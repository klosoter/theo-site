### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Alan J. Spence emerges from the late twentieth and early twenty-first century **Reformed** scene shaped by British evangelicalism, Scottish dogmatics, and a resurgent interest in **Reformed orthodoxy**. His intellectual context includes the postliberal turn, the rise of **analytic theology**, and a robust retrieval of early modern divines such as **John Owen**. Rather than pursue a purely historical exercise, Spence positions himself as a constructive theologian who reads the past for the church’s present, treating **tradition** as a canonically normed dialogue. The center of gravity in his method is a commitment to the **Chalcedonian** and Nicene faith as the church’s regula, and to **Scripture** as the *principium cognoscendi* of theology, the cognitive principle that mediates knowledge of the **triune God** who is the *principium essendi* or ontological principle. This dual principial structure sets up the twin poles of his oeuvre: **incarnation** as the redemptive and epistemic self-giving of the Son, and **inspiration** as the divinely given textual means by which the church knows and is conformed to Christ.

Spence’s method is an exercise in dogmatic coherence. He repeatedly invokes the classical claim that the truth of God exhibits **divine simplicity** and therefore yields an ordered unity among doctrines. This shapes his appropriation of **T. F. Torrance** on the rationality of the object and his wary reception of **Karl Barth** on the priority of revelation, while refusing any collapse of **Scripture** into mere witness apart from its **theopneustos** origin. Theologically, Spence is a ressourcement thinker who reads **Athanasius**, **Cyril of Alexandria**, and **Maximus the Confessor** alongside **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Owen**, retrieving technical tools like *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia*, **communicatio idiomatum**, and the **extra Calvinisticum** for contemporary **Christology**. His epistemic stance emphasizes the self-authenticating light of **autopistos** Scripture, the work of the Spirit in illumination, and the ecclesial setting of doctrine under **Word and sacrament**.

In conversation with contemporary constructive and analytic voices, Spence engages **Kevin Vanhoozer** on **speech-act** hermeneutics and the adequacy of **verbal plenary inspiration** for a thick account of canon, and he interacts with **Oliver Crisp** on analytic **Christology** and the logic of **two-natures** claims. He registers sympathy with **Barth** on the primacy of **revelation in Christ**, but he resists Barth’s actualist construal of Scripture as derivative event detached from textual **inerrancy** or robust **infallibility**. Against modern **kenoticism** and functionalist Christologies that evacuate the metaphysical heart of the tradition, he retrieves Chalcedon’s *unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, inseparable* grammar and insists on the Reformed accent of the **extra Calvinisticum** as a guardrail for **divine impassibility** and immutability rightly understood in light of the **incarnation**.

#### 2. Incarnation and Inspiration: John Owen and the Coherence of Christian Theology
Spence’s signature constructive move appears in **Incarnation and Inspiration: John Owen and the Coherence of Christian Theology** published in 2007. The thesis is simple and generative: **John Owen’s** system coheres because it is ordered by the mutually implicating poles of **incarnation** and **inspiration**. For Owen, the incarnate Son is the exhaustive revelation and mediator of God’s saving will, while the inspired Scriptures are the normative medium by which that saving will reaches, interprets, and reforms the church. Spence argues that this polarity generates a stable architecture across **Trinity**, **Christology**, **pneumatology**, **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **Scripture**. He reads Owen’s polemic against **Socinianism** as a sustained defense of the deity of Christ and the necessity of **penal substitution** within a covenantal frame, and he reads Owen’s treatises on the **Holy Spirit** and on the **divine authority of Scripture** as mutually illuminating accounts of how the Spirit unites believers to the incarnate Son by the inspired Word.

Crucial to Spence’s retrieval is Owen’s robust doctrine of **verbal plenary inspiration** and the self-authenticating authority of Scripture, which he treats under the old Protestant category of **autopistos**. Spence shows that this does not entail a bare rationalism, since the textual **inspiration** is communicated and efficacious only within the Spirit’s economy of illumination and **sanctification**. In this light, **covenant theology** becomes a grammar for reading the unity of the canon, with **incarnation** as the covenant’s telos and **inspiration** as the providential form of its deliverance. Spence’s Owen presents a thick **Christology** in which *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia* guard both the integrity of the human nature and the single person of the Son, a **communicatio idiomatum** that is personal rather than natural, and a Reformed insistence on the **extra Calvinisticum** to preserve the transcendent agency of the Logos in and beyond the assumed humanity.

#### 3. Christology: A Guide for the Perplexed
In **Christology: A Guide for the Perplexed** from 2008, Spence offers a didactic map of classical and modern **Christological** terrain. The guide does not simply rehearse patristic data; it exemplifies his commitment to the **Chalcedonian pattern** as a living rule for contemporary systematics. He gives careful attention to **Athanasius** on salvation as deification through the incarnate Word, **Cyril** on the unity of subject in the incarnate economy, the Definition of **Chalcedon** on the two natures in one person, and the later conciliar elaboration of **theandric** action without confusion of natures. Spence deploys technical tools like *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia* to explain how Christ’s human nature is without its own personal subsistence yet truly personalized in the eternal Son, and he treats the **communicatio idiomatum** as the personal predication that authorizes biblical speech like God suffered and the Lord of glory was crucified.

The constructive edges of the guide appear in his discussion of modern **kenoticism**, functionalist **Christologies**, and analytic proposals. Spence argues that any kenotic reduction of the Son’s attributes undermines **divine simplicity** and fails the **extra Calvinisticum** safeguard. He presses for a robust **impassibility** that is not stoic but christologically specified: the impassible God truly suffers in the flesh of the Son, with all the pathos proper to the assumed nature, while the divine nature remains impassible *simpliciter*. He resists collapsing Christ’s consciousness into a single human mind if this erases the Logos’s upholding agency, while acknowledging that a responsible account of Christ’s knowing must honor **Luke’s** witness of growth and **Hebrews** on learning obedience. Throughout, Spence exhibits a Reformed catholic instinct, using classical **Christology** to tether all doctrinal reasoning to the identity and work of the one mediator.

#### 4. Atonement, justification, and union
Within this **incarnation and inspiration** frame, Spence treats **atonement** and **justification** as corollaries of union with Christ articulated by **Owen** and the **Reformed** scholastics. In his reading of Owen’s The Death of Death in the Death of Christ and related treatises, Spence expounds **penal substitution** as a triune and covenantal act rather than a mechanical transaction. The Father purposes, the Son willingly undertakes, and the Spirit applies the one work of satisfaction, such that **definite atonement** is soteriologically integral to the actual efficacy of Christ’s priesthood. He construes **union with Christ** as the ontological and redemptive bond by which believers receive the double grace of **justification and sanctification**, thereby safeguarding the forensic character of **imputed righteousness** and the transformative character of Spirit-wrought renewal within a single economy.

Spence’s didactic work on **justification**, represented for many by his treatments in essays and by the popular-level **Guide for the Perplexed** volume often dated 2012, aims to clarify the relation of **faith alone** to obedience as fruit and evidence. He engages the **New Perspective on Paul** to affirm the covenantal context of justification while insisting that **imputation** is biblically warranted and confessionally central. In short, the grammar of **incarnation** supplies the personal ground of salvation in the mediator, while **inspiration** supplies the canonical judgment by which the church names justification, righteousness, and faith. The result is an atonement and justification doctrine that are exegetically accountable and systemically interlocked with **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **Scripture**.

#### 5. Scripture, canon, and hermeneutics
Spence’s second pole, **inspiration**, is not a mere appendix to **Christology**. It is the economy of the Spirit’s **theopneustos** action by which the church is conformed to Christ’s voice. Drawing from **Owen** On the Divine Original, Authority, Self-evidencing Light, and Power of the Scriptures, Spence argues that **autopistos** Scripture bears its own light and power as the Word of God written, and that this authority is recognized rather than conferred by the church. He construes inspiration as verbal, plenary, and organic, such that human authors speak truly as moved by the **Holy Spirit**. The correlative doctrine of **illumination** explains how the risen Christ addresses his people through the canon, with **infallibility** and **inerrancy** serving as properties of the text grounded in God’s truthfulness.

Hermeneutically, Spence is attentive to **speech-act** accounts of Scripture, engaging **Vanhoozer** to clarify how illocutions and perlocutions operate within canonical discourse. This places **exegesis** under the primacy of divine discourse while respecting the literary and historical forms of the text. He presses for ecclesial reading under the **rule of faith**, where dogmatic controls such as **Chalcedon** and **Trinity** govern the sense of Scripture without silencing its historical density. The coherence of the system appears here: **incarnation** grounds the personal identity who speaks in Scripture, and **inspiration** warrants the trust that the speaking God is encountered in and through the written Word.

#### 6. Pneumatology, ecclesiology, and sanctification
The **Word and Spirit** nexus animates Spence’s accounts of the church and Christian life. In Owen’s idiom, the Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and believers, such that **pneumatology** is inseparable from **Christology**. Spence develops this to argue that ecclesial ministries are extensions of the **Christological** economy through the Spirit’s **inspiration** of Scripture and illumination of hearers. **Preaching** is thus not a new revelation but a Spirit-enabled exposition of the inspired text that mediates the living voice of the incarnate Word. **Sacraments** are signs and seals within the covenant economy, bound to the Word, so that baptism and the Supper effect what they signify only as the Spirit unites recipients to the **incarnate** Christ by the **inspired** promise.

Sanctification, for Spence, assumes the Reformed double grace and leans on **Owen’s** treatise on the mortification of sin. The Spirit employs means of grace ordered by **Scripture**, forming Christ’s image in believers through the ordinary life of the church. Here the doctrine of **inspiration** is existentially important: the inspired canon catechizes desire, names sin and righteousness, and fixes the pattern of holiness in communion with the **triune God**. The coherence claim again holds: an inspired Scripture nurtures a sanctified people conformed to the incarnate Son, within the one **covenant** of grace administered in time.

#### 7. Systemic coherence and modern interlocutors
Spence’s constructive proposals are forged in sustained engagement with modern theology. With **Barth**, he affirms the primacy of **revelation in Christ** and the consequent reformation of human knowing, yet he resists making revelation strictly eventful at the expense of the **textual** stability guaranteed by **inspiration**. With **T. F. Torrance**, he retrieves **theological science** as an inquiry disciplined by the object’s rationality, though he maintains a more classically **confessional** account of canon and **infallibility**. With **analytic theologians** like **Oliver Crisp**, he seeks conceptual clarity on **two-natures** propositions, careful about metaphysical commitments that jeopardize **divine simplicity** or the **extra Calvinisticum**. With **Vanhoozer**, he triangulates between historical-critical exegesis and dogmatic reading through a robust view of divine **speech**.

Spence’s resistance to **kenoticism** and his retrieval of **impassibility** situate him within a broader catholic revival of classical theism. He insists that the **incarnation** does not entail divestment of divine attributes, but rather the personal assumption of a passible human nature by the impassible Son. He allows modern christological reflection to probe issues like Christ’s human knowing and will, but he refuses solutions that violate **Chalcedon** or the **Reformed** insistence on the Logos’s ongoing transcendence. His work is thus a case study in constructive **Reformed catholicity**, where **incarnation** and **inspiration** function as regulative lights guiding doctrinal development.

#### 8. Pedagogy and ecclesial posture
Spence writes not only for the guild but for the church, which shapes the tone of **Christology: A Guide for the Perplexed** and his didactic treatments of **justification** and **atonement**. His prose is catechetical without being simplistic, consistently subordinating speculative options to the constraints of **Scripture** and the ecumenical creeds. The church for Spence lives by the **canon**, and the classroom serves the pulpit. This may explain his persistent return to **John Owen** as a model of learning that is both scholastic and pastoral, integrating rigorous dogmatics with spiritual direction on **mortification**, **communion with God**, and the ministry of the **Word and sacrament**.

The ecclesial posture of his theology is marked by confidence in the sufficiency of **inspired** Scripture and the sufficiency of the **incarnate** Christ. He treats all doctrinal loci as Christologically and canonically conditioned, which lends his work a unitive pressure toward system. The coherence claim is not aesthetic but pastoral: a coherent theology catechizes a coherent people whose worship and mission are stable because ordered by the **triune** God as known in **Christ** through the **Word**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Spence’s project exhibits notable strengths. His elevation of **incarnation and inspiration** as coordinating poles faithfully preserves the **Word and Spirit** dialectic at the heart of the **Westminster Standards**, and his retrieval of **Owen** secures union with Christ, **penal substitution**, **imputation**, and a high doctrine of **Scripture**. His use of the **Chalcedonian pattern**, the **extra Calvinisticum**, and **autopistos** testimony aligns with confessional commitments to the sufficiency, clarity, and authority of the canon and to the uniqueness of the mediator. Doctrinal tensions arise where the coherence thesis might risk methodological overdetermination, potentially subordinating redemptive-historical development of **covenant** to a systematic center, or where conceptual refinements in **impassibility** and **two-natures** risk importing metaphysical assumptions beyond confessional warrant. A stricter Van Tilian accent on **revelation** as covenantal self-attestation could further guard epistemology from any residual foundationalism and secure **inerrancy** as a necessary entailment of divine speech. Likewise, a redemptive-historical calibration of **definite atonement** and **union with Christ** could foreground the exegesis of federal headship and the historia salutis in tandem with ordo salutis concerns. In sum, Spence’s integrated vision is deeply consonant with **Westminster** catholicity, and his emphasis on **incarnation and inspiration** provides a salutary map for contemporary dogmatics provided it stays tethered to the primacy of covenantal revelation, the unity of Scripture, and the whole counsel of God.
