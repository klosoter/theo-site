- Central categories: **connectional Presbyterianism**, **graded courts**, **parity of elders**, **regulative principle of worship**, **church discipline**, **spirituality of the church**, **Great Commission** focus, **good faith subscription**.
- Interlocutors and influences: **Westminster Assembly** polity, **James Bannerman** on the church, **Charles Hodge** on presbyterial order, **Thornwell and Dabney** on the **spirituality of the church**, **Morton H. Smith** and PCA founders; debates with **neo-Calvinist transformationalism**, **two-kingdoms** renewals, and **evangelical pragmatism**.
- Reformed reception: generally welcomed as a steadying, **confessional** administrator of **Presbyterian polity**; critiques from both stricter **jure divino** partisans and broader **Kuyperian** advocates; evaluative lens from **WTS** emphasizes Scripture’s sufficiency, **regulative worship**, and cautions against bureaucratic drift.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
L. Roy Taylor emerges as a contemporary **Reformed** churchman whose theological craft is ecclesial, juridical, and missionary. His career is inseparable from the consolidation of the **Presbyterian Church in America** after its 1973 founding and from the late modern pressures that tested **confessional Presbyterianism** in North America. Serving as **Stated Clerk** from 1998 to 2020, Taylor worked at the nerve center where **Westminster Standards**, the **Book of Church Order**, and the concrete problems of pastors, sessions, and presbyteries meet. His context was one of maturation beyond founding-era anxieties, the pursuit of catholic stability amid fragmentation, and the need to articulate what **connectional Presbyterianism** means under conditions of accelerating cultural change. The idiom of **Bannerman’s** The Church of Christ, **Hodge’s** Church Polity, and the **Westminster Assembly** debates on **jure divino** order provides the deeper grammar of his thought, while the day-to-day materials are the **Minutes of General Assembly**, presbytery records, and a steady application of the **regula fidei** as confessional standard.

Taylor’s method is administrative but not merely procedural. He treats polity as applied dogmatics. Scripture is sufficient and final, the **Westminster Confession and Catechisms** are normed norms under Scripture, and the **Book of Church Order** is a ministerial standard that gives flesh to **good and necessary consequence** for the life of the church. The recurring exegetical anchors are **Matthew 16** on the keys of the kingdom, **Matthew 18** on discipline, **Acts 15** on conciliar adjudication, **Ephesians 4** on ordered gifts, and **1 Timothy 3** and **Titus 1** on qualifications. He reads these texts through classic distinctions such as **jure divino** versus **jure humano**, the **potestas clavium** or power of the keys, and the collegial **actus presbyterii** of shared rule by elders. Taylor’s epistemic stance is restrained and cumulative. He privileges precedent, analogy, and the constraining grammar of constitutional texts, yet presses repeatedly that order is for mission. Thus the telos is the **Great Commission**, and the instrument is a disciplined **connectional Presbyterianism**.

#### 2. The office and the courts: elders, deacons, and graded conciliarity
Central to Taylor’s ecclesiology is **parity of elders** and the presbyterial logic of **graded courts**. Following **Westminster polity**, he presents the two ordinary, perpetual offices of **elder** and **deacon**, with the elder divided according to function as **teaching elder** and **ruling elder**, maintaining parity of authority as to governance. The courts are three: **Session**, **Presbytery**, and **General Assembly**, each possessing coordinate jurisdiction within powers committed to them. The doctrine behind this architecture is Trinitarian and covenantal. The Spirit gifts officers for public trust; covenant authority is exercised jointly and ministerially, not magisterially, and always under the Word. Taylor’s long stewardship of overtures and judicial references aimed to preserve this collegial structure against both congregational atomism and hierarchical clericalism. Thus the **session** keeps watch over worship and discipline, the **presbytery** guards doctrine and ordination, and the **General Assembly** expresses the church’s unity in truth and mission.

Taylor’s insistence on **connectionalism** is not merely structural. It is soteriologically toned. For him, **church discipline** is discipleship, not punitive management. Complaints and appeals exist to reclaim and reconcile. The **Book of Discipline** is the pastoral extension of the **regulative principle of worship**, namely that God must be worshiped and His church ordered only as He has commanded. The unity of truth and love requires a courtly culture marked by patience, transparent process, and respect for minority reports. Taylor’s reports frequently urged presbyteries to train clerks, to maintain records, and to guard the integrity of statistical reports, not as bureaucratic fastidiousness but as stewardship of the communion of saints before the face of God.

#### 3. Confessional integrity and subscription in practice
If polity is applied dogmatics, then confessionalism is its grammar. Taylor presided as **Stated Clerk** when the **PCA** refined its approach to **confessional subscription**, culminating in the 2002 adoption of **good faith subscription**. The conviction beneath this policy is the distinction between system subscription to the **Westminster Standards** and scruples regarding particular articles, vetted and delimited by the **presbytery**. Taylor’s posture was to maintain the **doctrinal integrity of the Standards** while acknowledging that churches are not seminaries and that mission requires visible unity within the system of doctrine. Under Taylor’s tenure, the Clerk’s office curated the formulation and dissemination of General Assembly actions that clarified this policy, strengthening the presbyteries’ responsibility to adjudicate stated differences and to protect the whole system of **Reformed orthodoxy**.

Confessional integrity extended beyond subscription to the curating of Assembly study reports. Taylor shepherded the **2007 Report on Federal Vision and New Perspective**, whose doctrinal conclusions rejected revisions to **justification by faith alone** and the **covenant of works** that would compromise **imputation** and the **perseverance of the saints**. He oversaw the flow of overtures and communication for the **2011 Insider Movement Report**, guarding **biblical revelation** and **Christological confession** in translation theory and frontier missions. He aided the Assembly’s reception of the **2019–2020 Ad Interim Report on Human Sexuality**, which articulated biblical norms on **sanctification**, **union with Christ**, and **identity** in relation to same-sex attraction. While not the author of these reports, Taylor’s theological role was to keep the process ordered, the terms clear, and the church’s **confessional witness** coherent.

#### 4. Worship, sacraments, and the regulative principle
Taylor’s ecclesiology is deliberately classical on **worship**. The **regulative principle of worship** stands as a pillar: elements are divinely instituted, circumstances are ordered by prudence according to the light of nature, and forms are to be consonant with edification. He insists that sessions guard Lord’s Day simplicity, **Word and sacrament** centrality, and reverent catholicity in hymnody and prayer. The **Directory for Worship** in the **BCO** is not a straightjacket but a pastoral tutor. Here Taylor reflects the old **Southern Presbyterian** accent found in **Thornwell** and **Dabney** as well as the broader **Westminster** tradition, contending that worship discipline is the seedbed of discipleship, and that every innovation must be tested by the rule of Scripture. The **sacraments** of **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are to be administered by lawfully ordained ministers, under sessional oversight, with fencing and admission practices tethered to credible profession. He underscores the continuity between **covenant** and **means of grace**, such that worship order serves the gospel’s delivery and the formation of holy people.

Taylor’s stance on worship helps explain his counsel in debates over contextualization. He endorsed flexibility in circumstances, such as language, service times, and architectural choices, but resisted instrumentalization of worship for seeker strategies. The choir of his claims reaches a simple stanza: **lex orandi lex credendi**. Prayers, preaching, and psalmody shape the doctrinal imagination, and the **session** bears responsibility to maintain orthodox cadences that catechize in the **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **redemption**.

#### 5. Discipline, due process, and the restoration of sinners
Taylor’s most repeated doctrinal refrain is that **discipline** is restorative. The **Book of Discipline** locates admonition, suspension, excommunication, and public restoration along a gospel arc grounded in **Matthew 18** and **Galatians 6**. Taylor’s annual reports regularly urged consistent application of process: careful records, notice to accused, right of counsel, and fidelity to the **rules of evidence**. Appeals and complaints are gifts that protect both the accused and the courts from precipitous or partial rulings. The theology here is not proceduralism. It is a confidence that the **keys of the kingdom** operate through due process, that **good and necessary consequence** yields prudential rules that embody justice and mercy, and that the church’s purity is inseparable from the holiness and hope of its members.

In controversies such as the **Federal Vision**, Taylor framed discipline as doctrinal catechesis. Where presbyteries needed guidance, he pointed to Assembly deliverances that defined confessional boundaries on **justification**, **sacramental efficacy**, and **covenantal objectivity**. In pastoral scandals, he would remind courts that the end of discipline is not public relations but repentant restoration or truthful separation, for the sake of Christ’s name and the flock’s care.

#### 6. Mission, diaconal ministry, and the spirituality of the church
Taylor is often read through the lens of the **spirituality of the church**, an inheritance of **Southern Presbyterianism**. He neither collapses that doctrine into quietism nor abandons it. Rather, he locates the church’s institutional mission in **Word, sacrament, and discipline**, summarily the **Great Commission**, while affirming a generous diaconal mercy and the scattered witness of Christians in all of life. He presumes a classic two-kingdom distinction in function, not in authority, such that the keys govern the churchly commonwealth while civil authority is ordained for temporal justice. Yet his emphasis remains positive: the church as church exists to make disciples, plant and govern congregations, and train officers. The **deaconate**, in his hands, is not a board of utilities but a school of compassion, extending ordered mercy that refuses both ecclesial politicization and pietistic retreat.

On culture, Taylor is an Augustinian realist. He encourages presbyteries and sessions to speak where **Scripture** speaks with moral clarity, such as on life, marriage, and justice, while warning against formal pronouncements that exceed the church’s competence. The anchor is **confessional clarity** coupled with pastoral prudence. Mission strategy flows from this center: plant churches that preach **Christ crucified**, catechize with the **Westminster Shorter Catechism**, worship according to the **regulative principle**, and cultivate leaders trained for **presbyterial** responsibility.

#### 7. Catholicity, cooperation, and the stewardship of unity
A hallmark of Taylor’s tenure is an irenic but firm pursuit of **catholicity**. He values fraternal relations with other **Reformed** bodies, attentive to the differences over **subscription**, polity, and worship that mark the **NAPARC** family. His reports often encouraged participation in cooperative ministries that fit the **PCA** constitution, while declining entanglements that would compromise confessional integrity. The theology beneath this posture is the distinction between the visible church’s unity in truth and the prudence of institutional cooperation. He articulates a doctrine of unity that is principled, conciliar, and tied to the **means of grace**, rather than thinly ecumenical or programmatically driven.

The long arc from 1998 to 2020 saw repeated stresses on unity. The **2007 Federal Vision** season strained trust; the **2010 Strategic Plan** provoked vigorous debate over identity and growth; the **2019–2020 Human Sexuality** materials required exactness and charity. Taylor’s contribution was to furnish the church with transparent process, public documentation, and steady exhortation to pursue the peace of the church through the constitutional means of **overtures**, study committees, and judicial procedures. His ecclesial theology is a theology of patience under the Word.

#### 8. Case-law theology: precedent, analogy, and the limits of codification
Taylor’s distinctive contribution as a theologian is his development of what might be called a **case-law** hermeneutic of ecclesial life. Like the **Westminster** appeal to **good and necessary consequence**, he views the **BCO** not as exhaustive legislation but as principled guidance requiring analogical application. When new issues arose, such as polity questions in multi-site churches, digital communication in judicial process, or the definition of terms in reports on **identity** and **sanctification**, Taylor’s counsel was to find the most proximate constitutional analog, to respect the **intent** of prior Assembly actions, and to keep the trajectory toward the church’s mission. The **jus divinum** elements remain irreformable, while humanly devised rules are mutable within the confessional system.

He knows the limits. Codification cannot outrun spiritual maturity. Courts require elders trained in the **Standards**, disciplined in prayer, and courageous in judgment. The plea that recurs through his writing is simple: build presbyteries that can shepherd their ministers, sessions that can catechize their people, and assemblies that can speak with a recognizable **Reformed** voice. The administrative theology of Taylor is an ascetical practice, forming habits of order that sustain the church’s **peace and purity**.

#### 9. Controversy management as pastoral theology
Taylor’s years as **Stated Clerk** were marked by controversy, and his manner of managing conflict discloses his pastoral theology. In the **Federal Vision** debates, he championed clarity on **justification**, the imputation of **Christ’s righteousness**, and the covenantal structure of **law and gospel**, while urging charity in rhetoric and due process in discipline. In engagements with the **Insider Movement**, he pressed for **Christological** precision in translation and for protection of indigenous churches from syncretism. In the growing debates around **Revoice** and sexuality, he provided the frame in which the church articulated a theological anthropology grounded in **creation**, **fall**, **redemption**, and **glorification**, guarding the difference between temptation and identity and the necessity of sanctification.

Through each, Taylor displayed a confidence that the church’s tools are sufficient. The **Westminster Standards** remain doctrinally adequate; the **BCO** provides ordered pathways for action; the **courts** possess Christ-given authority to teach, to correct, and to comfort. His is not the heroism of solitary intellect but of a craftsman who believes that the **Presbyterian** way, properly applied, is a means of grace.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Taylor’s theology of order-in-service-of-mission is a major contemporary achievement. Strengths abound. He stabilizes **confessionalism** through principled **good faith subscription**, he keeps **regulative worship** central as the heartbeat of discipleship, he frames **discipline** as restorative, and he weds **connectional Presbyterianism** to the **Great Commission** without triumphalism. His use of **good and necessary consequence**, conciliar **Acts 15** patterns, and the **potestas clavium** exemplifies classic **Reformed orthodoxy** translated into late modern administrative practice. Yet tensions appear. Some will judge his accent on the **spirituality of the church** too cautious in public theology, preferring a stronger **Kuyperian** account of cultural discipleship, while others will think his openness to prudential flexibility in **good faith subscription** introduces centrifugal drift. A WTS-oriented critique would suggest that his case-law method must be continually re-grounded in **biblical theology** that flows from the **covenant** and **kingdom** structure of Scripture, lest the **BCO** harden into proceduralism; that **Van Tilian** insights on antithesis and presupposition could sharpen the church’s cultural witness beyond minimal pronouncement; and that the pastoral telos of worship and catechesis must animate every judicial and administrative act to avoid bureaucratic capture. The alternative is not disorder but a deeper doxological ordering in which **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **Christ’s kingship over the church**, and the **mission of discipling the nations** govern every rule, every report, and every courtly act.
