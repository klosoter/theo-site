### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context
Joel B. Green stands at the crossroads of **evangelical exegesis**, **Wesleyan-Holiness spirituality**, and the contemporary movement for **theological interpretation of Scripture**. Educated within the Wesleyan stream and trained in **British New Testament scholarship** under **I. Howard Marshall** at **the University of Aberdeen**, his scholarship began in the late 1980s and matured across the 1990s and 2000s as questions of **hermeneutics**, **narrative**, and **ecclesial reception** pressed on the discipline. Green’s ecclesial home in the **Church of the Nazarene** and his academic appointments at **Asbury Theological Seminary** and later **Fuller Theological Seminary** situated him simultaneously among **evangelical biblical scholars** and **ecclesial practitioners** committed to **mission** and **holiness**. This location, both confessional and critical, is decisive for his enduring emphasis on **Scripture’s formative authority**, **salvation as communal transformation**, and **human embodiment** under the promise of **resurrection**.

Green’s historical moment saw the cresting of **historical criticism** and the emergence of **narrative-, rhetorical-, and social-scientific criticism**, alongside a postcritical turn to **canonical and theological interpretation** associated with figures like **Kevin J. Vanhoozer**, **Stephen Fowl**, and **Francis Watson**. Within this ferment he argued that **exegesis** is accountable to the **Rule of Faith** and the **church’s worship**, and must aim at a *telos* in **virtue** and **mission**. His hermeneutical project is inseparable from a robustly **ecclesial epistemology**, wary of reductive historicism yet hospitable to disciplined **historical and linguistic analysis**, and open to **neuroscience** and the **human sciences** where they illumine **biblical anthropology** without displacing **Scripture’s primacy**.

#### 2. Luke-Acts and the theological reading of Scripture
Green’s first major contributions emerged in **Lukan studies**, especially **The Theology of the Gospel of Luke**, 1995, and the **NICNT** commentary, **The Gospel of Luke**, 1997. Following **I. Howard Marshall** yet developing a distinct voice, Green reads Luke’s narrative as a comprehensive **soteriological drama** of **divine visitation**, **Jubilee reversal**, **forgiveness of sins**, and **spirit-empowered formation** of a renewed **people of God**. Salvation is not merely juridical but **holistic**, involving **healing**, **exorcism**, **reconciliation**, and **table fellowship**, all gathered into the **cross and resurrection** as the decisive manifestation of **God’s saving reign**. His attention to **social identity**, **honor-shame dynamics**, and **economic marginalization** reflects the influence of **social-scientific criticism**, yet his reading remains theologically thick, opposed to any reduction of **Luke-Acts** to sociological reportage apart from the **triune God’s agency**.

In Luke’s passion theology Green accents the righteous suffering of the **innocent one**, the **servant** whose death effects **release** and **forgiveness**, and whose resurrection inaugurates **eschatological hope**. While not denying **substitution**, he resists framing Luke with a singular **penal substitutionary** lens. Instead he maps **atonement motifs** as they arise from the **narrative logic**: **victory over the powers**, **vicarious representation**, **new exodus deliverance**, and **covenant renewal**. His **theology of Luke** thus becomes a paradigmatic instance of his larger method of **theological interpretation**, where **exegesis** and **doctrine** mutually inform within the church’s worship and mission.

Green’s broader hermeneutical works consolidate this approach. **Seized by Truth: Reading the Bible as Scripture**, 2007, argues that **Scripture** confronts readers within the **economy of grace** to reorder their **practices** and **affections**. **Practicing Theological Interpretation**, 2011, clarifies the tasks of **canonical exegesis**, advocating **interpretive virtues** and an ecclesial posture shaped by **the Rule of Faith** and the **creeds**. Editorial leadership in volumes such as **Hearing the New Testament**, 1995 and 2010, the **Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels**, 1992 and 2013, and the **Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics**, 2011, positioned him as a networker of the **theological interpretation** movement, making accessible a way of reading that is at once **historically responsible**, **canonically sensitive**, and **pastorally oriented**.

#### 3. Embodied anthropology and the human sciences
A central and controversial thread in Green’s corpus is his **Christian anthropology** forged in conversation with **neuroscience** and **philosophy of mind**. Through the co-edited volume **Whatever Happened to the Soul**, 1998, with **Warren Brown** and **Nancey Murphy**, and especially **Body, Soul, and Human Life**, 2008, Green commends **nonreductive physicalism**. This stance rejects **substance dualism** while opposing **reductionism**, affirming that human persons are wholly **embodied** and that their mental and spiritual capacities supervene on, but are not reducible to, their **biological constitution**. He argues that Scripture describes persons in **holistic terms** rather than in **Greek-inspired dualisms**, and that **resurrection** rather than **immortality of the soul** is the Christian hope. He engages critics such as **J. P. Moreland** and **John W. Cooper**, who defend dualist or holistic-dualist models, contending that the **biblical narrative**, Israel’s **creational monotheism**, and the **incarnation** of the **Son** commend an **embodied** account.

Green’s proposal marks an epistemic humility regarding **scientific findings** and an exegetical reassessment of texts like **Genesis 2**, **Ecclesiastes**, **Pauline soma language**, and **Luke-Acts**. He reads **psyche**, **spirit**, and **flesh** as functional descriptors within relational and covenantal frames rather than ontological partitions. The **intermediate state** is treated modestly, tethering personal continuity to **God’s covenant memory** and the promised **resurrection**. The normative horizon is the **new creation** in **Christ**, which underwrites both the **dignity** and the **vulnerability** of human embodiment. This anthropology feeds directly into his **ethical vision**, where **holiness** is practiced in bodily habits, communal disciplines, and **Spirit-shaped** dispositions, not suspended in a disembodied interiority.

#### 4. The cross, salvation, and plurality of atonement
Green’s soteriological vision is concentrated in **Recovering the Scandal of the Cross**, 2000 and revised 2011, with **Mark D. Baker**. Here he argues that no single **atonement theory** exhausts the **New Testament** witness, and that the **cross** must be interpreted within the **missional** and **ecclesial** contexts where Scripture was first heard. He criticizes distortions associated with an exclusive **penal substitution** frame, including a narrowed **individualism**, a thin account of **sanctification**, and an image of **divine justice** detached from **covenant mercy** and **new-creation** ends. Yet he affirms **judgment**, **sin’s gravity**, and **vicarious suffering**, proposing a **multi-faceted atonement** in which **substitution**, **victory**, and **moral transformation** coinhere. Echoing **Gustaf Aulen’s Christus Victor** while reframing it within **biblical narrative**, Green urges churches to deploy atonement imagery pastorally with sensitivity to **cultural idols**, **systemic evil**, and the call to **cruciform discipleship**.

In Luke-Acts this soteriology takes concrete form as **release to captives**, **forgiveness**, **table inclusion**, and **Spirit-empowered witness**. The cross is God’s **kingdom enthronement** of the rejected Messiah, whose **resurrection** vindicates the divine verdict and inaugurates **eschatological life**. The **ecclesial body** is thus an eschatological theater of **reconciliation** and **holiness**, a people whose practices of **hospitality**, **economic sharing**, and **public witness** embody the **gospel**. Green’s work consistently binds **atonement** to **discipleship**, so that **doctrine** yields **habitus** and **mission**, a hallmark of his **Wesleyan-Holiness** heritage.

#### 5. Conversion, virtue, and ecclesial formation
Green’s **Conversion in Luke-Acts**, 2015, synthesizes his emphases on **divine agency**, **human cognition**, and **communal identity**. Against purely voluntarist or purely determinist accounts, he describes conversion as **re-narration** into the **people of God**, a Spirit-elicited transformation of **perception**, **allegiance**, and **practices** that is embodied and storied. The paradigm cases of **Paul**, **Cornelius**, **Lydia**, and the **Philippian jailer** are read within Luke’s broader picture of **God’s initiative**, **Scripture’s fulfillment**, and the **church’s hospitality**, showing how **baptism**, **catechesis**, and **table fellowship** consolidate a new **moral psychology**. This concern for **virtue formation** appears also in Green’s **1 Peter** work and in the **Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics**, 2011, where he develops Scripture-guided norms for **holiness**, **endurance under suffering**, and **public engagement**. The result is a coherent vision of **ecclesial ethics** in which **exegesis**, **anthropology**, and **soteriology** converge in the practices of a people under the **lordship of Christ**.

#### 6. Pedagogy, editorial work, and institutional leadership
Green’s vocation includes substantial **pedagogical** and **editorial** labors aimed at transmitting **theological interpretation** to pastors and students. As co-author of **Introducing the New Testament**, 2001 and 2010, with **Paul J. Achtemeier** and **Marianne Meye Thompson**, he models an introduction that is at once **historically informed**, **literarily attuned**, and **theologically constructive**. As general or co-editor of reference works like the **Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels** and **Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics**, he curates a guild-wide conversation across **biblical theology**, **ethics**, and **ecclesial practice**. His leadership at **Fuller Theological Seminary**, including terms as **dean** and in senior academic roles in the 2010s, reflects a vision of a seminary ecosystem where **scriptural scholarship**, **pastoral formation**, and **mission** coincide.

This editorial and institutional work also advances a distinctive **methodological catholicity** among evangelicals. Green draws together **historical exegesis**, **canonical reading**, **patristic ressourcement**, and carefully appropriated **human sciences**. The constant is his appeal to **Scripture as Scripture**, that is, **divine discourse** addressed to the church, heard under the **Rule of Faith**, and aimed at **sanctification**. He refuses both **foundationalist biblicism** that reduces Scripture to data and **anti-realist skepticism** that dissolves Scripture into communities of interest. His via media is a chastened **critical realism**, in which the **triune God** uses a canonically shaped **narrative** to summon a people and to reconfigure their **imaginations** and **bodies** for **holiness** and **mission**.

#### 7. Methodological coherence and tensions
The coherence of Green’s project lies in the interweaving of **narrative soteriology**, **embodied anthropology**, and **ecclesial hermeneutics**. Salvation in **Luke-Acts** becomes the anchor for a wider **biblical theology** that expects **Scripture** to do formative work in the church. His **nonreductive physicalism** gives anthropological traction to his claims about **virtue**, **practices**, and **bodily holiness**, while his **atonement pluralism** frees pastoral theology to speak richly of the **cross**. His attention to **social identity**, **economics**, and **power** aligns with his reading of **Luke’s reversal** and the church’s **public witness**. The center holds because **Scripture** is the guiding norm and **ecclesial formation** the constant end.

Tension emerges where **anthropology**, **atonement**, and **method** intersect contested dogmatic loci. Green’s **ecclesial hermeneutics** must continually police the boundary where **human sciences** serve, but do not norm, **theological claims**. His **plural account of atonement** must avoid dispersion into an ad hoc eclecticism. His narrative accounts of **conversion** must secure the asymmetry of **grace** as the decisive cause while affirming **human response**. These tensions are not incidental but belong to the complex task he has undertaken, in which **biblical theology** is intentionally porous to **formation**, **mission**, and **science** without surrendering **revelation**.

#### 8. Legacy and ongoing influence
By the mid 2010s Green had become a recognized architect of **theological interpretation** within **evangelicalism**, with durable impacts in **Lukan studies**, **Christian anthropology**, and **pastoral hermeneutics**. His **NICNT Luke** continues to guide exegesis that refuses a split between **history** and **theology**. **Body, Soul, and Human Life** remains a touchstone in debates over **physicalism**, **dualism**, and **resurrection**. **Recovering the Scandal of the Cross** contributes to a now widespread evangelical reengagement with **atonement plurality** and the integration of **discipleship** into **soteriology**. His handbooks and dictionaries continue to tutor readers in the craft of **canonical exegesis** for **churchly ends**, extending his influence beyond his own discrete publications.

Green’s legacy is also pedagogical and institutional. Generations of students at **Asbury** and **Fuller** have absorbed a model of the **scholar-pastor**, one for whom **exegesis** is worshipful, **doctrine** is practical, and **mission** is the Church’s posture in the world. As an interpreter of **Luke-Acts** he has secured a place alongside **I. Howard Marshall** and **N. T. Wright** in shaping how evangelicals construe **salvation history**, **the Kingdom**, and the **people of God**. As a theological interpreter he has catalyzed a habitus in which **Scripture**, read with the **fathers** and in the **assembly**, trains bodies and communities toward **holiness** and **hope**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Green’s work invites both gratitude and critique. Positively, his **canonical realism** honors **Scripture as principium**, his **resurrectional anthropology** keeps Christian hope tethered to **new creation**, and his **ecclesial hermeneutic** resists privatized biblicism by recovering **Rule of Faith** sensibilities. His **Lukan soteriology** rightly highlights the breadth of **redemption**, the reality of **spiritual powers**, and the ethical entailments of **union with Christ** in **holiness**. Yet concerns surface at key loci. First, his **nonreductive physicalism** risks attenuating classical commitments to the **imago Dei** in its structural and relational dimensions and sits uneasily with confessional affirmations of a conscious **intermediate state**, where traditional **holistic dualism** has served to safeguard personal identity between death and **resurrection**. Second, his **atonement pluralism** can obscure the dogmatic centrality of **penal substitution** as the juridical heart of reconciliation within **covenant** and **federal headship**, even as other motifs like **Christus Victor** and **moral transformation** remain necessary entailments. Third, his account of **conversion** and **sanctification**, shaped by **Wesleyan-Holiness** emphases, may tilt toward **synergism**, whereas a **Reformed** grammar insists on **monergistic regeneration** and the primacy of **effectual calling** grounding responsive obedience. Methodologically, his appeal to **neuroscience** enriches pastoral wisdom but must remain ministerial to **special revelation**, lest **nature** overdetermine **grace**. A classical **Reformed alternative** would retain Green’s **ecclesial and narrative gains** while articulating a **holistic dualist** anthropology, centering **penal substitution** within a multi-aspect **atonement**, and ordering **conversion** to the unilateral efficacy of **sovereign grace**, thereby preserving the Reformation’s **law-gospel**, **covenant**, and **justification** accents alongside the integrative missional vision Green rightly champions.
