### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
David F. Wright, 1937 to 2008, belongs to the generation of evangelical scholars who re-entered the mainstream of historical theology with rigorous craft and confessional clarity, situating **patristic studies** within a Reformed agenda for ecclesial renewal. Trained and then long established at **New College, University of Edinburgh**, Wright combined the historical sensibilities of Scottish ecclesiastical scholarship with a broader anglophone commitment to **biblical authority** and **doctrinal retrieval**. His formation was marked by the collapse of Christendom in Western Europe and a simultaneous evangelical revival of **ressourcement**, a return to the fathers in order to reform the present. Methodologically he exemplified an **ad fontes** program, reading **Greek and Latin sources** closely, resisting totalizing grand narratives, and insisting that tradition be sifted by **Scripture** as the norma normans. Where others in the late twentieth century borrowed from **Barthian dialectic** or **Yale postliberalism**, Wright’s posture was a historically careful, confessionally explicit attempt to reconnect **evangelical Reformed theology** with the pre-Reformation church through disciplined attention to primary evidence.

The Edinburgh context mattered for Wright’s method, since Scottish scholarship on **John Knox**, **the Covenanters**, and **Scottish ecclesiology** kept questions of **church polity**, **discipline**, and **sacramental practice** near the surface. Wright’s editorial leadership and collaboration with **J. I. Packer** and **Sinclair B. Ferguson** made his methodological priorities public, particularly in the **New Dictionary of Theology** 1988, a project that anchored evangelical systematics and historical theology together. His approach to **epistemology** was not speculative, but historical and textual, exploiting the tools of **critical history** while rejecting a neutralist historicism. He read **Tertullian**, **Origen**, and **Augustine** as witnesses rather than arbiters, and he asked how their reception of **Scripture** might sharpen or correct late modern Protestant habits concerning **sacrament** and **church**.

Wright’s scholarly signature was a triad, **sources, soteriology, society**. He believed the **patristic catechumenate** disclosed a grammar of salvation that bound **doctrine**, **liturgy**, and **discipline** together, and he also believed that the social formation called **Christendom** had profoundly reshaped that grammar. Theologically, he moved within the lines of **Augustinian grace** and **Reformed soteriology**, but he refused to baptize later Protestant practice uncritically. The controlling conviction was that **Scripture**, read with the best patristic companions, could recalibrate **ecclesial identity**, particularly through reform of **baptismal practice** and **church membership**. This commitment to reform through history framed his major works and collected essays.

#### 2. Publications and editorial labors as program
Wright’s editorial achievements functioned as a public platform for his **Ressourcement-Reformed** project. With **J. I. Packer** and **Sinclair B. Ferguson** he co-edited the **New Dictionary of Theology** 1988, which offered evangelical students concise entries on **doctrines**, **figures**, and **movements**, embedding **patristic and medieval** topics in the everyday vocabulary of pastors and scholars. He later co-edited the **Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology** 1993, a reference work that put **Scottish Reformed identity**, **Presbyterian polity**, and **sacramental discipline** into sustained conversation with **patristic antecedents** and European contexts. These reference volumes were not merely academic handbooks but catechetical instruments, placing **Augustine**, **Cyprian**, and **Athanasius** alongside **Calvin**, **Knox**, and **the Westminster divines** in a single exegetical and doctrinal horizon.

The core of Wright’s own argument emerged with increasing clarity in the monograph **What Has Infant Baptism Done to Baptism?** 2005, followed by the collected essays **Infant Baptism in Historical Perspective** 2007. Here he marshaled close readings of **Tertullian**, **Origen**, **Cyprian**, and **Augustine** to interrogate the development of **paedobaptism** and its ecclesial consequences. His thesis was not an iconoclastic repudiation of infant baptism, though he was candid about its ambiguous origins. Rather, Wright argued that the rise and normalization of **infant baptism** under the conditions of **Christendom** had reconfigured **baptism** from a climactic act of *catechumenus* to *fidelis*, to a social rite of incorporation that displaced **catechesis**, obscured **conversion**, and detached **discipline** from **sacrament**. He insisted that a Reformed church committed to **covenant theology** must retrieve the **catechumenate**, renew **profession of faith** at **communion**, and restore **church discipline**, thereby resacramentalizing baptism as a **means of grace** tied to **Word** and **faith**.

These publications displayed Wright’s characteristic argumentative shape, historical reconstruction leading to ecclesial proposal. His reading of **Origen’s** appeal to *traditio apostolica* pressed the question of what counts as **apostolicity**, a theme he pursued by carefully weighing **Cyprian’s** conciliar decisions on the baptism of infants and the timing of baptism in relation to **original sin** and **Eucharistic participation**. His pages on **Augustine** explored the shift that occurred when **baptismal regeneration**, as Augustine read **John 3** and **Romans 5**, became tethered to the universal reach of **original sin**, thereby pushing baptism earlier and earlier in life. Wright conceded Augustine’s pastoral logic, yet he asked whether Augustine’s exegetical inferences and the Christendom frame unduly closed off other trajectories present in **Tertullian’s** cautions and the **catechumenal** ethos of earlier communities.

#### 3. Patristic retrieval and baptismal theology
The power of Wright’s contribution lies in his disciplined return to the **catechumenate** as an interpretive key. He expounded the catechumenal process, catechesis in **Scripture**, renunciations, and pre-baptismal **scrutinies**, as the school of conversion and the matrix for understanding **baptism** as both **sacramentum** and **mysterion**. The language of *sacramentum*, a visible oath of allegiance, and *mysterion*, a divine secret disclosed in Christ, offered Wright a double register, ecclesial commitment and divine action. He argued that when **infant baptism** becomes the default mode of initiation, the thick fabric of **catechesis** must be relocated, publicly owned and ritually articulated, lest **baptism** lose its enacted confession of **repentance** and **faith**.

In engagement with **Everett Ferguson’s** vast mapping of early baptismal practice and with **Paul Bradshaw’s** critical work on the **Apostolic Tradition**, Wright adopted a cautious stance toward reconstructing a single uniform pattern. He emphasized regional diversity, fluidity of rites, and the primacy of **Scripture** as the ultimate measure of **tradition**. He treated **Tertullian’s** De baptismo as a witness to debated practice, not a solitary outlier, and he explored **Origen’s** testimony concerning **infant baptism** as a claim about apostolic custom that does not eliminate the need for biblical warrant. The upshot was a hermeneutic of charity and critique, honoring **patristic evidence** while resisting appeals to early precedent as if they were self-authenticating.

Central to Wright’s theology was the Reformed insistence on **Word and sacrament**, **faith and promise**, and **covenant**. He stressed that the **covenant of grace** establishes corporate responsibilities that can underwrite **infant baptism**, yet he refused any **ex opere operato** construal. In Reformed idiom, **baptism** seals the promise and calls forth **faith** by the Spirit, but does not mechanically confer **regeneration** apart from **Word** and **union with Christ**. Wright therefore pressed churches to recover robust **public profession**, credible **catechesis**, and consistent **discipline**, so that the **ordo salutis** would be displayed sacramentally without collapsing **sign** into **thing signified**. Where **Augustine** or later **medieval** practice risked a sacramental automaticity, Wright sought a Reformed rebalancing in which **baptism**, **preaching**, and **table** together tutor the church in **grace**.

#### 4. Augustine, original sin, and ecclesial politics
Wright’s sustained dialogue with **Augustine** yielded a nuanced account of how doctrine, exegesis, and ecclesial politics intersect. He read **Augustine’s anti-Pelagian** corpus as a defense of **grace**, but also as a driver for the early normalization of **infant baptism** in North Africa, since the urgency of **original sin** and the fear of dying unbaptized pulled initiation earlier. He analyzed **Augustine’s** use of **Romans 5** and **John 3** to anchor the necessity of baptism while still distinguishing between the **visible church** and the **elect**. Wright argued that this strategy, effective against **Pelagian moralism**, had unintended consequences, because when embedded in **imperial Christendom**, it generated a cradle church in which **catechesis** lagged and **discipline** softened.

This diagnosis extended to **Cyprian** and the North African councils, whose pastoral decisions, especially on the timing of baptism and readmission of the lapsed, forged a link between **sacramental rigor** and ecclesial identity that would deeply influence the Latin West. Wright probed how **Donatist** controversy further complicated the relation of **sacrament** to **church unity**, clarifying the non-repeatability of **baptism** yet elevating institutional stability over catechetical depth. Drawing on the Reformed distinction between the **visible and invisible church**, he proposed that patristic pastoral instincts should be harvested without importing the coercive framework of **Christendom**. In this way Wright positioned **Augustine** both as a theological ally in **grace** and as a cautionary case in sacramental policy.

#### 5. Scottish retrieval and evangelical pedagogy
As co-editor of the **Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology** 1993, Wright demonstrated how a Reformed national tradition might be re-narrated through **patristic** and **medieval** continuities. He highlighted the role of **discipline**, **public profession**, and **catechisms** in **Scottish Presbyterianism**, reading these as modern heirs of the **catechumenate**. His evangelical pedagogy pushed for seminarians and ministers to teach **baptism** not as an isolated rite but as a node in a web of **doctrine**, **worship**, and **discipline**. Hence his editorial work with **J. I. Packer** and **Sinclair B. Ferguson** served a catechetical project, reintegrating historical theology with **systematics** so that the church’s memory could guide pastoral choices about **initiation** and **membership**.

Wright’s classroom and editorial labors trained readers to inhabit the **communion of saints**. He insisted that one cannot responsibly argue for or against **infant baptism** without reading **Origen**, **Cyprian**, and **Augustine** alongside **Calvin**, **Bucer**, and the **Westminster divines**. He urged evangelical theologians to recover the grammar of **participation in Christ**, **union with Christ**, and **means of grace**, lest either a pragmatic nominalism or a bare biblicism flatten the sacramental texture of the Christian life. This pedagogy produced a generation of students capable of exegeting **ancient sources** and applying them to current debates about **baptism**, **confirmation**, **profession of faith**, and **communion**.

#### 6. Christendom, modernity, and the end of an era
The provocative subtitle of **What Has Infant Baptism Done to Baptism?**, an enquiry at the end of **Christendom**, signaled Wright’s broader historical judgment. He read the decline of established church patterns in Europe as an opportunity to renounce the social automaticity that had long attached to **baptism**. Without the civic expectation that every child be brought to font, churches could reconstruct **catechetical** pathways and restore **discipline** without pastoral panic. Wright did not propose abolition, but reconfiguration. He recommended clear distinctions between **baptism**, **profession of faith**, and **admission to the Lord’s Table**, each tethered to **Word**, **faith**, and **covenant obligations**. In some settings this meant delaying **communion** until catechesis produced credible confession, in others it meant emphasizing parental vows and congregational responsibility so that **infant baptism** regained its evangelical context.

Wright also confronted Protestant amnesia about the complex **liturgical scripts** that surrounded **baptism** in the early church. He mined sources on **exorcisms**, **anointings**, and **baptismal confession** not to reimport them wholesale, but to retrieve their doctrinal logic. The renunciations before baptism, for example, dramatized **conversion**, the transition from *saeculum* to **ekklesia**, while the confession depicted union with the crucified and risen **Christ**. For Wright, modern churches could translate these patterns into Reformed worship by means of transparent **vows**, repeated **creedal confession**, and pastoral **discipline**. The aim was a thickened **ecclesial identity** sustained by **Word and sacrament**, not a nostalgic return to antique ritualism.

#### 7. Interlocutors ancient and modern
Wright’s interlocutors were both ancient and contemporary. In the ancient sphere he handled **Tertullian’s** ambivalence about baptizing children, **Origen’s** sweeping claim of apostolic custom, **Cyprian’s** conciliar scenarios, and **Augustine’s** dogmatic consolidation in the fight against **Pelagius**. In the modern sphere he anchored discussions alongside **Everett Ferguson’s** documentary history, engaged the liturgical-historical critiques of **Paul Bradshaw**, and drew on evangelical systematics represented by **Packer** and **Ferguson** to keep **doctrine**, **exegesis**, and **worship** aligned. He also positioned his work opposite **Karl Barth’s** 1943 rejection of **infant baptism**, acknowledging Barth’s protest against magical sacramentalism while querying his detachment from **covenant** and **ecclesiology**.

Wright’s strategy was not to adjudicate by authority of eminent names but to test claims in the light of **Scripture** and to trace their ecclesial consequences. He maintained that **traditio** is normed by **Scripture** and that **apostolicity** is constituted by fidelity to the apostolic **gospel**, not mere antiquity. He therefore refused both a naive primitivism and an uncritical confessionalism. By showing how **infant baptism** arose and functioned under particular historical pressures, he urged Reformed churches to own their doctrine of **covenant** and **means of grace** while retooling practice to display the evangelical heart of **repentance** and **faith**.

#### 8. Doctrinal integration and pastoral proposals
The doctrinal grammar that pervades Wright’s work can be summarized as a Reformed synthesis of **Scripture-priority**, **covenantal ecclesiology**, and **sacramental realism**, without **sacramentalism**. The **sign-thing** relation is determinative. **Baptism** signs and seals union with **Christ**, regeneration and remission of sins, and incorporation into the **church**, yet it does so in a way that calls for **faith**, be it the personal faith of the baptized or the covenantal obligations of the congregation. Wright recommended a set of pastoral proposals consonant with **Reformed orthodoxy**. Restore a robust **catechumenate** for all, including baptized children. Require clear **public profession** before **communion**. Practice consistent **discipline** so that **baptismal vows** are not nullities. Teach **Augustine’s** grace while correcting any drift toward **ex opere operato** assumptions. Emphasize the triadic nexus of **Word**, **sacrament**, and **discipline**, the classic **Reformed marks** of the church.

Wright linked these proposals to a missional horizon. At the end of **Christendom**, the church requires credible, thick, evangelically clear practices of **initiation** that make sense to outsiders and insiders alike. By narrating **baptism** through the **gospel**, and by placing it within a process of **catechesis** and **confession**, churches can recover what the early fathers sought, a people formed by **grace** into the life of **Christ**. Wright’s doctrine of **baptism** thus becomes a lens for reimagining **ecclesial identity**, where **confession**, **holiness**, and **unity** are not abstractions but enacted through long obedience within a covenant community.

#### 9. Legacy and Reformed or WTS evaluation
Wright’s legacy for Reformed theology is a concrete agenda, retrieve the **fathers** to reform **practice**. His historical work has already altered evangelical commonplaces by destabilizing confident claims about the apostolic uniformity of **infant baptism**, re-centering **catechesis**, and challenging a sociological captivity of **baptism** under **Christendom**. Through editorial projects like the **New Dictionary of Theology** 1988 and the **Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology** 1993 he mainstreamed **patristic theology** within evangelical curricula. His monograph **What Has Infant Baptism Done to Baptism?** 2005 and essays in **Infant Baptism in Historical Perspective** 2007 continue to resource pastors who want to hold together **covenant theology**, **grace**, and ecclesial **discipline**.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Wright’s strengths are substantial. He exemplifies **Scripture sufficiency**, he guards **covenant of grace** logic against **sacramentalism**, and he underscores the **marks of the church**, **Word, sacrament, and discipline**. Two tensions remain. First, his historical emphasis on the ambiguities of early **infant baptism** can be heard as destabilizing confessional clarity, unless explicitly tethered to the **Westminster Standards** on **baptism** as a means of grace for believers and their children. The remedy is precisely his own proposal, elevate **catechesis** and **profession** so that the practice displays **faith** and **promise** together. Second, his critique of **Christendom** can risk flattening the legitimate public dimension of **covenant** life, though his Scottish attention to **discipline** and **worship** mitigates this. In principle, the WTS path forward aligns with Wright’s best insights, retain **paedobaptism** grounded in **covenant**, reject **ex opere operato**, and reform congregational life by restoring **catechumenate**, **public confession**, and **discipline**, so that the Reformed account of **grace** and **church** is visibly embodied before the watching world.
