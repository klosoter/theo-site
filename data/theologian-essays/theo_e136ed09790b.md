### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Michael S. Burdett is a contemporary figure in **philosophical theology** whose oeuvre concentrates on the moral and metaphysical pressures exerted by late modern **technology** on **eschatology** and **theological anthropology**. Working within British institutions and Anglophone networks in **science and religion** and **STS**, he writes against the backdrop of **Heidegger's critique of technique** and the ascendant influence of **transhumanism** associated with **Nick Bostrom** and **Ray Kurzweil**. This setting makes the grammar of Christian **hope** newly urgent: can inherited accounts of **resurrection**, **new creation**, and **theosis** compete with technoscientific promises of radical life extension, cognitive enhancement, and digitized afterlives. Burdett answers by linking diagnostic **genealogy** to constructive **dogmatics**, arguing that modern technical projects are animated by a displaced **soteriology**, a secularized telos that parasitically borrows from the Christian **eschaton** while retooling the **imago Dei** into an engineering blueprint for self-transcendence.

Burdett's methodological signature is a two-step movement that weds **genealogical critique** to **eschatological retrieval**. Drawing on **Foucault's genealogy** and **Heidegger's Gestell** or enframing, he narrates how imaginaries of progress, control, and immortality travel from **theological** matrices into **technological** programs. He then re-centers the Christian story by rehearsing **Augustinian desire**, **gift**, and the distinction between *status viatoris* and *status termini* as an antidote to Promethean impatience. This approach is not a blanket **anti-technology** posture in the mode of **Jacques Ellul**; rather it is an ascetical redescription of the technological condition in light of **eschatological reserve**, that is, the conviction that the fullness of **salvation** and **perfection** is God’s act in **resurrection** and **new creation**, not a human artifact of optimization.

The intellectual ecology of Burdett's work shows sustained engagement with **STS** figures such as **Hans Jonas** on the ethics of the future and with **philosophy of mind** debates that feed **mind uploading** and **AI** aspirations. He returns repeatedly to **Teilhard de Chardin's** cosmic eschatology as a key antecedent for techno-messianic narratives, while differentiating his own dogmatic commitments by retrieving **Irenaeus** and **Athanasius** on **incarnation** and **deification**. This constructive dimension locates Burdett within a broader renaissance of **eschatological** and **anthropological** reflection in contemporary theology, alongside **Moltmann's theology of hope** and more Augustinian streams that underline **creaturely finitude** and **Sabbath**.

#### 2. Eschatology and the Technological Future: the thesis and its scaffolding
Burdett's 2015 monograph, **Eschatology and the Technological Future**, sets out his thesis with theoretical ballast and cultural specificity. The book argues that **transhumanism** and allied techno-optimisms are best understood as **secular eschatologies** that mimic and rival Christian teleology. The analytic payoff is twofold: first, to unmask the **soteriological** structure hidden within technical projects; second, to recover the Christian **eschaton** as a public grammar for evaluating the plausibility and desirability of technological aims. The argument proceeds by close readings of transhumanist sources such as **Bostrom's Superintelligence** and **Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near**, alongside theological resources on **resurrection of the body**, **glorification**, and **theosis**.

The book's formal method turns on **Heidegger's Gestell** to name the metaphysical compression by which entities are rendered as **standing-reserve**, available for manipulation and enhancement. Burdett leverages this analysis to expose how **human nature** is reconceived as programmable substrate, thereby displacing the **imago Dei** from a relational and vocational frame into a **technological project**. He then pivots to **eschatology**, arguing that only the doctrinal triad of **incarnation**, **cross**, and **resurrection** can rightly discipline our aspirations for transformation. By contrasting **resurrection** with **uploading**, and **new creation** with **Singularity**, he draws out the limits of technicized immortality and the incoherence of **disembodied** continuities promised by data-driven **digital eschatologies**.

A central constructive move in the 2015 work is to retrieve **theosis** without capitulating to transhumanist fantasies of divinization. Burdett reframes **deification** as participation in Christ's **eschatological life** through **grace** and **sacrament**, rather than as an asymptotic human ascent via enhancement. This reinforces **eschatological reserve**: the end is a gift to be received in **communion** and **worship**, not a tool to be manufactured. Here he leans on **Augustinian desire** directed to God as the true finis hominis, as against **Pelagian** disciplines of self-perfectibility that seep into the rhetoric of **optimization** and **biohacking**. He likewise reiterates the biblical theme of **Sabbath** as a theological limit that resists the totalizing tempo of **efficiency**.

#### 3. Mapping transhumanism as secular soteriology
Burdett's treatment of **transhumanism** is neither caricature nor capitulation. He carefully tracks its **metaphysical** and **ethical** claims, reading **Bostrom's** advocacy of morphological freedom together with **Kurzweil's** algorithmic historical teleology. He identifies three doctrinally parasitic transfers: first, **creation** collapsed into **production**, where being is equivalent to design space; second, **sin** re-described as **biological limitation** and entropy; third, **salvation** reconfigured as **enhancement** culminating in cognitive explosion. The result is a soteriology of **techne**, replacing **grace** with computation and **providence** with Moore's-law historicism.

In analyzing **mind uploading** and **digital immortality**, Burdett deploys **philosophy of mind** to ask whether continuity of consciousness can be preserved absent **embodiment**. He points out the dissonance between **biblical resurrection** and **substrate-independent minds**, insisting on **embodied continuity** grounded in divine **re-creative action**. He also follows **Hans Jonas** in raising the ethical index of our actions relative to the open-ended future of vulnerable life, concluding that **humility** rather than **hubris** is the cardinal virtue for technological action. This moral stance is joined to ecclesiological insights about **technological liturgies**: transhumanist practices and narratives function as quasi-liturgical formations that catechize adherents in hope redirected from **God** to **Technique**.

Burdett situates these findings historically by tracing Byzantine and modern strands of **theosis** and **perfectibility**, noting how **Renaissance** and **Enlightenment** motifs of mastery paved the way for today's **bioengineering** agendas. He engages **Teilhard de Chardin** as the emblem of a Christianized techno-evolutionary hope, yet judges it too immanentist to safeguard **eschatological transcendence**. Against both secular and pseudo-Christian technicized futures, he articulates a Christological norm where **glorification** is conformitas Christi through **Spirit-wrought** transformation, not accumulation of capacities.

#### 4. AI, dataism, and the anthropology of reduction
In essays and chapters through the late 2010s and 2020s, including a contribution to **The Robot Will See You Now** in 2019, Burdett turns his lens to **AI** and emerging **dataism**. The issue here is the anthropological shrinkage implied by computationalism, whereby the **imago Dei** is tacitly equated with **information-processing** and agency is treated as **optimization** within reward landscapes. Drawing on **Heidegger** and **Borgmann** as well as theological sources, he argues that such reduction occludes the **givenness** of persons, the opacity and depth of **subjectivity**, and the teleology of **communion** in **love**. Against models that seek digital proxies for **wisdom**, he commends an **apophatic anthropology** in which human meaning exceeds formalization and resists **total capture** by data.

Burdett calls attention to the spiritual formation carried by **platforms** and **algorithms**, shifting the conversation from isolated ethical dilemmas to **liturgical anthropology**. The patterns of attention, affect, and desire curated by machines are not peripheral but structuring. If **worship** forms desire toward the **triune God**, then **technological liturgies** school our loves toward **availability**, **speed**, and **self-display**. He thus proposes ascetical counter-practices drawn from **ecclesial life**: **Sabbath rest**, **silence**, **Eucharistic** reception, and **embodied presence**. These are not romantic retreats but reparative disciplines of **desire** that re-train the sensorium for **gift** rather than **grasping**.

Within this frame Burdett rejects both **technophobia** and **technophilia**. He charts a middle path of **critical receptivity** under eschatological judgment, allowing for technical tools that serve **creaturely flourishing** while resisting logics that re-script persons as nodes in an extractive data economy. Here his use of **eschatology** functions as a check against totalizing future imaginaries, insisting on **eschatological reserve** and the primacy of **divine action** in securing the telos of creatures.

#### 5. Theological anthropology, virtue, and theosis reimagined
A persistent theme in Burdett is the rehabilitation of **theological anthropology** against both essentialist fixity and posthuman dissolution. He reframes **imago Dei** as calling and relation rather than as a set of capacities, foregrounding vocation to **communion** and **stewardship** under **providence**. He then retrieves **theosis** as participation in Trinitarian life through **Christ** and **Spirit**, emphasizing that deification is neither absorption nor self-engineering but **graced participation**. The distinction between *natura* and *gratia* is placed within a narrative of **creation-fall-redemption-consummation**, such that **grace** heals nature and perfects it toward **glory** without collapsing into technique.

Ethically, Burdett leans on **virtue** rather than rule-only approaches, joining **Augustinian** accounts of **ordered love** to **practices** that form patience, hope, and humility. The central virtue is **hope**, disciplined by the cross and **resurrection**, which refuses despair in the face of suffering or naive optimism in the face of innovation. **Prudence** and **temperance** regulate adoption of enhancements, while **justice** regulates distribution and socio-technical design for the marginalized. The theological virtues direct technē toward **neighbor love** rather than **self-optimization**, marking a divergence from transhumanist valuations of autonomy and control.

This anthropological and ethical weave is explicitly **ecclesial**. Burdett envisions **church practices** as counter-formation in a technological age, where **Scripture**, **sacrament**, and **catechesis** narrate a different end and thus a different present. Such practices, while ancient, are cast as critical theory for the present, contesting the hegemonic **imaginary** of endless innovation and calling for discernment under the sovereignty of the **triune God**.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates: STS, Radical Orthodoxy, and public theology
Burdett converses across **disciplines**. With **STS** he shares a suspicion of technological neutrality, but he ventures beyond descriptive sociology to normative **dogmatics**. With **Heidegger**, **Jonas**, and **Ellul** he shares diagnostic insights about modern **technique**, though he tempers Ellulian totalization with **eschatological hope**. In philosophy of mind he challenges **functionalism** and **computationalism**, aligning with those who insist on **embodiment** and the irreducibility of **consciousness**. His posture toward **Radical Orthodoxy** is one of selective affinity: he echoes its **sacramental ontology** and critique of **secular autonomy** while avoiding its romantic medievalism by engaging concrete **AI** and **biotech** case studies.

Critics from technology policy sometimes judge his **eschatological** frame too theological for plural public reason, while some theologians worry that his appropriation of **Heidegger** and **Foucault** risks smuggling in a **hermeneutics of suspicion** that undermines **natural law** and metaphysical stability. Burdett responds by arguing that public discourse already traffics in covert eschatologies and that surfacing and testing them is a service to public reason. He contends that **creation** and **providence** set metaphysical guardrails that ensure his critique is not a free-floating skepticism but a theological **ontology** that can underwrite constructive proposals in **bioethics** and **AI** governance.

#### 7. Case applications: mortality, medicine, and digital mediation
In applied ethics Burdett treats **mortality** as a theological touchstone. The Christian valuation of death as an **enemy** that is nevertheless encompassed by **Christ's victory** yields a unique disposition toward medicine and enhancement. Efforts to defer death can be appropriate works of **healing** under **providence**, yet projects to abolish death through **technological immortality** cross a theological threshold into anti-creaturely **idolatry**. He urges medicine to focus on **care**, **presence**, and **palliative** accompaniment rather than exclusively on aggressive technological extension, thereby retrieving **Sabbath** and **lament** as part of faithful finitude.

On digital mediation and **AI**, Burdett recommends design and adoption principles ordered by **communion** and **attention**. Tools that intensify **surveillance**, commodify **intimacy**, or fracture **embodiment** should be resisted, while technologies that augment **care** and make space for **contemplation** may be embraced with caution. His repeated counsel is to test artifacts and systems against the narrative of **creation-fall-redemption-consummation** and the ecclesial practices that sustain **virtue** and **hope**.

#### 8. Continuities and developments across Burdett's corpus
Across books, chapters, and articles from 2015 onward, Burdett's through-line is unmistakable: analyze technology's **eschatological** desires and retrieve Christian **hope** as both critique and alternative. The 2015 **Eschatology and the Technological Future** articulates the thesis programmatically. Subsequent essays, including the 2019 chapter in **The Robot Will See You Now**, broaden the scope to **AI**, **automation**, and **dataism**, while journal articles in venues like **Zygon** and **Modern Theology** deepen the theoretical apparatus by engaging **phenomenology** and **virtue ethics**. The constructive horizon is stable: resist **secular soteriology**, confess **resurrection** and **new creation**, and cultivate **ecclesial practices** that school hope rightly.

His influence is felt in theological curricula and church-facing discussions about **transhumanism** and **AI**, where his clear naming of **secular eschatology** has become a standard diagnostic trope. He has collaborated in UK-based research initiatives on **human futures** that convene theologians, philosophers, and technologists, expanding the public presence of theological **anthropology** and **eschatology** in conversations frequently dominated by engineering and economics. The durability of his proposals rests in their simplicity and depth: technology must be placed beneath **providence**, judged by **eschatology**, and used in **love**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS-informed vantage, Burdett's work gains high marks for exposing **idolatry** in **secular eschatologies**, for insisting on **embodied resurrection**, and for retrieving **Sabbath**, **mortality**, and **virtue** under **providence**. His deployment of **eschatological reserve** parallels the Reformed **already/not yet**, guarding against overrealized hopes. Two tensions remain. First, the reliance on **Heideggerian** and **Foucauldian** **genealogy** risks granting too much analytic primacy to phenomenology of **power** rather than to **special revelation** as principium cognoscendi; a WTS alternative would foreground **Scripture's covenantal drama** as the controlling hermeneutic for technology, employing **Van Til's** antithesis and **common grace** to parse both the profound religious drive of technique and genuine goods under **creation**. Second, while Burdett retrieves **theosis** carefully, a Reformed framing would prefer **union with Christ** and **sanctification** language to avoid any suggestion that grace elevates by incremental capacity-accumulation; here **Bavinck's** organic motif and **Kuyper's** cultural mandate offer a principled path to affirm **technological vocations** within **creational limits**, bounded by **law** and ordered by **love**. Strengthening these lines would sharpen doctrinal normativity and keep critical tools subordinate to the **covenant**al grammar of **revelation**, **creation-fall-redemption**, and **kingdom** hope.
