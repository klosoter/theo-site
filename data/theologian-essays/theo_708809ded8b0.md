### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Jason Byassee emerges as a contemporary **United Methodist** theologian and pastor whose work sits at the intersection of **postliberal ecclesiology**, **patristic retrieval**, and **pastoral practice**. Trained at **Duke Divinity School** under figures like **Stanley Hauerwas** and **Geoffrey Wainwright**, Byassee absorbed the Yale-Duke emphasis on **church-shaped knowledge** and the **regula fidei** as hermeneutical guide. His early and ongoing association with the **Christian Century** as editor and essayist placed him in the thick of North American **mainline Protestant** discourse, even as his scholarship kept a steady eye on **Augustine** and the **Greek Fathers**. His pastoral leadership in congregations, notably in **North Carolina United Methodism**, and his later teaching post at the **Vancouver School of Theology**, furnished a laboratory where doctrinal retrieval could be tested against the demands of **preaching**, **liturgy**, and **pastoral care**.

Byassee’s methodological signature is best described as **praise seeking understanding**, a self-conscious Augustinian variation on **Anselm’s** classic *fides quaerens intellectum*. He approaches **Scripture** through **theological interpretation** within the church’s **worshiping life**, convinced that the **Psalms** and the **Trinity** are best learned where they are sung and confessed. This method privileges **doxology** over detached critique, yet it is not anti-intellectual; it is a disciplined reading under the **creed** and within the **communio sanctorum**. He draws on **lectio divina**, the long **patristic** habit of canonical cross-reading, and the **sacramental imagination** of the great doctors to construe how Scripture speaks the **triune** life of God.

His intellectual context joins the postliberal insistence on **intra-ecclesial rationality** with the **ressourcement** movement’s return to **patristic sources**. Byassee stands with figures like **Robert Jenson** and **Rowan Williams** in resisting modern fragmentation by turning to the **Nicene** grammar of **homoousios**, **perichoresis**, and **divine missions** as the church’s native language. In this he also inherits **Wainwright’s** insistence that **doxology** and **dogma** belong together: lex orandi, lex credendi. His rhetoric is ecumenically hospitable but firmly **Nicene-Chalcedonian**, arguing that the church’s **trinitarian confession** is not an optional appendix to biblical reading but its inner light.

#### 2. Works and doctrinal contributions
Byassee’s early monograph, **Praise Seeking Understanding: Reading the Psalms with Augustine** (2007), set the trajectory for his project. Drawing on **Augustine’s Enarrationes in Psalmos**, he argues that the **Psalms** are a school where the **corpus Christi** learns to pray in **Christo**, to become what it sings. The distinctive thesis is that interpretation is an ecclesial act of **formation**. The **totus Christus** theme functions as hermeneutical key: Christ speaks in the **Psalms** as Head and Body, and the church is inducted into this voice by repetition, preaching, and sacramental participation. This places **doxology** at the center of exegesis and sets the template for Byassee’s later work on **trinitarian theology** and **homiletics**.

In **Reading Augustine: A Guide to the Confessions** (2013/14), Byassee introduces **Augustine’s Confessions** as a pastoral and doctrinal map, not a museum piece. The book is catechetical, showing how **memory**, **desire**, and **grace** converge in narrative to shape the Christian life. Theologically, it presses an Augustinian anthropology of **restless hearts** ordered by **caritas**, where **gratia** is divine initiative healing **concupiscentia**. This anthropological frame informs Byassee’s later attention to **clergy health** and the habits required for durable ministry. His exposition treats **Confessions** as a script for ongoing **conversion** in the context of **baptismal** and **Eucharistic** life.

The short dogmatic primer, **Trinity: The God We Do Not Understand** (2015), distills Byassee’s approach to **trinitarian doctrine** for the parish. The book retrieves **Nicene orthodoxy** with attention to **Athanasius**, **Gregory of Nazianzus**, and **Augustine**, and shows how **perichoresis** shapes Christian prayer, mission, and community. Byassee insists on the unity of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity** without collapsing them, taking cues from **the divine missions** as the pattern by which the Father sends the Son and Spirit to draw the church into God’s life. He labors to repair modern **trinitarian amnesia**, showing that naming **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** is not a speculative add-on but the evangelical core of the **gospel**.

The **Brazos Theological Commentary: Psalms 101–150** (2018) embodies his conviction that doctrine and exegesis interpenetrate. There, **doxology** is the guiding hermeneutic: the final **Hallelujah** psalms are read as training in **praise** that orders the soul and the polis toward **God**. Byassee reads the **Psalter** canonically and christologically, in conversation with **Aquinas**, **Calvin**, and modern interpreters, yet his hallmark is the patient retrieval of **patristic voices** for contemporary proclamation. The result is a commentary that refuses the opposition between **devotion** and **critical rigor**, proposing that **theological exegesis** is itself a mode of **sanctification** for preacher and people.

A different facet of his theological vision appears in **The Gifts of the Small Church** (2010). Here Byassee translates doctrinal instincts into **ecclesial practice**, arguing that small congregations embody **koinonia**, **catechesis**, and **mutual upbuilding** in ways that are not deficits but charisms. The work criticizes a metrics-driven **ecclesiology of success** and commends a **sacramental** imagination that sees time, place, and people as graced. This dovetails with his **Wesleyan** interest in **sanctification** as communal habitus, where ordinary practices of **hospitality**, **song**, and **Scripture** reading form saints over time.

The coauthored **Faithful and Fractured: Responding to the Clergy Health Crisis** with **Rae Jean Proeschold-Bell** (2018) extends this pastoral-theological thread. Combining empirical research with theological reflection, Byassee addresses clergy **burnout**, **embodiment**, and **sabbath** as sites where **grace** must be bodily received. The text weds **practical theology** and **doctrine**: a trinitarian account of **creation** and **incarnation** obliges the church to care for the bodies of its ministers, while a **theology of the cross** refuses triumphalism. In implicit dialogue with **Hauerwas** and **Wainwright**, Byassee argues that the church’s **liturgical calendar**, **fasting**, and **feasting** are not optional wellness programs but means by which the **Spirit** conforms ministers to **Christ**.

Across these works, several doctrinal themes cohere. First, **revelation** is intrinsically ecclesial and liturgical; **Scripture** is properly read under the **regula fidei** within the **Eucharistic** assembly. Second, **trinitarian dogma** supplies grammar for pastoral life: **perichoresis** patterns communal mutuality, **missions** orient evangelism, and the **processions** ground divine simplicity and gift. Third, an **Augustinian** anthropology of desire underwrites **sanctification** as a lifelong redirection of loves by grace, mediated through communal practices. Fourth, **homiletics** is an exercise in **doctrinal catechesis**, where preaching names the **triune God** in ways that reshape imagination and action.

Byassee’s voice is marked by generosity toward the **patristic** and **medieval** heritage alongside clear commitments to **Wesleyan** spirituality. He frequently cites **Athanasius** on the **incarnation** as deifying medicine, **Gregory of Nazianzus** on the rule that what is not assumed is not healed, and **Augustine** on the **totus Christus**. Yet he also leans on **John Wesley’s** insistence that **holiness of heart and life** is the telos of doctrine. His essays and sermons portray the **Triune God** not as metaphysical puzzle but as the living agent who, through **baptism** and **Eucharist**, fashions a people capable of praise and service.

#### 3. Interlocutors, debates, and constructive edge
Byassee situates himself in live conversation with **postliberalism** while resisting its more austere **cultural-linguistic** reductions. He welcomes **Lindbeck’s** insight that doctrine regulates Christian speech but insists with **Jenson** and **Wainwright** that doctrine also names **God’s** real saving action. His engagement with **theological interpretation of Scripture** joins debates over the priority of **historical-critical** methods versus **ecclesial** readings. He refuses a zero-sum account: the **grammatical-historical** is necessary, yet without **creedal** rule and **liturgy**, exegesis malforms. This mediating posture draws on **ressourcement** Roman Catholic voices while remaining distinctly **Protestant** in its insistence on Scripture’s primacy within the **traditio**.

In contemporary pastoral theology, Byassee argues against technocratic solutions to church decline, contending in **The Gifts of the Small Church** and **Faithful and Fractured** that the church’s future lies not in managerial revolution but in deeper **catechesis**, **friendship**, and **habitus**. This places him near **Hauerwas** on the church as an alternative polis, though Byassee’s tone is more irenic and sacramentally expansive, closer to **Rowan Williams**. His **trinitarian** writing intervenes in debates about the **immanent-economic** relation and modern social models of the **Trinity**. He affirms the communicative fruitfulness of **perichoresis** for community life while signaling with **Augustine** the asymmetries of **processions** and the unity of divine **simplicity** to guard against projection of human social forms into God.

As a preacher and teacher, Byassee’s constructive edge is to show how **doctrine** sings. The final **Hallelujahs** of the **Psalter**, the confession of **homoousios**, and the practices of **sabbath** and **table** are not disparate parts but one choreography by which the **Spirit** conforms the church to **Christ** for the Father’s glory. He writes so that pastors may let **dogma** pastor, allowing **trinitarian** and **Christological** grammar to reframe disputes about growth, health, and mission. His corpus therefore belongs to that modern stream for which **ressourcement** is not retreat but a tactical advance.

#### 4. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** standpoint, Byassee’s retrieval of **Nicene trinitarianism**, **Augustinian** anthropology, and **ecclesial** exegesis is welcome. His stress on **divine missions**, reverence for **creeds**, and reading of the **Psalms** with **Augustine** resonate with **Reformed catholicity**. Yet several tensions surface. First, his method risks conflating **regula fidei** with a broadly **mainline** sensus fidelium, such that **tradition** becomes a wide river with blurred banks. A **WTS** corrective would insist that the **confessiones** of the churches, bound to **sola Scriptura**, norm reception of the **fathers**, and that **grammatical-historical** exegesis bears principial priority as the Spirit’s ordinary instrument. Second, his **Wesleyan** description of **sanctification** as communal habitus, while pastorally rich, occasionally speaks in tones perilously close to **synergism**; a **Reformed** account would sharpen **monergistic grace**, ensuring that practices are means, not conditions, of sanctifying action, and would anchor progress in **union with Christ** and the **ordo salutis**. Third, his use of **social Trinitarian** images for communal life needs guarding by **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and the **Creator-creature** distinction, lest **perichoresis** be overextended as a social blueprint. Finally, his commitment to **theological interpretation** sometimes appears to subsume **covenantal**, **redemptive-historical** exegesis under general ecclesial reading; a **WTS** alternative would integrate his patristic insights into a **covenant of grace** framework, reading **Psalms** and **Trinity** through the unfolding **historia salutis** culminating in Christ. To the extent that Byassee’s work can be received within those clarifications, it offers a salutary reminder that **doctrine** belongs at the heart of **preaching**, that **Scripture** is ordered to **doxology**, and that the **triune God** forms a people whose praise is their understanding.
