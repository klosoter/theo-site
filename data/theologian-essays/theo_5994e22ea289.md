### ESSAY
Deanna A. Thompson’s signature contribution is to retrieve **Luther’s theologia crucis** and recast it for a world shaped by **feminist critique**, **trauma discourse**, and the rise of **digital ecclesiology**. Her work centers on how the church bears witness to **God’s hidden-yet-given grace** among those who suffer, extending the **communio sanctorum** across embodied and networked spaces. A long-time teacher and public theologian in the Upper Midwest, she speaks from and to **Lutheran** contexts but writes with ecumenical intent. Through books like **Crossing the Divide** (2004), **Hoping for More** (2012), **The Virtual Body of Christ in a Suffering World** (2016), and **Glimpsing Resurrection** (2018), she advances a constructive program where **the cross and resurrection** inform pastoral care, ecclesial presence, and theological imagination. Her idiom is practical and doctrinal at once, drawing simultaneously on **Luther**, **feminist theologians**, and **trauma theorists** to articulate Christian hope without denial of wounds. In doing so she reorients the classic themes of **sin and grace**, **Word and community**, and **presence and mediation** for twenty-first century ministry.

#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Thompson inhabits a contemporary Protestant field marked by the postliberal turn to narrative, the maturation of **feminist and womanist theology**, the practical-theological turn to **lived religion**, and an explosion of **digital communication** that has reshaped ecclesial life. She reads **Martin Luther** not as a relic of confessional polemic but as a resource for a critical and reparative theology of the cross that can face **violence, patriarchy, and trauma** without sacralizing them. The seasoning of her work by personal experience of **stage IV cancer** intensified her epistemic stance: knowledge of God is cruciform and communal, emerging through **testimony**, **lament**, and concrete practices of accompaniment. Methodologically she combines **Lutheran retrieval** of *theologia crucis* and *simul iustus et peccator* with **feminist hermeneutics of suspicion and reconstruction**, integrates **trauma hermeneutics** attentive to dissociation and survival, and constructs a **digital ecclesiology** that extends the church’s **koinonia** across physical and virtual modalities. Her approach retains a confessional grammar of **Word**, **promise**, and **grace**, yet refracts that grammar through contemporary questions about **bodies, agency, and mediated presence**.

Thompson’s sense of theological authority is likewise cruciform and communal. She privileges **scriptural proclamation** configured by **Luther’s distinction of law and gospel**, while listening closely to the church’s wounded members whose bodies carry the marks that theory forgets. The **hiddenness of God** (*Deus absconditus*) and the **promissory Word of the gospel** become interpretive coordinates for navigating divine presence in absence. Rather than arguing metaphysical theses about divine attributes, she opts for a thick description of **pastoral encounter** and **ecclesial witness**, trusting that the truth of **Christ crucified and risen** appears within and through these relations. In short, her method is neither purely doctrinal nor merely practical; it is a **constructive, witness-shaped theology** that seeks to renew habits of **accompaniment** within the **body of Christ**.

#### 2. Luther and feminist theology: Crossing the Divide
In **Crossing the Divide: Luther, Feminism, and the Cross** (2004), Thompson addresses a fraught debate over **atonement** and the meaning of **the cross**. Feminist theologians such as **Rita Nakashima Brock** and **Delores S. Williams** had criticized classical atonement schemes, especially penal substitution, as undergirding patterns of **divine child abuse** and the sacralization of women’s suffering. Thompson grants the force of these critiques, yet refuses the dichotomy that pits **Luther** against feminist concerns. Reading Luther’s **theologia crucis** alongside feminist analyses, she retrieves the cross as God’s truthful naming of sin’s brutality and God’s self-giving solidarity with the violated. The cross is not a prescription to suffer but the unveiling of **grace** that resists oppression and creates **new agency**.

Crucial to her retrieval are Luther’s themes of **God’s hiddenness and revelation**, the **bondage of the will** and **justification by grace**, and the believer’s **freedom for the neighbor**. She reframes substitution as **transformative solidarity** rather than punitive equivalence, highlights **Christus Victor** motifs of liberation from the powers, and reads **simul iustus et peccator** as psychological realism about survivors and perpetrators alike. Her constructive proposal aligns the **cross and resurrection** with practices of **lament**, **truth-telling**, and **resistance**, making **atonement** an experienced reconciliation that heals without demanding compliance to violence. The interlocution with **Dorothee Soelle**, **Serene Jones**, and **Jürgen Moltmann** reinforces a vision where divine power appears as **cruciform love** rather than coercion, a power that empowers the harmed and judges harm.

#### 3. Suffering, hope, and grace: the memoir-theology of illness
With **Hoping for More: Having Cancer, Talking Faith, and Accepting Grace** (2012), Thompson turns to theology-as-testimony. Diagnosed with advanced cancer, she writes as a theologian-patient learning to receive **grace** through the **prayers and presence** of the **body of Christ**. The memoir is not a theodicy but a sustained meditation on **lament**, **hope**, and **promise** within limits. Against thin providentialism and triumphalist miracles, she leans into **Luther’s pastoral wisdom** about suffering as a site where **God’s promise** meets **human finitude**. The classic Lutheran trope **simul iustus et peccator** becomes an existential confession of weakness and trust. She honors medical science and laments bodily loss, yet insists that **resurrection hope** can suffuse ordinary days without denying the real prospect of death.

Here Thompson begins to foreground the **mediated character of Christian community**. Emails, CaringBridge pages, and social media posts become channels through which the **communion of saints** encourages and sustains. Rather than trivializing presence, such mediation becomes, in her account, a sacramental extension of **Christ’s care** to those who are hospitalized, immunocompromised, or isolated. The doctrine of **vocation** figures as well: caregivers, clinicians, and friends enact **Christ’s priestly ministry** in their ordinary work. The memoir thus functions as constructive theology by showing how **promise**, **community**, and **prayer** generate endurance, not by erasing fear, but by accompanying it.

#### 4. Digital ecclesiology: The Virtual Body of Christ
In **The Virtual Body of Christ in a Suffering World** (2016), Thompson offers a carefully argued **digital ecclesiology**. Taking seriously the critiques of **Sherry Turkle** about the perils of mediated life, she nonetheless contends that digital tools can intensify **koinonia** when governed by **the gospel’s call to accompaniment**. The metaphor of the **virtual body of Christ** names the real though mediated presence of Christian care as believers connect across time and space. She engages research by **Heidi A. Campbell** on digital religion and draws on **Pauline ecclesiology** of one body with many members to argue that online communication can be an extension of **communio sanctorum**.

Thompson does not propose a disembodied church. She emphasizes that **incarnation** entails bodies, local congregations, and sacraments. Yet she questions a false binary between embodied and mediated presence, noting that the church has always relied on technologies of mediation from codices to microphones. Theologically she reasons from **Word** and **promise** to argue that the gospel’s **performative speech** can travel digitally without loss of efficacy. She is cautious yet open regarding **sacramental practice** online, prioritizing pastoral discernment, communal accountability, and the criterion of **love’s service to the vulnerable**. Pre-pandemic, this was exploratory; in the wake of global lockdowns, her account served many pastors and lay leaders seeking a grammar for **online worship, prayer, and pastoral care** that is faithful to **Christ’s presence** and realistic about constraints.

#### 5. Trauma, Holy Saturday, and glimpses of resurrection
Thompson’s **Glimpsing Resurrection: Cancer, Trauma, and Ministry** (2018) deepens her engagement with **trauma theology** and pastoral praxis. In conversation with **Shelly Rambo’s** work on the Spirit’s persistence through the middle space of **Holy Saturday**, she describes ministry among trauma survivors as attention to what persists when death-dealing forces have not fully receded. Here the **resurrection** is not a loud erasure of wounds but a quiet, scarred life that breathes through locked doors. Liturgical and communal practices of **testimony**, **anamnesis**, **intercessory prayer**, and **gentle presence** attune the church to these glimpses. She insists that claims about **new creation** must be calibrated to the nervous systems and social conditions of those who have experienced violation, lest proclamation re-traumatize rather than heal.

Doctrinally, Thompson draws the cross-resurrection dialectic into pastoral method: hold fast to the **truthfulness of wounds** and to the **promise of life** without forcing either to cancel the other. The **theologia crucis** remains determinative as a hermeneutic of humility and protest, while **resurrection hope** supplies eschatological orientation. A vocabulary of **accompaniment** and **presence** displaces managerial or triumphalist modes of ministry. The church becomes recognizable where it learns to wait with the wounded and to narrate God’s faithfulness without shortcuts, trusting the Spirit’s quiet work.

#### 6. Doctrinal threads and constructive synthesis
Across these works Thompson weaves a consistent constructive tapestry. Her **doctrine of God** is confessed doxologically rather than speculatively: God is known in **Christ crucified and risen**, the **hidden God revealed in promise**, present by the Spirit within and beyond the gathered body. Her **Christology** tacitly draws on a **Lutheran communicatio idiomatum** and a generous **sacramental imagination** to underwrite talk of **mediated presence**, yet she keeps debates about **ubiquity** and **extra calvinisticum** offstage in favor of pastoral description. In **ecclesiology** she extends Paul’s metaphor of the body into the digital domain while guarding **embodiment** as normative and irreducible. For **soteriology**, she relocates **atonement** in practices of solidarity and liberation consonant with **Christus Victor** and transformative accounts of substitution, avoiding punitive logics while preserving a grammar of **grace** and **new agency**.

Ethically, **vocation** and the **priesthood of all believers** anchor her call for communities that accompany sufferers with durable love. Liturgically, she commends **prayer**, **testimony**, and **Eucharistic imagination** as sites where Christ’s life is shared. Epistemically, she trusts **witness** and **practice** as vehicles of truth, aligning with a **postliberal** sense of thick communal reasoning. Historically, she argues that such stances are not innovations but developments faithful to the **Reformation’s** insistence that God hides in lowly means and meets us as **gift**.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and impact
Thompson’s project positions her amid vigorous debates. With **Rita Nakashima Brock** and **Delores S. Williams**, she resists atonement language that teaches the vulnerable to accept abuse, yet she contends, against some feminist conclusions, that **Luther’s theology of the cross** can resource resistance rather than resignation. In dialogue with **Serene Jones** and **Dorothee Soelle**, she articulates a **passion of God** in solidarity with sufferers while maintaining the **promise** that addresses sinners as beloved. With **Moltmann**, she centers **the crucified God**, though her concern is less speculative impassibility than pastoral presence. In the digital sphere she engages **Sherry Turkle’s** critiques of virtual shallowness and responds by specifying **ecclesial practices** that deepen rather than thin relational life. Her proposals influenced practical-theological discussions across denominational lines, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when the grammar of **virtual presence** and **accompaniment** became pastorally urgent.

Institutionally, her work has circulated widely through **Lutheran** networks and ecumenical pastoral training, reshaping expectations about ministry with the **chronically ill**, **trauma survivors**, and the **homebound**. Congregations and seminaries have found in her writing a map for discerning how **Word and community** can be shared through screens without capitulating to consumerism. Critics from more sacramentally restrictive or metaphysically classical positions have pressed her on the risks of **virtualizing ecclesial presence** and the theological costs of moving beyond traditional accounts of **atonement** and divine attributes. Thompson receives such critiques as invitations to clarify pastoral criteria and to ground innovation in **gospel promise** and **love of neighbor**.

#### 8. Distinctive contribution
Thompson’s enduring thesis is that a renewed **theologia crucis** can bind together **feminist critique**, **trauma awareness**, and **digital mediation** to form a church capable of real presence in our fractured world. She refuses a romance of suffering and insists on **resurrection hope**, while acknowledging that hope often appears as a **glimpse** rather than a spectacle. Her constructive acuity lies in translating high doctrines of **cross, grace, and church** into patterns of **accompaniment** that are theologically thick and pastorally workable. By scripting a **virtual body of Christ** that does not negate embodiment, by reframing **atonement** to heal rather than harm, and by foregrounding **witness** as a mode of knowing, she equips ministers and laity for faithful improvisation under pressure. The result is a theology that is recognizably **Lutheran** yet dialogical, rooted in **Word and promise** while keenly attentive to what digital culture and trauma studies expose about human vulnerability and the possibility of grace.

In Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Thompson’s retrieval of **theologia crucis**, her candor about **lament**, and her pastoral focus on **Word-shaped consolation** commend themselves as salutary correctives to triumphalism. Yet tensions arise where her **atonement** accent leans away from penal substitution toward **transformative solidarity**, where her account of **divine suffering** trends toward passibility in the **Moltmann** register, and where her **digital ecclesiology** presses toward mediated presence in ways that strain **visible church** and **ordinary means of grace** commitments. Classical Reformed theology would affirm the primacy of **preaching** as a means that may be broadcast widely, but it would caution that **sacraments** require gathered, bodily fellowship and ordained administration, guarding the church’s visibility and the integrity of **covenant signs**. It would likewise articulate **penal substitution** within a richer tapestry that includes **Christus Victor** and **union with Christ**, thereby addressing both guilt and trauma without abandoning the juridical center of the **covenant of grace**. On **divine impassibility**, a Reformed account would deploy the distinction between God in himself and God toward us, allowing robust biblical language of divine compassion while maintaining **immutability** and **aseity**. In short, Reformed evaluation gratefully receives Thompson’s cross-centered pastoral wisdom and her summons to accompaniment, while proposing that **embodied worship**, **sacramental realism as spiritual presence**, and a covenantal construal of **atonement** provide firmer doctrinal footing for the very concerns she elevates.
