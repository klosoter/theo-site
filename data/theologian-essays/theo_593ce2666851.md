### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and Context: East German atheism meets Barthian dialectics
Born in 1934 in **Magdeburg**, **Eberhard Jüngel** came of age in the **German Democratic Republic**, where state **atheism**, Marxist **materialism**, and a suspicious public sphere forced the church to clarify its **public witness**. His early ministry and study at the **Kirchliche Hochschule Berlin** and later **Tübingen** embedded him within the hermeneutical renewal led by **Rudolf Bultmann**, **Ernst Fuchs**, and **Gerhard Ebeling**, while he was decisively drawn to **Karl Barth’s** dogmatic passion and his rejection of **natural theology**. This double formation, hermeneutical and dialectical, introduced the enduring antinomy that structures Jüngel’s work: how to articulate **God’s reality** as truth without capitulating either to metaphysics divorced from **revelation** or to existential reduction severed from **dogma**. In this setting, where **Marx**, **Feuerbach**, and **Nietzsche** had leveled theism, Jüngel framed theology as the proud confession that from the **cross** God speaks the truth about **world** and **human being**.

The early monograph **Paulus und Jesus** 1962 signals the agenda: a historically and hermeneutically disciplined retrieval of **New Testament** proclamation in which the **kerygma** does not dissolve into subjectivity. Against the charge that **faith** is projection, Jüngel insists with Barth that **revelation** is God’s act, yet he appropriates from **Bultmann** and **Ebeling** a meticulous attention to **language**, **understanding**, and **event**. This double allegiance would later underwrite his most famous theses, that **God’s being is in becoming** and that the **truth** of God-talk is **metaphorical truth**, both claims designed to honor God’s **self-communication** without falling into either silent apophaticism or a univocal **analogia entis**.

#### 2. Method: language, event, and the analogia fidei
Jüngel’s method can be summarized as a hermeneutical **analogia fidei** deployed against the **analogia entis**. From **Gadamerian** and **Ricoeurian** insights he retrieves the claim that **language** opens the world, such that theological predication is neither mere symbol nor empty tautology. In essays later grouped under **Unterwegs zur Sache** 1972 and **Metaphorische Wahrheit** 1974 he argues that theological discourse is verified by **metaphorical truth**, where metaphor does not merely decorate but discloses reality otherwise inaccessible. God-language works because **God speaks**, and in divine **self-communication** our speech is caught up into the history where **God** names himself as **Father, Son, and Spirit**. This is a disciplined **analogia fidei** that takes the shape of **analogia relationis**, grounded not in created being but in the relation given by **Jesus Christ**, especially in the **cross** and **resurrection** as the definitive event of understanding.

The methodological polemic against the **analogia entis** remains constant. Following **Barth**, Jüngel judged an unqualified being-analogy to legitimate a knowledge of God prior to **gospel**, threatening the **sola gratia** of divine **self-revelation**. Yet he also resists an anti-metaphysical biblicism by developing a thin but real ontology: the claim that **Sein** must be thought as **Geschehen**, **being as event**. This is the controlling intuition that frames all subsequent doctrinal work. The paradox is intentional. Only by thinking **being** from **history** can theology confess that **God is love**, for love is an event of **self-giving** that establishes identity precisely in relation. Against static **substance** thinking, Jüngel privileges **relational ontology** without erasing divine **aseity**. The protective grammar is **self-differentiation in unity**: God determines himself in the **mission** of the Son and Spirit, and thus divine identity is confessed as **Trinitarian** through and through.

#### 3. God’s being is in becoming: Barth’s legacy sharpened
The study **Gottes Sein ist im Werden** 1965 offers Jüngel’s classic formulation: **God’s being is in becoming**. The phrase is borrowed from **Barth** but systematized by Jüngel into a thesis about **Trinitarian ontology**. God’s **immutability** and **freedom** are not threatened by his history with us; rather divine freedom is displayed as the freedom to be himself for us in **Jesus Christ**. The **economic Trinity** is the **immanent Trinity**, not by identity of effects and essence, but because in the missions of **Son** and **Spirit** we are given God as he truly is. Here Jüngel’s decisive move is to locate ontology in the **evangel** itself: the God who justifies the ungodly is the God whose being consists in **loving communion**. To speak of **becoming** is not to ascribe change in the creaturely sense, but to affirm that divine **life** is living actuality. The dialectical counterpoint is clear: precisely in sovereign **constancy**, God is the living God who is never without his **history**.

That decision sets the stage for a broader engagement with **atheism**, **metaphysics**, and **modernity**. **God** is neither an extrinsic hypothesis nor the highest concept within a metaphysical ladder. Rather, God is confessed as the **mystery** that makes the world to be world, but only as disclosed in the **crucified**. This formulation methodologically refuses the **cosmological** and **ontological arguments** as independent warrants, yet it does not refrain from ontological claims. Instead, it seeks to derive an ontology from the **gospel**, a controlled reversal in which **justification** becomes ontological principle.

#### 4. Death, nothingness, and the theology of the cross
The monograph **Tod: Existenz und Wirklichkeit des Todes** 1971 witnesses to Jüngel’s sustained wrestling with **death**, **nothingness**, and **nihilism**, in dialogue with **Heidegger** and with **Barth’s** doctrine of **das Nichtige**. Death is not merely a biological limit but the decisive contradiction of human **existence**, the sign that our being is contested by **nothingness**. Into this abyss the **cross** of Jesus is read as God’s self-identification with the godforsaken, not as a tragic collapse but as the victorious **self-giving** by which God reconciles the world. By letting **death** do its worst to the **Son**, God denies **nothingness** its final word. The **resurrection** is therefore not supplemental wonder but the ontological consequence of **God’s love**, the event in which life has the last word.

This severe soteriology feeds back into Jüngel’s doctrine of God. Because God’s **justifying** love encounters us at the site of **death**, God must be confessed where human experience threatens to negate divinity. Hence the recurring Jüngelian paradoxes: **God’s presence as absence**, **majesty as humility**, **power as suffering love**. This is not romanticized weakness but the rhetorical sharpened form of **Luther’s theologia crucis**, now aligned with **Barth’s** christological concentration. Only such a theology can address modern **atheism**, because it takes seriously the world in which God seems not to be, and confesses that precisely there **God** has determined to be God.

#### 5. God as the mystery of the world: theism, atheism, and public truth
Jüngel’s signature work **Gott als Geheimnis der Welt** 1977 carries his constructive project to its height. Subtitled as a justification of a **theology of the crucified** in the contest between **theism** and **atheism**, the volume argues that the classical God of abstract **theism** deserves the critique of **modernity**. When **God** is treated as an explanatory supplement or a supreme being within the world, **Feuerbach’s** projection critique and **Nietzsche’s** transvaluation are in order. Yet the Christian confession of **God** is different: God is the **mystery of the world** not because knowledge has reached its limit, but because God freely hides and reveals himself in **Jesus Christ**. Mystery is a form of **truth**, not a deficit of reason. By this move, **atheism** becomes the necessary interlocutor that purifies Christian **God-talk** from idolatrous **theism** while forcing the church back upon the **gospel**.

The book also consolidates Jüngel’s **notion of truth**. If truth is **correspondence**, then it is in the first instance correspondence between God’s **self-interpretation** and our faith’s **interpretive obedience**. If truth is **coherence**, it is the teleological coherence of the **Triune** economy. If truth is **disclosure**, it occurs as God’s **self-showing** in the crucified and risen Jesus. In this polyphonic account, **metaphorical truth** receives dogmatic dignity. To say **God is love** is to speak metaphoric truth that discloses reality as it is, because **God** is himself the act that makes the predicate true. Thus **doctrine** is the regulated discourse of a community seized by God’s **self-communication**, and the **church** appears in Jüngel as the place where socially risky, publicly accountable speech about **God** is practiced.

#### 6. Language of faith, church, and the world
Essays in **Unterwegs zur Sache** 1972 and **Entsprechungen: Gott, Wahrheit, Mensch** 1986 extend the program into homiletics, ecclesiology, and public theology. Jüngel’s stress on **metaphorical truth** grounds a robust account of **preaching** as the event in which the **Word of God** addresses and recreates hearers. The church’s **public** is not merely cultic but civic; the gospel carries a **public character** because language carries world-opening force. Jüngel thus supports a Lutheran-leaning Protestant account of **law and gospel**, while locating the church’s societal engagement in the **truth** of witness rather than in **religious** utility. He stands here both in continuity and in contrast with contemporaries like **Jürgen Moltmann** and **Wolfhart Pannenberg**. With **Moltmann** he valorizes **hope** and history; with **Pannenberg** he affirms truth’s public claim. Yet he insists more radically on **revelation’s primacy** and on the grammar of **justification** as the church’s distinctive contribution to the public square.

This linguistic turn does not produce fideism. For Jüngel, to refuse the **analogia entis** is not to deny **reason** but to submit reason to the **cross**. Theology thinks after **God’s speech** and so is accountable to **Scripture**, to the **creeds**, and to the disciplined practice of **doctrine**. The controlling maxim remains that **God’s being is in becoming**, so the church’s task is to speak of God where God has promised to be: in **word** and **sacrament**, as testimonies to the once-for-all **history** of Jesus that spills into the present in Spirit-given **faith**.

#### 7. Justification as ontological principle
Jüngel’s late synthesis, **Das Evangelium von der Rechtfertigung des Gottlosen** 1998, crowns his lifelong conviction that **justification** is the **center** of Christian faith. The **righteousness of God** is not punitive retribution but reconciling gift, the **recta iustitia Dei** recovered by **Luther**. Yet Jüngel presses further than many Lutheran and Reformed expositions by arguing that **justification** is not only **forensic** but has **ontological** import. To justify is to make the sinner **true** before God, to establish a new **being-in-relation** that is not reducible to inner moral change yet exceeds external acquittal. This **ontological justification** does not collapse grace into nature; it establishes a new **existence** in *coram Deo*, an identity anchored in God’s own **self-determination** to be for us. The metaphysical claim is modest but real: the **being** of the justified is participation in the **event** of God’s reconciling love.

This leads to a vigorous **anthropology of freedom**. Human **freedom** is not an independent capacity but the creaturely correlate of God’s justifying **grace**. The **imago Dei** is a relational predicate realized in **communion**, not a metaphysical substrate. Ethics follows as the practice of freedom grounded in **truth**. Because God justifies the **ungodly**, the church must maintain a distinctive solidarity with the **godless**, a public presence where justification’s social shape becomes visible in practices of **reconciliation**, **forgiveness**, and **truth-telling**. Here Jüngel offers a constructive bridge from **dogmatics** to **ethics**, powered by the same dual commitments to **revelation** and to **language** as truth-bearing event.

#### 8. Christology and Trinity: identity in differentiation
Throughout, Jüngel’s **Christology** and **Trinitarian theology** unfold the axiom that **God is love**. The **immanent** and **economic** Trinity coincide because in **Jesus Christ** God is who he is: **Father** who sends, **Son** who is sent and returns, **Spirit** who effects the participation of the many in the one. The **extra Calvinisticum** is honored to the extent that the Son’s divine identity is not swallowed by history, yet Jüngel is adamant that divine identity is accessible only in the **history of Jesus**, which is the **self-interpretation** of God. The unity of God is not a static monad but the unity of **self-related love**. This bears fruit in a grammar of **self-differentiation** in unity that avoids both modalism and tritheism by anchoring all divine process in the **event** of **reconciliation**. Thus **Trinity** is not an abstract appendix but intrinsic to the **gospel**; likewise **Christology** is not a christomonist reduction but the cruciform mediation of the triune **mystery**.

Here Jüngel also refines the **analogia relationis**. Because God is love, there is a genuine though asymmetrical correspondence between divine **communion** and human **community**. This correspondence is not **ontological continuity** in the **analogia entis** sense, but the free gift of **participation** by the **Spirit**. The church’s sacraments, especially **baptism** as incorporation into Christ’s death and life, become the enacted metaphor in which the new **ontology** of the justified is publicly given. Dogmatically, this offers a distinct way to speak of **sanctification** without eclipsing **justification**: holiness is the **truth** of the justified life, not a second blessing added to acquittal but the creaturely form of being made **true**.

#### 9. Interlocutors, reception, and influence
Jüngel’s proximate conversation partners include **Barth**, **Bultmann**, **Ebeling**, **Fuchs**, and the philosophers **Heidegger**, **Hegel**, **Feuerbach**, and **Nietzsche**. Against **Bultmann**, he refuses existential reduction by safeguarding **dogmatics**; with **Ebeling**, he prizes **language** as the locus of encounter; with **Barth**, he defends **sola gratia** and the primacy of **revelation**, sharpening Barth’s phrase **Gottes Sein ist im Werden** into a systematic thesis of **Trinitarian** ontology. He debated Catholic proponents of the **analogia entis**, especially in light of **Erich Przywara**, while he engaged Protestant contemporaries such as **Pannenberg** and **Moltmann** on **history**, **hope**, and **truth**. His influence in Germany was consolidated by his long tenure at **Tübingen** from 1969, where he served as professor and later as rector, and by the dissemination of major works in English, notably **God as the Mystery of the World** and **God’s Being is in Becoming**.

Reception has been complex. Many Lutheran and Reformed theologians welcomed his elevation of **justification** as dogmatic center and his refusal of **natural theology**. Philosophically minded theologians hailed **metaphorical truth** as a way past sterile verificationism. Critics, however, have queried whether **being as event** threatens the classical doctrines of **simplicity** and **immutability**, or whether the emphasis on **language** shades into constructivism. Still others have wondered if **ontological justification** risks confusing **forensic declaration** with **ontological infusion**. Jüngel generally replies that his event-ontology protects divine **freedom** by refusing to bind God to creaturely categories, and that **forensic** and **ontological** belong together because God’s **word** does what it says. Nonetheless the debates mark the point where his **dialectical** method presses traditional metaphysical habits to a decision.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: strengths and tensions
From a classical **Reformed** vantage, Jüngel’s achievements are considerable. His insistence that **revelation** rules **reason**, his principled rejection of the **analogia entis**, his cross-centered **Trinitarian** concentration, and his elevation of **justification of the ungodly** offer salutary correctives to both liberal **theism** and thin pragmatism. His stress on **metaphorical truth** is a mature way to honor **Scripture’s** thick grammar, and his attention to **death** and **nothingness** clarifies the eschatological weight of the **gospel**. Yet several tensions remain. First, the axiom **God’s being is in becoming**, even carefully qualified, risks softening **divine simplicity** and **immutability** by making God’s **identity** too directly coextensive with redemptive history. Classical **Reformed** doctrine prefers to say that God’s *opera ad extra* manifest who God is **without change**, secured by the **archetypal-ectypal** distinction and the **extra Calvinisticum**. Second, Jüngel’s **ontological justification** rightly resists moralism but blurs the **forensic**-ontological distinction that protects **imputation** as sheer **grace**. A Reformed alternative would anchor the **new creation** ontology in **union with Christ** and **Spirit-wrought sanctification**, while preserving justification as purely **forensic** benefit. Third, the wholesale rejection of **natural theology** may forfeit what the **Reformed** tradition has carefully retained under **covenantal** and **eschatologically qualified** forms of **general revelation**, giving an account of **knowledge of God** that respects **noetic** effects of sin while still affirming a real **theater of God’s glory**. Finally, Jüngel’s privileging of **language** can underwrite a robust realism when tethered to **God’s speech**, but it needs explicit metaphysical ballast to avoid sliding into **linguistic idealism**. In sum, a Reformed reception can gratefully receive Jüngel’s **theologia crucis**, his **Trinitarian** evangel, and his critique of **theism**, while tempering his event-ontology with **concursus**, **immutability**, and the **forensic** grammar of **justification** within a full **covenantal** economy.
