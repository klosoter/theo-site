### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and analytic evangelical method
Steven B. Cowan emerges in the milieu of late twentieth-century **evangelical philosophy**, when the **analytic turn** in Anglo-American thought created new bandwidth for rigorous **philosophy of religion** and renewed **natural theology**. Working in evangelical colleges and ministerial contexts, including Southeastern Bible College in Birmingham in the early 2000s, Cowan situates his work inside the institutional life of the **Evangelical Philosophical Society** and journals like **Philosophia Christi**, where essays on **apologetic method**, **religious pluralism**, and **epistemology** are debated. His setting is not an ivory tower abstraction but the pragmatic classroom and church seminar, where **method** in apologetics has existential stakes. Against the backdrop of postmodern suspicion of **metanarratives** and a resurgent analytic defense of **theism**, Cowan frames apologetics as an interdisciplinary task undergirded by **classical theism**, informed by **Reformed epistemology**, and alert to the **noetic effects of sin**.

Cowan’s approach is best described as **principled eclecticism** in apologetic method. He neither canonizes a single method nor collapses differences among **classical apologetics**, **evidentialism**, **cumulative-case reasoning**, **presuppositionalism**, and **Reformed epistemology**. Instead he pursues an integrative posture that seeks to maximize the strengths of each while minimizing their liabilities under the conditions of contemporary **analytic discourse**. The burden of his editorial work and essays is to secure space for both **arguments for God** and **proper basicality**, for both **worldview-level transcendental critique** and **historical evidences** for the **resurrection** of Jesus. Cowan’s key intuition is that the biblical story justifies manifold warrants for belief under the *ordo cognoscendi*, while the unity of truth in God ensures coherence at the *ordo essendi*.

The intellectual context is also shaped by the post-Humean reevaluation of **natural theology** and the Plantingian reconfiguration of **religious epistemology**. Cowan leans into the recovery of the **cosmological**, **teleological**, and **moral arguments**, often engaging the **Kalam cosmological argument** popularized by **William Lane Craig**, while taking seriously **Alvin Plantinga’s** accounts of **properly basic belief** and the **sensus divinitatis**. Within this framework, Cowan resists a false dichotomy between **evidence** and **faith**. He stresses that because of the **noetic effects of sin**, apologetics requires both the **internal witness of the Spirit** and responsibly marshaled public reasons. The result is a methodological map that counsels charity and triage rather than intramural polemics.

#### 2. Five Views on Apologetics as a disciplinary map
The most visible crystallization of Cowan’s contribution is the edited volume **Five Views on Apologetics** in 2000. The book gathers leading representatives to present and critique five families of method: **classical apologetics** by **William Lane Craig**, **evidentialism** by **Gary R. Habermas**, **cumulative-case apologetics** by **Paul D. Feinberg**, **presuppositionalism** by **John M. Frame**, and **Reformed epistemology** by **Kelly James Clark**. Cowan’s editorial hand is not merely curatorial. In the introduction and conclusion, he organizes the taxonomy with unusual clarity, marking differences of epistemic starting point, argumentative strategy, and role of **Scripture** in **public reason**. He underscores contrasts like **deductive a priori** grounding in classical method versus **abductive coherence** in the cumulative case, as well as debates over the status of **properly basic belief** vis-a-vis **natural theology**.

Two features of Cowan’s synthesis are decisive. First, he frames apologetics in terms of layered warrants: **prolegomenal theism** can be defended by **cosmological**, **teleological**, and **moral** considerations, while **Christianity’s particular claims** are then argued from **historical evidence** such as the **resurrection**. Second, he distinguishes between **perspectival differences** and **incommensurable contradictions** among the views. Cowan’s analysis allows that **presuppositionalism** and **classical apologetics** may often be doing complementary work at different points in the dialectic. For instance, the **transcendental argument** that critiques the preconditions of intelligibility aligns with the classical insistence on **metaphysical first principles** like **non-contradiction** and **causal realism**. Conversely, Cowan warns that confusions arise when **Reformed epistemology’s** criticism of evidentialist foundationalism is taken to imply that **public evidences** are theologically suspect. His conclusion commends **methodological modesty** and context-sensitive deployment of the available repertoire.

This mapping has shaped syllabi and pastoral practice because Cowan presents the options with fairness and analytic rigor. By placing **Frame** and **Clark** in direct conversation with **Craig**, **Habermas**, and **Feinberg**, he helped normalize cross-pollination among schools often separated by denominational and institutional boundaries. The book’s enduring value lies in its canonical taxonomy and in Cowan’s insistence that apologetics serves the unity of the **gospel** rather than partisan allegiance to a single **school**.

#### 3. The Love of Wisdom and evangelical philosophy
In **The Love of Wisdom: A Christian Introduction to Philosophy** in 2009, coauthored with **James S. Spiegel**, Cowan turns from mapping apologetic methods to articulating a full-spectrum **Christian philosophy**. The volume traverses **logic**, **epistemology**, **metaphysics**, **ethics**, and **philosophy of religion**, consistently articulating a realist **correspondence theory of truth**, a moderate **foundationalism** chastened by **Reformed epistemology**, and a theistic **metaphysics** marked by **classical attributes** like **aseity**, **simplicity**, and **immutability**. Throughout, Cowan and Spiegel negotiate the space between Plantinga’s critique of classical **foundationalism** and a commitment to **public rationality** in the academy.

In the **epistemology** chapters, Cowan highlights **properly basic belief** in God’s existence via the **sensus divinitatis** while also defending the rational availability of **natural theology** under normal cognitive conditions. The tension between **semina fidei** and **theologia naturalis** is handled by a two-tier account of warrant: doxastic practices can be **proper** apart from discursive arguments, yet arguments can play a vital role in **defeater-defeater** strategies in secular contexts. In **metaphysics**, Cowan emphasizes **creation ex nihilo**, the **creator-creature distinction**, and **causal powers**, positioning Christian metaphysics against reductive **naturalism**. In **ethics**, he anchors moral realism in the **divine nature** and sketches versions of the **moral argument** that link objective values to **theistic** grounding. These chapters operationalize the analytic virtues that mark Cowan’s wider oeuvre: clarity about terms, attention to argument forms, and a reverent deference to **Scripture** as cognitive norm under the *analogia fidei*.

The final section on **philosophy of religion** consolidates Cowan’s apologetic posture. He assesses the **problem of evil**, canvassing **free-will defenses** and **skeptical theism**, and he weighs positions on **divine providence** including **Augustinian-compatibilism**, **Molinism**, and **simple foreknowledge**, insisting on **exhaustive divine omniscience** against **open theism**. Even where Cowan refrains from dogmatic settlement among orthodox options, he articulates criteria shaped by **biblical sovereignty**, **human responsibility**, and the **trustworthiness of God**. The net effect is an evangelical handbook for graduate-level study that is both **analytic** and **catechetical**.

#### 4. Religious diversity, exclusivism, and the public square
A recurrent strand in Cowan’s essays is engagement with **religious pluralism** and the rationality of **exclusivism**. Drawing on **Acts 4:12** and **Romans 1**, he argues that **soteriological exclusivism** is compatible with **general revelation** and common-grace insights across traditions, while still maintaining the necessity of **Christ’s mediation** and the integrity of **gospel proclamation**. Against pluralist proposals that relativize doctrinal claims in the name of interfaith harmony, Cowan contends that **truth** is irreducibly **correspondent** and that contradictions across religious systems are not overcome by appeals to **mystery**. His analytic case presses for clarity about **salvific necessity**, **epistemic access**, and **culpable ignorance**, and he makes frequent use of **defeater** terminology to explain how the **gospel** can overturn default **pluralist** assumptions in the academy.

Cowan’s interaction with **John Hick’s** pluralism and with **inclusivist** proposals inside evangelicalism tends to emphasize two themes. First, that **revelation** is the principium cognoscendi of theology and thus the norming norm for soteriological claims. Second, that **public reason** can and should test generic theistic assumptions through **natural theology**, so that Christian claims are not insulated from or reduced by secular criteria but rather engaged through a coherent **worldview**. This line of argument shows Cowan’s dual fidelity to **Scripture** and to **rational discourse** as a matter of discipleship in the public square.

#### 5. Arguments for God and the shape of classical theism
In his apologetic surveying, Cowan consistently defends the value of the family of **theistic arguments**. He treats the **Kalam cosmological argument** as a powerful entrée into discussions of **cosmology** and **causal finitism**, then pairs it with a **Leibnizian contingency argument** aimed at **sufficient reason** and the **existence of a necessary being**. He deploys the **fine-tuning argument** within the **teleological** tradition, carefully parsing multiverse hypotheses and probabilistic reasoning, and he advances the **moral argument** as a bridge to divine **goodness**, **normativity**, and **personal agency**. The point is never that any single argument compels assent in isolation, but that a **cumulative-case** displays an inference to the **best explanation** of the total evidence of experience and history.

Regarding **classical theism**, Cowan usually adopts and teaches the traditional **attributes** while registering contemporary debates about **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **timelessness**. He registers analytic clarifications that stave off caricature, such as distinguishing **pure actuality** from mere **immutability** and parsing **impassibility** as freedom from being acted upon rather than absence of **affections**. In this way, his work reflects an evangelical retrieval of **Augustinian** and **Thomistic** themes, mediated through analytic tools and responsive to recent criticisms from theistic **personalists**. The end is a God worthy of worship whose **aseity** grounds the order of being and knowing.

#### 6. Human freedom, providence, and evil
In the knotty debates on **providence** and **human freedom**, Cowan’s posture is pedagogical and adjudicative. He regularly delineates options: **Augustinian-compatibilism** emphasizing **divine sovereignty**, **Molinism** invoking **middle knowledge** to reconcile **libertarian freedom** with **providence**, and **simple foreknowledge** that refrains from middle-knowledge claims but affirms **omniscience**. He subjects **open theism** to sustained critique on exegetical and philosophical grounds, arguing that it imperils **omniscience**, **providence**, and **trust in divine promises**. When addressing the **problem of evil**, Cowan makes room for both **free-will defenses** and **greater-good theodicies**, and he uses strands of **skeptical theism** as a local undercutter for inferences from horrendous evils to atheism. The result is a calibrated response that foregrounds the **cruciform** pattern of redemption while maintaining robust **metaphysical theism**.

This treatment coheres with his larger mediating task. Cowan’s goal is not to resolve every intra-evangelical dispute but to clarify the conceptual space such that students and pastors can see how commitments about **freedom**, **causality**, and **knowledge** interact with doctrines like **creation**, **providence**, and **eschatology**. He urges that apologetic engagement with evil must be paired with ecclesial practices of **lament**, **prayer**, and **diaconal care**, because the apologetic task is carried out by the **church** in the presence of the suffering.

#### 7. Scripture, reason, and the shape of persuasion
A distinct emphasis in Cowan’s work is the calibration of **Scripture** and **reason** in persuasion. Drawing from **Reformed epistemology**, he regards **belief in God** and **the gospel** as capable of being **properly basic**, given the **Spirit’s internal testimony**, even while he defends the utility of **arguments and evidences** to remove **defeaters** and illuminate the **rationality** of faith. This dual-aspect account is not a compromise with **neutral rationality** but an instance of what he calls due regard for **creational rational order** under the authority of **revelation**. Thus, a **presuppositional** insight about the impossibility of neutrality is combined with a **classical** insistence that **logic** and **metaphysics** are common goods accessible to creatures made in the **imago Dei**.

Cowan remains wary of the rhetoric that pits **van Tilian** transcendentalism against **Thomistic** natural law, or that absolutizes **evidentialism** over against **fideism**. His repeated counsel is that arguments should be fitted to audiences and contexts, and that the apologist must cultivate **intellectual virtues** like **humility**, **courage**, and **charity**. In this way, the apologetic project is subordinated to **discipleship** and **mission**, and the worth of a method is finally measured by its service to **truth** and **love**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and ongoing significance
Cowan’s career threads him through debates with and among figures like **Craig**, **Habermas**, **Feinberg**, **Frame**, and **Kelly James Clark**, as well as the broader discussions catalyzed by **Plantinga**, **Wolterstorff**, **Alston**, and critics such as **William Hasker**. He appreciates **Craig’s** rigorous **classical method** while adopting **Plantinga’s** corrective to evidentialist **foundationalism**. He finds value in **Frame’s** **presuppositional tri-perspectivalism**, especially the focus on **lordship** and **covenant**, while maintaining that public **evidence** for the **resurrection** and **miracles** is not theologically out of bounds. His editorial and pedagogical voice is that of a moderator who knows that the next generation of apologists must be conversant with philosophy’s canon and Scripture’s canon alike.

Cowan’s significance persists because his work built a durable **taxonomy** and a habit of **charitable critique** that disciplines evangelical discourse. The categories of **classical**, **evidentialist**, **cumulative-case**, **presuppositional**, and **Reformed epistemology** methods are by now standard in classrooms and handbooks, in part because **Five Views on Apologetics** showcased them with analytic clarity. His teaching text **The Love of Wisdom** continues to seed cohorts of students who can argue with precision about **truth**, **warrant**, **causation**, and **God**. In an era of cultural polarization, Cowan’s irenic but firm advocacy of **exclusivism** and **public reason** offers a model for persuasive Christian witness.

In a final Reformed and WTS-style evaluation, Cowan’s **methodological eclecticism** is a strength when it refuses false dichotomies and honors the unity of **truth** under **revelation**, but it risks a muted account of the **covenantal antithesis** between belief and unbelief if **natural theology** is articulated without an explicit grounding in **covenant epistemology** and the primacy of **Scripture** as principium. A classical Reformed alternative would begin more explicitly with **revelation’s self-attesting authority**, treat **reason** as covenantally situated under **lordship**, and deploy **natural theology** as a ministerial, not magisterial, instrument in service to **general and special revelation**. Within that frame, many of Cowan’s insights about the **sensus divinitatis**, **defeater-defeaters**, and the value of a **cumulative case** would be retained, while the whole would be normed by **covenant**, **grace**, and **history** as the controlling categories for knowledge of **God** and his works.
