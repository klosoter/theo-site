### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Trevor J. Burke emerged as a **contemporary Evangelical** interpreter of **Pauline theology** precisely as **UK biblical studies** underwent two converging shifts: the consolidation of the **New Perspective on Paul** under figures such as **J. D. G. Dunn** and **N. T. Wright**, and the expanding use of **socio-scientific criticism** and **Greco-Roman social history** for New Testament exegesis. The result is a scholar who reads the apostle with serious attention to **ancient law**, **kinship systems**, and **household structures**, while remaining committed to the **evangelical confession of Scripture’s authority** and to a canonical **Trinitarian** horizon. Burke’s methodological posture is neither purely philological nor purely theological; it is a historically thick exegesis that leverages **lexical semantics** and **Greco-Roman legal sources** to argue that **adoption** is not a marginal trope but a central structuring metaphor in **Paul’s soteriology** and **ecclesiology**. In effect, his guiding thesis positions **huiothesia** and related **familial metaphors** as interpretive keystones for **Romans**, **Galatians**, and **Ephesians** in the 1990s–2010s debate over **law and grace**.

This methodological blend crystallizes in the insistence that Paul’s language of **Abba**, **sonship**, and **inheritance** must be read with sensitivity to **patria potestas** and **Roman adoption law**, without collapsing the material into simplistic proof-texting. The approach situates **God the Father**, **the firstborn Son**, and **the Spirit of adoption** within a cohesive narrative of status-transfer and identity-formation, thereby joining **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** to **mission**. Burke works with a restrained **biblical theology** rather than an expansive systematic construction, but the result is doctrinally suggestive for questions of **union with Christ**, **justification**, and **sanctification**, all refracted through the metaphor of **becoming sons** in the **oikos** of God.

#### 2. Adoption as an exegetical engine
The monograph **Adopted into God’s Family: Exploring a Pauline Metaphor** 2006 is Burke’s signature statement. He argues that **huiothesia** in **Romans 8.14–17**, **Galatians 4.4–7**, and **Ephesians 1.5** functions as an exegetical engine for **Paul’s gospel**, not an occasional ornament. Drawing on **Gaius, Institutes**, **Digest of Justinian**, and literary witnesses such as **Plutarch**, Burke reconstructs the legal matrix of **Roman adoption** as a status-conferring act under **patria potestas**, involving transfer from one **paterfamilias** to another, the cancellation of prior debts, and the securing of **inheritance rights**. He then reads Paul’s **Spirit of adoption** as the divine agent who effects this status transfer and ratifies it by enabling the filial cry **Abba, Father**, a theme that climaxes in **Romans 8** where adoption grounds both **assurance** and **eschatological hope** in the face of **suffering**.

A major polemical target is an overly exclusive reliance on **Jewish sonship** motifs or **exodus** paradigms to explain Paul’s filiation language. In dialogue with **James M. Scott** on **adoption and salvation history**, Burke argues that the **Greco-Roman legal** domain is not merely illustrative but constitutive for Paul’s metaphorics. While not denying Israel’s Scriptures, he insists that a comprehensive accounting of **huiothesia** must reckon with the legal-social logic of **inheritance** and **status-change** recognizable to mixed **Gentile-Jewish** assemblies in **Rome**, **Galatia**, and **Ephesus**. The result is a relational yet juridically patterned account in which believers, united to the **firstborn Son**, receive the **Spirit** as the **arrabōn** pledge of their eschatological **inheritance** and are thus constituted as **brothers and sisters** within the **household of God**.

#### 3. God the Father, Abba, and the Trinitarian frame
Burke devotes sustained attention to **God as Father** and to Paul’s use of **Abba** in **Romans 8** and **Galatians 4**, rejecting the sentimental reduction of **Abba** to the English daddy. Drawing on philological work aligned with figures like **C. E. B. Cranfield**, with cross-dialogue to **Douglas Moo** and **Gordon Fee**, he argues that **Abba** is a vocative of reverent intimacy, not childish informality. For Burke, the cry **Abba, Father** is christologically mediated and pneumatically enabled: only those indwelt by the **Spirit of the Son** can address the **Father** as sons, because this address presupposes incorporation into the **Son’s filial status**. The structure is irreducibly **Trinitarian** and informs both **assurance of salvation** and **prayer** as participation in the Son’s filial address.

Here the metaphor of **adoption** spans the **ordo salutis** and the **historia salutis**. It is enacted *ad intra* by the **Spirit’s** sealing and *ad extra* in the church’s familial life. The repeated insistence on **inheritance** integrates eschatology with the **already/not yet** tension: adoption is a present status and a future consummation that awaits the **redemption of our bodies**. Thus **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **eschatology** converge in the filial pattern of **Father-Son-Spirit**, a pattern Burke sees as embedded in Paul’s confessional habits as in **Ephesians 1** and **Romans 8–9**.

#### 4. From metaphor to social existence: family, kinship, and authority
Beyond the lexical and theological analysis, Burke tracks how **familial metaphors** structure Paul’s **pastoral authority** and communal norms. In essays and collections like **Paul and the Corinthians: Studies on a Community in Conflict** 2003, he highlights Paul’s self-presentation as **father** and even **mother** to the **Corinthians**, framing rebuke and reconciliation in the idiom of **household** and **sibling** relations. With dialogue partners such as **Joseph H. Hellerman** on the early church as family and **David A. deSilva** on **patronage**, Burke maintains that Paul’s ecclesiology reframes **patron-client** logics under the primacy of divine **paternity** and sibling **mutuality**.

These familial categories also shape Paul’s **missionary practice**. The creation of new **households of faith** across the **Mediterranean** was not simply the spread of ideas but the planting of kinship networks that reconfigure **status**, **loyalty**, and **ethos**. Ethical exhortations, including **household codes**, take on sharper contour as intra-family expectations of **honor**, **care**, and **mutual submission** under the **firstborn Son**. The rhetorical weight of calling believers **brothers and sisters** is thus not an epistolary convention but a sustained pastoral strategy that operationalizes **adoption** in congregational life.

#### 5. Mission studies and the family of God
The edited collection **Paul as Missionary: Realities, Strategies and Methods** 2011, produced with **Brian S. Rosner**, extends Burke’s theological commitments into the field of **Pauline mission**. The volume argues that Paul’s **apostolic vocation** binds together **gospel content**, **church-planting**, **suffering**, and **contextual wisdom**, with the **family of God** furnishing the social telos of mission. While conversant with empire-critical readings associated with **N. T. Wright** and subsequent scholarship, Burke’s interests lean toward clarifying what the **gospel** creates: households marked by **adoption**, **holiness**, and **mutual love** grounded in **Christ** and energized by the **Spirit**.

This focus positions **adoption** as missional plausibility structure. Converts enter a new **oikos** in which **inheritance** language relativizes civic **Romanitas** and ethnic **Judaean** boundary markers. In a conversation that also engages **Eckhard J. Schnabel** on mission and **John M. G. Barclay** on **gift**, Burke’s adoption-centered lens stresses the divine intent to form a translocal **family**. Mission is not merely the transfer of benefits but the incorporation into a filial identity that recasts status, allegiance, and ethical expectations.

#### 6. Adoption, justification, and union with Christ
Although Burke is not a systematician, **Adopted into God’s Family** repeatedly interfaces with discussions of **justification** and **union with Christ**. He resists the false choice between a **forensic** and a **relational** soteriology by showing that **Roman adoption** is both legal and familial. The believer’s new status is juridically conferred and relationally lived. This duality enables adoption to mediate between **justification** and **sanctification** without collapsing either. In dialogue with **J. D. G. Dunn** and the **New Perspective**, Burke appreciates the communal texture of **justification** while maintaining a classic **evangelical** emphasis on **faith in Christ** as the instrument of entry into the filial household.

At the same time, the adoption framework presupposes **union with Christ**, for only those who belong to the **firstborn Son** receive the **Spirit of the Son** and share in his **inheritance**. Adoption thus clarifies the shape of **participation**, grounding it in the **Son’s filial identity** rather than in an abstract mysticism. The result is a soteriology that is simultaneously **Trinitarian**, **covenantal**, and **ecclesial**, with **brotherhood** functioning as an ethical analogue of **union**.

#### 7. Backgrounds and their calibration: Jewish and Greco-Roman matrices
A recurring thread in Burke’s work is the calibration of **Jewish** and **Greco-Roman** backgrounds for Paul’s sonship language. While he grants the importance of **Abrahamic** promises and **exodus** traditions for Paul’s identity of the people of God, he contends that **huiothesia** as such is best illuminated by **Roman legal** practice under **patria potestas**, corroborated by sources like **Gaius** and the **Digest**. This insistence counterbalances the gravitational pull of a purely **salvation-historical** reading and gives concrete social legs to Paul’s talk of **inheritance**, **status**, and **transfer of allegiance**.

Burke’s judgment does not ignore **Israel’s Scriptures**. Texts such as **2 Samuel 7** and **Hosea 11**, and themes of **firstborn** and **inheritance**, are placed in dialectic with **Greco-Roman** adoption to form a bidirectional hermeneutic: Israel’s filial patterns are fulfilled in the **Messiah**, while the legal-social logic of **adoption** in the Roman world supplies the conceptual grammar by which **Gentiles** understand entry into the **family of God**. This balance allows Pauline **exegesis** to track the apostle’s mixed-audience rhetoric without erasing his **Jewish monotheism** or his **apocalyptic** commitments.

#### 8. Pastoral and ecclesial payoff: assurance, ethics, and identity
The pastoral payoff of Burke’s project is pronounced. In **Romans 8**, he reads **assurance** through the lens of **adoption**, insisting that the **Spirit’s witness** is not a private intuition but a filial cry that is ecclesially audible. Ethical exhortation likewise assumes a family frame: the **brothers and sisters** are to embody **mutual care**, practice **discipline**, and persevere as heirs-in-waiting. The language of **firstfruits** and **inheritance** anchors perseverance in eschatological hope rather than moralism. In congregational formation, he reframes leadership as **paternal care** after Paul’s model with **Corinth**, complicating modern democratic instincts with the ancient **oikos** template.

The ecclesial identity that results challenges both modern individualism and impersonal institutionalism. Conversion is a change of **household**. Baptism marks a transfer of **paternity**. Eucharistic participation enacts **sibling fellowship**. These lines show Burke’s instinct to read doctrinal loci through **familial metaphors**, with **adoption** offering a through-line across exegesis, theology, and ministry.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Burke’s elevation of **adoption** closely aligns with **Westminster Confession 12 Of Adoption** and the classic triad of **justification, adoption, and sanctification** within **union with Christ**. His insistence that **adoption** is both **forensic** and **familial** is a salutary correction to reductions that either moralize sanctification or privatize assurance. Strengths include the **Trinitarian** texture of **Father-Son-Spirit**, the ecclesial concreteness of **brotherhood**, and the eschatological sobriety of **inheritance** and **suffering**. Two tensions invite calibration. First, the foregrounding of **Greco-Roman legal adoption** can, at times, thin the texture of **covenant sonship** grounded in **Abrahamic promise**, **exodus deliverance**, and **Davidic firstborn** themes. Classical **federal theology** would integrate Burke’s legal-social insights with **federal headship** in the **last Adam** and the juridical reality of **imputation** in **justification**, ensuring that filial status arises from the **covenant of grace** administered in history. Second, while Burke rightly resists antitheses between **forensic** and **participatory** soteriology, a Reformed ordering would more explicitly anchor **huiothesia** in **union with Christ** as the fountainhead, with **justification** supplying the legal ground, so that the family metaphor does not drift into sociological constructivism. The constructive alternative is not a different doctrine but a different sequencing: adoption as a distinct benefit that blossoms from **union**, ratified by the **Spirit of adoption**, secured by **Christ’s righteousness**, and embedded in the **church** as the covenant household.
