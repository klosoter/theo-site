### ESSAY
Thomas H. McCall stands as a leading voice in contemporary **evangelical** dogmatics who marries **analytic theology** to **classical Nicene** retrieval while maintaining a distinct **Wesleyan-Holiness** and **Arminian** soteriology. Emerging at the turn of the twenty-first century, his work matured as analytic philosophers of religion and constructive theologians rediscovered **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **inseparable operations** in the wake of both **Barthian** and **social trinitarian** revisions. Teaching within flagship evangelical institutions and writing for both academy and church, McCall situates himself within a tradition that insists that **dogmatic clarity** should serve the **church's worship** and the **pastoral proclamation of the cross**. His signature thesis runs like a thread through his corpus: the **Trinity**, **atonement**, and **holiness** are best explicated by analytic rigor that is chastened by **conciliar orthodoxy** and ordered toward the **means of grace**.

McCall's method is self-consciously **sapiential** and **canonical**, yet it is unapologetically **metaphysical** in service to **classical theism**. In An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology, published in 2015, he defends **analytic theology** as an instrument for clarifying the **content of revelation** rather than a replacement for **biblical exegesis** or **confessional norms**. He commends conceptual tools like **modal reasoning** and **possible worlds** only insofar as they help specify the **logic of doctrines** such as **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**. He deploys the tradition's own grammar, for example *opera ad extra indivisa sunt* for **inseparable operations** and *ad intra* for **processions and relations**, and he insists that **metaphysical underdetermination** in Scripture is a hermeneutical invitation to **conciliar rule-guided** elaboration rather than to speculative novelty. This places McCall in a line of **Augustinian** and **Thomistic** retrievals that prize **homoousios**, **eternal generation**, and **processional taxis** as the principled constraints on constructive proposals.

The work that secured McCall's place in the modern trinitarian debate is Which Trinity? Whose Monotheism? published in 2010. There he navigates between **Latin** and **Social** trinitarianisms while testing the proposals of **Richard Swinburne**, **William Hasker**, and **Brian Leftow** against the **Nicene** heritage. He critiques **social trinitarianism** for diluting **monotheism** into a coalition of three centers of consciousness and underscores the risks to **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **inseparable operations** when divine will is multiplied. He resists identity maneuvers that treat the **persons** as parts or as merely modes, and he retrieves **perichoresis** and **eternal relations of origin** to safeguard both **unity and distinction**. His constructive argument binds the **one will** of God to the *homoousios*, maintains **eternal generation** and **spiration** as dogmatic poles, and upholds that **all divine actions** are the indivisible work of the **one simple God**, appropriated to the persons according to **taxis**.

If the Trinity is McCall's architectural framework, the cross is his testing ground. In Forsaken: The Trinity and the Cross, and Why It Matters, published in 2012, he confronts both academic and popular claims that the **Father abandoned the Son** on the cross, including the claim that **penal substitution** entails an **intratrinitarian rupture**. Drawing on **Psalm 22**, the **cry of dereliction**, and the **communicatio idiomatum**, he argues that the incarnate Son genuinely experiences **God-forsakenness** according to his **assumed human nature**, yet the **immanent triune life** remains unbroken. He resists any account that pits **divine justice** against **divine love**, appealing to **divine simplicity** to insist that **wrath** is the holy opposition of God's **love** to sin, not a separate attribute or a change in God's being. He critiques **Jürgen Moltmann** for collapsing **passibility** into the divine essence and pushes back on **Robert Jenson's** more speculative construals of **temporal God's own being** in the event of the cross. The result is a robust defense of **penal substitution within Trinitarian coherence**, rooted in **inseparable operations** and the **unity of will**.

McCall's fidelity to **Nicene** logic led him to a very public intervention in the 2016 debates over **Eternal Functional Subordination**. He argued that a claim of **eternal authority and submission** between Father and Son implies either **subordinationism** or a drift toward **tritheism**, since it threatens the **simplicity** and **unity of will** that are entailed by the *homoousios*. In essays and public statements, he contended that multiplying **wills** in God to secure **hierarchy** compromises **inseparable operations** and confuses **taxis** with **subordination**. By addressing the proposals of **Bruce Ware** and **Wayne Grudem**, while welcoming the assistance of **Kevin Giles** and other critics of EFS, McCall kept the focus on **conciliar norms**, especially **eternal generation**, and on the careful distinction between **eternal relations** and **temporal missions**. His case exemplified his broader strategy: reassert **classical trinitarian** commitments with **analytic clarity** to discipline contemporary doctrinal projects.

The constructive scope of McCall's project also includes the doctrine of sin and sanctification. In Against God and Nature? The Doctrine of Sin, published in 2019, he renders **original sin** as a reality that is at once **privation** of due good and **rebellion** against **divine law**. He appropriates **Augustinian** and **Reformed** insights into **total depravity**, yet he calibrates them by a **Wesleyan** emphasis on **prevenient grace** that liberates the will for **cooperant obedience**. He engages **Romans 5** on **Adam-Christ** solidarity and argues for **imputed guilt** only through an account of **federal representation** that is ordered to **Christ's recapitulation**. He resists both **Pelagian** reduction and **fatalistic determinism**, and he stresses sin's **ontological disorder** as deformation of **created goodness**. The constructive arc here aims at the **theosis of sanctification**, that is, participation by grace in **Christ's holiness**, framed by the **means of grace** and a robust doctrine of **ecclesial formation**.

While McCall is unabashedly **Arminian** in soteriological instincts, he is equally explicit in his rejection of **open theism** and **process theism**. His contributions on **providence and prayer** defend **divine foreknowledge** and **meticulous providence** ordered by holy love, while maintaining **libertarian freedom** as meaningful within a created order upheld by **divine concursus**. He rejects the claim that **future contingents** limit God, arguing instead for the **asymmetry of creator and creature** grounded in **aseity** and **simplicity**. He is wary of **Molinism** as a master key and instead commends a modest metaphysic of **simple foreknowledge** coupled to **wise governance**, thereby avoiding a reduction of **providence** to **counterfactual bookkeeping** and keeping pastoral focus on **petitionary prayer** and **trust**.

McCall's evangelical resourcement extends to the sources of **Arminian** theology. In Jacob Arminius: Theologian of Grace, published in 2012 with **Keith Stanglin**, and in After Arminius, published in 2020 with **Stanglin**, he retrieves **Arminius** and later **Remonstrant** trajectories as serious **catholic** proposals, not mere foil to **Reformed** identity. He demonstrates that **Arminian** commitments to **unlimited atonement**, **conditional election**, and **prevenient grace** were intended to safeguard **divine goodness** and **sincere gospel offers**, while remaining within **Nicene-Chalcedonian** orthodoxy. In this historical work, he also critiques caricatures of **Arminianism** as semi-Pelagian, showing instead a kind of **Augustinian synergy** that emphasizes the primacy of **grace** in **conversion** and **holiness**. His historical judgment and constructive instincts converge in a distinctively **Wesleyan** doctrine of **sanctification** that appropriates **theosis** as a participatory grammar for the **Christian life**.

A consistent note throughout McCall's work is the integration of **analytic precision** with **pastoral utility**. He uses the tools of **conceptual analysis** to fortify **catechesis** and **preaching**, for example by clarifying that **impassibility rightly construed** protects rather than undermines the **depth of divine compassion**, or by showing that **inseparable operations** strengthens confidence in the **triune God's saving work**. The unity of doctrine and doxology appears in his insistence that **Trinitarian** grammar is not a speculative overlay but the condition of possibility for **evangelical proclamation** of **Christ crucified and risen**. He aims to heal the breach between **academic theology** and **churchly practice** by making **classical doctrines** appear as the very grammar of **gospel comfort**.

McCall's collaborative posture in the wider guild of **analytic theology** strengthens this program. He co-edited Philosophical and Theological Essays on the Trinity in 2009 with **Michael Rea**, placing **systematic theologians** and **philosophers** in critical conversation over **relative identity**, **Latin trinitarianism**, and **social models**. He interacts constructively with **Oliver Crisp** on **Christology** and **atonement**, with **Fred Sanders** on **Trinity and mission**, and with **Barth** scholars over the risks of **christomonism** and the promise of **theological exegesis**. This interdisciplinary conversation keeps his commitments to **classical theism** supple, resisting rationalist overreach while rejecting anti-metaphysical sentimentality.

McCall's most durable contribution is the demonstration that **evangelical** theology can be robustly **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** without abandoning a missionally attuned **Wesleyan** piety. He shows how **divine simplicity** disciplines talk about **atonement**, how **inseparable operations** purifies the proclamation of the **cross** from fantasies of **tritheistic moralism**, and how **prevenient grace** can be stated without surrendering **grace's primacy**. The result is a body of work that presses for **doctrinal coherence** across loci and for a spiritually potent **dogmatics** that can sustain **catechesis**, **worship**, and **mission**.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, the evaluation is grateful yet guarded. McCall's robust defense of **Nicene trinitarianism**, **eternal generation**, **simplicity**, and **inseparable operations** is a genuine achievement, and his critique of **Eternal Functional Subordination** aligns closely with **classical Reformed** commitments to the **unity of the divine will** and the **indivisibility of divine action**. His parsing of **penal substitution** without **intratrinitarian rupture** and his retrieval of **impassibility rightly construed** strengthen the **doctrine of God** and **atonement** against modern distortions. Points of tension arise where his **Arminian** construal of **libertarian freedom**, **prevenient grace**, and **unlimited atonement** undercut **covenantal monergism**, **effectual calling**, and **particular redemption**, thereby loosening the tight coordination of **decree**, **covenant of grace**, and **union with Christ** that characterizes **Reformed orthodoxy**. His preference for **simple foreknowledge** over **decretal compatibilism** may also soften the note of **meticulous providence** central to **Reformed** piety and assurance. A Reformed alternative would press **asymmetric dependence** all the way down, locating human freedom within **federal headship**, **effectual vocation**, and **Spirit-wrought faith**, while affirming McCall's best insights on **Trinity**, **cross**, and **classical theism** as necessary guardrails for evangelical dogmatics.
