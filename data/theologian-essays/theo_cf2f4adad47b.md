### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and method under Reformed confessionalism
Peter A. Lillback emerges as a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose work lives at the intersection of **historical theology**, **systematics**, and **pastoral practice**. Trained within the orbit of the **Westminster Standards**, he absorbed a method that insists on **sola Scriptura** while cultivating disciplined retrieval of **sixteenth and seventeenth-century sources**. His vocational arc as **Presbyterian minister** and as **president of Westminster Theological Seminary** from 2005 positioned him to integrate classroom, pulpit, and institutional leadership, a triad that frames his scholarly concerns. Methodologically, he models the close reading of **Calvin’s Latin** and the thick description of **Reformed scholastic development**, resisting simplistic genealogies. The signature of his method is a retrieval of **foedus** and **testamentum** as durable biblical-theological scaffolding, tethered to **confessional orthodoxy** and oriented to the church’s catechesis in **law, gospel, and sacrament**. In this he stands adjacent to voices like **Richard A. Muller** on continuity, appreciative yet critical of revisionist theses from **R. T. Kendall** or **Brian Armstrong**, and attentive to the WTS idiom shaped by **Van Til’s analogical knowledge**, **Vos’s biblical theology**, **Murray’s covenant formulations**, and **Kline’s ancient Near Eastern treaty models**.

Lillback’s epistemic stance is self-consciously **confessional**, yet it is not a naive biblicism. He situates **Calvin** within late medieval and Renaissance currents, the reciprocal mediation of **exegesis** and **doctrine**, and the emergent **federal theology** of the later Reformed orthodox. The goal is not antiquarianism but the retrieval of **covenant** as an architectonic category for **assurance**, **obedience**, and **ecclesial order**. His writing cadence is that of a pastor-scholar, pressing the scholastic **distinctiones** to serve proclamation, catechesis, and the cure of souls. As an institutional leader at **WTS**, he elevated **confessional fidelity** and **ministerial formation**, joining historical rigor to the **duplex beneficium** of **justification and sanctification** in **union with Christ**.

#### 2. Context and controversy: Calvin and the federal turn
The immediate historical backdrop for Lillback’s main project is the twentieth-century debate over **Calvin versus the Calvinists**, a family of theses that alleged deep discontinuity between **Calvin** and later **Reformed scholasticism** on **predestination**, **assurance**, and **covenant**. Figures like **Kendall** and **Gerrish** argued that post-Calvin orthodoxy displaced Christocentric assurance with decretal introspection, framed **law and gospel** more legalistically, and imported novel **bi-covenantal** schemas. In contrast, **Muller** and a cohort of revisionists contended for substantive continuity, insisting on the organic development of **federal categories** from **Calvin** through **Ursinus**, **Olevianus**, **Perkins**, **Turretin**, and **Witsius**. Lillback’s thesis aims squarely at this contested field. He claims that **Calvin** is not a bystander but a decisive agent in the rise of **covenant theology**, and that his mature corpus displays a robust and pervasive use of **foedus** and **testamentum** that is architectonic for his soteriology and ecclesiology.

This context also includes internal **Reformed** deliberations on the **covenant of works**, **republication** in the **Mosaic economy**, and the function of the **third use of the law**. Within the WTS tradition, **John Murray** hesitated to use the phrase **covenant of works** while retaining its substance, whereas **Meredith Kline** accented **treaty forms** and a typological **works principle** in Israel’s land tenure. Lillback’s approach is relational and oath-centered, emphasizing God’s self-binding in **oath** and **promise** as the ground of assurance and obedience. He thereby positions his retrieval to mediate between scholastic precision and pastoral usefulness, contending that **Calvin’s federal grammar** already harmonizes **law and gospel** in **union with Christ** through the **duplex beneficium**.

#### 3. The Binding of God: thesis, sources, and argument
Lillback’s flagship monograph, **The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology** 2001, states its thesis with clarity: **Calvin** develops a sustained doctrine of **foedus** that is neither incidental nor merely terminological, and this doctrine meaningfully prepares the way for later **federal orthodoxy**. The work surveys the **1559 Institutes**, the **Catechisms**, and key **commentaries** and **sermons**, especially the **Deuteronomy sermons**, to show the density and distribution of **covenant** language. Lillback argues that **Calvin’s hermeneutics** gives **diathēkē** a dual register, translated as **testamentum** to stress testamentary promise and as **foedus** to highlight mutuality and public obligation, a duality that grounds both **assurance** and **sanctification**. God’s **oath** binds him ad extra, not by metaphysical necessity but by free **grace** condescending in **covenant**, while believers are bound *ad homines* in fidelitas under the **third use of the law**.

The monograph’s lexical analysis is matched by theological synthesis. Lillback traces **Calvin’s duplex beneficium** of **justification** and **sanctification** to **union with Christ** as the inner logic of the **covenant of grace**, and he finds an inchoate **pactum salutis** in Calvin’s trinitarian account of the mission of the Son under the **Father’s will**. While he resists attributing a fully formed **bi-covenantal** system to Calvin, he contends that Calvin’s exegesis of **Romans 5** and **Galatians 3** sets real precedent for the later **covenant of works**. The upshot is a portrait in which Calvin’s covenant theology is not foreign import but organic core, anticipating **Ursinus** and **Olevianus** and providing conceptual footing for **Turretin** and **Witsius**. The payoff for theology and piety is the centering of **oath-bound promise** for assurance and the sanctifying force of **covenantal law** as gracious rule for redeemed life.

#### 4. Calvin’s covenant architecture: law, gospel, and sacrament
On Lillback’s reading, **Calvin** aligns **law and gospel** within the **covenant of grace** by deploying the classic **usus legis**. The **first use** convicts, the **second** restrains civilly, and the **third use** instructs the justified in gratitude. This is not moralism. It is **covenantal gratitude** grounded in **justification by faith alone** and the sealing of **sacraments** as **signa et sigilla**. Lillback underscores Calvin’s robust **sacramental realism**, particularly in the **Lord’s Supper**, where **union with Christ** mediates the **duplex beneficium** by the Spirit’s *virtus*. The **oath** motif reappears in sacramental theology, since **baptism** is both divine pledge and human vow. The covenantal oath, joined to the sacramental seal, heightens assurance by focusing faith on **God’s promissio**, a move that answers **Kendall’s** charge that later Reformed assurance fixated on decree rather than Christ.

Lillback also highlights Calvin’s federal reading of redemptive history. The **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, **Davidic**, and **New Covenants** are not competing dispensations but progressive administrations of the single **covenant of grace**. The **Mosaic economy** bears a fierce pedagogy and a typological **law-works** arrangement in the civil sphere, yet soteriologically it remains gracious in its sacrificial and promissory structures. Here Lillback sees seed-form for later debates about **republication**, but he insists Calvin’s emphasis lies on continuities that orbit **Christ** as the substance, **fides** as the instrument, and **Spiritus** as the efficient cause of participation.

#### 5. Oath, assurance, and the pastoral telos of federal theology
The leitmotif of Lillback’s Calvin retrieval is **oath-bound grace**. God’s **self-binding** in **foedus** through **promissio et iusiurandum** provides an objective grammar for **assurance**, anchoring faith in God’s sworn word rather than in the oscillations of introspective experience. Against modern psychologized accounts of assurance, Lillback retrieves the Reformed impulse to direct doubting consciences to **Christ extra nos**, made present by the Spirit in the **Word and sacraments**. This pastoral theology is structured by the **duplex beneficium** in **union with Christ**, by the **third use of the law** as the path of grateful obedience, and by a doctrine of the **church** as the covenant community under ordained **ministry**.

The teleology is ecclesial as well as individual. Lillback stresses catechesis in the **Ten Commandments**, the **Apostles Creed**, and the **Lord’s Prayer** as the canonical grammar of covenant life. He resonates with **Ursinus’s** catechetical method and sees in **Olevianus’s** schema a bridge from **Calvin** to later **federal orthodoxy**. The effect is to present **covenant** not as scholastic scaffolding but as the living form of the Christian life, where **law**, **gospel**, and **sacrament** weave together assurance, obedience, and worship. This nexus, he argues, refutes the myth that **covenant theology** necessarily undermines **grace**, instead showing how **promise-bound law** magnifies both the gratuity of salvation and the holiness of the saved.

#### 6. Public theology and history: Washington, providence, and liberty
Though primarily a **Reformation** scholar, Lillback also labored in **American religious history** through **George Washington’s Sacred Fire** 2006 and follow-up essays like **Wall of Misconception** 2008. Here the theological categories of **providence**, **oath**, and **public virtue** shape his argument that **Washington** was no deist cipher but a statesman whose vocabulary of **Providence**, **duty**, and **oaths** cohered with Anglican and broadly **Reformed** Christianity. He canvasses **primary sources**, including addresses, circular letters, and private correspondence, to reframe the debate over the **Founders** and to ground a Christian account of **religious liberty**. The core claim is not that the early republic was a confessional theocracy, but that its project of liberty was intelligible within a **covenantal** and **providential** moral universe.

This historical work expresses a theological instinct. Lillback’s emphasis on **oath** in **covenant** becomes a lens for **civil society**, framing **law**, **authority**, and **conscience** within divine **providence**. His public theology thus joins **natural law** reflection with a Reformed accountability to Scripture, suggesting a principled space for Christian engagement in pluralistic contexts. The hermeneutical pivot remains the same: God binds and equips, and human agents vow and act in gratitude and duty. In this way, the covenantal imagination can cross from **ecclesiology** to **civitas** without collapsing the two kingdoms or erasing confessional boundaries.

#### 7. Institutional leadership and pedagogy at Westminster Theological Seminary
As **president of Westminster Theological Seminary** beginning in 2005, Lillback stewarded an institution defined by **confessional integrity**, **biblical theology**, and **pastoral training**. His leadership, visible in **presidential addresses** and curricular priorities, sought to keep **systematic theology**, **exegesis**, and **church history** mutually informing. Theologically, he held together the insights of **Vosian** biblical theology and **federal orthodoxy**, resisting both a flattening biblicism and a detached scholasticism. Under his tenure, WTS continued its emphases on **Van Til’s presuppositional apologetics**, **Murray’s soteriology**, and the debates surrounding **Kline’s covenant constructs**, while articulating a pastoral center in **union with Christ** and the **ordinary means of grace**.

Pedagogically, Lillback promoted retrieval for proclamation. He regularly commended **catechesis**, **psalmody**, and sacramental practice framed by **covenant** logic, and he urged fidelity to the **Westminster Confession of Faith** in a contemporary register. The push was toward ministers who could articulate **law and gospel** as covenantal friends, articulate **assurance** from **oath-bound promise**, and shepherd congregations in the rhythms of **word, sacrament, and prayer**. This institutional voice amplified the scholarly message of **The Binding of God**, namely that **covenant theology** is the grammar of Reformed piety and mission.

#### 8. Interlocutors, developments, and lines of critique
Lillback’s reading of **Calvin** is in constructive conversation with **Muller**, **Bierma**, and **Beach**, who similarly stress continuity, though with differing accents on sources like **Bullinger** or **Olevianus** as proximate catalysts of early **federal theology**. Against **Kendall** and **Armstrong**, he insists that **assurance** in Reformed orthodoxy coheres with **Christ-centered** promise and the **Spirit’s testimonium**, mediated by **Word and sacrament**, and thus does not devolve into decretalism. With respect to **Turretin** and **Witsius**, he affirms the mature codification of **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and **pactum salutis**, while carefully noting that **Calvin** does not present these in scholastic form. Later debates over **republication** in the **Mosaic covenant** find in Lillback a cautious reader who privileges **Calvin’s** accent on the unity of grace while acknowledging typological complexity in Israel’s polity.

A measured critique arises at the level of historical precision and constructive balance. The strength of Lillback’s **oath** motif can risk marginalizing other drivers of **Calvin’s** system such as **divine simplicity**, **autotheos**, and the **extra Calvinisticum**, though he does not deny them. His tendency to read forward from **Calvin** to **orthodoxy** is mostly warranted by lexical and structural evidence, yet the danger of **anachronism** remains if later **bi-covenantal** clarity or the full **pactum salutis** is too readily backfilled. When engaging **public theology**, his appeal to **providence** and **natural law** could be sharpened with **Van Til’s** critique of autonomy and with **Kline’s** intruded-eschatology that relativizes national projects. On intra-Reformed covenant debates, his emphasis on unity and oath could be complemented by **Kline’s** insight into typological **works** principles, or by **Murray’s** careful reluctance regarding the term **covenant of works**. In Reformed and WTS terms, the net evaluation is positive: Lillback’s retrieval of **Calvin as a federal theologian** strengthens **confessional** assurance, catechesis, and sacramental practice, while inviting ongoing correction from classical **Reformed orthodoxy** on **revelation’s principium**, the law-gospel dialectic in **redemptive history**, and the relation of **nature and grace** in public life.
