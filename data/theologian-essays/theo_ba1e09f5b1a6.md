### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
D. G. Hart emerges as a contemporary Reformed historian-theologian whose central thesis is that **confessional Protestantism**, ordered by the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and articulated in the **spirituality of the church**, best safeguards both the church’s identity and the believer’s life in the *saeculum*. Formed within circles shaped by **J. Gresham Machen** and the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, Hart’s approach is deliberately historical and ecclesial rather than speculative, privileging the ordinary disciplines of Word, sacrament, and discipline as theologically determinative. The intellectual setting of late twentieth-century **American evangelicalism**, riven by the **culture wars** and marked by a persistent **civil religion**, provides his foil. From the 1990s forward, Hart narrates a genealogy of American Protestantism in order to recover **Old School Presbyterianism** and to critique the amorphous category of **evangelicalism**. His method is a confessional-historical retrieval: the doctrine and practice of the church’s **ordinary means of grace** interpret the past and norm the present. This method underwrites Hart’s insistence on **two kingdoms** as an Augustinian and Reformed grammar for Christian political modesty, and funds his suspicion of parachurch activism that eclipses the **visible church**.

Hart’s epistemic stance is deliberately modest. He differentiates the theological knowledge of God’s saving work, ordered by **special revelation**, from prudential judgments in the common realm, ordered by **general revelation** and **natural law**. Without offering a speculative **natural theology**, he grants that the *lex naturae* equips citizens to act together in the **civil kingdom** apart from ecclesial authority. That differentiation, which he sometimes names with the older Reformed contrast between *regnum potentiae* and *regnum gratiae*, resists both ecclesiocracy and sacral nationalism. The result is a public theology of restraint, anchored in **confessionalism**, not in an expansive **world-and-life view** that risks colonizing every sphere with explicitly redemptive rhetoric.

#### 2. Evangelicalism under historical judgment
Hart’s early work, especially **Defending the Faith: J. Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America** (1994), frames his lifelong argument. Reading Machen as a principled defender of **confessional Presbyterianism** against the merging pressures of cultural **modernism** and revivalist **evangelicalism**, Hart depicts **Old Princeton** not as reactionary but as catholic and churchly. The crisis that expelled Machen from the **Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.** and birthed the **OPC** is interpreted as the decisive moment when confessional churches refused an ecumenism of minimal doctrine and maximal activism. The **Westminster Standards** become, in Hart’s narration, not a sectarian fence but the scaffolding for genuine catholicity. This reading sets his trajectory: a defense of the **spirituality of the church** against movements that collapse gospel ministry into national reform or ecclesial identity into parachurch strategy.

That trajectory is amplified in **That Old-Time Religion in Modern America** (2002), **The Lost Soul of American Protestantism** (2002), and **Deconstructing Evangelicalism** (2004). Hart subjects the category **evangelicalism** to historical deconstruction, interrogating the **Bebbington quadrilateral** as an analytic tool that abstracts from church order, creeds, and sacramental practice. He argues that the rise of a trans-denominational evangelical identity, forged in mass revivalism and parachurch networks, entailed the loss of Reformed **confessional identity**. The Old School–New School split reappears as a structural contrast between a churchly **means-of-grace piety** and a voluntarist **activist piety**. For Hart, the latter generated both **fundamentalism** and postwar **neo-evangelicalism**, traditions that share a functional ecclesiology where the parachurch defines mission while the church supplies volunteers.

#### 3. Liturgy, catechesis, and the ordinary means
The book **Recovering Mother Kirk: The Case for Liturgy in the Reformed Tradition** (2003) extends Hart’s argument from history to practice. He contends that a truly **Reformed liturgy**, governed by the **regulative principle of worship** and concentrated on Word and sacrament, trains believers to live as pilgrims whose political and cultural acts are penultimate. The priority of preaching, baptism, and the Supper as **ordinary means of grace** is not a devotional niche but the church’s public witness. Against both **consumerist worship** and confected liturgical eclecticism, Hart retrieves a dialogical order rooted in Scripture, creeds, and **psalmody**. This ecclesial profile is inseparable from the **spirituality of the church**: the church as church does not legislate economic policy or cultural taste; it proclaims **law and gospel** and administers discipline. Theologically, the ecclesial focus demarcates the **visible church** as the locus of Christ’s special rule, a claim Hart correlates with the classic Reformed distinction between **church power** and **civil power**.

The insistence on catechesis and form is deliberate. For Hart, the **Westminster Shorter Catechism** and the **Directory for Public Worship** supply the architecture for a resilient Christian life amid late-modern fragmentation. The purchase is twofold: it resists **civil religion** by refusing patriotic liturgies, and it resists **transformationalism** by anchoring Christian identity in Christ’s appointed ordinances. Here the theological center of gravity is ecclesiological, and the ethics that follow are liturgically formed rather than politically orchestrated.

#### 4. Two kingdoms and the secular commonwealth
In **A Secular Faith: Why Christianity Favors the Separation of Church and State** (2006), Hart turns most explicitly to political theology. He contends that a Reformed rendering of **two kingdoms** neither privatizes faith nor advances theocracy; rather, it recognizes Christ’s universal lordship while distinguishing the modes of his rule as *regnum gratiae* in the church and *regnum potentiae* in the saecular commonwealth. The upshot is a principled affirmation of a **secular state** as a prudential regime where citizens deliberate by lights available through **general revelation** and **natural law**. Hart criticizes **theonomy** and **Christian Reconstruction** for conflating Israel’s theocratic polity with post-Pentecost nations, and he presses **neo-Calvinist** transformationalism for promising a redemptive social theory that lacks New Testament warrant and tends to inflate the church’s public voice beyond its charter.

The political argument reappears in **From Billy Graham to Sarah Palin: Evangelicals and the Betrayal of American Conservatism** (2011), where Hart indicts **evangelical conservatism** for instrumentalizing religion in service of partisan aims, thereby eroding both Christian witness and conservative prudence. His alliance with **David VanDrunen** and the broader **two kingdoms** retrieval is clear, though Hart’s register remains historical and ecclesial rather than dogmatic. He reads **Westminster Confession** 23 on the magistrate as authorizing civil order for justice and peace while forbidding ecclesial capture. Behind the polemic lies a pastoral claim: the church’s holiness is compromised when it baptizes the platforms of either Left or Right.

#### 5. Calvinism as global confession and contested identity
With **Calvinism: A History** (2013), Hart broadens his lens. He narrates **Reformed Protestantism** as a global, confessional tradition that produced churches, catechisms, and schools, not simply a worldview or a reform movement within evangelicalism. The book’s emphasis falls on ecclesial forms, **confessions** from **Heidelberg** to **Westminster**, and the complex regional trajectories of Dutch, Scottish, Swiss, and American Calvinists. Hart presses against a romantic **Calvin**-centered historiography by attending to institutional continuities and discontinuities over five centuries. The thread of **confessionalism** remains, however, and the argument culminates in the claim that Reformed identity has always been anchored in churchly documents and disciplines, never only in cultural programs.

His smaller biographies and essays, such as **John Williamson Nevin: High Church Calvinist** (2005) and **Still Protesting: Why the Reformation Still Matters** (2018), add texture. Nevin’s **Mercersburg** retrieval of catholicity becomes a way for Hart to commend ecclesial depth within **Calvinism**, correcting both **low-church biblicism** and pragmatic **evangelicalism**. In Still Protesting, he doubles down on **Reformation** distinctives, arguing that Protestantism’s enduring gift is not a program of democracy or capitalism but the **justification of the ungodly** and the consequent re-formation of worship and ministry. The doctrinal accent falls on **sola fide**, **Word and sacrament**, and the **visible church** as Christ’s appointed polity.

#### 6. Conceptual grammar: spirituality of the church and the common realm
Conceptually, Hart stabilizes his project through the twinned categories of **spirituality of the church** and **two kingdoms**. The spirituality doctrine, indebted to **Old School Presbyterianism** and sharpened by figures such as **James Henley Thornwell** and **Charles Hodge**, claims that the church as institute is limited to those ends Christ ordained: preaching, sacraments, and discipline, the care of souls, and moral instruction from Scripture. That doctrine is not quietistic; it produces an intense pastoral and liturgical seriousness. The **two kingdoms** distinction then supplies the corollary for Christian citizenship: Christians act as neighbors in the **civil kingdom** by prudence, persuasion, and compromise, rather than by confessional fiat. Hart’s vocabulary often invokes the older Augustinian contrast between the pilgrim **city of God** and the temporal **earthly city**, translated into Reformed idiom as *regnum gratiae* and *regnum politicum*. The civil realm is common, not neutral; it is providentially ordered by God’s **common grace** yet not administerially ruled by the church.

This grammar yields a particular stance toward **civil religion** and **American exceptionalism**. Hart sees both as theological temptations that yoke the church’s worship and ethics to national myths. He insists that the **Westminster Confession** does not license a sanctified nationalism but, when read in its full seventeenth-century context and with its American revisions, limits the magistrate’s religious role and protects the church’s independence. The line between the kingdoms is permeable for persons but firm for institutions: believers live one life **coram Deo**, yet the church and the state possess distinct offices, sanctions, and ends.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
Hart’s work is a running argument with **evangelicalism**, **neo-Calvinism**, and sacral politics. With **Abraham Kuyper** he shares a high doctrine of **providence** and respect for institutional pluralism, yet he resists the expansion of **sphere sovereignty** into a comprehensive **world-and-life** program for redemptive cultural transformation. He contends that modern Kuyperians sometimes collapse the **antithesis** into cultural maximalism and that they obscure the Reformed church’s historical liturgical and confessional core. Figures like **Tim Keller** and **Peter Leithart** become foils of different sorts: Keller as a savvy Kuyperian apologist whose public theology remains activist, Leithart as a neo-Constantinian theologian of **baptismal politics**. Hart’s rejoinder is steady: the New Testament authorizes the church’s ministry, not a Christianized civilizational project.

With **theonomists** and **Christian Reconstructionists**, Hart disputes the moral hermeneutic that would transpose Israel’s civil law into modern codes, defending a Reformed use of **natural law** under **general revelation**. With **George Marsden** and **Mark Noll**, Hart shares historical instincts and a critique of evangelical anti-intellectualism, yet he presses further by declaring **evangelicalism** a sociological coalition that should not function as a theological identity. His constructive allies are often implicit: **Machen** stands as patron saint of **confessional Protestantism**, **Old Princeton** demonstrates a catholic and rigorous Reformed orthodoxy, and contemporary scholars like **David VanDrunen** offer a more dogmatic statement of **two kingdoms** that complements Hart’s historical case. Through it all, Hart keeps the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** in view as a test case for a churchly Protestantism that resists capture by the culture wars.

#### 8. Doctrine in practice: ecclesial holiness and lay vocation
One of Hart’s most persistent themes is that doctrine becomes credible in practice through the **ordinary means of grace**. The focus on **regulative worship**, **catechesis**, and **discipline** is not antiquarian but pastoral. By shaping Christians as hearers and receivers before they are activists or culture-makers, the church gives them the virtues needed for their many callings. In Hart’s frame, **vocation** is the theological linchpin for relating faith to the common realm: Christians serve neighbors in the crafts of law, medicine, business, and politics without ecclesial authorization for redemptive transformation. This aligns with classic Reformed teaching on **vocation** and **providence**, underscores a positive role for **prudence**, and keeps the gospel’s **justifying** center from becoming a political platform.

The corollary is a guarded but genuine affirmation of the **secular**. Hart’s **A Secular Faith** insists that a constitutional order not bound to confessional theology can be the best friend of the church’s freedom. He reads the American revisions to **Westminster Confession** 23 as a theologically coherent adaptation that secures liberty for the church’s ministry and forbids civil coercion in matters of conscience. In this register, a secular order is not a rival soteriology but an arrangement of common life under God’s **providence** that leaves room for the church to be the church.

#### 9. Strengths, limits, and enduring contribution
Hart’s enduring contribution is to restore **confessional Protestantism** as a full-orbed ecclesial project against the flattening effects of **evangelicalism** and the overpromises of **transformationalism**. Historically, he succeeds in showing how **Old School Presbyterianism** provided a coherent alternative to voluntarist activism, how **Machen** represents catholic breadth rather than sectarian narrowness, and how **Reformed worship** can be both simple and weighty under the **regulative principle**. Theologically, his articulation of **two kingdoms** and the **spirituality of the church** establishes principled limits that protect both gospel proclamation and the integrity of civil society. His global survey in **Calvinism: A History** re-centers churchly forms and confessions as the true carriers of Reformed identity. Whether addressing **civil religion**, **theonomy**, or **neo-Constantinian** experiments, Hart’s basic counsel is the same: give the church back its own voice, and let Christian citizens shoulder their public responsibilities without baptizing their prudence.

At the same time, Hart’s polemical edge invites probing. His deconstruction of **evangelicalism** risks underestimating the genuine theological work done inside that coalition by figures who sought a thicker Protestant orthodoxy. His suspicion of **neo-Calvinism** sometimes treats **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace** as inevitably expansionist, whereas earlier Dutch Reformed sources also deploy them to restrain ecclesial inflation. And his reliance on **natural law** as a lingua franca for the civil realm raises questions about its practical accessibility in a fragmented late-modern culture. Yet even these tensions function as a summons to deeper reflection on the grammar of **nature and grace**, the meaning of **Christ’s kingship**, and the vocation of Reformed churches in pluralist societies.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Hart’s achievement is salutary in its recovery of **confessionalism**, its ecclesial seriousness about the **ordinary means of grace**, and its principled articulation of **two kingdoms** and the **spirituality of the church**. These emphases stand firmly within classical Reformed orthodoxy and correct the ecclesial amnesia of much **evangelicalism**. The primary tension arises in the calibration of **nature and grace**. If the line between *regnum potentiae* and *regnum gratiae* hardens into parallelism, the result can blunt the **antithesis** that **Van Til** and the **Westminster Standards** locate at the level of heart-religion that pervades every calling **coram Deo**. A more integrative alternative, still classical, retrieves the **magisterial Reformed** use of **general revelation** and **natural law** for common life while interpreting them under the covenantal lordship of the **mediatorial Christ** who rules all history for the church. That alternative preserves Hart’s ecclesial modesty and his critique of **civil religion**, yet it grants a more positive account of Christian intellectual and cultural labor as a penultimate fruit of **common grace** ordered by **special revelation**. In short, Hart rightly fences the church’s ministry and demythologizes political messianism; Westminster’s task is to affirm those fences while refusing any dualism that would mute the comprehensive claims of **revelation** and **covenant** over the believer’s life in the world.
