### ESSAY
Mitchell L. Chase is a contemporary **evangelical biblical theologian** whose work pursues the unity of Scripture through **figural fulfillment** and the **christotelic** shape of the canon. Teaching in the ecosystem of **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary** and serving as a local church pastor in Louisville, his scholarship stands at the intersection of **academic retrieval** and **pastoral theology**. In a period shaped by the long shadows of **historical criticism**, the renewal of **typological** interpretation by figures like **G. K. Beale** and **Richard B. Hays**, and a growing interest in **patristic exegesis**, Chase develops a hermeneutic where **divine authorship** and **progressive revelation** secure the coherence of the **biblical storyline**. The resulting profile is a consistent emphasis on **resurrection hope**, a sober account of **the fall**, and a careful delineation of **typology and allegory**, all rendered in accessible prose that nonetheless argues for rigorous **canonical** controls.

Chase’s method is anchored in the claims of **Scripture’s inspiration and inerrancy** and the doctrine of **single divine and multiple human authorship**, which together warrant a **sensus plenior** that is discovered not constructed. He describes the canon as a teleologically ordered whole, **christotelic** in that it aims at Christ as its telos while preserving the integrity of **historical-grammatical exegesis**. The controlling categories are **progressive revelation**, **intertextual patterning**, and **covenantal structures** that generate typological correspondences across epochs. For Chase, **typology** traces historical patterns within the economy of God’s actions that reach **eschatological escalation** in Jesus Christ, while **allegory** is treated with a retrievalist caution, useful when tethered to textual signals and canonical usage. The decisive controls are the **divine authorship** that ensures coherence, the **canonical shape** that frames context, and the **apostolic hermeneutic** displayed in the New Testament’s use of the Old.

The intellectual ambience of his work draws upon both the **church fathers** and modern **biblical theology**. With **Origen** and **Augustine** he appreciates a spiritual sense, yet he aligns more closely with **Calvin’s literal-sense primacy** understood as reading the text in the fullness of its canonical horizon. From **Vos** and **Beale** he receives **redemptive-historical method** and the discipline of **typological escalation**, while **Hays** contributes categories of **figural reading**, **echo**, and **allusion**. With **Brevard Childs** he shares the commitment to canonical form as theological location. The result is not eclecticism but a principled synthesis: **literal sense** honored, **figural sense** retrieved, **divine intent** confessed, and **apostolic precedent** followed.

Chase’s 2020 volume, **40 Questions About Typology and Allegory**, is programmatic for his hermeneutics. He offers crisp definitions of **type**, **antitype**, **figure**, **pattern-prophecy**, and **allegory**, arguing that typology is not imaginative overlay but recognition of **providence-shaped correspondences** designed by the **divine author** and often signaled by **covenantal institutions** such as **temple**, **sacrifice**, **priesthood**, **kingship**, and **exodus**. He distinguishes typology from mere parallelomania by requiring historical grounding, textual indicators, and canonical verification, thus placing **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ as the moment of interpretive clarity. His treatment of **allegory** is a model of evangelical retrieval: he refuses an uncritical embrace of the **allegorical method** yet defends **allegorical readings** where the **New Testament** deploys them or where the **canonical pattern** constrains them, echoing the insistence that the spiritual sense must be rooted in the **literal-historical**. Here he engages **Origen** and **Augustine** appreciatively, warns against a free-floating **mysticism** of the text, and appeals to the **apostolic typology** of **Paul** and **Hebrews** as norms.

In **Resurrection Hope and the Death of Death** (2022), part of Crossway’s **Short Studies in Biblical Theology**, Chase advances a comprehensive account of **resurrection** as the climax of the **biblical storyline**. He reads the Old Testament as seeded with **resurrection hope** through promise and pattern: **Genesis 22** with **Isaac restored**, **Jonah’s descent and return**, **Psalm 16’s** assurance of the Holy One not seeing corruption, **Isaiah 25–26’s** swallowing up of death, **Ezekiel 37’s** enlivened bones, and **Daniel 12’s** awakening of many. The Gospels reveal Christ as the **firstfruits** and the **last Adam**, whose Paschal victory inaugurates the **new creation**. Paul’s **1 Corinthians 15** and **Romans 6** anchor the church’s **union with Christ** in death and life, yielding an ethic of hope and holiness. The volume’s thesis is that the resurrection is not an isolated miracle but the **eschatological engine** of redemption, the moment where **death dies** and creation’s destiny begins. Pastoral consequences include **baptismal identity** as participation in Christ’s resurrection, the sanctifying power of **future hope**, and the consolations of **creedal confession** in the **resurrection of the body**.

Chase’s 2023 book, **Short of Glory: A Biblical and Theological Exploration of the Fall**, supplies the necessary counterpart. He reads **Genesis 1–3** with the now widespread but carefully grounded thesis of the **Edenic temple**, where Adam serves as **priest-king**, entrusted with a vocation of sacred guardianship and royal expansion of sacred space. The **serpent’s deception**, **Adam’s federal headship**, and the **divine curse** yield exile and death, but not without **protoevangelium** in the **seed promise** of **Genesis 3:15**. Using **Romans 5:12–21** and **1 Corinthians 15**, Chase argues that humanity stands condemned **in Adam**, inheriting both **corruption** and forensic **guilt**, and that redemption comes **in Christ**, the faithful **second Adam**. He traces the outworking of the fall through the **primeval history**, the spread of violence, and the narrowing grace of election, all while attending to **covenant** as the structure that carries hope forward. The volume is doctrinally synthetic and pastorally urgent, clarifying **original sin**, **total depravity**, and the need for **penal substitution** and **resurrection life**.

Across these works the through-line is a high confidence in **Scripture’s unity** and a disciplined practice of **figural exegesis** within a **canonical horizon**. Chase organizes the canon by **covenantal epochs** whose institutions and narratives generate **typological trajectories** that converge on Christ. The **exodus** becomes the master-type of deliverance, completed in the **new exodus** of the cross and empty tomb; **Davidic kingship** is intensified in the **Messiah**, enthroned in resurrection; **sacrifice** terminates in the once-for-all offering, vindicated by **resurrection**; **temple** culminates in the **incarnate Son** and the **Spirit-indwelt church**, seen as **firstfruits** of the age to come. His is a model of **eschatological escalation**, where earlier patterns are neither annulled nor flattened but fulfilled at a higher key, consistent with apostolic appeals to **antitype** and **shadow-to-reality** contrasts in **Hebrews** and **1 Peter**.

Methodologically, Chase’s most significant contribution is the adjudication of **typology and allegory** with clear criteria and patristic sensitivity. He elevates **authorial intent** by differentiating between the **human author’s historical horizon** and the **divine author’s canonical horizon**, secured by inspiration. This allows genuine **sensus plenior** without collapsing into **reader-response** or unmoored symbolism. He identifies **textual triggers** for figural reading in narrative repetition, lexical echoes, structural parallels, and covenantal motifs, and he insists that **New Testament use of the Old Testament** provides normative exemplars for how such reading should proceed. The aim is not arbitrary ingenuity but recognition of **divine patterning** in history that the canon itself discloses. In short, hermeneutics is subordinated to **the economy of revelation**, and exegesis is measured by **canonical coherence** and **apostolic practice**.

Chase’s constructive theology therefore proceeds from hermeneutics to **Christology**, **soteriology**, and **eschatology**. In **Christology**, Jesus is the **last Adam**, the **true Israel**, the **greater David**, the **new temple**, categories that derive from **typological structures** embedded in Israel’s Scriptures. In **soteriology**, the cross and resurrection display a **penal-substitutionary** atonement whose efficacy is vindicated by the **resurrection**, which functions as both the Father’s verdict and the down payment of **new creation**. **Union with Christ** binds believers to the crucified and risen Lord, establishing a moral order of **sanctification** shaped by **resurrection ethics**. In **eschatology**, the resurrection inaugurates the **already and not yet**, with the Spirit as **firstfruits** and the church as a **pilgrim temple** awaiting consummation. These doctrinal trajectories are not treated in isolation but within the interwoven fabric of **canonical typology** and **christotelic fulfillment**.

Chase’s interlocutors are engaged with care and specificity. With **Hays**, he adopts **figural reading** while pressing for more explicit **canonical controls**. With **Beale**, he leans into **inaugurated eschatology** and **temple** typology. With **Childs**, he locates meaning in the **final form** of the canon. With **Origen** and **Augustine**, he mines the **spiritual sense** while delimiting it by **literal sense** and **apostolic precedent**. He resists hyper-criticisms that deny any predictive or figural coherence in the Old Testament and warns against a flattening literalism that refuses the **church’s rule of faith** as hermeneutical guardrail. His dialogical posture is that of retrieval through reform, convinced that the **apostolic hermeneutic** licenses, and the **church’s tradition** confirms, the responsible reading practices he commends.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation is largely positive, with clarifying cautions. The strengths are evident: robust **redemptive-historical hermeneutics**, principled **typology**, a high view of **divine authorship**, and a doctrinal center of **federal headship**, **penal substitution**, and **resurrection** that aligns with **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**. Two tensions invite attention. First, while Chase’s use of **sensus plenior** is disciplined, Reformed theology will insist that the spiritual sense is not a second sense but the fuller scope of the **literal sense** as determined by the canon and the **analogia fidei**. Care must be taken that **allegorical retrieval** never functions as an independent source of meaning but remains demonstrably grounded in **textual and covenantal** structures. Second, his exposition of the fall is warmly compatible with **covenant theology**, yet a more explicit articulation of the **covenant of works** would strengthen the federal architecture that undergirds **imputation** and **last Adam** Christology. Within these clarifications, Chase’s emphasis on **christotelic fulfillment**, **apostolic typology**, and **resurrection hope** stands as an exemplary evangelical contribution that Reformed readers can appropriate with gratitude and use as a bridge between **patristic spiritual exegesis** and **confessional redemptive-historical** practice.
