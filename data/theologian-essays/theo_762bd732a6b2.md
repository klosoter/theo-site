### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the liturgical turn
Teresa Berger emerges as a contemporary Catholic theologian whose work concentrates on **liturgy**, **gender**, and the **migration of worship** into global and digital spaces. Educated in the German-speaking academy and now teaching at **Yale Divinity School** and the **Institute of Sacred Music**, her formation is framed by **Vatican II** 1962–1965 and its enduring reconfiguration of Christian worship through **Sacrosanctum Concilium**. The conciliar wager that the Church would be renewed through the reform and active participation of the faithful in the **lex orandi** provides Berger with both her subject matter and her critical horizon. The collapse of a single Euro-Atlantic liturgical center, the dynamism of postcolonial **inculturation**, and the rise of **digital media** create the historical constellation within which Berger reads worship as a living, migrating, and contested practice. In this matrix, the classic question of **lex orandi lex credendi** becomes a problem of whose prayer counts as the Church’s prayer, how such prayer is mediated, and how it is remembered in the construction of **liturgical history**.

Her generative context is also the broader **liturgical studies** movement that turned from textual rubrics to embodied **ritual performance**. Influences such as **Catherine Bell** on ritualization, **Victor Turner** on liminality and communitas, and **Pierre Bourdieu** on habitus equip her to interrogate the social matrices of worship. Berger appropriates these tools to ask how gendered bodies are disciplined, authorized, and silenced within the Church’s rites, and how practices migrate across borders and media. This methodological turn is not merely descriptive; it is a theological claim that **sacramentality** is inseparable from **mediation**, that ritual participation inscribes and reveals **doctrine**, and that the theological historian must employ a disciplined **hermeneutics of suspicion and remembrance** toward inherited narratives.

#### 2. Method: historiography as theological intervention
Berger’s method integrates **historical-critical research** with **ritual theory** and **feminist theology** to produce what she names a gender-aware **liturgical historiography**. The wager of this project is that the apparent neutrality of liturgical history masks patterns of exclusion embedded in its sources and narrators. The archive itself is not innocent. Normative voices in official **ordo** collections, rubrics, and episcopal legislation frequently mute the practices of women, domestic devotions, and non-textual enactments. Berger reads these silences as theological data, not merely archival gaps. In effect, to write liturgical history is to engage in a discernment of **traditio** and **reception**, where what has been handed on was often mediated through male clerical gatekeepers. Under this lens, the maxim **lex orandi lex credendi** is prised open to reveal the contested politics of whose lex orandi has been permitted to signify the Church’s lex credendi.

Berger’s epistemic stance is a chastened realism about **ritual mediation**. Ritual does not transparently deliver divine realities; it mediates them through social bodies and cultural forms. This is not to deny **real presence** or sacramental efficacy but to insist that the Church’s recognition of sacramental **signa et res** operates under historically situated regimes of visibility and authority. Thus, she advances a dual hermeneutic of critique and retrieval: critique of gendered occlusions, and retrieval of forgotten or under-acknowledged practices such as women’s leadership in **monastic offices**, lay-led **domestic prayer**, and the liturgical agency of the **ordo virginum**. Such retrieval is not antiquarian. It aims at a re-narration of the Church’s worship that can sustain contemporary discernment on **authority**, **participation**, and **inculturation**.

#### 3. Lifting a veil: gender and the making of liturgical history
In **Gender Differences and the Making of Liturgical History** 2011, Berger offers her signature thesis: liturgical history, as typically told, is gendered in its sources, questions, and conclusions, thereby constituting a partial account of the Church’s **lex orandi**. She shows how the dominant narratives privilege episcopal and monastic male voices that codified rites, while marginalizing sacramental and para-liturgical practices that were normative in female religious houses, domestic spaces, and lay associations. The book’s metaphor of lifting a veil signals that what is obscured is not absent but socially rendered invisible. Case studies examine how medieval nuns shaped the **Divine Office**, how women’s confraternities mediated **Eucharistic devotion**, and how legal proscriptions paradoxically attest to female ritual leadership in certain locales. In each case, Berger maps the tension between prescriptive **rubrics** and descriptive **lived liturgy**.

The theological upshot is a chastened appeal to **tradition**. Berger argues that tradition is not a static deposit but an ongoing process of **reception** filtered through power-laden structures. A reform in the spirit of **Vatican II** requires not only textual reform but a re-memory of who has prayed and how. When the historical account expands, the theological horizon of **participatio actuosa** can be filled with more variegated faces and practices. Berger’s work thus reconfigures the conversation around **ordination**, **ministries**, and **authority**, not by projecting modern ideals into the past, but by reading the past with tools alert to gendered dynamics of inclusion and exclusion.

#### 4. Lex orandi, memory, and authority
Berger deploys the grammar of **anamnesis** to argue that liturgical memory is constitutive of ecclesial identity. If anamnetic remembrance is central to **Eucharist** and the **Divine Office**, then the Church’s collective memory of its worship must attend to those whose practices have sustained communal prayer across centuries. She refuses the dichotomy between official **rites** and unofficial **devotions** by showing their mutual permeability, particularly in women’s communities where office, lectio, and paraliturgical prayers braided a consistent pattern of sanctified time. Theologians such as **Gordon Lathrop** and **Aidan Kavanagh** insist that liturgy is primary theology. Berger extends this claim by insisting that primacy entails responsibility for the integrity and fullness of the **liturgical archive** itself. Authority in worship remains real, but legitimate authority must be accountable to the totality of ecclesial practice, including those documented only indirectly, in prohibitions, penances, or marginalia.

This reframing yields ecumenical implications. Traditions wrestling with **women’s ordination**, diaconal ministries, and lay-led prayer can find in Berger’s historiography not a proof-text but a more catholic canvas of worship. To acknowledge that the Church has often prayed in households, convents, and fields is to reckon anew with the breadth of the **communio sanctorum** and the distributed character of liturgical agency under the sovereignty of the **Triune God**.

#### 5. Worship on the move: liturgy in migration
As editor of **Liturgy in Migration: From the Upper Room to Cyberspace** 2012, Berger curates a conversation on the transnational circulation of ritual forms. The premise is that Christian worship has always migrated, as evidenced from Pentecost to the many vernaculars of the **Roman Rite**, and in the expansion of global **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** worship. Migration, both demographic and liturgical, exposes the insufficiency of center-periphery models. Berger’s framing claims that inculturation is a two-way traffic of **traditio** and **translatio**, in which diaspora communities negotiate between inherited forms and new contexts, producing hybrid liturgical grammars. The result is neither eclecticism nor rigid uniformity but what she and others call **glocal** liturgy, marked by fidelity and improvisation.

The theological stakes in migration are high. Questions of **authority** and **authenticity** must be worked out in relation to episcopal oversight, local habitus, and the eschatological catholicity of the Church. Berger argues for a pneumatological patience that allows **rites** to breathe across borders, while maintaining critical attention to power differentials that can coerce conformity or commodify local symbols. Here again, **lex orandi** is not a fixed script but a living discourse under the guidance of the **Spirit**, witnessed by the plurality of ecclesial bodies.

#### 6. Digital worlds: mediation, presence, and practice
Berger’s **@Worship: Liturgical Practices in Digital Worlds** 2018 advances the analysis of worship’s newest frontier: the **digital ecclesial sphere**. She catalogs and interprets practices such as live-streamed Eucharists, online **Liturgy of the Hours**, YouTube processions, prayer apps, and mediated pilgrimages. Her central claim is that digital practices are not unreal simulacra but genuine modes of **mediation** that can carry devotion, catechesis, and forms of communal **koinonia**. Liturgical theologians must therefore move beyond analog nostalgia to a theologically thick account of digital **sacramentality**. At the same time, Berger delineates theologically significant distinctions between devotional practices that translate well to online spaces and sacramental rites whose **material signa** entail embodied, gathered enactment.

On the contested question of digital Eucharist, Berger tends toward a cautious stance grounded in classical **sacramental ontology**. She highlights the centrality of a gathered assembly, the presidency of ordained ministry, and the integrity of the eucharistic action as a single **ritual whole**. Her argument does not simply repeat legal proscriptions; it analyzes the ritual density of sharing bread and wine and the ecclesiology implied by face-to-face assembly. Yet she also notes that liturgical life includes more than sacramental peaks. Digital prayer can intensify **daily office**, extend the reach of preaching and catechesis, and sustain dispersed communities in prayerful solidarity, especially for the sick and homebound.

#### 7. Pandemic accelerations and the domestic church
The 2020 pandemic accelerated all that **@Worship** had traced. Berger’s public work and essays during and after this period attend to the improvisational genius of the **domestic church**, the creative authority of parish clergy and lay leaders, and the emergence of hybrid assemblies. She reads these developments as a stress test for **ecclesiology**, revealing both the resilience of **tradition** and the fragility of narrowly institutional imaginations of worship. Theologically, she argues that recognition of digital mediations must be paired with renewed catechesis on **embodiment** and desire for the physically gathered **ekklesia**. The dialectic is not between real and unreal but between modes of **presence** and degrees of ritual adequacy to the Church’s sacramental ends.

Berger also highlights global disparities. Access to technology, differing public health regimes, and varied episcopal leadership patterns produced uneven liturgical responses. This demanded discernment about **authority** in crisis, subsidiarity, and the prudential wisdom of local communities. Her broader thesis remains: worship migrates across spaces and media, yet retains a core commitment to the **paschal mystery** enacted in Word and sacrament, a core that calls the Church back to embodied communion even as it learns to pray across screens.

#### 8. Interlocutors, influences, and constructive horizon
Berger’s interlocutors map the breadth of contemporary **liturgical theology**. From **Aidan Kavanagh** she inherits the conviction that liturgy is primary theology and the Church’s school of faith. From **Gordon Lathrop** she appropriates the grammar of structural symbolics, juxtaposition, and **ordo**. From **Catherine Bell** and **Victor Turner** she takes tools to analyze ritualization, habitus, liminality, and communitas. From **Judith Butler** she borrows attentiveness to the performativity of gendered bodies, reworked within a sacramental ontology that affirms the givenness of creation and the ecclesial discernment of **traditio**. Postconciliar debates on **inculturation**, **authority**, and **participation** provide her proximate field of reference, while classic Catholic accounts of **sacramentality** and **mediation** set doctrinal boundaries.

Constructively, Berger proposes a liturgical theology of memory and migration. Memory entails lifting the veil on **gendered omissions** in the archive to let the whole Church remember how it has prayed. Migration entails recognizing the **Spirit’s** work in the circulation and adaptation of rites across cultures and into the digital sphere. Both require a disciplined ecclesiology that can adjudicate authenticity without collapsing into uniformity or relativism. The future of **lex orandi lex credendi** in her account is genuinely catholic: pluriform, accountable, embodied, and mediated.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed perspective shaped by the **regulative principle of worship**, Berger offers both salutary correction and points of tension. Positively, her critique of androcentric **liturgical historiography** strengthens the Reformed insistence on the priesthood of all believers and the need to hear the whole **communion of saints**. Her attention to **lived liturgy**, the **domestic church**, and diasporic communities resonates with Reformed emphases on Word-centered household devotion and the diffusion of **vocation** across all of life. Her cautious account of digital **sacramentality**, distinguishing between truly ecclesial sacraments and edifying digital devotions, aligns with Reformed insistence that the **means of grace** are located in the gathered ministry of **Word and sacrament** under biblically regulated oversight. The tensions emerge where Berger’s hermeneutic of **traditio and mediation** risks making authority derivative of historical reception rather than primarily of **Scripture** as the norma normans. A Reformed alternative would insist that the canon’s own *ordo* governs the Church’s *usus*, and that visible catholicity flows from covenantal assembly rather than from a pluralist account of ritual **authenticity**. On the digital front, Reformed theology would sharpen the line further: while digital preaching and prayer may be providential helps, **sacraments** demand bodily gathering, a common table, and ordained ministry in situ as covenant signs and seals. Berger’s work nonetheless presses Reformed churches to reexamine their own histories for gendered omissions, to catechize congregations more robustly in the theology of **presence**, and to cultivate ministries that honor the Spirit’s ordinary operations through the instituted **means of grace** amid a migrating and mediated world.
