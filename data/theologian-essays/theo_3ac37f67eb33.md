### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Fleming Rutledge emerges as a preacher-theologian of the contemporary **Anglican** world, ordained to the priesthood in 1977 during the first wave of women ordained in the **Episcopal Church**, and forged in the pastoral crucible of New York City congregations during the waning of postwar **mainline Protestantism**. Her location matters: the pulpit stands at the intersection of **Scripture**, **culture**, and **public life**, so her theology is relentlessly homiletical, public-facing, and kerygmatic. With the postliberal retrieval of **Karl Barth** in the background and the Pauline turn toward **apocalyptic** signaled by **Ernst Kasemann** and **J. Louis Martyn**, Rutledge resists liberal moralism and therapeutic religion by insisting that the gospel names God's invasive judgment and rescue of a captive world. Her method is shaped by a robust **analogia fidei** rather than an **analogia entis**: the truth about God and the world is received from the apocalyptic unveiling of Jesus Christ, not extrapolated from nature or culture. This yields a figural reading of the canon in which **Isaiah**, **Romans**, **Galatians**, and **Revelation** interpenetrate, and a preaching habitus in which the cross interprets both text and times.

Rutledge's epistemic stance is declarative rather than speculative: the Word is announced as **euangelion**, not defended as a religious option among others. She is not constructing a systematic treatise on **divine simplicity** or **divine impassibility**, yet she consistently frames doctrinal claims with classical Christian anchors such as **Chalcedonian Christology** and **trinitarian** confession. Her rhetoric is apocalyptic and dramatic: history is a contested field patrolled by **Sin**, **Death**, and the **Powers**, and the church is summoned to witness to God's decisive invasion in the crucified and risen **Messiah**. This drama supplies an ontology of conflict rather than an anthropology of self-improvement. It presupposes a forensic register, but not a narrowly individualist one: lawcourt and battlefield belong together as metaphors under the primacy of **divine agency**.

#### 2. Major works as theological loci
Rutledge's corpus is best read through two capstones. First, The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ (2015), an expansive dogmatic-homiletical synthesis of **atonement** motifs under the sovereignty of the cross. Second, Advent: The Once and Future Coming of Jesus Christ (2018), a retrieval of **Advent** as the church's catechesis in eschatological judgment and hope. Around these stand earlier volumes of cultural preaching and seasonal sermons, notably The Bible and the New York Times (1998), The Undoing of Death (2002), The Battle for Middle-earth (2004), and Not Ashamed of the Gospel (2007). Across these works she persistently leverages **Pauline apocalyptic**, deploys **figural exegesis**, and organizes doctrine around the liturgical proclamation of **Christ crucified** and **Christ to come**. Her canvas is wide: **Anselm** and **Athanasius** are cited alongside **Gustaf Aulen** and **Barth**, the newspapers are read under the light of **Romans**, and even **Tolkien** becomes a grammar for **evil**, **hope**, and **eucatastrophe**.

In The Crucifixion, Rutledge argues that Christian proclamation must recover the objective scandal of **crucifixion** as the locus of God's retributive and restorative justice. She refuses both liberal reductions to **moral influence** and conservative reductions to a single penal mechanism. Instead she advances a layered account in which **substitution**, **representation**, and **Christus Victor** are integrated, with **penal** dimensions neither denied nor absolutized. The cross, she insists, is where **God's wrath** against Sin and the Powers is enacted for us and in our place, so that God might be both just and the justifier of the ungodly. The tone is Isaiah 53 and Romans 3 as much as Revelation 12: it is the **Lamb slain**, the **Judge judged in our place** in the Barthian idiom, the victory of the **Messiah** over cosmic adversaries.

#### 3. Apocalyptic deliverance and rectification
At the heart of Rutledge's soteriology stand two intertwined claims: the enslaving reality of **Sin as Power** and the primacy of **God's apocalyptic deliverance**. Following **Kasemann** and **Martyn**, she foregrounds Paul's proclamation that the righteousness of God is disclosed as an invasive rectification that liberates captives, not merely as a verdict that leaves the world unchanged. Her preferred English for δικαιοσυνη and δικαιωσις is often **rectification**, in order to hold together forensic acquittal and ontological new creation. This is not a collapse of justification into sanctification but a denial that God's verdict can be cordoned off from his creative act. The lawcourt metaphor needs the battlefield and the exodus. That is why the cross must be read with **Passover**, **Day of Atonement**, and **Suffering Servant** typologies, and why the drama of **Satan**, **Death**, and **the Powers** is indispensable to a fully Pauline vision.

Within this apocalyptic frame, **substitution** is not a legal fiction but the principle of the covenant representative. Rutledge is insistent that Jesus dies **for us**, **instead of us**, and **with us**, and that each preposition matters. Following **Barth** as mediated by **Jungel** and others, she uses the phrase **The Judge judged in our place** as a cruciform axiom. The penal is properly understood as the self-implication of God's love in judgment against sin's destructive reign. That protects **wrath** from caricature: **wrath** is not the opposite of love but its form in the presence of evil. Against some construals of **Rene Girard**, she rejects any account that would reduce the cross to exposure of scapegoating apart from objective reconciliation. Exposure is real, but victory and rectification are wrought by the Son's obedient death and the Father's vindicating resurrection. The effect is cosmic: **new creation** is not metaphor but the horizon within which the acquitted are also delivered and transferred into the kingdom of God's beloved Son.

#### 4. Advent, judgment, and hope
Advent: The Once and Future Coming of Jesus Christ (2018) is a countercultural catechism in **judgment** as the church's good news. Against the secular sentimentalization of December, Rutledge retrieves **John the Baptist**, **apocalyptic prophecy**, and the bracing language of **wrath and mercy** as one. The season of waiting is training in realism about **evil** and **the Powers**, precisely in order to foster durable hope that does not derive from human progress. Advent gathers **Isaiah** and **Revelation**, **Romans** and **Luke**, under the confession that the coming One is both the crucified **Lamb** and the reigning **Lord**, who will rectify all things. Here, too, her rhetoric is theological: **judgment** is not merely punitive but restorative; **hope** is anchored in the Parousia; **patience** is an ecclesial habit born of confidence in God's **apokalypsis**. The **already/not yet** tension is formative: believers wait not in vacancy but in the Spirit's down payment, tasting the powers of the age to come and protesting present injustice with eschatological protest.

This Advent theology interfaces with her homiletic insistence that sermons must name **wrath** as God's opposition to evil and **mercy** as God's purpose to save. She resists any attempted separation of the God of **Old Testament** judgment from the God of **New Testament** love, reading the unity of the canon christologically. The measure of divine judgment is the cross itself, where the Judge bears the judgment, and therefore the threat inherent in judgment becomes the birthplace of hope. This is not a softening of eschatology but its intensification. The church is schooled to pray, **Come, Lord Jesus**, not as an escapist wish but as the definitive plea for **rectification** in the face of **Death** and **corruption**.

#### 5. Pauline preaching: Romans and Galatians
The volume Not Ashamed of the Gospel (2007) collects sermons on **Romans** that display Rutledge's exegetical debts and theological instincts. She repeatedly accents the objective character of the **gospel** as God's message about what God has done, **extra nos** and prior to human response. Her preaching is galvanized by **J. Louis Martyn's** reading of **Galatians** and **Beverly Gaventa's** reading of **Romans**, both of which insist on the invasion of God's rectifying righteousness against **cosmic enslavers**. She is appreciative yet critical of **N. T. Wright's** emphasis on covenant membership and ecclesial boundary markers. Though she acknowledges the import of **Abrahamic** promises and **covenant** continuity, Rutledge fears that a primarily covenantal construal risks underestimating apocalyptic rupture, that is, the radical otherness of God's act in the cross and resurrection which creates a new reality. Hence her repeated appeal to Paul's use of **apokalypsis** language and to the pervasive agency of **the Spirit** who liberates from **Sin** and **Death**.

In this Pauline key, **justification** or **rectification** is the deliverance of the ungodly by the God who justifies the ungodly. It declares a new status and installs a new dominion. That is why Rutledge is drawn to metaphors that exceed the courtroom: **exodus**, **rescue**, **new creation**, **adoption**, and **transfer** of lordship. The forensic is never lost; it is taken up into a larger apocalyptic reality. The church thus becomes a sign of the coming world, not by exhibiting moral superiority, but by living out of **baptismal union** with Christ, confessing his lordship in the face of rival **Powers**.

#### 6. Culture, literature, and public theology
The Bible and the New York Times (1998) exemplifies Rutledge's commitment to the public square. The claim is not that Scripture simply endorses progressive causes, but that **Scripture** reveals the true plot of reality, by which the headlines are re-narrated. She brings **Isaiah** and **Paul** into contact with debates about **violence**, **capital punishment**, **racism**, **consumerism**, and the **market**. Her sermons reject civil religion while commending civic responsibility informed by the lordship of Jesus. The engagement with **Tolkien** in The Battle for Middle-earth (2004) is not a detour but an exercise in discerning how narrative can disclose the **nature of evil**, the possibility of **eucatastrophe**, and the fragile practice of **hope** amid disappointment. Literature becomes a parable under the greater story of crucifixion and resurrection.

Likewise, The Undoing of Death (2002) functions as a pastoral dogmatics of **mortality**, **resurrection**, and **hope**. Rutledge opposes any sentimental denial of death's terror, insisting on the concrete victory of **Christ's resurrection** as death's undoing. She also crafts reflective homilies on the **Seven Last Words** and Good Friday, returning again and again to the scandal that the world's salvation is accomplished in an instrument of Roman torture. Public theology for her is therefore homiletics extended: to preach Christ crucified is to oppose the **Powers** that enslave and to announce **freedom** for captives here and now, always as an anticipation of the final rectification.

#### 7. Doctrine of God, Christ, and the cross
Rutledge's doctrine of God is not worked out in scholastic loci, yet consistent features emerge: the God of **Israel** and the Father of **Jesus Christ** is one; divine **wrath** is the action of love against evil; and divine **mercy** is holy, not sentimental. She respects the tradition's insistence on the mystery of the **Trinity**, and her christology is robustly **Chalcedonian**. She draws on **Athanasius** to insist that only God can save and that the mediator must be truly God and truly man. This anchors her confidence that the cross is effective, not illustrative. In atonement she retrieves **Anselm** for the necessity of satisfaction, yet refuses to confine satisfaction to debt-payment apart from victory and representation. She thus tends to speak of the **vicarious obedience** of the Son and the **substitutionary** bearing of sin in ways that overlap with Reformed accounts, while retaining the **Christus Victor** horizon as irreducible.

Her treatment of the cry of dereliction, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me, is emblematic. She will not say the Trinity is divided, yet she permits the biblical language to do its work: the **Son** endures godforsakenness in solidarity with the godforsaken, so that the godforsaken might be brought home. Here the **Barthian** axiom about the Judge judged guides without dissolving the mystery. The result is a trinitarian shape to the cross in which the Father judges sin in the flesh of the Son and the **Spirit** raises the Son into the new age. The pastoral upshot is immense: no depth of human abandonment is beyond the **reach of God** who has gone there in Christ, and no depth of human guilt is beyond the judgment already borne at Golgotha.

#### 8. Church, sacraments, and Christian life
As an **Anglican** preacher, Rutledge displays confidence in the **means of grace** without over-specifying sacramental mechanics. **Baptism** marks incorporation into Christ's death and resurrection; the **Eucharist** proclaims the Lord's death until he comes. The church is an eschatological community, a pilgrim people sustained by word and sacrament, tasked with **witness** rather than cultural domination. She is alert to the temptations of moralism and activism: transformation follows proclamation, and ethics follows doxology. Yet she calls the church into public engagement, not as a rival sovereignty but as a sign of the coming sovereignty of God in **justice** and **mercy**. Her persistent attention to **wrath** keeps social justice from dissolving into sentiment; her attention to **mercy** keeps divine judgment from devolving into mere retribution. The theological ethic is cruciform and hopeful.

In pastoral register, Rutledge equips Christians to name the **Powers** that distort social and personal life, to avoid self-reliance masked as spirituality, and to live by the **Spirit's** power in concrete practices of patience, truth-telling, and forgiveness. She resists techniques for spiritual mastery in favor of a life lived under the **Word**, hearing the announcement of what God has done and will do in Christ. The liturgical year, especially **Advent** and **Holy Week**, becomes a school for desire, training the church to hope for a rectification not of its own making.

#### 9. Interlocutors and contested questions
Rutledge's interlocutors are chosen for their usefulness in preaching the **gospel**. From **Barth** she takes the kerygmatic confidence of divine initiative and the christological center of election and judgment. From **Kasemann** and **Martyn** she takes the primacy of **apocalyptic**, the notion that God's act is not continuous with human religious striving. From **Aulen** she receives the recovery of **Christus Victor**, while from **Anselm** she appropriates the gravity of sin and the necessity of satisfaction. With **N. T. Wright** she shares a conviction that the **Resurrection** is historical and world-shaping, but she challenges his covenant-membership emphasis when it seems to domesticate the shocking otherness of God's apocalyptic rectification. With **Douglas Campbell** she shares impatience for contractual soteriology, while maintaining a more traditional conviction about **wrath** and **judgment** than Campbell's construal often allows. With **Rene Girard** she shares a diagnosis of scapegoating, while insisting that exposure of scapegoating is not yet reconciliation without **substitution**.

These debates reveal the grain of her theology. She aims for a differentiated unity in atonement, a Pauline center of gravity in **rectification**, and a canonical imagination expansive enough to engage the newspaper without surrendering to it. Her judgments are evangelically motivated: what must be said in order for the crucified **Christ** to be preached as the power of God unto salvation today. The criterion is **kerygma** oriented toward **hope** under the sign of **judgment**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** vantage, including a Westminster Theological Seminary sensibility, Rutledge's work is a welcome ally on several fronts: her robust affirmation of **substitutionary atonement**, her refusal to mute **wrath** and **judgment**, her insistence on the primacy of **divine agency**, and her integration of forensic and cosmic dimensions under the sovereignty of the cross. Her retrieval of **Christus Victor** without abandoning **penal** elements coheres with older Reformed catholicity that affirmed multiple biblical images. Moreover, her pastoral proclamation of **Advent** judgment and **resurrection** hope is exemplary.

Tensions remain. First, her **apocalyptic hermeneutic** risks eclipsing the historic **covenant** through which God orders redemptive history, and so can obscure the federal structures, promises, and **imputation** patterns central to Reformed readings of **Romans** and **Galatians**. The language of **rectification** can flatten the necessary asymmetry in which the forensic verdict logically grounds and precedes transformative renewal, a point safeguarded in Reformed accounts of **union with Christ** by the duplex grace of **justification** and **sanctification** under distinct yet inseparable acts. Second, her figural **homiletics** sometimes under-specifies a doctrine of **Scripture** as verbally inspired and inerrant in the sense prized at WTS, raising questions about the interface between canonical exegesis and **grammatico-historical** method. Third, as an **Anglican**, her account of the **means of grace** and ecclesial authority leans toward a generous sacramentalism without the confessional precision found in Reformed standards. These tensions suggest not a rejection but an adjustment: a covenantal-apocalyptic synthesis in which the drama of the **Powers** is set within the promissory economy of **Abraham** and **Christ**, and in which **imputation** of Christ's righteousness as forensic ground secures the transformative scope Rutledge rightly champions. Within such a framework, her clarion proclamation of the crucified and coming **Lord** can be received with gratitude and sharpened for Reformed ministry.
