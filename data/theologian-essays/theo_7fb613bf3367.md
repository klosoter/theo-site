### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Keith L. Johnson emerges within the contemporary evangelical academy shaped by the post-1990s **Barth renaissance**, the ongoing Protestant-Catholic exchange over **analogy** and **nature-grace**, and evangelical retrieval of classical doctrine through **ressourcement**. His home base in **Wheaton College** situates him at a crossroads where churchly formation and academic reflection are held together, a posture that frames his emphasis on **dogmatics as discipleship**. Johnson reads **Karl Barth** and **Thomas Aquinas** against their caricatures, seeking a constructive path that honors confessional **Christocentrism** while taking seriously metaphysical questions that evangelical theology often avoids. The animating conviction is that theology is an ecclesial craft governed by **revelation** in Scripture, practiced under the **rule of faith**, and ordered to the sanctification of the people of God.

Johnson’s method is formally disciplined and materially Christological. Formally, he advances an ecclesial, interpretive **habitus** oriented by Scripture’s canonical sense and sustained by the practices of the church, as laid out programmatically in **Theology as Discipleship**. Materially, he treats **Christology** as the principled center for ontology and soteriology alike, a conviction he refines in conversation with **Barth’s analogia fidei** and with Roman Catholic discussions of **analogia entis**. This dual attentiveness yields a method that is neither biblicist nor rationalist but a mode of **dogmatic reasoning** that is confessional, analogical, and participatory. The axis of his oeuvre is thus the triad of **revelation**, **analogy**, and **participation**, each transposed into evangelical key.

#### 2. Karl Barth and the question of analogy
Johnson’s signature monograph, **Karl Barth and the Analogia Entis** (2010), offers a revisionist account of Barth’s famous rejection of the **analogia entis** advanced by **Erich Przywara** and received by Roman Catholic **ressourcement** theologians such as **Hans Urs von Balthasar**. Rather than rehearsing Barth’s sweeping dismissal, Johnson carefully distinguishes targets and terms, arguing that Barth’s No was trained on an account of natural theology that eclipsed the primacy of **revelation** and the freedom of God’s self-communication, not on the very possibility of **analogical predication**. By reconstructing Barth’s own **analogia fidei** as a theologically thick grammar of participation grounded in the history of **Jesus Christ**, he opens conceptual space for rapprochement. What Barth rejects, on Johnson’s reading, is an **analogy of being** conceived as a neutral metaphysical bridge; what he affirms is an analogical relation given in the event of **revelation** and secured by the Spirit’s gathering of the church into **Christ**.

This re-description accomplishes two things. First, it rescues Barth from a simplistic iconoclastic posture toward metaphysics, showing that Barth’s positive account of **participation** and **analogical language** presupposes divine **aseity** and a hard **Creator-creature distinction**, while insisting that knowledge of God is a gift of **grace** through **revelation**. Second, it challenges Protestants and Catholics to clarify whether their dispute concerns the order of **revelation** and **nature** or the content of **analogy** itself. Johnson’s constructive proposal is that an evangelical theology can affirm a Christologically specified **analogy** that neither collapses **nature** into **grace** nor posits a zone of autonomous **natural theology**. Here the contrast between **analogia entis** and **analogia fidei** functions not as a binary but as a discernment of principia: the principium cognoscendi is **revelation**, and the principium essendi is the triune **God** whose likeness grounds finite participation.

#### 3. Dogmatics as Discipleship
In **Theology as Discipleship** (2015), Johnson develops a constructive ecclesiology of doctrine. The central thesis is that theology belongs to the church’s sanctifying practices and so must be oriented to **discipleship**, not to academic self-assertion. He frames doctrine as a school of wisdom that trains the mind in **analogical judgment**, habituates the affections to the **triune God**, and orders the will toward **holiness**. The volume retrieves the ancient pairing of **fides quae** and **fides qua**, showing how the content of faith shapes the act of believing and conversely how the act of believing clarifies the content. In this model, **Scripture** norms the grammar, the **creeds** anchor the rule, and the **sacraments** and **prayer** deepen participation in **Christ** by the **Spirit**.

Johnson’s ecclesially situated method is not indifferent to academic rigor. Rather, it places critical tools in service of **edification**. Exegesis is embedded in **dogmatics**, and **dogmatics** returns to exegesis with refined questions about **God**, **creation**, **sin**, and **salvation**. He resists the disjunction between descriptive and confessional theology by treating **confession** as the rightful context for description. The result is a pedagogy of doctrine that cultivates intellectual virtues consonant with **Augustine’s** ordo amoris and that renders **evangelical theology** capable of nuanced engagement with **Thomistic** metaphysics, **Barthian** actualism, and modern questions about language for **God**.

#### 4. Salvation and participation in Christ
An animating theme across Johnson’s corpus is **soteriological objectivism** derived from **Barth** yet chastened by evangelical instincts about conversion and mission. He emphasizes that salvation is an accomplished reality in the person and work of **Jesus Christ** and that human participation is a Spirit-wrought sharing in that objective reconciliation. This dovetails with a participatory **Christology** in which union with **Christ** governs justification, sanctification, and vocation. Drawing from **Eberhard Jüngel** and **George Hunsinger** on **Barth’s** ontology of grace, Johnson contends that evangelical proclamation must be anchored in the indicatives of **reconciliation** if it is to sustain the imperatives of **discipleship**.

Yet he pairs this with a robust account of personal **faith**, **repentance**, and ecclesial formation. The **analogia fidei** ensures that the movement from God to humanity is primary and determinative, while the Spirit creates faithful correspondence in the church’s life. Johnson thus avoids collapsing salvation into a purely forensic model or a purely participatory model by insisting on their ordered relation in **union with Christ**. The upshot is an evangelical idiom that can speak of deification in the patristic sense of participation in the divine life by **grace** while preserving the Reformation’s emphasis on **justification by faith** and the inviolable **Creator-creature distinction**.

#### 5. Reframing Barth’s doctrine of God
Johnson’s rereading of **Barth’s doctrine of God** is a quiet but significant contribution. Against a literary tendency to oppose **Barthian actualism** to classical **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, he argues that Barth’s positive teaching, rightly construed, safeguards divine **aseity**, **impassibility** in the mode of sovereign love, and the uncreated **simplicity** of God’s life. The corrective is not to deny Barth’s reorientation around **revelation** and election but to insist that the **triune God** who reveals is not reconstituted by the history of **Jesus Christ**. In short, Johnson reads **Barth** as a reforming ally of **classical theism**, not its adversary.

Here Johnson is in conversation with **Bruce McCormack** and **George Hunsinger** over the metaphysical entailments of **Barth’s** doctrine of election and **immanent Trinity**. While he acknowledges the gains of actualistic ontology in resisting speculative **natural theology**, he cautions that evangelical theology must articulate attributes like **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** in non-competitive terms that support rather than undermine the Gospel’s objectivity. The **analogia fidei** functions here as a rule of predication: what Scripture attributes to God is said analogically in a way that secures the mystery of **divine transcendence** and the reality of **divine presence**.

#### 6. Bonhoeffer, culture, and public theology
As co-editor of **Bonhoeffer, Christ and Culture** (2013) with **Timothy Larsen**, Johnson engages **Dietrich Bonhoeffer** to explore the church’s public vocation. The volume refracts Bonhoeffer’s **Christology**, **ecclesiology**, and ethics through contemporary cultural questions, arguing that faithful presence requires a discipleship-shaped **public theology**. For Johnson, Bonhoeffer’s insistence that Christ is the **Lord of the world** in the concrete form of the church’s life resonates with his own thesis that dogmatics belongs to **discipleship** and thus to public witness. The Christological concentration, learned from **Barth** and tested in the crucible of **Bonhoeffer’s** resistance, grounds an evangelical engagement with culture that avoids culture-war reductionism and quietist retreat.

This dimension of Johnson’s work underscores his conviction that doctrinal clarity and mission are inseparable. The same analogical discernment that governs speech about **God** governs the church’s prudential reasoning in the world. By retrieving **Bonhoeffer’s** grammar of responsibility under the Word, Johnson places **evangelical theology** within a broader ecumenical conversation about **ethics**, **politics**, and the cross-shaped wisdom of **Christ**.

#### 7. Evangelical-catholic rapprochement without erasure
Johnson’s mediation work is perhaps most evident in his constructive proposals for Protestant-Catholic understanding on **analogy**, **nature and grace**, and **soteriology**. He recognizes that **Erich Przywara’s analogia entis** aimed to preserve both divine **transcendence** and genuine creaturely participation. Yet he insists, with **Barth**, that any account of **analogy** must be normed by **revelation** such that God’s self-interpretation in **Christ** governs our predication and metaphysical confidence. The result is a chastened openness to metaphysics: evangelical theology can receive **Thomistic** insights into **analogy**, **simplicity**, and the act-potency grammar where these serve and are disciplined by the Evangel.

Johnson also resists simplistic Protestant polemics against **Roman Catholic** accounts of **nature** and **grace** by highlighting ressourcement corrections within Catholic theology that stress the gratuity of the **supernatural** and the primacy of **grace**. Still, the evangelical commitment to **sola Scriptura** and **solus Christus** functions for him as a principled hedge against any reification of **natural theology** as an independent pathway to God. The line of travel is a generous yet guarded ecumenism: real convergence under **revelation**, real divergence where **analogy** risks becoming autonomous or **grace** becomes a metaphysical principle rather than the gift of the **triune God**.

#### 8. Pedagogical influence and disciplinary shape
Beyond monographs and edited volumes, Johnson’s essays in venues such as **Pro Ecclesia**, **International Journal of Systematic Theology**, and the **Scottish Journal of Theology** model a style of evangelical **dogmatics** that is patient, source-sensitive, and pastorally directed. He has become a guide for students learning to read **Barth** and **Aquinas** without partisan reflexes, and to connect doctrines like **divine simplicity**, **atonement**, and **sanctification** within a coherent **Christological ontology**. His pedagogy raises evangelical confidence that doctrine is not an abstracted system but the grammar of **discipleship**.

This pedagogical influence extends to curricular design where the pairing of **Scripture** and **dogmatics**, **creed** and **catechesis**, and **pastoral practice** and **sacramental life** is foregrounded. The net effect is a renewal of evangelical theology’s center of gravity: ecclesially located, open to **ecumenical retrieval**, and insistent that theological excellence serves the church’s **mission**.

#### 9. Significance and constraints
Johnson’s enduring contribution is a reframed conversation about **analogy**, a rehabilitated **Barth** for evangelicals, and a programmatic case for **dogmatics as discipleship**. He shows that an evangelical can critically inhabit both **Barthian** and **Thomistic** worlds without surrendering confessional anchors. His work clarifies that the alternative to anti-metaphysical biblicism is not metaphysical autonomy but **Christologically normed analogy**. He has thus helped unfreeze debates that too often pitted **analogia entis** against **analogia fidei** as mutually exclusive, and he has shown how **participation in Christ** can be confessed without fuzzing the **Creator-creature distinction** or the normative status of **Scripture**.

At the same time, Johnson’s project depends on careful boundary-keeping. The constructive space he opens risks closing if **analogy** once again drifts from **revelation**, or if **Barth’s** expansive objectivism blurs evangelical emphases on **conversion** and **mission**. Johnson negotiates these tensions by insisting that the **gospel’s indicatives** and the church’s **imperatives** remain tethered within **union with Christ**, and by continuing to refine how **divine attributes** are confessed in ways that protect both **transcendence** and **presence**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster vantage, Johnson’s strengths are clear: he prioritizes **revelation** and **Scripture**, sustains the **Creator-creature distinction**, centers **Christ**, and retrieves **divine simplicity** and **aseity** within a pastoral dogmatics. His use of **analogia fidei** deepens confessional instincts, and his insistence on **dogmatics as discipleship** aligns with the Reformed conviction that theology is for the church under the **Word**. Concerns arise at three points. First, any reconciliation of **analogia entis** with evangelical theology must avoid reintroducing a **nature-grace** schema that, in Reformed critique, threatens the sufficiency of **special revelation** and the finality of **covenant** as the medium of knowledge of God. The Westminster alternative would specify that all true knowledge of God is covenantally mediated, with the **light of nature** rendering humanity inexcusable but not supplying a positive metaphysical bridge to God; hence **analogia fidei** remains the controlling rule. Second, Johnson’s sympathetic rendering of **Barth’s election Christology** invites scrutiny relative to Reformed doctrines of **decretive will**, **pactum salutis**, and the asymmetry of election and reprobation, lest the objectivity of reconciliation soften the biblical warnings attached to unbelief. Third, his participatory idiom underscores **union with Christ**, which Reformed theology warmly affirms, yet it requires explicit guarding of forensic **justification** as the ground of sanctification to avoid any drift toward ontological transformation eclipsing the **legal** act. A Westminster-shaped alternative would foreground covenantal **revelation** over metaphysical participation, uphold **analogia fidei** as the sole safe rule of predication, and deploy **Bavinck’s** and the older **Reformed scholastics’** account of **simplicity** and **immutability** to secure the Creator’s freedom while maintaining a richly Trinitarian account of presence in **Word** and **sacrament**.
