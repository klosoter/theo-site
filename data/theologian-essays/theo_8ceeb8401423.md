### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and aim
James E. Dolezal is a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose defining contribution is a rigorous retrieval of **classical theism**, especially **divine simplicity** and **pure actuality**. Educated in conservative Reformed circles and active as a professor at **Cairn University**, he writes against the background of late twentieth and early twenty-first century evangelical debates about **impassibility**, **immutability**, and **God and time**. His work stands downstream of the **open theism** controversies and the later disputes over **Eternal Functional Subordination**, but it also engages internal Reformed trends that accommodate divine change or temporal sequence for the sake of relational immediacy. Dolezal frames his project as a confessional and metaphysical correction, appealing to **Westminster Confession 2.1** and to **Aquinas** on *simplicitas Dei*, arguing that the drift from **aseity** and **simplicity** into **theistic mutualism** compromises the Christian doctrine of God. He reads the canon with **Augustine** and **Anselm**, deploys **Turretin** and **Mastricht**, and insists that the rallying cry of classical theism, **all that is in God is God**, safeguards the gospel by securing a God who is **immutable**, **impassible**, and **infinite**.

#### 2. Method, metaphysics, and Scripture
Dolezal’s method is **ressourcement** in its Reformed idiom. He retrieves **Scholastic realism** and natural theology, contending that metaphysical first principles such as **act and potency**, **essence and existence**, and **privation and perfection** are demanded by Scripture’s witness to **aseity**, **immutability**, and **simplicity**. He embraces **analogical predication** over univocal God talk, appropriating the Thomistic *analogia* to deny that creaturely perfections are predicated of God in the same mode. He insists on exegesis governed by the twin paths of **via negativa** and **via eminentiae**. Thus anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms are ruled by the confession that God is **without body, parts, or passions**, even as divine names like good, wise, or just are confessed as infinitely, eminently, and simply identical with the divine **essence**. Scripture and metaphysics meet in his appeal to doctrines such as the **extra Calvinisticum**, **simplicity**, and **eternity**. He contends that historic **Reformed scholasticism** never abandoned **Aquinas** on these points but converted him, so to speak, to the **Westminster** idiom, yielding a principled dismissal of the modern evangelical fantasy of a God composed of distinct psychological states or temporal episodes.

#### 3. God Without Parts 2011 and the grammar of simplicity
In **God Without Parts** 2011, Dolezal constructs a full-throated account of **divine simplicity** as the metaphysical condition for **immutability**, **impassibility**, **eternity**, and **infinity**. The claim that God is **without parts** is unfolded through classical denials of composition: no composition of **act and potency**, no composition of **essence and existence**, no aggregation of **substance and accidents**, no real distinction between **attributes** within God, and no assemblage of faculties that could be increased or diminished. The divine nature is **ipsum esse subsistens**, subsistent being itself, pure actuality or *actus purus*. From this Dolezal argues that God is not dependent on any cause, that he does not acquire perfections, and that his **attributes** are not bits added to an underlying core. In the register of biblical theism, this preserves **aseity**, **self-sufficiency**, and **immutability**, refusing a view in which God grows by relation to the world. The book presses the thesis that **simplicity** is not an optional scholastic add-on but the deep grammar that holds together **holiness**, **love**, **wisdom**, and **power** as God himself rather than as a divine collection.

#### 4. All That Is in God 2017 and the critique of theistic mutualism
In **All That Is in God** 2017, Dolezal moves from constructive exposition to polemical clarification, addressing what he calls **theistic mutualism**, a family of evangelical revisions that ascribe real change in God in order to preserve relational give and take with creatures. He respectfully but firmly critiques **John Frame** and **K. Scott Oliphint** on covenantal properties, **Bruce Ware** and **Wayne Grudem** on relational subordinationism, and broader **analytic-evangelical** claims about divine temporal sequence. The book’s titular maxim, **all that is in God is God**, or *quidquid est in Deo Deus est*, functions as both axiom and criterion. Dolezal argues that once one grants parts, passions, or passive potency in God, even contingently, the historic doctrines of **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** unravel. He draws on **Aquinas** and **Turretin** to resupply distinctions that contemporary evangelicalism often lacks, most notably the doctrine of **no real relations in God** toward creatures and the category of **extrinsic denomination**. These tools allow him to affirm that God truly relates to creatures and truly loves the world, while denying that such relations introduce composition, development, or ontological dependence in the divine **essence**.

#### 5. Immutability, impassibility, and eternity
Central to Dolezal’s constructive case is the claim that **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **eternity** are entailments of **simplicity** and **pure actuality**. If God is without potency, then he cannot undergo transition from one state to another, whether emotional, cognitive, or volitional. Dolezal reads biblical affirmations like Malachi 3.6 and James 1.17 as doctrinally determinate for **immutability**, while treating passages that speak of God’s repentance or grief as accommodations calibrated by the **Creator-creature distinction**. **Impassibility** then names not apathy but the absence of passive potency, so that divine love is uncaused, unalterable, and identical with the divine **essence**. **Eternity** likewise follows, not as endless time but as the fullness of life that is wholly present and without succession. The resulting portrait is of a God who does not enter temporal process yet whose **ad extra** works unfold freely in created time. By distinguishing **ad intra** identity from **ad extra** effects, Dolezal safeguards a robust doctrine of **providence** and **decree** without attributing flux to God.

#### 6. Simplicity and Trinity
Dolezal also contends that **divine simplicity** strengthens rather than threatens **trinitarian** dogma. He rejects **social trinitarianism** in favor of the classical doctrine of **relations of origin**, affirming **eternal generation** and **spiration** within the simple divine essence. The persons are not parts of God but subsistent relations in the one **ousia**, which is why **opera ad extra sunt indivisa**, the works of the Trinity toward creation are undivided. He aligns with the Reformed account of **Calvins autotheos** rightly understood, where the Son is God of himself according to essence yet receives his personal mode of subsistence from the Father. Dolezal denies that simplicity renders the persons indistinguishable or collapses them into a monad, since the personal properties are not accidents joined to essence but the way the one **simple** God is three. This patristic and scholastic consensus allows him to rebut **EFS** proposals by showing that eternal relations are not relations of authority and submission but of paternity, filiation, and active spiration.

#### 7. Creator and creature, no real relations, and the decree
The engine room of Dolezal’s system is the asymmetry of Creator and creature, which he explicates through **no real relations in God** and **extrinsic denomination**. Creatures genuinely bear real relations to God that modify them, while God’s relation to creatures is a relation of reason that introduces no composition or potency into God. This principle secures **aseity** and explains how God can will a new effect without becoming new. He integrates this with a robust doctrine of **decree**, arguing that God’s single, simple, eternal act is identical to the divine essence, yet that this act contingently yields diverse temporal effects. To charges of modal collapse, Dolezal deploys Scholastic distinctions such as necessity of the consequence versus necessity of the consequent, and the difference between God’s necessary willing of himself and his free willing of creatures. The effect is to guard divine **freedom** without denying **immutability**, and to uphold **providence** as wise and fatherly rather than as metaphysically compelled emanation. The Creator-creature disanalogy, in his hands, becomes the cognitive rule for reading Scripture and articulating dogma without falling into **theistic personalism**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
Dolezal’s strongest allies are the catholic and Reformed doctors who anchor his case, above all **Aquinas**, **Augustine**, **Anselm**, **Turretin**, **Mastricht**, and the English Puritans like **Stephen Charnock** and **John Owen** on **attributes**. His direct interlocutors are contemporary evangelicals who treat God as in some way temporal, passible, or composed, including **John Frame**, **K. Scott Oliphint**, **Bruce Ware**, and **Wayne Grudem**, as well as analytic proposals that finesse immutability into mere moral constancy. The reception of **God Without Parts** 2011 and **All That Is in God** 2017 has been notable. Among advocates of **Reformed catholicity**, the books became touchstones for the recovery of **simplicity** and **impassibility**, often alongside complementary work by **Steven Duby** and others who defend classical attributes. Among Van Tilian circles and analytic evangelicals, criticism has focused on alleged overreliance on **Aquinas**, the disputed use of **analogy**, and the pastoral fear that divine **impassibility** chills the warmth of covenantal fellowship. The controversy sharpened intra-Reformed conversations about how **confessional** commitments constrain metaphysical speculation and how **Scripture** authorizes metaphysical claims about God.

#### 9. Scripture, theology, and pastoral import
While the idiom is scholastic, Dolezal intends pastoral purchase. By retrieving **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, he argues that Christian assurance rests on the constancy and sufficiency of God whose **love** is identical with his **being**, not a fluctuating mood. A God who is **pure act** does not need the world to become fully himself, which reaffirms the gratuity of **creation** and the freedom of **grace**. Through **no real relations**, he aims to preserve the profundity of God’s covenantal presence without suggesting ontological mutual dependence. The cross then is not the suffering of a changeable deity but the historical mission by which the **impassible** Son, in his assumed humanity, truly suffered for us. Dolezal’s case thus holds Christology, **Trinity**, and **attributes** together under the single claim that **all that is in God is God**, and that this is precisely why the gospel is good news.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed and WTS evaluation must hold two commitments together, the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **principle of covenantal condescension**. Dolezal’s greatest strength is his uncompromising retrieval of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **eternity** that aligns closely with **Westminster Confession 2.1** and the older **Reformed scholastics**. He is right to insist that the erosion of these **attributes** yields a personalist deity whose being is in process. The tensions arise where his Thomistic deployment of **analogy** and **no real relations** meets **Van Tilian** concerns about the **analogia entis** and the epistemic asymmetry of revelation. Reformed alternatives within orthodoxy can secure the same conclusions while accenting covenantal modes of divine presence, as in **Bavinck’s organic motif**, without granting that the covenant introduces real change into God. One can affirm **simplicity** as dogmatic rule, utilize **extrinsic denomination**, and still foreground **covenant** as the history-embracing medium of knowledge of God. The best WTS path keeps **simplicity** and **Creator-creature** distance firm, stresses **anthropomorphic** accommodation in Scripture, and guards the warmth of divine **mercy** and **love** by rooting them in the simple essence rather than in temporal passions. On this reading, Dolezal’s project is fundamentally sound, and when chastened by Reformed emphases on revelation and covenant, it offers a stable alternative to theistic mutualism without ceding any confessional ground.
