### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
R. C. Sproul, born in 1939 in Pittsburgh and deceased in 2017, matured within the emergent **neo-evangelical** milieu while remaining anchored in **confessional Reformed** identity. Educated at **Westminster College** and **Pittsburgh Theological Seminary**, he studied doctrine under **John Gerstner**, an heir of **Old Princeton** and **Warfield**. Postgraduate work at the **Free University of Amsterdam** brought him into contact with **G. C. Berkouwer** and the Dutch stream of **Reformed dogmatics**. This formation yielded a distinctive synthesis: a high **doctrine of God** that was classically theistic, a biblically realist **epistemology**, and an evangelistic urgency grounded in **covenant theology**. In 1971 he founded **Ligonier Ministries** in Pennsylvania, designing a teaching fellowship to catechize laypeople in **Reformed orthodoxy** under the rubric **coram Deo**, life lived before the face of a holy God.

Sproul’s method remained consistently **classical** rather than **presuppositional**, appropriating **Aquinas’s natural theology** and **Aristotelian realism** to argue that Christianity is not only true but rationally warranted. He insisted that **sola Scriptura** governs theology while **general revelation** and the **sensus divinitatis** supply real, though suppressed, knowledge of God. He resisted **Kantian skepticism**, and he appealed to the **law of non-contradiction** as a theological tool. The aim was not rationalism but the removal of intellectual obstacles so that the authoritative **Word of God** could be heard. His grammar of method wove **analogia fidei** in exegesis with **natural law** in ethics, all under the normative primacy of inspired **Scripture**.

#### 2. Institutional leadership and public theology
Sproul’s public ministry fused **institutional leadership** and **doctrinal clarity**. He served as a leading architect of the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978, drafting its Exposition to specify the meaning of **verbal plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy** against both neo-orthodox and limited inerrancy proposals. The resulting **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy** positioned him as a principal defender of the authority of **Holy Scripture**. In 1994 he launched the **Renewing Your Mind** broadcast to catechize through public theology, and he oversaw the **Reformation Study Bible** in 1995 with a major revision in 2015, distributing **Reformed confessional** notes on canon, covenant, and **redemption accomplished and applied**.

In 1997 he founded **Saint Andrew’s Chapel** near Orlando and later **Reformation Bible College** in 2011, institutionalizing a curriculum centered on **classical theism**, **Reformed soteriology**, and **churchly worship**. His leadership in the **Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals** and support for the **Cambridge Declaration** in 1996 signaled resistance to therapeutic evangelicalism and a renewed commitment to the **solas** of the **Reformation**. Sproul’s ecclesial identity was Presbyterian and confessional, with allegiance to the **Westminster Standards** and practice of **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** as ordinary means of grace.

#### 3. The holiness of God and the doctrine of God
Sproul’s signature theological insight is that the weight of Christian truth rests upon the **holiness of God**. In **The Holiness of God** from 1985 he argued that holiness is both God’s majestic otherness and his moral purity, a double emphasis that exposed the divine **aseity** and human **sinfulness**. He taught Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4 as paradigmatic visions, insisting that the thrice-holy acclamation is the only attribute repeated to the superlative, thereby serving as a lens for **divine simplicity** rather than a rival to it. Holiness for Sproul does not segment attributes but intensifies the whole reality of **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **omnipotence** in the one God.

Sproul described the human condition as living **coram Deo**, provoking terror apart from **propitiation** and **imputation**. Against contemporary theologies that weakened **divine wrath**, he recovered biblical idiom on judgment and the need for **atonement**. In tandem he defended **creation ex nihilo** and **providence** as total divine governance, arguing in **Not a Chance** in 1994 and **The Invisible Hand** in 1996 that chance has no causal power and that concurrence secures secondary causes without compromising **sovereignty**. His doctrine of God remained resolutely **classical**, at times explicitly defending **univocal predication** in limited respects to preserve meaningful God-talk while honoring the ultimate **analogy of being** under **simplicity**.

#### 4. Scripture, inerrancy, and hermeneutics
Sproul’s role in the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** made him a benchmark for **evangelical bibliology**. He defined **inerrancy** as Scripture’s truthfulness in all it affirms, rightly interpreted, and he rejected both **limited inerrancy** and the reduction of inspiration to encounter. In essays and lectures later collected in **Reason to Believe** and teaching series on **Revelation and Inspiration**, he affirmed the organic inspiration of human authors, the trustworthiness of narrative and history, and the unity of the **canon**. His hermeneutic stressed the **grammatical-historical method**, the **analogia fidei** that Scripture interprets Scripture, and the clarity of the gospel across the whole canon.

This bibliology was not isolationist. Sproul welcomed **general revelation** and **natural theology** as handmaids to exegesis, but he guarded the **norming** role of Scripture. The exposition of **Romans**, **John**, and **Hebrews** in his teaching ministry consistently tethered doctrinal conclusions to textual argument. He viewed **sola Scriptura** as a principle of source and authority rather than a denial of tradition, which is why he invested decades in explicating the **Westminster Confession** in **Truths We Confess** from 2006 to 2007, making a confessionally bounded hermeneutic accessible to the church.

#### 5. Soteriology, election, and the cross
Sproul’s **Reformed soteriology** entered the bloodstream of evangelicalism through **Chosen by God** in 1986 and **Willing to Believe** in 1997. He defended **total depravity** as moral inability, **unconditional election** as God’s gracious choice, **definite atonement** as the efficacy of Christ’s cross for the elect, **irresistible grace** as effectual calling, and **perseverance of the saints** as divine preservation. He argued that **regeneration precedes faith** as a principle of monergistic salvation and that any synergism compromises **sola gratia**. Engaging **Arminianism** and semi-Pelagian currents, he leveraged **Jonathan Edwards** on the will’s affections and inclination to show the coherence of freedom with necessity.

At the center stood **justification by faith alone**. In **Faith Alone** from 1995 and later **Getting the Gospel Right** in 1999 he contended for the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** and the forensic nature of justification, opposing both **Roman Catholic** confusions of infusion and the emergent **New Perspective** tendencies that relocated justification within ecclesial boundary markers. Sproul framed the **cross** as **penal substitution**, defending propitiation in **The Truth of the Cross** from 2007. His pastoral aim was assurance grounded in the **promissory word** and the extra nos of Christ’s obedience, with sanctification as the necessary fruit of union but not its ground.

#### 6. Church, sacraments, and worship
As a confessional Presbyterian, Sproul’s **ecclesiology** and practice of the **means of grace** were substantial, though often overshadowed by his public apologetics. In **Grace Unknown** from 1997 and in his expositions of the **Westminster Standards**, he presented the church as the covenant community gathered under the Word and sacrament. He affirmed infant **baptism** as a sign and seal of the covenant and the **Lord’s Supper** as spiritual communion with the risen Christ, rejecting both transubstantiation and memorialism in favor of a robust **Calvinian real presence**. His ordering of worship aligned with the **regulative principle**, stressing the primacy of Scripture reading, preaching, prayer, and sacrament.

He championed **eldership**, **discipline**, and catechesis, insisting that the health of the church depends on doctrine believed and practiced. The founding of **Saint Andrew’s Chapel** and the editorial labors on the **Reformation Study Bible** reinforced a vision of a teaching church rooted in **covenant theology**. His critique of contemporary pragmatism in worship drew upon **the holiness of God**, arguing that reverence is not an aesthetic preference but a theological imperative derived from **divine majesty**.

#### 7. Apologetics, philosophy, and culture
Sproul’s apologetic stance is best seen in **Classical Apologetics** in 1984 with **John Gerstner** and **Arthur Lindsley**, where he defends the legitimacy of **natural theology** against both **fideism** and strong **presuppositionalism**. He insisted that the existence of God is demonstrable with moral certainty and that **Romans 1** holds people accountable to general revelation even as sin suppresses the truth. He appropriated **Aquinas’s Five Ways**, defended the **cosmological** and **teleological** arguments, and used **moral law** reasoning to undergird ethical claims on abortion and justice. Probability arguments in **Reason to Believe** were not concessions to skepticism but rhetorical avenues to show Christianity’s comprehensive rational coherence.

In cultural engagement he was a **natural law** advocate, insisting that civil society can and must recognize creational norms. He opposed **open theism** represented by **Clark Pinnock** and allies, warning that its denial of exhaustive foreknowledge compromised **divine omniscience** and **providence**. He critiqued **postmodern relativism** and recovered categories of **truth**, **essence**, and **being** within a **classical metaphysics**. Yet his emphasis on **sola Scriptura** kept philosophy as a ministerial science, subordinate to **theology**, even as it supplied critical tools for public persuasion.

#### 8. Roman Catholicism, ecumenism, and justification debates
Sproul’s engagements with **Roman Catholicism** were pointed yet careful. In the mid-1990s he challenged the **Evangelicals and Catholics Together** initiative, arguing that the document confused **justification** and compromised **sola fide**. In **Faith Alone** and later in **Are We Together** in 2012 he distinguished between cooperative cultural projects and doctrinal consensus, insisting that the **Council of Trent** anathematized the gospel as confessionally understood by **Reformed theology**. His exchanges with evangelical leaders such as **J. I. Packer** and **Charles Colson** were marked by respect coupled with clarity that unity must be doctrinally principled, not merely strategic.

Sproul also interacted with **Norman Geisler** and broader evangelical debates on **free will** and predestination. While sharing with Geisler a **classical apologetic** posture, Sproul criticized efforts to retain libertarian freedom within a monergistic soteriology. In churchly contexts he emphasized that confessional **Presbyterianism** offers a coherent framework in which **covenant**, **sacrament**, and **sovereign grace** converge. The result was a body of work that supplied lay evangelicals with the grammar of **Reformed orthodoxy** without sacrificing catholic breadth.

#### 9. Pedagogy, style, and the catechetical project
Sproul’s writings such as **Essential Truths of the Christian Faith** in 1992 and **Everyone’s a Theologian** in 2014 reveal an enduring pedagogical strategy. He distilled complex **doctrinal loci** into clear units, always moving from **Scripture** to doctrine to life **coram Deo**. He employed narrative and argument together, harnessing historical vignettes from **Augustine**, **Luther**, and **Edwards** to frame contemporary questions. His teaching series on **St. Andrew’s pulpit** and Ligonier platforms made **divine attributes**, **justification**, and **providence** compelling to non-specialists without diluting content.

This catechetical project included the curation of the **Reformation Study Bible**, editorial oversight of **Tabletalk** magazine, and repeated calls to confessional integrity through the **Westminster Confession**. He refused the false dichotomy between academic theology and ecclesial catechesis. The aim was the church’s reformation by renewing her mind under **biblical authority** and returning her worship to the reality of God’s **holiness**. In this way his corpus functions as a comprehensive introduction to **Reformed theology** both doctrinally and devotionally.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Sproul’s legacy is a powerful retrieval of **classical theism**, **inerrancy**, and **monergistic soteriology**, though with debated choices in **apologetic method**. His prioritizing of the **holiness of God** as an organizing theme rightly magnifies **divine transcendence**, yet it invites clarification lest holiness be construed as a controlling attribute in tension with **divine simplicity**, where all divine perfections are identical to the divine essence. A Westminster assessment will applaud his defense of **sola fide** against **Tridentine** and **ecumenical** ambiguities, his covenantal exegesis, and his expository fidelity to the **Westminster Standards**. It will question, however, his advocacy of **natural theology** as more than ministerial, his allowance for limited **univocal predication** about God, and his polemic against **Van Til** on the inevitability of **circularity** in ultimate commitments. The alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy would stress a **covenantal epistemology** that affirms the clarity of **general revelation** yet interprets all knowing as covenantally situated, a stronger deployment of the **Creator creature distinction** in all predication, and an apologetic that self-consciously presupposes **Scripture’s authority** while still marshaling evidences. Even so, Sproul’s integration of **Old Princeton** clarity with **confessional Presbyterian** piety remains an enduring gift to the church.
