### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Tarleton Gillespie emerges as a theorist of the digital public in the long turn from early **Web 2.0** exuberance to late-stage anxieties about **platform governance**. Writing in the shadow of **Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act** and the **Digital Millennium Copyright Act**, he tracks how legal immunities and **DMCA anticircumvention** provisions scaffold a new infrastructure of **intermediary power**. His intellectual formation is firmly within **Science and Technology Studies**, drawing on **Bruno Latour’s actor-network** sensibilities and on **public sphere** debates from **Jürgen Habermas** and **Nancy Fraser**, while closely engaging the media-institutional tradition of **James Carey**. Against the romantic self-description of companies like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter as neutral conduits, he reads design decisions as **normatively thick infrastructures**, where architecture is argument in the register of **Lawrence Lessig’s code is law**. The animating burden of his project is that everyday technical work and policy tweaks amount to a practical **moral order** for speech, visibility, and sociality online.

Methodologically, Gillespie blends **conceptual genealogy**, **policy analysis**, and **ethnographic attention** to organizational practice, an STS-style triangulation that treats **infrastructures** as socio-technical settlements of competing values. He is a close reader of corporate rhetoric, especially the idiom of **platform** as a term of art that hedges liability and performs neutrality while promising empowerment to multiple audiences. He pairs that rhetorical analysis with studies of **intermediary liability** regimes and with interviews and document analysis to reconstruct the internal logics of **content moderation**. Across his corpus, he defends a normative vocabulary of **custodianship**, by which he means the unavoidable responsibility exercised by private firms that curate, rank, and remove content, even as they claim **noninterference**. This method lets him pass from empirical description to ethical evaluation without adopting the heavy system-building of political philosophy, keeping his intervention anchored in the material discourses of **algorithms**, **guidelines**, and **appeals**.

#### 2. Early work: law, enclosure, and cultural practice
Gillespie’s first monograph, **Wired Shut: Copyright and the Shape of Digital Culture (2007)**, provides the legal-cultural prehistory of his platform thesis. He interprets **DRM**, **anticircumvention**, and **licensing** strategies under the **DMCA** as structuring a digital enclosure that narrows the horizon of legitimate creativity, echoing the critical insight of **Langdon Winner** that artifacts have politics. By analyzing **fair use** jurisprudence, industry white papers, and the symbolic politics of piracy and property, he shows how legal code and software code converge to determine the **conditions of participation** in digital culture. The conceptual move here is foundational: technologies are not containers for content but **normative machines**, and the law that guards them manufactures social expectations about what counts as legitimate communication. Theologically adjacent concerns already surface: the locus of authority for speech and creativity is displaced from public deliberation to private infrastructures, generating a secular **ordo** of permission and prohibition that functions as an implicit **moral theology of communication**.

In this early period he also begins clarifying the rhetorical work done by emergent labels. The term **platform**, which will become his signature object, first appears as a marketing tool deployed by firms to appeal to regulators, investors, advertisers, and users with different connotations of **neutral facilitation**, **technical base**, and **stage for performance**. Through close reading of policy statements and press materials, he uncovers the strategic polysemy that allows companies to claim **publisher-like control** when curating quality while insisting on **common-carrier passivity** when confronted with liability. This tension between curation and neutrality, staged through the language of platform, prepares his later argument that industry actors conduct practical **theodicy** for the harms of their systems by narrating them as aberrations rather than as fruits of structural design.

#### 3. Naming the regime: the politics of platforms
His influential article **The Politics of Platforms (2010)** crystallizes a central analytic: the word **platform** is itself governance. Gillespie shows how companies benefit from platform’s quadruple valence as **computational architecture**, **raised public stage**, **political platform**, and **economic two-sided market**, each of which smuggles assumptions about authority, responsibility, and **legitimacy**. The platform story legitimates **user-generated content** by promising reach and participation while shielding corporate actors from **editorial accountability** owed by traditional media. The essay dissects appeals to **neutrality** and **openness** as techniques of power, arguing that selection, ranking, and recommendation are constitutive acts of **mediation** that set the bounds of the public. The heart of the claim is that platforms are not merely channels but **institutions of public discourse**, and so the categories applied to them should be institutional, not merely technical. In theological register, the platform is a liturgical space, with rules of presence and voice, an ordered **polis** where practices shape persons and where the very structure of visibility inculcates a social **telos**.

This naming exercise is paired with concrete policy analysis. Gillespie connects platform rhetoric to **intermediary liability** debates under **Section 230**, showing how companies animate the statute’s safe harbors to underwrite aggressive experimentation in **algorithmic curation** without facing publisher duties. He anticipates later controversies by arguing that once visibility is allocated by code, the myth of neutrality cannot bear the moral weight of the harms that follow. The platform is an **immanent authority** that governs by ranking, a quiet **sovereign** whose decrees are release notes and whose edicts are community standards.

#### 4. Algorithms and relevance as social ordering
With the edited collection **Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality, and Society (2014)** and his own chapter **The Relevance of Algorithms (2014)**, Gillespie generalizes the insight to the level of epistemology. Algorithms, he argues, are not just efficient procedures but **public knowledge machines** that enact judgments of **relevance**, **worthiness**, and **significance**. Because platforms intermediate vast flows of information, their ranking, trending, and recommendation systems impose a practical **canon** on what is knowable and by whom. He introduces terms like **calculated publics** and analyzes the **black box** dynamics that hide criteria from scrutiny while cultivating trust through interface theater such as **trending lists**, **likes**, and **verification badges**. The social life of algorithms, in this telling, includes developer cultures, training data, feedback loops, and business imperatives, so that mathematical formalisms are wrapped in organizational **habitus**.

This account of algorithmic curation performs simultaneously descriptive and normative work. By showing how platforms assemble **relevance**, Gillespie makes visible the moral predicates of technical systems: ideas of **merit**, **safety**, **civility**, and **newsworthiness** are operationalized in code. He thus reframes technical debates as quarrels over shared goods in the **public sphere**, importing the tradition of **Habermasian** communicative rationality into the study of computational mediation. The picture that emerges is one of a rampant **proceduralism** that can obscure value choices under the sign of efficiency, a temptation toward technocratic **gnosis** that imagines social conflict solvable by better ranking rather than by political negotiation and ethical formation.

#### 5. Custodianship and the hidden moral labor of moderation
Gillespie’s signature monograph, **Custodians of the Internet: Platforms, Content Moderation, and the Hidden Decisions That Shape Social Media (2018)**, offers the most systematic account of platform moral order. Drawing on interviews with moderation workers, leaked **policy guidelines**, corporate statements, and case studies, he reconstructs the layered apparatus of **content moderation**: automated detection, triage queues, outsourced review shops, escalation to policy teams, and public communication. He demonstrates how moderators are asked to navigate rules on **hate speech**, **nudity**, **graphic violence**, **harassment**, and **political extremism**, often with seconds per item and high rates of trauma, all to maintain the corporate promise of a safe and attractive **community**. The argument is twofold: moderation is foundational, not peripheral, to platform operation; and the prevailing industry posture of **noninterference** is a rhetorical fiction that deflects accountability.

The book’s key normative term, **custodianship**, seeks to move past sterile debates about censorship versus free speech by naming the inevitable responsibilities of private stewards of quasi-public spaces. Gillespie presses for **transparency**, **appeals**, and **due process** analogues that would render moderation more legitimate, and he urges scholars and regulators to treat platform governance as a form of **private administration** of the public sphere. He resists both libertarian fantasies of frictionless speech and paternalist reliance on platform benevolence, preferring institutional checks and **procedural safeguards**. Theologically, this is a call to acknowledge that the practices of **exclusion**, **discipline**, and **admonition** are already in play, and so they must be made articulate and answerable to the goods they purport to serve.

#### 6. From scandals to regulation: transparency, amplification, governance
In the post-2016 landscape of electoral interference, **disinformation**, and **deplatforming** controversies, Gillespie’s analysis turns to amplification and accountability at scale. He examines how **recommendation engines** and **trending algorithms** intensify the reach of sensational or incendiary content, making **amplification** a central site of governance distinct from removal. He scrutinizes practices like **shadow banning**, **downranking**, and **labeling**, arguing that they constitute a repertoire of soft power whose normative stakes are often underappreciated. His essays and public scholarship interrogate corporate transparency reports, independent **audits**, and new regulatory frameworks such as the European **Digital Services Act (2022)** that mandate access to data and risk assessments. The leitmotif remains: platforms are **institutions** that claim authority over the shape of public discourse, and their claims require public contestation and juridical framing.

This period also features engagement with the labor and care dimensions of moderation. Drawing on work by **Sarah T. Roberts** on commercial content moderation and by **Kate Klonick** on Facebook’s **Oversight Board**, Gillespie situates platform governance within wider political debates about **private constitutionalism** and the domestication of **rule of law** ideals inside firms. He highlights the fragility of **appeals processes**, the instrumentalization of **transparency** as public relations, and the tendency of companies to treat extreme cases as justification for universal rules, while the routine everyday harms of harassment and marginalization remain under-governed. The conceptual stakes are ecclesial in miniature: who gets to define the **confession** that community guidelines instantiate, how that confession is adjudicated in practice, and what mechanisms exist for repentance, restoration, and **excommunication** in the form of deplatforming.

#### 7. Anthropologies of attention and the liturgies of ranking
Without deploying theological vocabulary directly, Gillespie consistently implies an anthropology and a theory of formation. By treating **ranking** as an order of **relevance** that habituates publics to expect instantaneous visibility and frictionless affirmation, he points to a digital **ordo amoris** in Augustinian terms, where loves are ordered by metrics rather than by truth or virtue. Attention is discipled by interface cues like **likes**, **retweets**, and **streaks**, which become subtle **liturgies of recognition**. The result is not only new structures of knowledge but new structures of desire, a habitus that orients agents toward virality, novelty, and performative outrage. The boundary between **moderation** and **formation** blurs: removal and ranking together school users in what counts as acceptable and admirable, an implicit catechesis enacted by infrastructure.

Gillespie’s attention to the mundane is crucial here. The banality of **community standards**, the iterative tweaking of **recommendation systems**, and the routinized adjudication of **borderline content** collectively produce an ethical environment. His insistence that platforms cannot not govern challenges both cyber-libertarian and statist stories, urging recognition that the real work of shaping speech happens in the middle spaces of product and policy. In classical doctrinal terms, he is narrating a regime of **practices** that inculcate virtues and vices, a digital **ecclesiology** without sacraments whose sacra are data, whose pastors are policy teams, and whose homilies are nudges and notifications.

#### 8. Interlocutors, divergences, and contributions
Gillespie’s work converses with and diverges from a number of influential frameworks. With **Lawrence Lessig**, he shares the insistence that **code is law**, yet he resists reduction of normative questions to architecture alone, emphasizing **organizational culture** and **public legitimacy**. Against simple uptake of **Habermas’s** proceduralism, he stresses the materiality of **infrastructures** and the asymmetries of corporate power that shape communicative conditions. With **danah boyd** and **Zeynep Tufekci**, he foregrounds **amplification** and **network effects**, but he pushes further on the internal contradiction of the **platform** label as governance by marketing language. In dialogue with **Sarah T. Roberts**, he makes **moderation labor** central rather than peripheral, insisting that the public imaginaries of open forums sit atop a hidden workforce that bears the moral burden of curation.

The distinctiveness of his contribution lies in the fusion of **rhetorical analysis** of corporate self-description, **STS** attention to infrastructures, and a patient mapping of **policy regimes**. He offers not a metaphysic of technology but a thick description of institutions, through which he surfaces the normative stakes that others cast as mere engineering or law. His vocabulary of **custodianship**, **relevance**, and **platform politics** has become lexicon for broader debates, including legislative efforts to rethink **intermediary liability**, scholarly arguments about **algorithmic accountability**, and journalistic coverage of **deplatforming**. In effect, he has helped stabilize the very object of critique, disciplining public discourse to see platforms as **institutions of moral order**.

#### 9. Systematic resonances: revelation, authority, and polity by other means
Read theologically, Gillespie’s analysis maps onto enduring questions of **revelation**, **authority**, and **polity**. Algorithms that select what is seen enact a practical doctrine of **revelation** by determining which words and images are manifest to which publics, thereby mediating both fact and moral salience. Corporate claims of **neutrality** camouflage an **authority** that is neither elective nor sacramental but contractual and infrastructural, a modern variation on **quasi-sovereignty** that rivals the claims of other institutions to govern speech. The polity of platforms, with its **community guidelines**, **disciplinary processes**, and putative **appeals**, resembles an ecclesial order without transcendence, where legitimacy must be generated through transparency and procedural fairness rather than through shared thick goods.

Gillespie’s normative recommendation, **custodianship**, functions as a proposal for institutional humility and articulated responsibility. It acknowledges the inevitability of governance while seeking to fold that power back into accountable forms. Theologically, this sits near a modest **natural-law** gesture: there are goods of public communication that can be named and pursued without invoking thick metaphysical commitments. Yet the account remains within an **immanent frame**, presuming that better procedures and clearer rhetoric suffice to align infrastructures with public good, a presumption that invites both affirmation and critique from traditions that insist on deeper accounts of **sin**, **virtue**, and **truth**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: corporate sovereignty, common grace, and ordered speech
From a classical Reformed perspective, especially in a Westminster Theological Seminary register, Gillespie’s account is a salutary exposure of the myth of **platform neutrality** and a sober anthropology of communication under conditions of **fallenness**. His insistence that infrastructures enact a **moral order** coheres with doctrines of **creation norms** and **general revelation**: God’s world has an order for speech bound up with the **ninth commandment** and the neighbor’s good, and human institutions unavoidably legislate toward or against that order. His language of **custodianship** resonates with **common grace** accounts of civic stewardship and with a Kuyperian **sphere sovereignty** that calls different authorities to their proper limits. At the same time, his immanent proceduralism underestimates **total depravity’s** reach into incentive structures: optimization for engagement will not simply be tamed by transparency and appeals, because disordered loves corrupt both users and governors. A Reformed corrective would name corporate **quasi-sovereignty** as a species of modern **idolatry**, where visibility and virality function as rival sacraments mediating significance, and would commend an architecture of distributed authority under **two-kingdoms** wisdom: the civil magistrate under **Romans 13** bears responsibility to curb harms through public law; ecclesial communities must catechize members in truthful, charitable speech; and firms should be constrained by normed principles of **subsidiarity**, **due process**, and **non-manipulation** that honor creaturely limits. Gillespie’s vocabulary helps translate these commitments into actionable critiques of **algorithmic amplification**, **opaque moderation**, and **liability shields**; yet a Reformed account will press beyond custodianship to the confession that public communication finally answer to truth before God, not only to procedure before users.
