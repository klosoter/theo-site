### ESSAY
J. Gary Millar emerged within a late twentieth-century **evangelical** ecosystem where **biblical theology**, shaped by a strong sense of Scripture’s unity, was being reasserted against both atomistic exegesis and free-floating spirituality. Trained amid Irish and British theological institutions and later serving the **Presbyterian Church** in Ireland before leading **Queensland Theological College** in Brisbane from 2012, he brings a pastor-theologian’s sensibility to scholarly work. Millar’s writing is best located at the confluence of **covenant theology**, **expository preaching**, and a retrieval of **Old Testament spirituality** for contemporary mission. His leadership within **The Gospel Coalition Australia** underscores a public leaning toward ecclesial renewal by the means of **Word and prayer**, a pattern he argues is native to biblical **covenant** and not merely an evangelical cultural inheritance.

Millar’s method is overtly **canonical** and strongly **salvation-historical**, operating under **sola Scriptura** and anchored in a disciplined reading of the final form of the text. He positions **biblical theology** not as a foil to systematic reflection but as the scaffolding for doctrinal synthesis that is faithful to the grain of Scripture. Against the fragmentation produced by some historical-critical approaches, he follows guides like **Gordon McConville** and **Graeme Goldsworthy** in reading **Deuteronomy**, **Psalms**, and **Acts** as coherently joined in the drama of **covenant** and **kingdom**. His exegetical tone is sober and pastoral, privileging literary context, intertextual allusion, and the redemptive-historical storyline, while showing impatience with speculative reconstructions detached from the received canon. The theological engine is the conviction that **promise and fulfillment** meet in Christ, that **law and gospel** coinhere without confusion, and that Christian obedience is lived *coram Deo*, before the face of God, within the new covenant’s **Spirit-gifted** community.

#### 1. Deuteronomy and the shape of covenantal ethics
Millar’s first major scholarly contribution, **Now Choose Life: Theology and Ethics in Deuteronomy** 1998, situates **Deuteronomy** as a normative fountainhead for **biblical ethics**. He argues that the book’s basic antithesis of **life and death** is not mere sanction but covenantal invitation into life with God. The covenant summons is framed by grace and offers **life** through hearing, remembering, and loving the Lord. Millar draws sustained attention to **fear of the Lord**, **love**, and **heart** language as constitutive of ethos rather than detachable motivations appended to command. He shows how **Deuteronomy 30**’s promise of **heart circumcision** anticipates the **new covenant**, reading this as eschatological provision rather than moral incrementalism. The result is an ethic of obedient love that is neither moralistic nor antinomian, where **lex et evangelium** cohere as gift and demand within the divine-human communion.

The texture of Millar’s **Deuteronomic ethics** is integrative: the cultic directives embed **holiness**, the civil statutes instantiate **justice**, and the narratival recollections encode **memory** as a moral mechanism. He underlines the book’s pedagogy of **remembering** and **retelling** as the Spirit’s ordinary path to communal formation. He also stresses **missionary centripetality** in **Deuteronomy**, arguing that Israel’s holiness is meant to draw the nations to Yahweh’s wisdom, a theme Millar connects to **Solomonic kingship** and ultimately to the expansion of the **church** in **Acts**. The ethical horizon thus stretches from Sinai to Zion to Pentecost, with Deuteronomy providing the grammar for Christian holiness that is Christologically fulfilled and pneumatologically empowered.

#### 2. Prayer as covenantal calling and the canon’s throughline
Millar’s capstone in biblical theology is **Calling on the Name of the Lord: A Biblical Theology of Prayer** 2016 in the **New Studies in Biblical Theology** series. The thesis is deliberately simple and profoundly unifying: true **prayer** across Scripture is fundamentally the act of calling on the name of the Lord. He traces this from **Genesis 4.26**, where humanity begins to invoke the divine name, through the patriarchs’ altar-building, the lexically dense invocations in **Psalms**, the oracle of **Joel 2** and its Day of the Lord urgency, to the apostolic proclamation in **Acts 2** and **Romans 10.13**. The climactic turn is that **Jesus** is confessed as the Lord whose name is called upon, so **Christian prayer** is explicitly **Trinitarian**, by the **Spirit**, through the **Son**, to the **Father**. This reading compresses the canon’s scattered prayers into a covenantal act of allegiance and dependence that is inseparable from **gospel proclamation**.

Against technique-driven or therapeutic models, Millar insists that **prayer** is covenantal identification and mission-aligned petition. He argues that **lament** is not the failure of faith but its form under the cross, locating **lament** within the Messiah’s own cry and the church’s witness amid affliction. He develops a theology of **bold access** grounded in Christ’s priesthood and a practice of **corporate prayer** aligned with **Acts** as the engine of mission. The important dogmatic corollary is that **prayer** is not an optional devotion but a participatory means by which the **church** confesses Lordship and receives the **Spirit’s** empowering presence. Millar thus reframes prayer as a covenantal marker with ecclesial and missional dimensions, redressing a deficit he perceives in modern **evangelical** praxis.

#### 3. Ministry, proclamation, and pastoral theology
Millar’s pastoral-theological corpus includes **Saving Eutychus: How to Preach God’s Word and Keep People Awake** 2013 with **Phil Campbell**, which is a practical manifesto for **expository preaching** that marries textual fidelity with rhetorical craft. While recognizably homiletical, it carries a theology of **revelation** and **illumination**: God addresses his people through the public proclamation of Scripture, and human clarity serves divine clarity. Millar advocates for sermons shaped by the **passage’s structure**, animated by the **gospel’s logic**, and delivered with pastoral affection. He links the craft to **prayer**, insisting that preachers prepare not only outlines but congregations through sustained corporate intercession. The effect is a rounded account of ministry as Word-prayer synergy that is consonant with his covenantal theology.

In **2 Corinthians For You** 2015, Millar mines Pauline themes of **weakness and power**, offering an accessible yet theologically rich exposition where apostolic fragility becomes a cruciform model for contemporary ministers. He reads **2 Corinthians** as a treatise on **new covenant ministry**, where the Spirit writes on hearts and the paradox of **glory through suffering** reframes success. His **Read This First** 2019 continues the theme of welcoming ordinary believers into confident **Bible reading**, emphasizing the Bible’s overarching **storyline**, the centrality of **Christ**, and the necessity of **prayerful dependence**. Across these works, the doctrinal undertow is a high view of **Scripture’s authority**, confidence in the **Spirit’s** work through appointed means, and a sober realism about pastoral endurance.

Doctrinally, Millar’s corpus yields a textured account of **covenant**, **law and gospel**, **sanctification**, and **prayer**. In the wake of **Deuteronomy**, sanctification is construed as covenantal communion where **obedience** is the Spirit-wrought correlate of **grace**. He frequently underscores **love of God** and **fear of the Lord** as irreducible affections that shape action, refusing a thin deontological reduction of Christian ethics. The motif of **remembering** functions theologically as anamnetic participation in the saving acts of God, much as **Lord’s Day** worship rehearses the gospel to refashion a people. In **Calling on the Name of the Lord**, the doctrine of **prayer** becomes a means-of-grace locus: Christ mediates access, the Spirit prompts and sustains invocation, and the Father delights to answer for the sake of his name. While Millar does not write scholastic dogmatics, his biblical-theological argumentation regularly yields systematic dividends in **ecclesiology**, **pneumatology**, and **soteriology**.

Millar’s interlocutors and angle within **evangelical** debates are illuminating. He stands with **D. A. Carson** in defending **biblical theology** as canon-conscious and Christocentric, and with **Christopher J. H. Wright** in integrating mission and ethics. He learns from **John Calvin** on the **Institutes’** portrait of **prayer** as chief exercise of faith and on **three uses of the law**, though he carefully revoices these themes through **Deuteronomy’s** idiom. Methodologically he resists letting **critical reconstructions** displace the theological function of the final form, although he acknowledges the literary and compositional features recognized in mainstream scholarship. Practically, he pushes back against **prosperity gospel** distortions of **prayer** and success theologies, leveraging **2 Corinthians** to commend weakness as the true context for **Spirit** power.

The integrated arc of Millar’s thought is best read as a retrieval of **Old Testament spirituality** for the **church** under the crown rights of **Christ**. By rooting **prayer** in the covenantal act of calling on the Lord’s name, he ensures that devotion is attached to doxology and witness. By recovering **Deuteronomy** as formative for Christian ethics, he presses the **church** to inhabit a holiness that is grateful, public, and missionally magnetic. By urging **expository preaching** tethered to **prayer**, he seeks to synchronize the classic **means of grace** with the missional urgency of the twenty-first century. His achievement is not to construct a new system but to reattach durable evangelical instincts to deep canonical grooves.

Millar’s theology exhibits an economy of focus that makes it portable across cultures, especially within Australian and global **Reformed** evangelicalism. The emphasis on **Word and prayer**, the stress on **church** as a praying community, and the centering of **covenant** ethics in belonging to God travel well across denominational lines. He speaks pastorally into the anxieties of late modern ministry, commending ordinary practices under extraordinary promises. The cross-pressured experience of contemporary pastors finds in his reading of **2 Corinthians** a theologically charged path of endurance with the **Spirit**. At the same time, the conceptual minimalism of his approach invites systematic elaboration, especially where ecclesial identity, sacramental signification, and doctrinal cohesion intersect with practice.

There are, however, tensions and open questions that a systematic examiner should test. Millar tends to treat **prayer** as the paradigmatic means of communion and mission, and while he affirms **Word** centrality, his account of **sacrament** remains implicit rather than developed. The covenantal ethic drawn from **Deuteronomy** is carefully Christocentric, yet a more explicit mapping of **threefold use of the law** within the *ordo salutis* would deepen his alignment with classical dogmatics. His use of **Acts** to model **corporate prayer** and mission is stirring, but the transposition from apostolic to post-apostolic contexts requires further ecclesiological articulation, particularly regarding **church offices** and ordinary **means of grace**. Additionally, his canonical method sidelines speculative **source criticism** productively, yet this can invite the charge of underengaging critical questions that bear on doctrine, such as the shape of **canon** or the development of **covenant** formulae.

In a consolidated Reformed and Westminster-aligned evaluation, Millar’s covenantal retrieval of **Deuteronomy** and his canonical theology of **prayer** are strong allies of classical **Reformed orthodoxy** on **Scripture**, **covenant**, and **sanctification**. His insistence that **prayer** is covenantal calling accords with the **Westminster Larger Catechism** on invocation and the address to the Father through the Son by the **Spirit**. Yet his pastoral focus sometimes leaves **sacraments** underarticulated relative to **Word and prayer**, creating a practical hierarchy that classical **means of grace** theology would resist. A Westminster path would integrate his **prayer** thesis with a thicker account of **preaching** as Christ’s own voice and with a clear sacramental ontology of **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** as covenant-signified and grace-exhibiting means. On **law and gospel**, Millar’s Deuteronomic ethic could be fruitfully correlated with the confessional doctrine of the **moral law’s** abiding normativity and delight under **union with Christ**, clarifying the first, second, and third uses in the Spirit. The best Reformed alternative is not a rejection but an expansion: retain Millar’s canonical and missional clarity, while embedding it more fully within a confessional account of **church**, **sacraments**, and the **means of grace**, so that calling on the Lord’s name is explicitly joined to hearing his voice and feeding at his table.
