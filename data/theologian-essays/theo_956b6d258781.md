### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Matthew J. Tuininga emerges as a contemporary **Reformed** ethicist whose work unfolds amid the volatility of **late-modern pluralism**, the maturation of **law-and-religion** scholarship, and renewed debates over **Calvin’s two kingdoms**. Educated in Reformed theology and moral philosophy and completing doctoral study at Emory University under the orbit of **John Witte Jr.**, he writes as a scholar attentive to jurisprudence, political history, and classic **magisterial Protestant** sources. His teaching and writing since the 2010s, including service at **Calvin Theological Seminary**, situate him within institutions tethered to the **Dutch Reformed** and **Presbyterian** traditions while interacting with broader evangelical discourse. The social setting is marked by constitutional liberalism, contested **religious liberty**, and polarized ethics, to which Tuininga responds with a retrieval of **Augustine’s two cities**, **Calvin’s regnum Christi duplex** and a cautious affirmation of **natural law** as a mode of common moral knowledge suitable for public reason.

Methodologically, Tuininga practices **historical-theological retrieval** guided by close textual reading of **Calvin** and early **Reformed** sources, juridical sensitivity to the **magistrate’s office**, and an Augustinian account of pilgrim identity and eschatological hope. He resists both static proof-texting and revisionist fantasies of a monolithic **Christendom**, proposing instead that Calvin’s distinctions between the **spiritual government** of Christ in the church and the **temporal government** of Christ over civil life provide a flexible grammar for ecclesial integrity and civic engagement. His stance is neither voluntarist nor positivist; he articulates a measured **natural law** ethic in the Thomist-Reformed stream, chastened by sin and requiring **prudence**. This approach situates him between **two-kingdoms natural law** theorists like **David VanDrunen** and **neo-Calvinist** transformationalists in the line of **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Dooyeweerd**, while drawing from political theologians such as **Oliver O’Donovan** and **Nicholas Wolterstorff**.

#### 2. Calvin retrieved: the thesis and its contours
Tuininga’s central book, **Calvin’s Political Theology and the Public Engagement of the Church: Christ’s Two Kingdoms** (2017), argues that the Reformed tradition’s original grammar of church and politics is neither a Lutheran-style **law-gospel dualism** nor a modern sacred-secular separation, but **Calvin’s duplex regimen**, the twofold rule of Christ. In Calvin’s idiom, Christ reigns **spiritually** through the **ministerium verbi**, **sacraments**, and **discipline**, ordering the pilgrim church toward the heavenly polis; and **temporally** through providence and common grace, ordering civil life toward **iustitia** and **pax**. The analytic hinge is not ontology but **ends and means**: different offices administer distinct divine ends with distinct instruments. The **church as institute** bears the keys, exercises **discipline** for holiness, and proclaims judgment and mercy. The **magistratus politicus** bears the sword to defend the innocent, punish injustice, and secure outward peace for all neighbors. For Tuininga, this is an actionable account of **public justice** and **ecclesial integrity** that prevents both ecclesiocracy and political quietism.

A crucial plank in Tuininga’s retrieval is Calvin’s deployment of **conscience** and **natural law**. Conscience is not autonomous sovereignty but a creaturely faculty accountable to **God’s law**, illumined uniquely by Scripture yet capable of recognizing many civil goods by **lex naturalis**. This layered moral epistemology underwrites both the universality of certain civil norms and the church’s prophetic office. Tuininga stresses that Calvin’s **natural law** is not a separate soteriological road; it is an economy of divine providence for the common order, bound to be corrected and filled out by **Scripture**. In this way, the two kingdoms avoid collapsing into **nature-grace partition**; rather, grace orders the church to its proper end while nature is upheld and directed by Christ’s temporal rule.

#### 3. Christendom, coercion, and pluralism
The historically delicate question Tuininga faces is **Christendom** and the legacy of religious coercion in the **magisterial Reformation**. Calvin’s Geneva endorsed a confessional establishment and punitive measures against heresy. Tuininga neither romanticizes nor anachronistically condemns this, but interprets it through Calvin’s prudential judgments about political unity and social survival in the sixteenth century. He highlights how **Calvin** distinguished coercive political prudence from the church’s **spiritual** jurisdiction and how the reformer placed decisive weight on **word-discipline** rather than on the sword for the purity of the church. Building from this historical caution, Tuininga argues that contemporary **pluralist** polities, aiming at civil peace amid deep diversity, should not enforce orthodoxy but should secure **religious liberty** and **equal protection** while preserving the church’s freedom to witness, form members, and practice discipline.

Tuininga’s Augustinian commitments shape this application. The **civitas terrena** and **civitas Dei** interpenetrate historically, yet their ends differ. Civil government orders the earthly peace with a penultimate orientation, while the church orders a pilgrim people to eternal peace by **charity** and contemplation. The two kingdoms communicate not by jurisdictional conflation but by **shared membership**; believers inhabit both orders and thus bring **virtues** learned in ecclesial formation into their vocations. Consistent with **O’Donovan’s** moral realist instincts, Tuininga insists that political authority remains answerable to God’s rule and to substantive goods. Still, consistent with **Wolterstorff’s** concern for justice and rights, he urges that civil law’s coercion be limited to public wrongs rather than ultimate claims of worship.

#### 4. The shape of public engagement: justice, prudence, and witness
In essays and public interventions, Tuininga advances a practical **ethic of public justice** that prioritizes legal impartiality, the protection of the vulnerable, and due process. He addresses controversies such as **religious liberty**, **refugee reception**, **sexual ethics**, and **the sanctity of life**, urging that Christians reason publicly with both **Scripture-shaped moral vision** and appeal to **accessible reasons** grounded in the goods of human flourishing. The watchwords are **prudence** and **charity**. He rejects both **theonomy** that would canonize Mosaic penology and a thin **proceduralism** that empties law of moral substance. Instead, he contends that the **natural law** tradition, clarified by Reformed emphases on sin and grace, supplies a grammar for arguing about **marriage**, **life**, and **justice** in liberal democracies without asking the state to become an arm of the church.

Central to this model is the differentiation of the **church as institute** from Christian action in other vocations. The church gathered and governed must not be captured by party politics; its ministers wield the **keys** of teaching, sacraments, and discipline, not the instruments of legislation. Yet Christians as citizens, lawyers, teachers, and magistrates, formed by the **gospel**, pursue neighbor-love under Christ’s temporal rule. In this twofold posture, the church preserves its **pilgrim holiness** while its members seek the **common good**. Tuininga thus retrieves the **Reformed** theme of distributed offices and maintains the reformer’s insistence that ecclesial discipline is the church’s distinctive coercive power, whereas the state’s sword is constrained to civil wrongs.

#### 5. Calvin and his heirs: triangulating VanDrunen and Kuyper
Within contemporary **Reformed** debates, Tuininga’s reading triangulates between **David VanDrunen’s** so-called **R2K** account and **Abraham Kuyper’s** **sphere sovereignty**. With VanDrunen, he affirms the biblical basis for distinguishing **cultic-redemptive** ministry from **civil** governance and the need for **natural law** to guide a common political ethic. Yet he resists construing the **common kingdom** as a realm of sheer nature insulated from the impact of **redemption**, emphasizing instead Calvin’s insistence that Christ rules both kingdoms and that Christians bear **eschatological hope** into civic life as a moral orientation. With Kuyper, he shares a deep affirmation of Christ’s lordship over all of life and a sympathy for differentiated authorities. Yet he cautions that **neo-Calvinist** transformationalism sometimes dissolves jurisdictional clarity, tempting churches to become culture-making agencies and tempting states to sacralize policy.

This triangulation issues in a more precise language of ends and instruments. The **church’s end** is fellowship with God through **word, sacrament, and discipline**; its instrument is **spiritual authority**. The **state’s end** is public peace and justice; its instrument is **law and coercion**. **Sphere sovereignty** adds valuable attention to family, school, and voluntary associations, which Tuininga integrates as sites of civil society under Christ’s temporal rule. But Calvin’s **two kingdoms** remains the primary grammar for sorting the church’s public witness from its members’ varied vocations, thereby shielding the **pulpit** from partisan capture and keeping **magistracy** from theological usurpation.

#### 6. Conscience, persecution, and religious liberty
A distinctive contribution of Tuininga’s scholarship is his sustained attention to **conscience** and **persecution** in the **Reformed** tradition. Drawing on **Calvin**, early **Huguenot** resistance theory, and post-Reformation debates, he traces how a strong doctrine of **conscience coram Deo** can ground **religious liberty** in pluralist societies without abandoning claims about truth. For Calvin, conscience requires instruction and correction by **Scripture** and church discipline; for the magistrate, conscience demands restraint in coercing ultimate matters of worship. Tuininga applies this to contemporary debates by defending rights of **free exercise** and **non-establishment** as instruments of public peace and justice that also serve the church’s mission.

This analysis also illuminates the difference between churchly **discipline** and state **punishment**. Tuininga underscores that excommunication is not a civil disability but a spiritual judgment aimed at repentance and restoration, while civil penalties must be proportionate, public, and limited to the realm of temporal harms. The retrieval of a textured **Reformed** doctrine of **discipline** thus allows churches to uphold confessional integrity without seeking recourse to the state’s sword, even as they advocate in the public square for laws that protect the vulnerable and uphold basic moral goods.

#### 7. The moral grammar of natural law and Scripture
Tuininga’s constructive ethic depends on an interplay of **natural law** and **Scripture**. He frames **lex naturalis** as the creational order discerned by reason, damaged by sin yet not destroyed, rendering many civil norms accessible to believers and unbelievers. But he also insists that biblical revelation clarifies and reorients moral knowledge, especially on contested questions of **marriage**, **sexuality**, and **the sanctity of life**. The Bible’s authority is **normative** for the church’s teaching and the believer’s conscience; natural law functions as a mode of public reasoning that can commend substantive goods without presupposing confessional faith. This is a disciplined **bilingualism**: the one moral order of God communicates in two registers for two audiences and two jurisdictions, under the one **Christus Rex**.

Here Tuininga appropriates insights from **O’Donovan** on the resurrection’s moral authority, while maintaining the **Reformed** emphasis on the law’s threefold use and the priority of **special revelation** within the church. His natural-law retrieval remains Augustinian and Calvinian rather than purely Thomist, alert to **concupiscence** and the need for **prudence**. Against fears that natural law licenses theological neutrality, he answers that the two kingdoms are united in Christ’s sovereignty and that ecclesial preaching should not be muted. Against the charge that Scripture alone suffices, he argues that civil law by its nature governs diverse peoples for temporal ends, a task that calls for common moral grammar even as Christians confess the fullness of divine law revealed in Christ.

#### 8. Vocations, diaspora, and public hope
Tuininga appropriates the **diaspora** motif to describe the church’s posture in liberal democracies. The church is a pilgrim people, resident aliens whose public voice is prophetic rather than managerial. This diasporic posture curbs triumphalist dreams of **culture war** conquest while avoiding privatized withdrawal. The church’s worship, catechesis, and discipline generate **virtues** of patience, justice, and charity that leaven civic life through the faithful vocations of its members. The church addresses the state with frank counsel, invoking **natural law** and neighbor-love to frame legislative goods, while the state protects the church’s freedom and the equal rights of all.

This vision grounds hope not in the sacralization of the regime but in the **kingdom of God** that both judges and sustains political orders. The **eschatological** horizon disciplines expectations and animates perseverance. Christians seek the **common good** in law and policy but do not confuse the penultimate order with the consummate. In Tuininga’s idiom, public hope is a form of **caritas** rendered under Christ’s temporal rule and nourished by the church’s spiritual rule, ensuring that the church’s distinct holiness and the state’s civil justice mutually benefit rather than consume one another.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation: strengths, tensions, and alternatives
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Tuininga’s retrieval of **Calvin’s two kingdoms** admirably clarifies jurisdictional boundaries, protects the **church’s spiritual mission**, and equips Christians for public service without ecclesial politicization. His accent on **discipline and the keys**, on prudential **religious liberty**, and on an Augustinian **pilgrim** eschatology is salutary. Yet tensions remain. First, his reliance on **natural law** as a common moral grammar faces the **antithesis** emphasized by Van Tilian **presuppositional** critique: fallen reason is not merely dimmed but directionally opposed to God’s truth, making public accessibility fragile for matters like **marriage** or **life** where suppressive unrighteousness reshapes reason’s deliverances. Second, his deference to liberal-democratic **procedures** risks underestimating how late-modern regimes catechize citizens with rival **liturgies** and implicit theologies, threatening the very **conscience** he seeks to protect. Third, the calibration of grace and nature could be tightened by integrating **Kuyper’s sphere sovereignty** and a **covenant** theology of creation and redemption, which specify creational ordinances and institutional competencies under Christ’s one lordship without relying as heavily on contested accounts of **lex naturalis**. A constructive alternative within classical orthodoxy would maintain Tuininga’s two-kingdoms instrumentality, strengthen the role of **special revelation** for norming contested moral questions, and construe public reasoning as unapologetically confessional yet civically responsible, trusting the Spirit’s use of truthful speech more than the neutrality of common rationalities. Even so, Tuininga’s work remains a disciplined, timely contribution that renders **Calvin’s political theology** workable for pluralist contexts while honoring the church’s distinct calling.
