### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Kelly M. Kapic emerges as a leading voice in contemporary **Reformed dogmatics** who holds together academic rigor and pastoral concern, teaching at **Covenant College** and writing for the church as well as the academy. His work is situated within a wave of late twentieth and early twenty-first century **evangelical ressourcement**, the retrieval of **classical Reformed** sources such as **Calvin** and **John Owen** alongside constructive dialogue with **modern theology** from **Barth** to **Webster**. Formed by study in the British and American contexts and shaped by ecclesial service, he reads **Scripture** as the norma normans within the interpretive school of the **Reformed confessions**, yet he refuses a narrow biblicism by welcoming catholic resources from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**. At the heart of his method is a disciplined **doxological posture** that nurtures truth for the sake of love, a stance he names as a theological **habitus** of humility and wonder before the **Triune God**.

Kapic gives this method its crispest programmatic statement in **A Little Book for New Theologians** 2012, where theology is construed as faithful knowledge of God marked by **prayer, holiness, and love of neighbor**. He insists that the theologian must cultivate **epistemic humility** without surrendering the churchs confession of **divine simplicity** and **aseity**, and that genuine understanding requires both intellectual discipline and **affectus** directed toward the **gloria Dei**. This approach is amplified in his editorial labors in **Mapping Modern Theology** 2012, which introduces major doctrinal loci while modeling critical charity toward diverse voices in **modern dogmatics**. Kapic thus represents a retrieval that is neither antiquarian nor iconoclastic, but a constructive and ecclesially accountable **pastoral dogmatics**.

#### 2. Gift, Trinity, and the shape of the gospel
The early and ongoing pivot of Kapics constructive work is the grammar of **gift and generosity** as an ontology of grace. In **God So Loved, He Gave** 2010, coauthored with **Justin Borger**, and later in **The God Who Gives** 2018, Kapic unfolds a narrative dogmatics in which the **Triune Gods** eternal plenitude overflows in **creation**, **covenant**, and **redemption**. Grace is not a commodity or an abstract substance but the **self-giving of the Father through the Son in the Spirit**, the missions of the **Logos** and the **Spiritus** that echo the eternal *perichoresis*. He integrates **union with Christ** and **adoption** into a dynamic soteriology that honors **Calvins duplex gratia**, justification and sanctification as inseparable gifts that locate believers within the triune economy of giving and receiving. With measured appreciation, Kapic engages recent accounts of gift in **John Barclay** and **Miroslav Volf**, while resisting any reduction of **charis** to social theory by tethering generosity to the **homoousios** confession and **creatio ex nihilo**.

Throughout these treatments Kapic is careful to preserve the **Creator-creature distinction**. The divine generosity does not collapse into emanation, nor does it compromise **divine aseity**. Instead, creation is sheer **donum**, a gratuitous gift that invites *grata refero* the return of gratitude without implying divine lack. Soteriology is thus construed not as a legal mechanism detached from the giver but as **participation in Christ** through the Spirit, guarded by the forensic clarity of **imputation** and the covenantal form of the **ordo salutis**. The ecclesial result is a doxological community shaped by **Eucharistic thanksgiving**, the **communio sanctorum** whose practices enact reception of the generously self-giving **Triune God**.

#### 3. The doctrine of God under the sign of generosity
Kapics doctrine of God holds classic **Reformed orthodoxy** while furnishing a pastoral idiom. He affirms **divine simplicity, immutability, and impassibility**, yet he refuses to interpret these in a way that stifles biblical testimony to Gods **covenantal compassion**. Divine impassibility signifies the fullness and constancy of divine love such that the **Triune God** is not vulnerable to manipulation or change, even as the economy reveals true divine pity in the **incarnate Son**. The grammar is Chalcedonian, maintaining that in the one person of **Christ** the properties of the human nature carry the pathos of suffering, while the person is the **Son consubstantial with the Father**, so that the compassionate acts are truly the acts of God toward us. Kapic thus counters caricatures of classical theism by elaborating how **perichoresis** and **mission** give the church a richer confession of Gods generous presence.

In creation and providence, Kapic locates agency within the triune economy of **gift**. **Creation ex nihilo** embodies gratuitous generosity, and **providence** is neither fatalistic nor deistic but the wise shepherding of the **Father** through the **Son** in the **Spirit** toward the sabbath rest of God. The covenant is read as the structured theater of divine giving, where **union with Christ** sets the elect within the history of **Abraham to Christ**, integrating **historia salutis** with the **ordo salutis**. This keeps redemption concrete, ecclesial, and sacramental without erasing the Protestant distinction of **Word and sacrament** under the primacy of the proclaimed **gospel**.

#### 4. Suffering, lament, and embodied hope
In **Embodied Hope** 2017 Kapic turns his theological lens toward **pain, suffering, and lament**, weaving biblical theology, doctrine, and pastoral wisdom into a single cloth. He takes aim at glib theodicies and thin therapeutics by centering the **incarnation**, the **cross**, and the **resurrection** as the grammar of hope for mortals confronted by evil and finitude. The book proposes that the churchs practices of prayer, confession, and shared life are not decorative but integral to how believers encounter the **crucified and risen Christ** amid affliction. Kapic appreciatively engages **Bonhoeffer** on costly grace and community, highlighting the **communion of saints** as the concrete space where suffering is named and carried before God in the **Psalms of lament**.

At the doctrinal level, Kapic protects **providence** and **divine goodness** without trivializing the shattering realities of disease, decay, and death. By tracing **Christological solidarity**, he insists that God does not stand at a clinical remove. Rather, the **Son** assumes our frailty, conquers death, and ministers through the **Spirit** in the cruciform patterns of the church. The outcome is a pastoral metaphysic of hope, grounded in the **resurrection** and nourished by **Word and sacrament**, that refuses both stoic resignation and sentimental triumphalism in favor of robust **Christian endurance**.

#### 5. Theological anthropology and the goodness of finitude
Kapics most distinctive constructive contribution is his theological anthropology of **finitude** in **Youre Only Human** 2022. He argues that many pastoral maladies arise from a failure to distinguish **sin** from **creaturely limits**, resulting in shame and restless productivity that war against the reception of **grace**. Drawing richly on **Sabbath**, **time**, and the rhythms of embodied life, Kapic frames finitude as an aspect of the **imago Dei** and not a defect to be overcome. He retrieves the dictum **gratia non tollit naturam sed perficit**, grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, and shows how **sanctification** forms habits of humble dependence rather than heroic self-construction.

This anthropology is deeply **Christological** and **pneumatological**. In the **incarnation**, the **Son** embraces human limits without sin, dignifying embodied temporality and social interdependence. In the **Spirit**, believers are freed from the tyranny of self-salvation to receive their creatureliness as gift, practicing **gratitude, patience, and Sabbath rest** as theological virtues. Kapic presses pastors and congregations to recalibrate expectations of growth, to see **union with Christ** as the source of identity, and to interpret limitations as the stage where divine generosity is displayed, all under the authority of **Scripture** and the **covenantal gospel**.

#### 6. Sanctification, communion, and Puritan retrieval
Kapics editorial and historical work on **John Owen** anchors his constructive themes. In **John Owen: Reformed Catholic, Renaissance Man** 2007, coedited with **Mark Jones**, and in the modern edition of **Owen’s Communion with the Triune God** 2007 with **Justin Taylor**, he opens a window on Puritan **communion with God** that is richly **Trinitarian** and pastorally acute. Owen’s insistence that believers commune distinctly with the **Father**, the **Son**, and the **Spirit** provides a template for Kapic’s own focus on **union with Christ** and the differentiated economy of grace. In **Sanctification** 2014, an edited volume, he convenes a conversation that retrieves **mortification and vivification**, **means of grace**, and **virtue formation**, arguing that holiness is the fruit of the **Spirit** rooted in adoption, not voluntarism or quietism.

This Puritan retrieval is filtered through a generous catholicity. Kapic situates Owen within the broader **Reformed scholastic** and **patristic** matrices, showing how careful metaphysics underwrites practice. Yet the accent is always practical, aimed at the cure of souls. The lexical tool **Pocket Dictionary of the Reformed Tradition** 2013 coauthored with **Wesley Vander Lugt** exemplifies his desire to equip churches and students with clear handles on **Reformed doctrine**, while resisting tribalism by pointing beyond slogans toward doctrinal depth. The cumulative effect is an ecclesial dogmatics that prizes **Word and sacrament**, **catechesis**, and the **communio sanctorum** as the arena of God’s sanctifying generosity.

#### 7. Scripture, tradition, and disciplined humility
Threading through Kapic’s corpus is a consistent account of **Scripture and tradition**. He argues that the **canon** is the unique voice of God, yet the catholic tradition offers tested wisdom for interpretation. In **A Little Book for New Theologians** 2012 he deploys **virtue epistemology** as a theological discipline, insisting that **humility, patience, and love** shape the reading of the **Word** as much as technical skill. His editorial project **Mapping Modern Theology** 2012, completed with **Bruce McCormack**, models how to read **modern theologians** critically yet appreciatively, clarifying both gains and losses in the trajectory from **Schleiermacher** to **Barth** and beyond.

Kapic is not a polemicist so much as a catechist of theological wisdom. He presses students and pastors to receive **doctrine** as doxology and discipleship, to see the unity of **orthodoxy and orthopraxy**, and to cultivate **affectus** that befits knowledge of the **Triune God**. This disciplined humility renders his dogmatics hospitable to outsiders while rooted in the **Reformed confessions**, a posture he believes is demanded by the **gospel of grace** that is always gift before it becomes task.

#### 8. Integrations and developments across the corpus
Taken together, Kapic’s work constitutes a coherent theological vision in which **gift and generosity**, **union with Christ**, and **creaturely finitude** interlock. The logic runs from **Trinity** to **creation** to **covenant** to **church**, with **suffering** and **sanctification** interpreted within that arc. Grace is not opposed to nature but heals and perfects it, and **salvation** is participation in the Son’s life by the Spirit in the concrete history of **Israel and Jesus**, secured by **imputation** and flowering in **communion**. The church’s practices are thus not ancillary. **Lament, Sabbath, Eucharist, catechesis**, and acts of mutual care are the appointed means by which the generous God forms a generous people.

Kapic’s constructive posture is one of careful retrieval. He guards **divine simplicity** while refusing to absolutize any single scholastic model, affirms **impassibility** while preaching about God’s **steadfast love** to the suffering, and champions **union with Christ** while upholding the clarity of **forensic justification**. By reading **John Owen** alongside **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, and by conversing with **Barth** and **Webster**, he maintains a classical **Reformed center** that is alert to modern concerns, especially the pastoral distortions that arise when churches mistake **finitude** for **fallenness**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a confessional **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Kapic’s project is a welcome exercise in **pastoral dogmatics** that preserves essentials while addressing contemporary wounds. Strengths include his clear affirmation of **Trinity, creation ex nihilo, providence, union with Christ, duplex gratia**, and the **means of grace**, his insistence that **Scripture** norm our theology, and his careful distinction between **creaturely finitude** and **sin**. Questions arise at several pressure points. First, the grammar of **gift and participation** can eclipse the forensic beam of **imputation** if not constantly clarified by the covenantal structure of the **Westminster Standards**, which anchor **justification** in Christ’s obedience and federal **headship**. A WTS reading will press for sharper articulation of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as the frame for divine generosity, so that gift is not detached from **covenant law-gospel** relations. Second, the compassionate idiom surrounding suffering, though pastorally necessary, requires vigilant confession of **divine impassibility** and **immutability** as per classical theism, lest divine love be rendered passible at the level of **ad intra** being rather than **ad extra** economy. Third, Kapic’s laudable embrace of **Sabbath** and limits should be set more explicitly in the eschatological **Lord’s Day** hope and the pattern of **Word and sacrament** administered by ordained means, thereby protecting creaturely rest from therapeutic reductionism and fastening it to **covenantal worship**. These cautions signal not rejection but alignment with his central aims. Within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, one can preserve Kapic’s insights by foregrounding **revelation by covenant**, affirming the primacy of **imputation** within **union with Christ**, and rendering **generosity** as the personal self-giving of the **Triune God** who remains simple, immutable, and impassible in se while lavish in mercy toward us in Christ.
