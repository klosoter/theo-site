### ESSAY
Adam J. Johnson’s signature contribution is to reframe Christian soteriology not as a contest among **atonement theories** but as an ordered contemplation of **God’s being in reconciliation**, coordinated by the **divine perfections** of the **triune God**. Emerging within the ferment of early twenty-first-century **Reformed** retrieval of **classical theism** and amid contentious disputes over **penal substitution**, **divine impassibility**, and the ethics of the cross, Johnson argues that the church’s diverse soteriological idioms coinhere because God is simple and perfect in his works *ad extra*. His program pivots on the claim that **atonement** is first a doctrine of **God** and only then a doctrine of **sin**, judgment, and grace. The result in works like **God’s Being in Reconciliation** and **The Reconciling Wisdom of God** is a dogmatic construction that foregrounds **divine simplicity**, **wisdom**, and **love**, while harvesting the strengths of **satisfaction**, **penal substitution**, **Christus Victor**, and **recapitulation** without collapsing them into one dominant metaphor.

Johnson’s formation is inseparable from the theological ambience shaped by **John Webster** and the critical yet appreciative engagement with **Karl Barth**. Educated in a context marked by the renewal of **theology proper** and the retrieval of **patristic** and **scholastic** resources, Johnson absorbed Webster’s conviction that dogmatics begins with the **perfections of God** and proceeds in disciplined **doxology**. In dialogue with **Church Dogmatics IV** on **reconciliation**, and in conversation with **Athanasius** and **Anselm** as well as **Aquinas** and **Calvin**, his work inhabits the post-2000 climate in which **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** are being rearticulated over against revisionist trajectories associated with **Moltmann** or **process theology**. Within the **Reformed** stream, his approach resonates with **Herman Bavinck’s** organic ontology and **Francis Turretin’s** ordering of loci, even as he appropriates **Barth’s** actualist insistence that God is who he is in his acts without surrendering the **extra Calvinisticum** or the Creator-creature distinction.

Methodologically, Johnson’s hallmark is a sapiential ordering of soteriology by **theology proper** through the grammar of the **divine perfections**. He reads Scripture canonically by **analogia fidei**, insisting that atonement discourse must be governed by what Holy Scripture teaches of God’s **simplicity** and **triunity**, and by the missions of the Son and Spirit that manifest the eternal processions *ad intra*. This theological ontology disciplines atonement talk to avoid fragmentation: the cross and resurrection display one wise, just, and loving act of the one **simple God**, expressed under multiple biblical images. Johnson’s constructive motif is that **wisdom** coordinates the many by relating them to the good order of God’s creative and redemptive teleology. He deploys a repertoire of classic terms such as **vicarious obedience**, **priestly mediation**, and **union with Christ** to prevent theory-reduction and to retain the scriptural breadth of sacrificial, judicial, and victorious idioms.

The monograph **God’s Being in Reconciliation** from 2012 presents Johnson’s mature dogmatic thesis in concentrated form. There he engages **Barth’s** doctrine of reconciliation to argue that atonement reveals, without exhausting, **God’s being** as the one who freely is toward us in grace, while maintaining the **extra Calvinisticum** so that the incarnate Son’s atoning work manifests rather than constitutes the divine life. Johnson aligns with **Barth** in refusing a speculative gap between *ad intra* and *ad extra*, yet retrieves **divine simplicity** to insist that the diverse soteriological operations are the single act of the one **triune God**. In distinction from **Moltmann’s** proposals that seem to revise **impassibility**, Johnson recommits to the classical claim that God is impassible in being and passionately loving in action, so that the **passion of Christ** is the hypostatic union’s historical determination of the Son’s human nature. This yields a reconciliation doctrine that is at once thoroughly **Christocentric** and resiliently **theocentric**.

In the same year, **Atonement: A Guide for the Perplexed** distilled Johnson’s integrative posture for students and pastors navigating the landscape created by **Gustaf Aulen’s** tripartite typology and the late modern polarization over **penal substitution**. Johnson neither multiplies models nor winnows them to a single favorite; instead he locates **satisfaction**, **penal substitution**, **Christus Victor**, **recapitulation**, and **moral influence** as scripturally warranted idioms converging in the one **work of Christ**. Drawing on **Irenaeus** and **Athanasius** to affirm the restorative and participatory ends of salvation, on **Anselm** and **Calvin** to articulate **satisfaction** and **vicarious obedience**, and on **Owen** and **Packer** to preserve the juridical density of **penal substitution**, he orders these motifs under the **divine perfections** of **justice** and **love**. The guide resists both historicist relativism and analytic reduction by staging the doctrine doxologically: the end of atonement discourse is praise of the **triune Lord** whose unified act enfolds many ordered goods.

Johnson’s 2016 volume, **The Reconciling Wisdom of God**, advances this constructive strategy by centering the **wisdom of God** as a dogmatic key for reframing atonement. He develops a sapiential reading of biblical witnesses such as 1 Corinthians 1 to 2, Proverbs, and Colossians, contending that the **crucified and risen Christ** is the embodiment of God’s **wisdom**, enacting the rectification of creation’s order. In this account, **wisdom** mediates between **providence** and **redemption**, clarifying how the cross relates to the teleology of creation, the governance of history, and the perfection of the saints in **union with Christ**. Along the way Johnson engages contemporary **analytic theology** on models of atonement, arguing that formal model-building must be chastened by the richer metaphysical and biblical content supplied by the **divine perfections**. The outcome is a constructive emphasis on the manifold goods realized by atonement: pacification of enemies, remission of sins, adoption, participation, and ecclesial formation, all unified by the wise purpose of the **triune God**.

As editor of the **T&T Clark Companion to Atonement** in 2017, Johnson convened a broad field of voices to display the catholic range of **atonement** doctrine across **patristic**, **medieval**, **Reformation**, and **modern** periods. The Companion’s architecture exhibits his conviction that historical typologies must be situated under **theology proper** and read in terms of **divine simplicity** and **perfections**. Contributions explore **Anselmian satisfaction**, **Aquinas’s** sacrificial metaphysics, **Reformed** developments in **penal substitution**, and contemporary assessments of **Christus Victor**, narratival soteriology, and political critiques of **sacrifice**. By mapping the discourse without canonizing a single paradigm, Johnson’s editorial labor stabilizes the field for constructive dogmatics and signals a research agenda: the integrative retrieval of **atonement** within a robust **doctrine of God**.

Doctrinally, Johnson organizes atonement around the **triune missions** and the Son’s **vicarious obedience** culminating in the cross and resurrection. The **Father** sends the Son in the Spirit to reconcile the world, so the atonement’s identity is irreducibly **trinitarian**. The Son assumes our nature to perform a life of perfect filial **obedience** and priestly **self-offering**, bearing the curse as **penal substitution** and achieving **satisfaction** that is personal and covenantal rather than transactional in abstraction. The **Spirit** unites believers to Christ so that the benefits of redemption flow to them in **union with Christ**, securing justification, adoption, sanctification, and incorporation into the church. Under **divine simplicity**, these goods are aspects of one simple act that conforms us to Christ’s image and shares in his victory, so that **Christus Victor** and **recapitulation** do not compete with **satisfaction** and **penal** motifs but arise from the same wise love and just mercy. Sacramentally, Johnson hints at the Eucharist as the church’s participation in the reconciled life, and ecclesiologically he stresses the cross as the pattern of communal holiness and mission under the lordship of the **triune God**.

Johnson’s constructive moves frequently turn on redeploying contested divine attributes in service of soteriology. He defends **divine impassibility** in a Christological key, insisting with **Aquinas**, **Athanasius**, and **Bavinck** that the **impassible** God genuinely loves and that the Son truly suffers in his human nature. He thus resists arguments that the cross proves a passible divine essence, aligning instead with recent **Reformed** retrievals of **simplicity** and **immutability** as conditions for the gospel’s stability. Simultaneously he responds to moral critiques of the cross, including nonviolent concerns associated with writers like **Weaver** or post-Aulen polemics against **penal substitution**, by stressing that the Father and the Son act in the one **Spirit** in perfect unity of will, so that the atonement is not divine child abuse but the Son’s **self-offering** in love. To narratival proposals such as **N. T. Wright’s** emphasis on exile and return, he grants the indispensability of biblical story yet insists that story must be explicated in terms of **theology proper** and the **perfections** of **justice** and **mercy**.

Throughout, Johnson is a catholic Reformed theologian whose interlocutors are generous and whose retrievals are disciplined. He learns from **Irenaeus’s** **recapitulation** without surrendering **forensic** justification, and from **Anselm’s** **satisfaction** while clarifying that the personal God of Scripture is not bound by impersonal honor codes. He reads **Calvin** on **vicarious obedience** and **union with Christ**, deploying **Owen’s** precision on **penal substitution**, and he appropriates **Bavinck’s** organic synthesis of **dogmatics** to integrate creation and redemption. His engagement with **Barth** is appreciative yet selective: God is who he is in his acts, but Johnson guards the **extra Calvinisticum** to resist any identification of God’s essence with his reconciling work. In conversation with **Torrance**, **Packer**, and **Aulen**, Johnson holds the lines of catholicity and Reformed identity by refusing either historicist diffusion or sectarian narrowing.

A brief word on disciplinary location: Johnson’s work emerges in institutions shaped by evangelical **catechesis** and Great Books pedagogy, so his prose seeks doxological clarity beyond purely academic polemic. Nevertheless, he operates within a scholarly network whose norms include careful **ressourcement**, attention to **exegetical** warrant, and use of conceptual tools from **scholastic** metaphysics. His essays on **simplicity** and atonement exemplify this: conceptual precision serves pastoral and homiletical aims, so that the doctrine is not merely true but spiritually nourishing. That dual register explains both the breadth of his editorial curation in the **T&T Clark Companion** and the readability of **Atonement: A Guide for the Perplexed**.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Johnson’s ordering of atonement under **theology proper**, his retrieval of **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability**, and his affirmation of **penal substitution** within a larger field of motifs commend his project to classical **Reformed** sensibilities. Yet Westminster instincts will probe several tensions. First, the **Barthian** accent on God’s being in act can risk muting the principled, covenantal architecture of redemption, where **pactum salutis**, **covenant of works**, and **federal headship** structure **satisfaction** and **imputation** in explicitly **forensic** terms. Johnson’s sapiential synthesis might be strengthened by granting confessional priority to the law-gospel contrast and the courtroom grammar of **justification** alongside the participatory and victorious idioms. Second, his deployment of **divine simplicity** as an integrating heuristic should be tethered to the specific **covenantal** administrations by which the one simple act is historically differentiated, lest unity flatten the typological richness by which Scripture distributes **sacrifice**, **ransom**, and **conquest** across redemptive epochs. Third, WTS concerns about **Barth’s** actualism and the method of beginning with **theology proper** rather than with **covenant revelation** suggest alternative paths: anchoring atonement in the **covenant of redemption**, in **Owen’s** precise account of **double imputation** and the Son’s **active obedience**, and in **Turretin’s** careful distinctions that protect the Creator-creature distinction in a Van Tilian key. In sum, Johnson offers a powerful, doxologically rich retrieval that many Reformed readers can gladly receive, provided his integrative frame is decisively articulated in terms of **covenant**, **federal** representation, and the primacy of **forensic justification** under the sovereign wisdom of the **triune God**.
