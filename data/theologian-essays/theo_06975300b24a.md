### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The career of **Jerry L. Walls** emerges at the crossroads of the **analytic philosophy of religion** renaissance and a renewed **Wesleyan theological** confidence in the doctrinal coherence of **holiness** and **grace**. Educated in philosophy at **Notre Dame** amid the influence of **Alvin Plantinga** and the broader movement to rehabilitate **theistic metaphysics**, Walls absorbed a style of argument that prizes clear modal analysis, attention to possible worlds semantics, and the use of **perfect being theology** to test claims about **divine goodness** and **justice**. Teaching for many years at **Asbury Theological Seminary**, he located his philosophical work within a Methodist tradition shaped by **John Wesley’s** doctrine of **prevenient grace** and **entire sanctification**, while engaging the public square through analytic apologetics. The guiding intuition that frames his ouevre is that the doctrines of **heaven**, **hell**, and **purgatory** can be vindicated before the tribunal of reason if one insists on **libertarian freedom** and the universality of **God’s love**.

Walls’s methodological stance is both confessional and argumentative. He affirms **Arminian-Wesleyan** commitments about **universal atonement**, **resistible grace**, and the reality of **apostasy**, while insisting that such claims must be expressible in the language of **analytic theology** and defensible against objections from **atheism**, **moral anti-realism**, and **determinist theism**. This leads him to leverage **free will theodicy**, the resources of **modal logic** drawn from **Plantinga**, and a broadly **moral realist** vision that underwrites the normative weight of divine commands without reducing them to voluntarism. The ethos is neither fideistic nor rationalistic. It is a disciplined attempt to show that the **Wesleyan vision of holiness** is not an aesthetic adornment on doctrine but the structural key to **eschatology** and **soteriology** understood as transformation into **perfect love**.

#### 2. The infernal question: hell and the logic of damnation
Walls established his program with **Hell: The Logic of Damnation** in 1992, a pioneering contribution in the contemporary analytic discourse on **eternal punishment**. Against the charge that an everlasting hell is disproportionate or morally incoherent, he argues that the central issue is not retribution measured by temporal offense but the rational possibility of **self-exclusion from God** by creatures endowed with **libertarian freedom**. Drawing on **C. S. Lewis’s** picture of hell as the trajectory of the self into isolation, Walls reconstructs the doctrine so that the eternity of hell reflects the fixity of character that results from repeated, culpable refusals of **grace**. He rejects **annihilationism** as too sanguine about the moral seriousness of sin, and he distances himself from **universalism** as incompatible with freedom understood as the power of contrary choice. The positive proposal stresses **God’s universal salvific will**, robust **prevenient grace**, and the meaningfulness of **free will**, while insisting that divine love does not necessitate the consent of rational agents.

The argument is not merely pastoral. Walls treats hell as a test case in **moral theodicy**. If God is essentially good, then any doctrine of damnation must be compatible with **perfect justice** and **perfect love**. The reconciliation of these hinges on the affirmation that God will extend **optimal grace**, that is, a form of grace sufficient to enable a serious and informed choice for or against God. If after such grace some finally refuse the good, eternal separation can be defended as the recognition of creaturely dignity even in the tragedy of **self-chosen loss**. He develops a careful response to the worry of **soteriological luck**, contending that the divine economy must include means by which historical and cultural disadvantages are rectified, a line of thought that opens naturally into his later case for **postmortem evangelization**.

#### 3. The telos of salvation: heaven and perfect joy
In **Heaven: The Logic of Eternal Joy** in 2002, Walls advances a complementary vision of the redeemed end. Here the **Wesleyan** theme of **entire sanctification** is made eschatological. If the divine purpose is to form creatures capable of **agapeic love**, then heaven must be construed as a community of perfected freedom in which moral struggle has ripened into settled character. Drawing implicitly on **Thomas Aquinas** and explicitly on **C. S. Lewis**, Walls depicts the beatific future not as static contemplation alone but as dynamic participation in **God’s goodness** that secures the identity of persons in purified communion. The ethical core is transformation into **holy love**, which functions as the moral grammar uniting **justification** and **sanctification**.

Walls again deploys **perfect being theology**. If God is perfectly good, heaven must satisfy conditions worthy of God’s creative and redemptive intent. He therefore resists minimalist soteriologies that reduce salvation to legal acquittal and offers an enriched **teleological** account that assigns primacy to interpersonal union with God and neighbor. The logic of heaven, on his telling, confirms that the conditions for the exercise of **libertarian freedom** are not negated in the eschaton but fulfilled, as the will is stabilized in the supreme good without causal necessitation. This emphasizes a Wesleyan confidence that grace heals the will rather than replaces it, and that the **imago Dei** reaches its flourishing in a perfected capacity for **love**.

#### 4. Between grace and glory: Protestant purgatory and postmortem hope
The most distinctive contribution of **Jerry L. Walls** may be his development of **Protestant purgatory** in **Purgatory: The Logic of Total Transformation** in 2011. Aware of **Council of Trent** polemics and of **Reformed** rejection of postmortem purification, he reconstructs purgatory without the medieval apparatus of **temporal punishments**, **meritorious satisfactions**, or **indulgences**. The core claim is that if sanctification is necessary for heaven, and if many die short of **entire sanctification**, then a postmortem process of **total transformation** is both theologically fitting and consonant with **Wesleyan holiness**. He roots this in **prevenient grace** extended beyond death, locating purgatory within the economy of grace rather than within a works scheme. Thus the doctrine becomes an extended application of **sanctifying grace** culminating in perfected love.

Two argumentative threads fortify this proposal. First, the problem of **soteriological luck** suggests that the divine justice of **good God** requires that salvation not be hostage to the accidents of birth, history, or the quality of evangelization one receives. Walls argues for a **postmortem evangelization** that provides those who lacked an adequate opportunity to respond to **Christ’s grace** with such an opportunity after death. Second, the concern for moral character presses that even those who are justified require deeper healing. Purgatory supplies the place where love’s medicine completes its work. The result is a **Protestant** and **Wesleyan** model that preserves **sola gratia** while explaining the sanctifying continuity between this life and the next. This proposal has provoked sustained debate with **Reformed** theologians who hear in it a revision of the sufficiency of **Christ’s atonement**, and with **Roman Catholics** who find the revision insufficiently sacramental and ecclesial, yet it marks Walls as a leading voice for ecumenical rethinking of **last things**.

#### 5. Calvinism contested: universal love and libertarian freedom
Walls’s polemical front against **determinist soteriology** appears in **Why I Am Not a Calvinist** in 2004, coauthored with **Joseph Dongell**. The thesis is straightforward. If **God’s love** is universally redemptive and if moral responsibility requires **libertarian freedom**, then **unconditional election**, **limited atonement**, and **irresistible grace** misrepresent the character of the **gospel**. The argument is not merely exegetical. It is a philosophical appraisal of **compatibilist freedom** that concludes such freedom is insufficient for responsibility as desert and for the authenticity of love. The authors mount a case that **prevenient grace** enables a genuinely free response to the **call of the gospel**, and they fault **double predestination** for entailing that God antecedently wills the damnation of the non-elect, a verdict incompatible with the moral argument for a **good God**.

In pressing this case, Walls leans on a conceptual framework that includes **perfect being theology**, the **free will defense** refined by **Alvin Plantinga**, and a nuanced appeal to **Molinist** resources where helpful to show how God can strongly actualize a world with robust creaturely freedom without causally determining sin. He underscores that God can and does orchestrate **optimal grace** for every person, increasing hope for salvation while safeguarding freedom. The proposed synergy between **grace** and **freedom** remains a point of dispute with **Reformed** interlocutors such as **Paul Helm** and **Oliver Crisp**, who argue that divine sovereignty and exhaustive providence are better secured by compatibilism and decree. Walls answers that sovereignty without moral goodness is a pyrrhic victory, and that **Arminian-Wesleyan** theism secures both in a more coherent way.

#### 6. Moral realism and theistic foundations
The philosophical backbone of Walls’s theism is elaborated in his collaborations with **David Baggett**, notably **Good God: The Theistic Foundations of Morality** in 2011 and **God and Cosmos** in 2016. Against **Euthyphro** worries and **robust atheistic moral realism** defended by figures like **Erik Wielenberg**, they argue that the best explanation of objective moral values, obligations, and the authority structure of normativity is **theism** with a rich doctrine of **God’s nature** as the locus of **the Good**. They resist both voluntarist divine command theories that detach morality from divine character and secular accounts that lack ontological resources for normativity with authority. The conclusion is that **moral realism** is not merely consistent with theism but finds in the **Trinitarian God** its most coherent ground.

This moral argument is not ancillary but integrated with Walls’s **eschatology**. If moral truths are objective, then the shape of **heaven**, **hell**, and **purgatory** must reflect the requirements of **justice** and **love**. If moral agents are dignified as free, then **libertarian freedom** must frame blame and praise. If moral guilt is not trivial, then **hell** cannot be dismissed as a medieval construct. If moral transformation is the telos, then **purgatory** or an equivalent process of robust sanctification is theologically apt. Walls’s broader project thus seeks a coherent moral universe in which the **character of God** explains the structure of salvation and the logic of last things.

#### 7. Ecclesial protest and catholicity without Rome
With **Kenneth Collins**, Walls authored **Roman but Not Catholic** in 2017, a comprehensive critique of **Roman Catholic** claims regarding **papal primacy**, **magisterial infallibility**, and **ecclesial indefectibility**. The argument is historically informed and theologically motivated by a **Protestant** understanding of **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **conciliar fallibility**, and the need for a chastened catholicity that refrains from locating indefectibility in a single episcopal office. The authors affirm much of **Catholic** doctrinal heritage on **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **moral theology**, while contending that the Roman system exceeds the warrant of Scripture and the patterns of the early church. This work deepens Walls’s profile as a **Wesleyan** ecumenist who pursues broad consensus on creedally central matters yet maintains a **Reformation** protest where authority claims undermine gospel primacy.

The ecclesial critique interfaces with his **purgatory** work. Walls’s Protestant purgatory deliberately disentangles postmortem sanctification from **indulgences** and the **treasury of merits**, casting it instead as an application of **sanctifying grace**. His ecclesiology affirms the church as a means of grace, not as the juridical manager of a purgatorial economy. The continuity of themes shows how his **Methodist** identity governs both soteriological and ecclesial judgments, yielding a catholicity without capitulation to **Roman** centralization.

#### 8. Development, coherence, and influence
Across three decades, **Jerry L. Walls** has pursued a single project with remarkable coherence. The trilogy **Hell** 1992, **Heaven** 2002, and **Purgatory** 2011 articulates a unified **eschatology** under the constraints of **perfect being theology** and **libertarian freedom**. The polemic **Why I Am Not a Calvinist** 2004 positions that eschatology within a broader **Arminian-Wesleyan** soteriology focused on **prevenient grace**, **universal atonement**, and the seriousness of **apostasy**. The moral works with **David Baggett** supply the metaphysical grounding of **moral realism** necessary for the whole. The ecclesial critique with **Kenneth Collins** displays how his doctrinal judgments extend to questions of **authority** and **catholicity**. His influence is felt in **analytic theology** courses, in **Wesleyan** seminaries, and in ecumenical conversations about **purgatory** and **postmortem salvation**.

Walls’s interlocutors span analytic theism and historical theology. He credits and engages **Alvin Plantinga** on **free will defense**, dialogues with **Robert Adams** on **divine goodness**, disputes **Erik Wielenberg** on non-theistic moral realism, interacts with **Thomas Aquinas** on **purgatorial purification**, cites **C. S. Lewis** on **hell** and **sanctification**, and debates **Thomas Talbott** on **universalism**. Reformed conversation partners like **Paul Helm** and **Oliver Crisp** sharpen disagreements over **compatibilism**, **divine decree**, and the nature of **grace**. The result is a body of work exemplary of **analytic theology** at the service of a particular confessional tradition without retreating into parochialism.

#### 9. Doctrinal contributions in systematic perspective
Set within the loci of **systematic theology**, Walls’s contributions are notable in three areas. First, in **the doctrine of God**, he articulates **God’s goodness** as intrinsically moral and non-arbitrary, employing **perfect being theology** to maintain that divine sovereignty cannot license the willing of sin or damnation apart from creaturely desert rooted in **libertarian freedom**. Second, in **soteriology**, he argues for **prevenient grace** that universally enables response, optional use of **Molinist** insight to explain providence without causal determinism, and a thick account of **sanctification** culminating in **entire sanctification** as **love perfected**. Third, in **eschatology**, he offers a coherent triad of **heaven**, **hell**, and **purgatory** that honors moral responsibility, avoids universalism, and explains the adequacy of **divine justice** and **mercy** through the idea of **optimal grace** and **postmortem evangelization** where necessary.

These proposals are framed by a robust **moral realism** that grounds normativity in **God’s nature**, answering **Euthyphro** pressures and resisting secular alternatives. The architecture shows the marks of **analytic theology** at every step: carefully stated theses, argument from premises about freedom and goodness, and willingness to test confessional claims by their consistency with **perfect being** constraints. While some will fault the project for privileging philosophical criteria, Walls would respond that **faith seeking understanding** obliges precisely this exercise under the light of **Scripture**, reason, and **tradition**, with **Wesleyan** emphases on holiness and grace as the interpretive key.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, the strengths of **Jerry L. Walls** are clear. He defends **theism** against secular moral skepticism, takes **divine holiness** and **justice** with seriousness, and refuses sentimental universalism. Yet principled tensions remain. First, his commitment to **libertarian freedom** and **prevenient grace** sits uneasily with **Reformed** accounts of **total depravity**, **effectual calling**, and **compatibilist freedom** grounded in **God’s decree**. The Reformed insist that true responsibility is compatible with sovereign determination, and that **regeneration** is the decisive monergistic work that frees, rather than merely enables, the will. Second, his **optimal grace** and **postmortem evangelization** proposals challenge the **covenantal** structure of history in which the means of grace are ordained within time and community, and they risk undermining the urgency of **gospel preaching** as the appointed instrument by which the Spirit effectually calls the elect. Third, the doctrine of **Protestant purgatory** threatens the **sufficiency of Christ’s atonement** as understood in **Reformed** categories of **definitive sanctification** and **union with Christ**, where progressive sanctification flows from an accomplished status rather than requiring a postmortem therapeutic state. Finally, Walls’s moral constraints on **divine sovereignty**, while laudable in intent, can appear to subordinate revelation to **philosophical reason**, whereas **Reformed orthodoxy** would argue that Scripture’s covenantal depiction of **God’s freedom**, **particular grace**, and **effectual love** offers a more biblically integrated account of holy sovereignty. A sympathetic Reformed alternative would commend **compatibilist freedom**, **particular redemption**, and **effectual calling**, anchoring assurance and transformation in **union with Christ** by the Spirit, while holding that the public scandal of **hell** must be received under the mystery of decree rather than reconstructed under libertarian presuppositions.
