### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Thomas H. McCall emerges as a leading voice in contemporary **philosophical theology**, working across the seams of analytic philosophy and dogmatic retrieval to serve evangelical ecclesial life. Formed in the milieu of **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School** and its **Henry Center for Theological Understanding**, and later joining **Asbury University** in 2020, McCall navigates late modern debates with a steady eye on **pro-Nicene** standards. The intellectual backdrop includes the rise of **analytic theology** in Anglophone contexts, renewed interest in **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**, and contentious evangelical disputes over **eternal functional subordination** and atonement. McCall’s self-presentation is neither a pure philosopher of religion nor a historicist systematician. He is an evangelical dogmatician who believes that the creedal and conciliar tradition is materially true, that **Scripture** rules as norma normans, and that the virtues of analytic discourse can clarify rather than supplant the church’s teaching.

Methodologically McCall commends what he calls analytic dogmatics, a practice that honors **revelation** while deploying careful distinctions and arguments. In **An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology** of 2015 he specifies the virtues of clarity, charity, courage, and conceptual patience, urging theologians to treat doctrinal claims as truth-apt and to refuse both fideistic retreat and rationalistic arrogance. Against dismissive claims that metaphysics is alien to theology, McCall retrieves the classical confidence that **metaphysics** can be ministerial to **theologia** when tethered to **exegesis**, creed, and the communion of saints. He opposes a lazy employment of the word mystery that hides contradictions, yet insists that properly apophatic reserve is integral to doctrines like **divine simplicity** or the **incarnation** where *ad intra* identity and *ad extra* missions permanently exceed our comprehension.

#### 2. Pro-Nicene trinitarianism against social tritheism
McCall’s most sustained constructive work in trinitarian ontology appears in **Which Trinity? Whose Monotheism?** of 2010. The book names a twofold concern. First, some proposals of **social trinitarianism** construe the divine nature as a kind instantiated by three instances, thus compromising **monotheism**. Second, analytic treatments that invoke **relative identity** or mutable divine properties can distort **homoousios** and the **inseparable operations** of Father, Son, and Spirit. Against such trajectories, McCall argues for numerical unity of the **divine essence**, not a generic unity. The one God is simple, and the three hypostases are not three individuals of a species but three **subsistent relations** eternally constituted by **eternal generation** and **spiration**. The result retrieves a **Latin trinitarianism** anchored in **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and **Aquinas**, and calibrated to resist the tritheistic pressure that he discerns in models advanced by **Richard Swinburne**, **William Hasker**, and the duo of **William Lane Craig and J. P. Moreland**.

Here McCall’s preferred grammar foregrounds **inseparable operations** and **one will** in God, reminding readers that the missions reflect the processions without collapsing the persons. On mission, the Son is sent and assumes a human nature; on procession, the Son is from the Father by **eternal generation**. These are asymmetrical relations, yet they do not entail a subordination of essence or will. To safeguard this, McCall rejects the use of **relative identity** as a way to resolve the identity puzzles of Trinity. He instead commends well-tried conciliar distinctions: essence and person, relation and subsistence, mission and procession. In polemical mode he shows that social models that prize three centers of consciousness and three wills can amount to three gods, whereas pro-Nicene teaching secures **homoousios** as the grammar by which triune life is unity of action and unity of power.

#### 3. The EFS controversy and Nicene will
McCall’s public significance among evangelicals intensified during the controversy over **eternal functional subordination** in the mid 2010s. He argued in essays and lectures that the thesis of an eternal authority of the Father and a corresponding eternal submission of the Son implies either two wills in God or a property of subordination that differentiates the divine essence, both of which are incompatible with **Nicene orthodoxy**. The burden of his critique is that EFS confuses *ad extra* missions with *ad intra* processions, recasting the obedience of the incarnate Christ as the eternal mode of the Son’s relation to the Father. Against this, he deploys **inseparable operations**, **unity of will**, and the doctrine of **eternal generation** to show that the Father’s paternity and the Son’s filiation are not roles assumed under a covenant of redemption but eternal relations of origin that do not imply ontological inequality.

In taking this stance, McCall confronted evangelical leaders who had advanced EFS as a ground for complementarian ethics, including **Bruce Ware** and **Wayne Grudem**, and he received support from pro-Nicene scholars such as **Fred Sanders** and **Steven Holmes**. He demonstrated that appeals to **homoousios** cannot sit with a theory of authority and submission within the life of God understood as an eternal command structure. The Son’s incarnate obedience is a property of the human will assumed by the Word in the incarnation. It is not an eternal feature of the divine will. This argument, combined with McCall’s careful retrieval of **inseparable operations**, helped catalyze a return in evangelical theology to a more classical account of the Trinity’s work and will.

#### 4. The cross without rupture and the grammar of impassibility
In **Forsaken: The Trinity and the Cross, and Why It Matters** first published in 2009, McCall treats the **cry of dereliction** and the inner-trinitarian significance of Calvary. He resists two errors. On one side, a voluntarist penal theory can suggest the Father’s wrath falls upon the Son in a way that fractures divine fellowship. On the other, modern theologies of the cross like those of **Jürgen Moltmann** and **Robert Jenson** can be read as positing rupture or change in God, thus jeopardizing **divine impassibility** and **immutability**. McCall insists that the atonement must be described within **Trinitarian** unity. The one God acts to reconcile by the Son’s self-offering in the power of the Spirit. The Son suffers and dies according to his **assumed human nature**, and through the **communicatio idiomatum** we speak truly of the passion of the Son of God, while maintaining that the divine nature does not suffer passively.

This careful grammar allows McCall to affirm **penal substitution** without caricature or divine child abuse. The Father does not vent anger upon an external other. Rather the triune God judges sin in the flesh of the incarnate Son as the Son freely offers himself. McCall retrieves **Chalcedonian** Christology, clarifies *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia* to avoid Nestorian fragmentation, and emphasizes that the atoning work is the single, inseparable act of Father, Son, and Spirit. The cry My God, my God, why have you forsaken me breathes the depth of the Son’s covenant solidarity with sinners, yet it does not imply ontological abandonment within the Trinity. The result is an evangelical rearticulation of the cross that maintains **impassibility** in a classical sense, while refusing Stoic caricatures and insisting on the dramatic reality of suffering in the incarnate life of the Son.

#### 5. Sin as privation, corruption, and culpability
McCall’s constructive work in hamartiology appears programmatically in **Against God and Nature: The Doctrine of Sin** published in 2020. There he advances an account of **original sin** and human agency that is Augustinian without fatalism and Wesleyan without moralism. Sin is construed as **privation** and disorder relative to God’s good order, but it is also radical corruption that implicates persons, powers, and institutions. McCall attends to **Romans 5**, the adamic root of human misery, and the disordered loves that characterize human willing. He defends deep responsibility while rejecting simplistic voluntarism. Here he leans toward **libertarian freedom** of the agent in the ordinary sense of alternative possibilities, yet he frames this freedom within the bondage described by **non posse non peccare** prior to grace.

On the contested matter of **imputation**, McCall acknowledges the federal patterns of Scripture while preferring to describe the adamic reality as the inherited condition of corruption and death rather than the immediate legal transfer of guilt. He highlights **solidarity** in Adam and in Christ, extending the corporate and representative dimensions without eclipsing personal responsibility. Though sympathetic to **prevenient grace** in a Wesleyan key, he stresses that salvation is wholly of **grace** and is realized only by union with Christ. Across the argument McCall’s analytic sensibility appears in careful attention to action theory, responsibility, and the metaphysics of powers, producing a doctrine of sin that engages **Augustine**, **Jonathan Edwards**, and **John Wesley** without capitulating to any single school.

#### 6. Christological precision and the reality of temptation
Beyond hamartiology and trinitarian doctrine, McCall has contributed to Christological debates, especially regarding **kenosis** and **impeccability**. He rejects strong **kenotic Christology** that posits the Logos’s divestment of divine attributes. In conversation with contemporary analytic models of **two minds** Christology associated with **Thomas Morris**, McCall preserves the **Chalcedonian** balance of one person in two natures, insisting on the real human mind and will of Jesus and the undiminished divinity of the Son. He affirms **impeccability**, the truth that the incarnate Son could not sin, grounded in the personal union, yet he argues that temptation was fully real according to the human will and within the economy of the Spirit. With the **communicatio idiomatum** he secures the truth of divine participation in human suffering and victory, while avoiding both Nestorian division and Eutychian confusion.

This Christological work connects to his soteriology. The obedient life and death of Christ are filial and Spirit-empowered acts that redeem human agency from bondage to sin. By emphasizing obedience as genuinely human, McCall also protects the anti-EFS insight that the Son’s earthly obedience belongs to the incarnate economy rather than to an eternal subordination in **immanent Trinity**. The result is a coherent pattern in which **pro-Nicene** trinitarianism, classical **Christology**, and evangelical soteriology interlock without contradiction.

#### 7. Programmatic leadership in analytic theology
McCall’s editorial, pedagogical, and institutional labors also matter. With **Michael Rea** he coedited **Philosophical and Theological Essays on the Trinity** in 2009, a landmark of cross-disciplinary collaboration that gathered philosophers of religion and systematic theologians to wrestle with **homoousios**, **perichoresis**, and **divine simplicity**. Through the **Henry Center for Theological Understanding** in the 2010s he curated dialogue between academics and the church, championing projects that join **retrieval** and **mission**. In **An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology** he addressed objections from **postliberal** trajectories that suspect metaphysics, demonstrating that analytic work can serve **exegesis**, nourish **doctrinal catechesis**, and promote the unity of **confession** and **reason**.

His program is marked by an ethical posture as well as an epistemic stance. Analytic theology, on McCall’s account, cultivates the intellectual humility to receive **creedal** authority and the courage to ask hard questions about coherence. It seeks the common good of the churches by refusing both scholastic insularity and anti-intellectual populism. By insisting that doctrines like **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and **eternal generation** are not esoteric inventions but hermeneutical guides to reading **Scripture**, McCall positions analytic dogmatics as a servant of the Great Tradition rather than as a competitor to it.

#### 8. Influence, reception, and ongoing debates
The influence of Thomas McCall can be traced across evangelical curricula, scholarly debates, and pastoral discourse. His critique of **eternal functional subordination** helped turn the tide of evangelical trinitarianism back toward **Nicene** and **protestant scholastic** norms, reshaping denominational statements and popular preaching on the **Trinity**. His account of the cross in **Forsaken** offered pastors a way to preach **penal substitution** within an explicitly **Trinitarian** framework that banishes images of intra-trinitarian conflict. His work on **sin** provides evangelical ethics with a thick description of personal and structural evil without dissolving culpability. And his programmatic defense of **analytic theology** has legitimized a style of evangelical reasoning that is confessional, constructive, and transparent.

Reception has not been uniform. Some defenders of **social trinitarianism** contest his charge of tritheism and continue to argue for models with three centers of consciousness. Proponents of EFS have refined their claims about **authority** and **submission**, though McCall’s insistence on **unity of will** remains a strict test. Within soteriology, Reformed critics have pressed him on **imputation** and **definite atonement**, and some classical theists urge a stronger affirmation of **impassibility** as **actus purus** without the qualifications he considers pastorally necessary. Yet across these debates McCall’s consistent posture is irenic but rigorous, a willingness to argue in the open while binding himself to the church’s credal center.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Thomas McCall’s corpus exhibits substantial convergence and a few significant tensions. The convergence is weighty. His resolute defense of **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, **eternal generation**, and **homoousios** aligns with **Westminster Confession** commitments and with **Calvin’s autotheos** properly understood within **pro-Nicene** grammar. His demolition of **eternal functional subordination** underscores the Reformed insistence on **one simple will** in God and on the categorical distinction between *ad intra* processions and *ad extra* missions. His cross-centered retrieval in **Forsaken** protects both **impassibility** and **penal substitution**, a combination the Reformed have long defended under the **communicatio idiomatum** and the pactum salutis understood as an economic, not ontological, ordering of the triune work.

The tensions arise chiefly where McCall’s Wesleyan sympathies and analytic commitments nudge him away from Reformed federalism. His inclination toward **libertarian freedom** complicates robust accounts of **providence** and moral inability, and his hesitancy about immediate **imputation** in Adam risks diluting the federal depth of **covenant** headship that grounds the forensic riches of **justification**. His occasional softening of **impassibility** language, meant to stress the genuineness of the Son’s suffering, can be tightened by the Reformed insistence on **pure act** and the asymmetry of attribution that keeps all divine *passiones* at the level of the person of the Son according to the assumed nature. Reformed alternatives would press **compatibilist freedom** under a high doctrine of **providence**, reaffirm immediate **imputation** alongside real corruption, and articulate **definite atonement** within the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity. Even where divergence remains, McCall’s work serves the Reformed by sharpening the shared **pro-Nicene** center and modeling a disciplined use of **analytic theology** harnessed to **Scripture** and creed.
