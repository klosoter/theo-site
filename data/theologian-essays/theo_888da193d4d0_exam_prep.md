### TITLE
Rudolf Bultmann is the paradigmatic modern NT theologian who preserved a verbal allegiance to kerygma while evacuating it of supernatural content through **demythologizing** and an existentialist construal of **revelation**.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Rudolf Bultmann** (1884–1976) worked in early twentieth‑century German **liberal Protestantism** shaped by **history-of-religions** scholarship and post‑Kantian critique.  
- His career at **Marburg** unfolded amid the **Weimar** and Nazi eras, in dialogue with **Heidegger** and parallel to the rise of **dialectical theology**.

- Methodologically he weds **Formgeschichte** and the **historical‑critical** method to an existential hermeneutic indebted to **Heidegger**.  
- For **Bultmann**, theology speaks of God only as **event** in existential self‑understanding, never as objective metaphysics or classical **natural theology**.  
- He sharply distinguishes the *Historie* of Jesus from the **kerygma**, insisting that faith rests on the preached word, not verifiable **historical** facts.

- In **History of the Synoptic Tradition** (1921) he develops **form criticism**, classifying pericopes to reconstruct the pre‑Gospel **Sitz im Leben** of the churches.  
- In **Jesus and the Word** (1926) he presents an eschatological **Jesus of history**, yet already subordinated to the existential demand of decision.  
- In **New Testament and Mythology** (1941) he calls for **demythologizing**, reinterpreting NT mythic language in existential terms rather than rejecting it.  
- In **Theology of the New Testament** (1948–53) he offers a comprehensive, kerygma‑centered **NT theology** that marginalizes metaphysical **Christology** and cosmology.

- His work decisively reshapes the doctrine of **Scripture and revelation**, understanding the Bible as human witness that becomes Word in existential encounter.  
- His **Christology and soteriology** recast the cross and resurrection as events of self‑understanding rather than objective, space‑time occurrences.  
- His view of **church and proclamation** elevates kerygma and decision while weakening sacrament, institution, and visible **ecclesiology**.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to stress his radical break from **Reformed confessional** teaching on Scripture, miracles, and the bodily **resurrection**.  
- You should also acknowledge that his focus on the scandal of **kerygmatic** preaching and decision indirectly exposes superficial cultural **Christianity**.

- When pressed, compare **Bultmann vs Barth** on revelation, resurrection, and the Word of God.  
- It is also helpful to contrast **Bultmann vs Bavinck** or **Vos** on redemptive history, Scripture, and the relation of **history and faith**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Rudolf **Bultmann** was born in 1884 in Wiefelstede in northern Germany, the son of a Lutheran pastor, and was educated in the milieu of late **nineteenth‑century liberal Protestantism** shaped by **Ritschl**, **Harnack**, and the history‑of‑religions school. After studies at Tübingen, Berlin, and Marburg he became professor of New Testament at **Marburg** in 1921 and remained there until retirement, teaching generations of students who would define mid‑century German theology. His intellectual context was dominated by post‑Kantian suspicion of metaphysics, the development of historicism, and the application of **historical‑critical** methods to Scripture, as well as by the philosophical turn to existence represented by **Kierkegaard** and later **Heidegger**.

The driving problem of **Bultmanns** theology emerges from this context: how can one speak meaningfully of **God** and of Jesus Christ in the modern world after **Kant** and under the pressure of scientific naturalism and historical criticism. He is convinced that the New Testament is clothed in **mythological** world‑pictures, presupposing a three‑storied universe with angels, demons, and miracles that modern people simply cannot take literally. At the same time, he rejects both the optimism of older **liberalism**, which tried to reduce Christianity to timeless moral and religious truths, and crude fundamentalist supernaturalism, which refuses the gains of **modern historical** consciousness. The problem he wants to solve is how the New Testament **kerygma** may continue to confront modern hearers with an existential call to decision once its mythic shell has been stripped or reinterpreted.

Politically and ecclesially, **Bultmann** lived through the First World War, the Weimar Republic, and the rise of the Nazis, signing declarations in support of the **Bekennende Kirche** and resisting the Aryan paragraph. Yet his primary battleground remained the lecture hall, where he sought to integrate rigorous **Formgeschichte** with an existential understanding of faith. His driving intuition is that the New Testament confronts us not with information about a metaphysical realm but with a summons to authentic existence before **God**, and that theology must be re‑articulated accordingly. From the standpoint of Reformed orthodoxy this means that a modern epistemic problem, shaped by **Kantian** limits, becomes more determinative for his project than the canonical narratives and the ecumenical creeds.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically, **Bultmann** is first of all a practitioner of the historical‑critical method, especially **form criticism** or **Formgeschichte**, as seen programmatically in his **History of the Synoptic Tradition** from 1921. Scripture for him is a historically conditioned human witness composed of discrete pericopes whose forms and settings in the life of the early church can be analyzed and classified. He sees the task of exegesis not as reading a harmonized narrative, but as tracing the development of tradition from the **Jesus of history** to the **Christ of faith**, locating each unit within the worship, catechesis, or polemics of early Christian communities. This historical work, however, does not yield saving knowledge of God in any straightforward way; it rather exposes the contingent, mythological character of the New Testament world‑picture.

In terms of **revelation**, **Bultmann** insists that God is not an object within the world that we can describe alongside other objects, which places him decisively in a post‑**Kantian** and post‑metaphysical trajectory. God is known only in the event of **revelation** as an eschatological address that encounters the hearer in the present. Here he is deeply indebted to **Heideggers** existential analysis of Dasein in *Being and Time*, though he Christianizes the language. For **Bultmann**, the revelation of God takes place in the **kerygma**, the proclaimed word about the cross and resurrection, which becomes the event in which the hearer is called out of inauthentic existence, characterized by self‑reliance and security in the world, into authentic existence marked by faith, obedience, and openness to the future. Revelation is thus not primarily cognitive disclosure of propositional truths about the **Trinity** or divine attributes, but an existential event that reorients the self.

Reason and experience are therefore tightly circumscribed in **Bultmanns** method. Scientific **reason** operates autonomously in the realm of historical investigation; it may and must demythologize the biblical texts, denying, for instance, the possibility of physical miracles as part of the worlds causal nexus. This historical reason cannot, however, reach **God** or provide a foundation for faith. Existential **experience** is equally ambiguous: human beings experience anxiety, finitude, and guilt, but only as they are addressed by the **kerygma** does this experience become the place of saving truth. The **church** is the community gathered by this proclamation, but for **Bultmann** the church carries no sacramental or institutional authority in the classical sense; it is the context in which the word is preached and faith awakened, not the bearer of an objectively given **tradition** to be received in humble submission.

History is the most contested category in **Bultmanns** work, especially in **New Testament and Mythology** from 1941 and in his ongoing debates with **Oscar Cullmann** and **Ernst Käsemann**. He famously distinguishes **Historie**, as critical reconstruction of the past, from **Geschichte**, as existentially significant event, and he insists that faith does not rest on the successful demonstration of historical facts like the empty tomb or physical resurrection appearances. The only historically necessary fact is that Jesus lived and was crucified; the **resurrection** belongs to the sphere of **kerygma** and is meaningful as proclamation that the cross is Gods saving act. Here the tension with a Reformed method that grounds faith in Gods self‑attesting work in **redemptive history**, as emphasized by **Vos** and **Van Til**, becomes sharp, since **Bultmann** refuses to accord covenantal history any epistemic weight apart from its existential reinterpretation.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

The classic Reformed baseline on **revelation and Scripture** confesses the Bible as the inspired, inerrant Word of God written, a unified canonical testimony that authoritatively and truthfully narrates redemptive history centered in Christ. **Bultmann** decisively breaks with this, treating Scripture as a fallible human witness whose authority lies not in its textual form but in the event of **kerygmatic** encounter. In **New Testament and Mythology** he argues that the New Testament is clothed in mythological language that modern people cannot accept; the task is not to discard the myths but to interpret them existentially. Miracles, exorcisms, and cosmological claims are not records of supernatural interventions but symbolic expressions of the human situation and the possibility of liberation. His implicit opponent is not only pre‑critical orthodoxy but also **Barths** strong doctrine of the Word of God as it comes to us in and through the biblical texts. From a Reformed standpoint, **Bultmanns** move dissolves the objectivity and perspicuity of Scripture and relocates revelation from the inspired text into the unstable arena of subjective experience.

On **Christology and soteriology**, the confessional baseline affirms the two natures of Christ, **homoousios** with the Father and with us, whose once‑for‑all historical death and bodily resurrection accomplish objective atonement and victory over sin and death. **Bultmann** reinterprets these claims within his existential framework, as seen in **Theology of the New Testament** and in **Jesus and the Word**. He grants that Jesus proclaimed the eschatological kingdom and that his cross is central, yet the saving meaning of the cross does not lie in a metaphysical transaction or penal substitution, but in the call to die to oneself and live in authentic faith. The **resurrection** is not a revivification of a corpse nor a space‑time event, but a mythic way of speaking about the significance of the cross as Gods decisive act of salvation. In polemic with **Karl Barth** and later with **Pannenberg**, he denies that faith requires or can ever rest on the historical demonstration of an empty tomb. The Christ event is, for him, the eschatological word that confronts us here and now, not a chain of supernatural facts. Reformed theology, following **Calvin** and **Bavinck**, must object that this dissolves the objectivity of the gospel and collapses union with Christ into inner existential transformation without a robust ontology of the incarnate, risen Lord.

Regarding **history, eschatology, and justification**, the Reformed tradition reads the biblical narrative as a unified **redemptive history**, from creation through fall to consummation in Christ, where justification is Gods forensic declaration based on the imputed righteousness of Christ received by faith alone. **Bultmann** mistrusts grand salvation‑historical schemas, regarding them as mythological overlays that obscure the existential urgency of decision. In his essay on **New Testament eschatology** and in **Theology of the New Testament**, he argues that the early church gradually internalized eschatology so that the decisive eschatological event is not a future cosmic consummation but the present moment of faith awakened by the **kerygma**. Justification by faith becomes the paradigmatic expression of authentic existence, where the sinner abandons reliance on works or worldly securities and entrusts himself wholly to Gods address. His interlocutor here is **Ernst Käsemann**, who accused **Bultmann** of over‑existentializing and losing the apocalyptic sovereignty of God in history. From a Reformed perspective, as seen in **Vos**, **Bultmann** replaces the objective movement of the covenant of grace and the forensic reality of justification with a nearly Heideggerian language of self‑understanding, leaving the believer with no solid historical anchor outside the self.

In the locus of **church, sacraments, and culture**, the Reformed confessions speak of the visible **church** as the kingdom of Christ, gathered and preserved by Word and sacrament, with baptism and the Supper as real means of grace. **Bultmann** largely sidelines ecclesiology and sacramentality, focusing instead on preaching as the primary locus of **revelation**. The church is wherever the **kerygma** is faithfully proclaimed and accepted in faith; structures, confessions, and sacraments carry no inherent divine promise apart from their function as vehicles for existential decision. This is consistent with his broader suspicion of objectified religion and piety. In the realm of culture, he shares with earlier liberalism a willingness to embrace modern scientific and critical insights, seeking a demythologized understanding of the gospel that can speak plausibly in a secular world. Opponents such as **Dietrich Bonhoeffer** and later **Jürgen Moltmann** complained that this results in a dehistoricized, individualistic faith, insufficiently attentive to the communal and political dimensions of the kingdom of God. From a Reformed angle, especially at **Westminster**, one would see here an underdeveloped doctrine of the church and means of grace and a problematic capitulation to the modern autonomy of culture and science.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians like **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** anticipate and reject **Bultmanns** key moves by insisting that revelation is both historical and verbal, that Scripture is a divinely inspired record of Gods mighty acts, and that the bodily **resurrection** of Christ is essential to the gospel. **Calvin** speaks of Scripture as the spectacles through which we see Gods works in history, while **Bavinck** stresses the organic unity of special revelation culminating in Christ as the incarnate Logos; both leave no room for a sharp disjunction between faith and historical fact of the sort **Bultmann** proposes. In the twentieth century, **Geerhardus Vos** articulates a robust **redemptive‑historical** theology that stands as a direct alternative to **Bultmanns** existential demythologizing, reading the New Testament not as myth but as the inspired interpretation of real, covenantal events. **Van Til** would see in **Bultmann** a classic case of autonomous reason, allowing Kantian and Heideggerian categories to dictate what can be believed about God and history, and would charge that his method entails a principled refusal to recognize Gods self‑attesting revelation in Christ and Scripture.

Westminster examiners will insist on at least two non‑negotiable objections. First, **Bultmanns** program of **demythologizing** directly contradicts the Reformed doctrine of Scripture as inspired, inerrant, and perspicuous, since he allows extra‑biblical philosophical criteria to determine which elements of the text can be retained and which must be reinterpreted. Second, his denial of the bodily **resurrection** as a historical, space‑time event guts the gospel of its objective content and conflicts with texts like 1 Corinthians 15, where Paul grounds Christian hope precisely in the historical resurrection of Christ. At the same time, there are limited but real ways a Reformed theologian can learn from **Bultmann**. His relentless insistence that the gospel demands personal **decision** and cannot be reduced to inherited culture challenges nominalism within confessional churches. His warning against using God as an explanatory stop‑gap in the causal nexus, and his refusal to treat divine action as a rival to creaturely causality, can sharpen a more robustly **classical theistic** account of providence and miracle that avoids crude supernaturalism. Engaging **Bultmann** thus forces Reformed theology to articulate more clearly how Gods objective acts in redemptive history confront persons existentially through the self‑attesting Word and Spirit.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, it is safe to open with a sentence like this: Rudolf **Bultmann** is the leading twentieth‑century New Testament theologian who tried to preserve the scandal of the **kerygma** for modern people by radically demythologizing Scripture and interpreting revelation in existential terms. Such a line acknowledges both his historical significance and the core of his project without yet endorsing it. You can safely say that he is a methodologically rigorous **form critic**, that he is deeply influenced by **Heidegger**, and that he wanted to avoid both naive supernaturalism and shallow liberal moralism. You may also affirm that his work raises the unavoidable question of how the modern church speaks credibly about **miracle**, **resurrection**, and demons without capitulating either to naturalism or to fideism.

There are, however, phrases that must be carefully qualified at Westminster. You should not simply say that **Bultmann** shows us how to make Christianity credible to modern people, since that implies that modernity sets the norms to which revelation must conform. Avoid speaking of **demythologizing** as if it were a neutral hermeneutical tool; instead, describe it as his attempt to reinterpret biblical mythological language within an existential framework, and then immediately note that this entails denying the historical reality of miracles and the bodily **resurrection**, which Reformed orthodoxy cannot accept. Be cautious with the language of **existentialist** theology or of *Entmythologisierung*; explain that for **Bultmann**, myth is not mere falsehood but symbolic language about the human condition, yet insist that Scripture is more than symbolic expression. Also refrain from using unqualified slogans like faith is independent of history or the gospel does not need historical proofs, since examiners will expect you to assert that the Reformed tradition ties faith to Gods real acts in **redemptive history** while still recognizing that faith is a gift of the Spirit, not the outcome of neutral historical research.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings of **Bultmann**, so clarify a few points. Many students caricature him as simple liberalism that rejects everything supernatural; you should show that he does not throw away the New Testament language but reinterprets it, and that he sincerely wants to speak of Gods eschatological **act** in Christ. At the same time, do not overcorrect by making him sound orthodox; stress that his denial of the empty tomb as historical, his view of demons and miracles as mythic, and his reduction of **Christology** to the call to authentic existence are fundamental departures from Nicene and Reformed teaching. Another frequent confusion is to oppose **Bultmann** and **Barth** as if they were wholly unrelated; it is better to say that both react against older liberalism and emphasize the priority of the Word, but Barth grounds this Word in Gods objective self‑revelation in the history of Jesus Christ, whereas **Bultmann** grounds it in existential encounter largely independent of demonstrable historical facts. If pressed, you should insist that any Reformed appropriation of his emphasis on decision and preaching must be tightly subordinated to a strong doctrine of Scripture and to the historicity of the **incarnation**, cross, and resurrection.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Rudolf **Bultmann** is a brilliant but deeply problematic theologian whose attempt to rescue the offense of the **kerygma** by severing it from objective redemptive history ultimately undermines the gospel he wishes to preserve, yet whose sharp focus on preaching and personal decision can still chastise complacent confessionalism. We can affirm his insistence that God is not an object within the world, that faith is not reducible to historical probability, and that the New Testament confronts us existentially in the present through proclamation, but we must unequivocally deny his **demythologizing** of miracles, demons, and especially the bodily resurrection, his reduction of revelation to an event of self‑understanding, and his effective abandonment of the Reformed doctrine of Scripture as the inspired, truthful Word of God. If asked where we land, we should say that Reformed theology must hold together what **Bultmann** pulls apart, affirming that the Spirit uses the self‑attesting Word to bring about existential renewal precisely by bearing witness to Gods real, once‑for‑all acts in the incarnate, crucified, and risen Christ, so that any theological method that discounts those acts as myth stands outside the bounds of confessional orthodoxy.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Rudolf **Bultmann** is the key twentieth‑century New Testament theologian who tried to preserve the scandal of the **kerygma** for modern people by demythologizing Scripture and reinterpreting revelation in existential terms.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- **Bultmann** lived from 1884 to 1976, taught mainly at **Marburg**, and worked in the context of early twentieth‑century German **liberal Protestantism**.  
- His major methodological work **History of the Synoptic Tradition** (1921) applies **Formgeschichte** to the Gospels and focuses on the pre‑Gospel church.  
- His programmatic essay **New Testament and Mythology** (1941) and his **Theology of the New Testament** (1948–53) articulate his existential **demythologizing** project.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- **Bultmann** weds rigorous **historical‑critical** and form‑critical exegesis to an existential hermeneutic influenced by **Heidegger**.  
- He views **revelation** not as propositional disclosure but as an eschatological event in which the **kerygma** calls the hearer to authentic existence.  
- He sharply distinguishes **Historie** from existentially meaningful **Geschichte**, insisting that faith does not rest on historical demonstration of miracles or the resurrection.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **Scripture and revelation**, he treats the Bible as a mythologically clothed human witness that becomes Gods Word only in the existential event of **proclamation**.  
- On **Christology and soteriology**, he reinterprets the cross and **resurrection** as symbols of self‑surrender and new existence rather than objective, space‑time acts.  
- On **eschatology and justification**, he internalizes eschatology into the present moment of faith and reads justification by faith as paradigmatic authentic existence.  
- On **church and sacraments**, he marginalizes institutional and sacramental structures and centers the church on preaching the **kerygma** that summons to decision.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press his denial of the bodily **resurrection** as historical and his reduction of miracle language to mythic symbolism.  
- They will object to his view of **Scripture** as a fallible human witness that must be demythologized according to extra‑biblical philosophical criteria.  
- They will challenge his separation of faith from **redemptive history** and his existentializing of justification and eschatology.  
- They will see his method as a paradigmatic example of autonomous **reason** and modernity dictating the limits of what revelation may say.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Bultmann vs Barth** on revelation and resurrection contrasts existential **kerygma** without historical anchor with Word‑centered history in Jesus Christ.  
- **Bultmann vs Bavinck** on Scripture pits demythologized human witness against organically inspired, truthful **revelation**.  
- **Bultmann vs Vos** on redemptive history contrasts existential decision with covenantal, epochal acts of God in history.  
- **Bultmann vs Schleiermacher** on liberalism compares existential reinterpretation of myth with **Gefühl** and consciousness of absolute dependence.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Rudolf **Bultmann** brilliantly exposes the need for existential encounter with the gospel yet fatally severs that encounter from the objective, historical **incarnation**, cross, and resurrection on which Reformed faith non‑negotiably rests.
