### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Nancy Cartwright emerges within the late twentieth-century reconfiguration of **philosophy of science** in the wake of **Hempel's deductive-nomological model**, **Popper's falsificationism**, **Kuhn's paradigms**, and **Duhem's holism**. Educated in the analytic tradition and teaching at institutions such as **Stanford**, **LSE**, **UCSD**, and **Durham**, she allied with a turn toward case-based inquiry and material practice associated with figures like **Ian Hacking** and **Patrick Suppes**. The result is an empirically serious, anti-idealizing approach that resists the hegemony of universal **laws of nature**. Her method places weight on **models**, **measurement**, and concrete **causal powers** rather than abstract axiomatizations. This orientation is often labeled **entity realism** and **methodological pluralism**: take seriously the reality of entities and their capacities that we can experimentally manipulate, but treat sweeping generalizations with suspicion. That stance will underwrite her signature claims in **How the Laws of Physics Lie** and later work on **evidence for use**.

Cartwright's epistemic posture is deliberately local and practice-laden. Rather than deriving phenomena from exceptionless **nomological generalizations**, she tracks how scientists build **nomological machines** that harness **capacities** under carefully engineered **ceteris paribus** conditions. This places her astride debates with **Humean regularity theories**, **Lewis's best-systems account of law**, and **structural realism** as advocated by **John Worrall**. The distinctive claim is that the world is **dappled**: a mosaic of partially overlapping regimes in which different causal packages operate. Models do real work, but their generality is hard-won and fragile. For theology, this methodological posture sets terms for thinking about **providence**, **secondary causation**, and the status of so-called **laws of nature** in a creation experienced as patterned yet not globally regimented.

#### 2. How the laws lie and why capacities matter
In **How the Laws of Physics Lie** (1983), Cartwright launches the thesis that the most celebrated **laws** of physics and the social sciences do not straightforwardly describe the world. Rather, they hold in model systems or idealized situations that we carve out of the world. Canonical examples from **quantum mechanics** and **classical mechanics** show that law statements capture tendencies abstracted from messy reality. The slogan **laws lie** is not a rejection of science but a critique of inflated nomological realism. She prefers **capacities** to laws: real properties of entities that tend to produce certain effects, powers which can be combined and masked. In place of universal coverage, she emphasizes *per se* tendencies and the management of **ceteris paribus** clauses.

This inversion targets the **D-N model** and the dream of a unified axiomatic science. By stressing **capacities**, she resurrects an **Aristotelian-style powers metaphysics** within a rigorously empirical register and pushes back against **Humean** passivism. The world contains things that can act, not just patterns we project. The upshot is a patchwork picture of explanation: we explain by citing the **capacities** at work in situ, not by subsuming cases under a universal law. For theologians considering **creation's order** and **secondary causes**, this alignment with **causal powers** resonates with classical accounts of causal *virtus* while challenging any complacent identification of divine **providence** with a thin regime of exceptionless lawlike regularity.

#### 3. Nature's Capacities and the measurement problem
In **Nature's Capacities and their Measurement** (1989), Cartwright deepens the metaphysics and epistemology of **capacities**. Measurement is reinterpreted as the art of constructing arrangements where a capacity can manifest under controlled constraints. She develops a logic of **capacity composition**, showing how capacities can add, cancel, or interact nonlinearly. This proposes a new **semantics for causal claims** beyond both naive covering-law accounts and unstructured causal regularities. The guiding image remains the **nomological machine**: an engineered set-up that stabilizes the exercise of capacities.

This work engages critics like **Stathis Psillos** who defend realist laws, and connects with **econometrics** and **experimental design** where isolating a factor's contribution is hard. Her case-based epistemology anticipates later **interventionist** accounts, yet differs by grounding interventions in real **powers** rather than purely counterfactual structure. For theology of nature, this stance informs an ontology of **secondary causation** where **powers** are not illusory but created and ordered. It also raises questions about the reach of **miracles** as special acts of God that may suspend or reconfigure ordinary **nomological machines** without denying creaturely **capacities**.

#### 4. The Dappled World and the failure of unity
With **The Dappled World** (1999), Cartwright consolidates her critique of **unity-of-science** ambitions. The world is not governed by a single nomological pattern but is **dappled**, stitched together by local **mechanisms** tuned to different domains. She opposes **global reductionism** and resists **strong structural realism**, arguing that successful science trades in domains and models, not global theories that perfectly mesh. Laws work in the lab and in engineered contexts; outside, **capacities** continue to operate, but interactions are complex and rarely captured by a law tout court.

Her dappled ontology confronts **David Lewis's best-systems** account: against the idea that laws are whatever best systematizes the mosaic of events, Cartwright insists that the mosaic itself is already mechanized and power-laden. Similarly, against **van Fraassen's constructive empiricism**, she preserves **realism about entities and capacities**, though not about universal laws. Theologically, the picture challenges any easy move from scientific order to metaphysical **necessity of nature**, pressing instead toward a doctrine of **providence** that appreciates the plurality of **created orders** within the one creation, perhaps described by an *ordo creationis* that is richly textured rather than monolithic.

#### 5. Hunting causes and using them
In **Hunting Causes and Using Them** (2007), Cartwright turns to the practice of causal inference and the transition from discovery to deployment. She analyzes **Mackie-style INUS conditions** and critiques overreliance on **Bayesian networks**, **Rubin causal models**, and **Pearl's DAGs**, arguing that structure without **mechanism** and **capacity claims** is epistemically thin for real-world use. The most robust causal knowledge is mixed: part **statistical** and part **mechanistic**, anchored in specific **nomological machines** that can be replicated in the target environment.

Here she articulates the crucial difference between **efficacy** and **effectiveness**. A treatment or policy may be efficacious under trial conditions yet not effective in the wild if the relevant **support factors** and **stabilizing mechanisms** are absent. This distinction reappears in her policy work and bears directly on Christian prudence about **common grace**, **medical ethics**, and the wise application of knowledge for neighbor love. The thick, local knowledge demanded by **causal capacities** resists technocratic hubris and honors the grain of creation.

#### 6. Evidence-based policy and evidence for use
Cartwright's applied pivot, especially in **Evidence-Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing It Better** (2012, with **E. Hardie**) and **Evidence for Use** (2022), rebukes simplistic hierarchies that privilege **randomized controlled trials** as universal gold standards. She defends a **pluralist methodology** for integrating **RCTs**, **observational studies**, **mechanistic evidence**, and **case knowledge** to construct an argument that a policy will work here, now, for these people. The operational concept is **supporting factors**: identify and secure the local conditions that activate the **capacity** the policy relies on.

This practical philosophy returns to the heart of her metaphysics: if the world is **dappled** and **capacities** act only in suitable contexts, then good policy-making must be **localist** and **mechanism-sensitive**. For Christian social thought, this validates a **subsidiarity-like** prudence and resists one-size-fits-all technocracy. It also reframes discussions of **miracles and providence** in public reasoning: success claims must be tethered to plausible **nomological machines** rather than abstract law-talk, while leaving room for God to act *ad extra* without collapsing creaturely **capacities** into divine action.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
Cartwright's corpus is stitched together by engagements with canonical views. Against **Hempel's D-N model**, she maintains that explanation by law fails in domains where only **ceteris paribus** principles are available. Against **Lewis's best-systems laws**, she posits that the world's basic furniture includes **powers** and **mechanisms**, not just event patterns. With **Worrall's structural realism**, she shares a respect for successful structure but refuses to demote **entities and capacities**. She is sympathetic to **van Fraassen's** anti-necessitarian caution but rejects his **empiricist** agnosticism about what exists, defending **entity realism**. In causality, she appropriates aspects of **Woodward's interventionism** and engages **Pearl-Rubin** frameworks, while insisting that interventionist graphs must be backed by **mechanistic** content if they are to underwrite use.

Critics such as **Psillos**, **Tooley**, and **Armstrong** have pressed whether abandoning robust **laws** undermines explanation and counterfactual support. Others, including **Earman** and **Maudlin**, worry that a **dappled world** lacks the metaphysical unity needed for physics. Cartwright replies that practice shows otherwise: we get explanation and control by knitting together local **nomological machines**, and counterfactuals can be grounded in **capacity** claims plus stable arrangements. This polemic is the crucible in which a theological appropriation must be forged: can Christian doctrine of **providence** affirm patchwork nomology without dissolving cosmic order?

#### 8. Unity, order, and theological appropriation
Cartwright's work reframes the old natural theology question about **laws of nature**. If laws in the strong sense **lie**, then the order of creation appears as a proliferating set of **local mechanisms** and **causal packages** that we can often stabilize but rarely universalize. That is consonant with a doctrine of **secondary causes** in which God creates kinds with **powers** that act *per se* given apt conditions and under **divine concursus**. It also illumines **miracle** not as violation of reified laws but as an extraordinary act of God that either supplies missing **supporting factors** or otherwise overrides the usual **nomological machine**, while leaving creaturely **capacities** intact.

At the same time, her **dappled** metaphysic presses theologians to clarify the basis of creation's unity. Classical Christian claims about **divine simplicity** and **universal providence** do not depend on a metaphysic of exceptionless **law statements**, but on the **divine decree** as the *principium essendi* of order. Cartwright's pluralism can be received as a chastening of rationalist extrapolations from science to **metaphysical necessity**, while encouraging humble, **prudential reasoning** in medicine and policy that recognizes the conditionality of our craft. Her **evidence-for-use** program dovetails with an ethic of wisdom that attends to **place**, **people**, and **practices** within the larger theater of God's governance.

#### 9. Doctrinal developments and conceptual tools
The signature developments across Cartwright's major works can be arrayed as a sequence: first, **laws lie** because they idealize; second, **capacities** are the right ontological ground for causal claims; third, the world is **dappled**, so unity must be stitched mechanistically; fourth, causal inference requires **mixed methods**; fifth, application demands **evidence for use** that secures **supporting factors**. Each step carries characteristic conceptual tools: **nomological machines** to stabilize powers; **ceteris paribus laws** to articulate tendencies; **efficacy vs effectiveness** to distinguish trial from practice; and **mechanism-plus-statistics** to warrant interventions. These tools are cross-disciplinary, reaching physics, **economics**, **medicine**, and **public policy**.

For theology, these tools invite a reframing of nature-grace questions. Rather than lamenting the loss of universal laws, one may attend to the richness of **created powers** and the art of **dominion** as the wise cultivation of **nomological machines** consonant with **creational norms**. The emphasis on **measurement** as world-making highlights the moral stakes of modeling, including the danger of **idealization** that erases the vulnerable. Cartwright's program thus intersects with Christian concerns about **justice**, **truthfulness**, and **neighbor love** in the exercise of technical power.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and broadly **WTS**-inflected standpoint, Cartwright's **causal powers realism** and **localist pluralism** offer both assets and liabilities. On the positive side, her rejection of thin **Humean regularity** and her defense of robust **secondary causation** cohere with classical **Reformed scholastic** accounts of created **virtutes** under **divine concursus**. Her dismantling of global **law realism** underwrites a doctrine of **providence** grounded not in universal nomological necessity but in the **divine decree** and **Wisdom** who orders a world of many creaturely kinds. Her **evidence-for-use** ethos commends prudence, attends to **contexts**, and resists technocratic **idolatry**, virtues consonant with a covenantal ethic of stewardship under **common grace**. On the critical side, her rhetoric of a **dappled world** risks collapsing metaphysical unity into epistemic patchwork, which tensions claims about the one coherent **covenantal order** of creation under **Christ's primacy**. Moreover, her methodological naturalism can tend toward epistemic **immanentism**, leaving little room to acknowledge **revelation** as principium cognoscendi or to integrate theology's own **sources and norms** with scientific practice. A Reformed alternative would receive her **capacities** within a stronger doctrine of **creation's unity** and **teleology**, construe **laws of nature** as **covenantal regularities** expressing God's faithful governance rather than exceptionless descriptions, and place **prudential evidence** within a sapiential frame where **Scripture**, **churchly wisdom**, and **right reason** together discern how to build and deploy **nomological machines** for the love of God and neighbor.
