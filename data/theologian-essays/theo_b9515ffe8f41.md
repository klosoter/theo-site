### ESSAY
Anselm of Canterbury, born 1033 in Aosta and dying 1109 in Canterbury, stands as a pivotal architect of **scholastic method** framed by **Benedictine monasticism** and pastoral reform. Formed at **Bec** under **Lanfranc**, he became prior in 1063 and abbot in 1078, before his translation to the **See of Canterbury** in 1093. His career unfolded within the **High Medieval** consolidation of ecclesial institutions and the contentious **investiture controversy** under William II Rufus and Henry I of England. This crucible of reform and controversy sharpened a mind bent toward **fides quaerens intellectum**, a maxim that is less a slogan than an epistemic habit: faith seeks understanding by moving from **Scripture’s confession** to intelligible **ratio**. Anselm did not pit authority against reason; he pursued reasons coherent with belief so that the Church’s confession might be contemplated with clarity. The monastery furnished him a school of prayerful dialectic; the archbishopric demanded doctrinal steadiness against **tritheist nominalism** and political pressure. Across these settings, his distinctive combination of **contemplative prayer**, **monastic lectio**, and **dialectical inquiry** issued in a corpus whose aim is vision of **God’s simplicity and goodness** culminating in the necessity and fittingness of the **God-man**.

Anselm’s method unfolds in a rational key that remains tethered to **credere ut intelligas**, Augustine’s call to believe that one may understand. In the preface to the **Monologion** he promises an inquiry **sola ratione**, without appeal to external authority, to exhibit the internal coherence of the Church’s confession of the **divine nature**. The companion **Proslogion**, initially titled Fides quaerens intellectum, seeks a single synthetic argument leading the mind to God as **that-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought**. Yet the rationality on display is not autonomous; it is an ordered ascent from given confession to necessary reasons, using **convenientia** to show the fittingness of divine works. His dialectic then presupposes **divine simplicity** and **aseity** as regulative principles, since only if God is without composition and from himself can reason trace the perfections that are God’s very being. Here **Augustine** and **Boethius** are deep wells: the **divine ideas**, the **Verbum** and **amor** structure, and the Boethian account of eternity frame Anselm’s project.

The **Monologion** composes a chain of arguments from the gradient of goods to a highest **summum bonum**, from multiplicity of limited perfections to a simple, self-sufficient **ipsum bonum**. The trajectory is not empirical induction but a rational ascent: if there are degrees of **truth, goodness, and justice**, then their degrees are intelligible only by relation to an unparticipated **Truth and Goodness**. Anselm concludes that this supreme nature is **simple**, **immutable**, and **eternal**, refusing any composition of act and potency or of essence and accident that would compromise **aseity**. From **simplicity** and **perfection** he draws out divine attributes as modes of the same reality, protecting the confession that God is not merely very good, but **Goodness itself**. The **Trinity** is explored in the latter portions of the work through Augustinian taxis: the **Son** is **Verbum**, the perfect self-expression of the divine intellect, and the **Spirit** is **amor**, the subsistent love proceeding from Father and Son. These metaphysical registers are not proofs from effects so much as interior analyses of what it means for there to be the **highest simply perfect nature**.

In the **Proslogion**, Anselm famously offers the prayerful contemplation that became known as the **ontological argument**. If God is **that-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought**, he must not only exist in intellect but in reality, since existence in re is greater than existence in intellect alone. Moreover, such a being cannot be conceived not to exist, because necessary existence is included in the very concept of the **absolutely maximal being**. The **Fool** who says in his heart there is no God has grasped the term without understanding the necessary entailment. **Gaunilo of Marmoutier** responded in the Liber pro Insipiente, alleging that one could run parallel reasoning for a **perfect island**. Anselm’s reply, the **Responsio ad Gaunilonem**, presses the category difference: only a **maximally perfect being** admits of necessary existence; contingent particulars like islands do not. The **Proslogion** is not a freestanding natural theology severed from faith but a dramatized ascent of **intellectus fidei**. The argument’s later history, from **Descartes** to **Leibniz** and on through **Hartshorne** and **Plantinga**, reveals Anselm’s intuition about **necessary being** and **greatness** to be generative for metaphysics and analytic philosophy of religion.

Within moral psychology and hamartiology, Anselm’s dialogues **De Veritate**, **De Libertate Arbitrii**, and **De Casu Diaboli** develop a precise grammar of **rectitudo**. Truth is **rectitude perceptible by the mind**, a rightness that things have when they are as they ought to be, and that wills have when they will what they ought for its own sake. Freedom is not indifference between contraries but the **power to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake**, a definition that dissolves the common opposition between freedom and rectitude by making rightness the very form of free willing. The fall of angelic and human wills is a failure of **rectitudo** driven by a corrupted motive power, not a natural necessity. In **De Casu Diaboli** he explores the mystery that some angels persevered while others fell, concluding that **grace** is necessary for perseverance, yet the absence of grace does not cause sin since defect belongs to the creature. These treatises thus yield a moral backdrop for **Cur Deus Homo**: sin is the withholding of **due honor**, a refusal of **rectitudo** toward God’s supreme dignity.

The soteriological heart of Anselm’s corpus is **Cur Deus Homo** 1094–98, a dialogical exposition with **Boso** on the necessity and fittingness of the **incarnation** and **atonement**. Sin places the human race under a debt of **honor** that cannot be repaid by mere creatures, because the affront to infinite **majesty** creates a deficit proportioned to God’s dignity. Divine **mercy** does not simply remit the debt by fiat, for that would violate **justice** and disrupt the right order of the universe. A satisfaction must be made that is both **fitting** and **necessary** in the order of rectitude, leading to the thesis that only a **God-man** can make satisfaction: as man he ought to repay, as God he has the infinite worth to repay superabundantly. The **passion and obedience** of Christ thus constitute a satisfaction that is not primarily penal but **honor-satisfaction**; yet it is juridical and objective, effecting reconciliation and restoration of **rectitudo**. Anselm insists that God is not constrained by an external necessity; the necessity is **hypothetical** given God’s fixed **justice** and **wisdom**. The work thereby weaves together **incarnation**, **satisfaction**, and **exaltation**, culminating in the reward that the God-man shares with his body, the Church. Despite later caricatures, Anselm’s account refuses a picture of a wrathful Father compelled to punish; he emphasizes the unity of divine **will**, the **simplicity** of divine **justice and mercy**, and the intention of **beatitude**.

Anselm’s polemical and ecclesial writings further exhibit his doctrinal architecture. In **De Incarnatione Verbi** 1094 he responds to **Roscelin of Compiègne**, whose **nominalism** tended toward **tritheism**; Anselm defends that the three persons are one **substance** without aggregation, preserving **divine simplicity** while distinguishing persons by relations of origin. In **De Processione Spiritus Sancti** 1098 Anselm defends the **Filioque**, arguing from the unity of divine essence and the doctrine that the **Spirit** proceeds as **Love** from the **Father and the Son**, so that double procession secures both personal distinction and essential unity. These treatises show his Augustinian inheritance and his readiness to deploy **necessary reasons** for conciliar formulae. His defense of the Roman claim in England and participation at the **Council of Bari** 1098 reveal an archbishop whose pastoral office and doctrinal craft were inseparable, constantly binding **monastic contemplation** to **episcopal governance**.

The later **De Concordia Praescientiae et Praedestinationis et Gratiae Dei cum Libero Arbitrio** 1107–08 synthesizes Anselm’s earlier moral psychology with a Boethian **eternity** doctrine. God’s **foreknowledge and predestination** are compatible with **free choice**, since God is eternal and sees all times in one simple **now**, without alterable sequence in the divine **life ad intra**. Predestination is the ordering of persons to **beatitude**, and grace is necessary for any act of **rectitudo** that merits eternal life. Yet Anselm preserves the integrity of created causality: God does not force sin, though he permits it for wise reasons. Freedom remains the capacity for **rectitudo** for its own sake; the sinful act lacks that rectitude and thus is a privation rather than a positive entity caused by God. In joining **foreknowledge**, **predestination**, **grace**, and **free choice** under the canopy of divine **simplicity** and **immutability**, Anselm establishes a compatibilist grammar without collapsing secondary causes into the first.

The texture of Anselm’s thought includes a reflective philosophy of language and knowledge allied to **Boethius**. The dialogue **De Grammatico** explores the relation of names and things, distinguishing **substance** and **quality** to guard theological predication about God and creatures. In **De Veritate** he grounds truth not merely in propositions but in the **rectitude of being**, thereby giving an ontological substrate for the **analogy** by which creatures signify the Creator. This semantic clarity is not pedantry; it is the infrastructure for later claims about **divine names**, **simplicity**, and the **attributes**. The consistent appeal to **necessary reasons**, so misunderstood as rationalism, actually serves the apophatic insight that God is beyond composite concepts. Anselm labors to show that what is confessed in **Scripture and creed** is neither contradiction nor arbitrary fiat, but the very wisdom of the simple God communicated to finite reason.

Historically, Anselm’s legacy radiates through both **scholastic theology** and later **philosophy of religion**. **Thomas Aquinas** cites him approvingly on **divine simplicity**, **Trinity**, and **incarnation**, while offering a distinct pathway to God through the **Five Ways** rather than the Anselmian modal insight. **Bonaventure** inherits the **illumination** motif and reasons of **convenientia**, while **Duns Scotus** engages the **necessity** claims with his own univocity and formal distinction. In modernity, **Descartes** reformulates the **ontological argument**; **Leibniz** adds the possibility premise; and contemporary analytic philosophers like **Norman Malcolm**, **Charles Hartshorne**, and **Alvin Plantinga** retrieve modal versions. In soteriology, the distinction between **Anselmian satisfaction** and **Abelard’s moral influence** becomes a benchmark taxonomy, though such binaries can flatten nuances. His ecclesial role during the **investiture controversy** models the intellectual as pastor, joining **doctrinal defense** with **institutional reform**.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation will gladly receive Anselm’s **classical theism**, his robust account of **divine simplicity and aseity**, and his careful harmonization of **justice and mercy** in the **God-man**. The Reformed insistence on **Scripture as principium cognoscendi** will, however, qualify Anselm’s program of **sola ratione** by insisting that all right reasoning about God is ministerial, normed by **covenant revelation** and cognizant of the **noetic effects of sin**. On **atonement**, Reformed orthodoxy affirms the **objective satisfaction** but reframes Anselm’s **honor-debt** within **covenant justice** and **law-court** categories, emphasizing **penal substitution** grounded in the **covenant of works** and fulfilled by the **New Covenant** Head. The logic of **necessitas** is best tethered to God’s **free decree**, so that what is necessary is hypothetically necessary given the **divine will**, not a structure suspended above God. Anselm’s compatibilist **freedom as rectitude** aligns with Reformed **effectual calling** and **perseverance**, even as Scripture’s redemptive-historical texture presses the Church beyond abstract **convenientia** to the history of **promise and fulfillment** in Christ. Properly disciplined by **revelation**, Anselm’s vision of **faith seeking understanding** remains a model of Christian reason serving doxology.
