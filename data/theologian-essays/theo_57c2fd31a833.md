### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the wager of method
Stanley J. Grenz, 1950 to 2005, emerges from the **North American Baptist** world during evangelicalism’s pivot from **modern foundationalism** to **postmodern critique**. Educated at the University of Munich under **Wolfhart Pannenberg**, PhD 1978, he absorbed a program of **eschatological ontology** in which the **future of God** is determinative for present identity. His teaching ministry, first at the **North American Baptist Seminary** and then at **Regent College** in Vancouver, positioned him at the crossroads of **broad evangelical** renewal and ecumenical conversation. Grenz’s animating thesis, announced in **Revisioning Evangelical Theology** 1993 and systematized in **Theology for the Community of God** 1994, is that evangelical theology must move from **propositionalist certainty** toward **trinitarian community**, interpreting doctrine within the **people of God** formed by the **Spirit** under the lordship of the **risen Christ**. The field context is urgent: debates on **biblical inerrancy**, contested models of **atonement**, and the onrush of **postmodernity**, summarized in **A Primer on Postmodernism** 1996. Against anxiety over truth’s loss, Grenz wagers that truth is secured by **eschatological realism** and the **Spirit-guided community**, not by a Cartesian **foundationalism**.

The decisive intellectual encounter for Grenz is **Pannenberg’s** insistence that all reality is historically disclosed in the light of the **eschaton**, blended with the ecclesial instincts of a **believers’ church** and the constructive impulse of **Barthian** christological concentration. He extends the contemporary **trinitarian revival**, learning from **Moltmann’s** history of the **Trinity**, **Zizioulas’s** personalism, and **LaCugna’s** insistence that the **economic Trinity** reveals the **immanent Trinity**. The pastoral context of catechesis is never far away, as seen in **Who Needs Theology** 1996 and **Created for Community** 1996. Thus the theological task appears as a communal service, a redescription of the **kingdom of God** that reframes identity and ethics for a late modern church.

#### 2. Postfoundational method and the location of theology
Grenz’s signal methodological proposal, developed with **John R. Franke** in **Beyond Foundationalism** 2001, rejects both **naive foundationalism** and radical **relativism**. He advances a **postfoundational** stance: theology is normed by **Scripture**, mediated through the **tradition** of the church, and discerningly engaged with **culture**, all within the **community** indwelt by the **Spirit**. This **Scripture-tradition-culture triad** functions asymmetrically, with **Scripture** exercising material normativity as the Spirit-inspired text, yet only ever read within the **consensus fidelium** that is historically situated. The epistemic confidence is not located in indubitable premises but in **eschatological objectivity**. Truth is what will finally be manifest in the **resurrection of the crucified**, an **eschaton** that grounds **critical realism** and underwrites communal self-correction across time.

Grenz frames this method as an evangelical ressourcement of the **Great Tradition**, especially the **Nicene** commitment to **homoousios** and a retrieval of *perichoresis*, without surrendering the Protestant impulse of **Sola Scriptura**. His idiom is communitarian and **pneumatological**, invoking the **Spirit’s** work in the church’s interpretive practices, echoing **George Lindbeck’s** cultural-linguistic insight and **Alasdair MacIntyre’s** traditioned rationality. Where classical evangelicalism emphasized **propositional revelation** in **Carl F. H. Henry**, Grenz accents the lived, worshiping **community** as the site of theological knowledge. The wager is that the **triune God** is known **ad extra** by the saving economy and that this knowledge is reliable because the **Spirit** forms a people who hear and respond to **Scripture** faithfully.

#### 3. The system: Theology for the Community of God
In **Theology for the Community of God** 1994 Grenz offers a full dogmatics centered on **community** under the **kingdom of God**. The doctrine of God is fully **trinitarian**, organized by *perichoresis* and **mutuality**, yet determined by the **Christ-event** as the definitive disclosure of divine life. The world is interpreted through **creation** ordered to **consummation**, with an **eschatological ontology** that resists any static nature-grace schema. Sin is communal dis-integration, and salvation is incorporation into the **people of God** through **union with Christ** in the **Spirit**. The sacraments of **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper** are read as communal practices that enact participation in the **triune life**, consistent with a Baptist yet dialogical account of **ordinances**.

Grenz’s anthropology turns on the **imago Dei as relational destiny**. Humanity is created for **communion**, imaging the **triune God** not as isolated rationality but as **sociality** grounded in the **Trinity**. He elaborates the imago along **christological** and **pneumatological** lines, contending that human personhood is fulfilled in conformity to the **Son** by the **Spirit** within the **church**. Eschatology becomes architectonic, with the **already and not yet** ordering all doctrine. The church is the **eschatological community**, a sign and foretaste of the **kingdom**, and ethics is discipleship shaped by **virtue** and **practices** that reflect **trinitarian mutuality**.

#### 4. Trinity and the rebirth of evangelical dogmatics
Grenz’s later monographs intensify the trinitarian pivot. In **The Social God and the Relational Self** 2001 he offers a sustained **trinitarian anthropology**, mining **Zizioulas’s** ontology of personhood, **Moltmann’s** history of the **Trinity**, and contemporary discourse on the **self** to argue that human identity is fundamentally **relational**. In **Rediscovering the Triune God** 2004 he surveys and appropriates the twentieth-century **trinitarian renaissance**, constructing an evangelical account of **social trinitarianism** chastened by **classical theism**. He affirms **consubstantiality**, **inseparable operations**, and the **one will** of God, yet he insists that the divine life is best described by **mutual indwelling** and **self-giving love**. The upshot is a metaphysic where *perichoresis* is not a mere metaphor but the ontology that grounds **ecclesiology**, **ethics**, and **mission**.

Critics worry that such **social trinitarianism** risks diluting **divine simplicity** and introduces a model of three centers of consciousness. Grenz attempts to avoid tritheism by stressing the **one divine essence** and by tethering all talk of the **immanent Trinity** to the **economic missions** of the **Son** and **Spirit**. He invokes **Rahner’s Rule** that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and adds an evangelical safeguard by making **Scripture’s economy** the grammar for all speculation. While sympathetic to **LaCugna’s** turn to the economy, he remains committed to doctrinal **dogma** as truth, not mere doxological grammar, a stance that holds together **confession**, **worship**, and **teaching**.

#### 5. Ethics, sexuality, and the moral shape of community
Ethics is not an appendix in Grenz’s program but a corollary of **trinitarian communion**. In **The Moral Quest** 1997 he presents **Christian ethics** as an ecclesially embodied way of life oriented to the **kingdom of God**, integrating **virtue ethics**, **divine command**, and **narrative**. The moral life is ordered by **eschatological teleology** and cultivated through **practices** that reflect **self-giving love**. His earlier **Sexual Ethics: An Evangelical Perspective** 1990, revised 1997, and **Welcoming but Not Affirming** 1998 defend **marriage** as a covenantal union and articulate a pastoral stance of **hospitality** joined to traditional **moral norms**. The argument for sexual differentiation is grounded in **imago Dei as relational complementarity**, though he carefully resists any simplistic hierarchy by stressing **mutual submission** as a trinitarian virtue.

Grenz also engages ecclesial gender questions in **Women in the Church** 1995 with Denise Muir Kjesbo, advocating full participation of **women** in ministry within an evangelical framework shaped by **giftedness** and **community discernment**. He seeks an ethic that is neither **fundamentalist** legalism nor **liberal** revisionism, but a **kingdom**-directed holiness that coheres with **trinitarian mutuality**. The emphasis is consistently pastoral, always tied to the life of the **church** as a people formed by **Scripture** in the **Spirit** for the sake of the **world**.

#### 6. Evangelical identity and the renewal of the center
In **Renewing the Center** 2000, expanded 2006, Grenz narrates a contested genealogy of **evangelicalism**, proposing a renewed **center** that is theologically **trinitarian**, **ecclesial**, and **missional**. He resists a boundary-policing identity and presses for a **consensual tradition** that honors **Nicene** and **Reformation** core commitments while welcoming **ecumenical** enrichment. Earlier, **Revisioning Evangelical Theology** 1993 had already signaled his distance from **propositional inerrantism** as the doctrinal linchpin, replacing it with **christological** and **trinitarian** nodes that generate a theological habitat for doctrinal consensus and moral formation. Grenz’s collaboration with **Roger E. Olson** in **20th-Century Theology** 1992 maps the twentieth-century shift from **classical theism** to **historicized theologies**, allowing him to situate evangelicalism within a broader story in which **Barth** reconfigures **revelation**, **Pannenberg** reconfigures **eschatology**, and **Moltmann** reconfigures **the Trinity**.

This evangelical renewal is pedagogically extended in **Who Needs Theology** 1996 and the **Pocket Dictionary of Theological Terms** 1999 with **Guretzki** and **Nordling**, tools aimed at forming the **laity** for theological literacy. The center that Grenz envisions is doctrinally thick yet hospitable, marked by **worship**, **catechesis**, and **mission**, where **Scripture** governs, **tradition** instructs, and **culture** is engaged in hopeful critique. The strategic aim is communal coherence without **sectarianism**, a catholic evangelicalism ordered by the **triune God**.

#### 7. Scripture, truth, and epistemic humility
Grenz’s bibliology affirms **inspiration**, **authority**, and **trustworthiness** of **Scripture**, while refusing to make **inerrancy** the master category of theological identity. He prefers **canonical** and **narrative** accounts of biblical authority situated in the **community’s** worship and proclamation, convinced that **truth** is secured and known eschatologically as the **Spirit** leads the church into all truth. In **A Primer on Postmodernism** 1996 he interprets the postmodern turn as both judgment and opportunity for **evangelical theology**, freeing it from false **foundations** while recalling it to **Trinity**, **community**, and **mission**. This yields a modest but confident **critical realism**, suspicious of both totalization and skepticism, grounded instead in the **resurrection** as the pledge of reality’s final disclosure.

His interlocutors within evangelicalism include **Carl F. H. Henry** and **Millard Erickson**, whose **foundationalist** and **propositional** emphases he revises, as well as **Kevin Vanhoozer**, who critiques and complements Grenz by advocating **theodramatic hermeneutics** that keep **Scripture’s** canonical form central. Grenz responds that doctrine is the church’s **communal wisdom** for faithful performance, and that the **Spirit’s** agency guards the community from captivity to the flux of **culture**. The result is an epistemology of **humility** and **hope**, governed by **Jesus Christ**, witnessed in **Scripture**, and enacted by the **church**.

#### 8. Interlocution across traditions and the charge of postconservatism
Grenz is often located within so-called **postconservative evangelicalism**, a label popularized by **Roger E. Olson**, that names an evangelicalism renewed by the **Trinity**, open to **tradition**, and attentive to **culture** without capitulation. He engages **Roman Catholic** and **Orthodox** sources, especially **patristic** accounts of *perichoresis*, and shows sympathy for **ecumenical** trajectories that reframe **soteriology** as participation and **ecclesiology** as communal holiness. Dialogue partners include **John Zizioulas** on personhood, **Catherine Mowry LaCugna** on the economy of the **Trinity**, **Jürgen Moltmann** on the **history of God**, and **Stanley Hauerwas** on the **virtues** and **politics** of the church. From these he borrows conceptual tools, yet he retains an evangelical accent on **conversion**, **mission**, and **biblical preaching**.

Detractors, among them **D. A. Carson** and some confessional Protestants, warn that the **Scripture-tradition-culture triad** blurs **Sola Scriptura**, that **social trinitarianism** risks softening **divine aseity**, and that **communal hermeneutics** can relativize **doctrine**. Grenz answers by doubling down on **eschatological objectivity** and the **Spirit’s** governance in the church. He contends that orthodox **dogma** persists not by escape from history but by the **Spirit’s** fidelity through history, an evangelical confidence anchored in the **risen Lord**.

#### 9. Final years, death, and emerging legacy
Grenz’s death in 2005 at fifty-five cut short a fertile program that had already reshaped **evangelical theology**. His later work continued to refine a **trinitarian metaphysics** of **relationality**, a communally located **theological method**, and a program for a **catholic evangelical center**. Students and colleagues at **Regent College** and beyond testify to a generative legacy that helped normalize the **trinitarian turn** in evangelical dogmatics, advanced discussions of **imago Dei**, **sexual ethics**, and **virtue**, and permitted fruitful engagement with **postmodernity** without surrender. Subsequent evangelical voices, including **Vanhoozer** in **The Drama of Doctrine** and **William J. Abraham** in canonically attuned **epistemology**, intersect and at times correct Grenz’s proposals, evidencing a living tradition of disciplined reception and critique.

Grenz’s corpus remains widely used in theological education, from **Theology for the Community of God** as a comprehensive text to accessible guides like **Who Needs Theology**. The enduring contribution is the insistence that evangelical theology be unambiguously **trinitarian**, profoundly **ecclesial**, and attentively engaged with **culture** under the **eschatological lordship** of Christ. His wager that **community** is the primary location of theological knowledge continues to provoke both imitation and scrutiny.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation in contrastive principle
From a confessional Reformed and WTS vantage, Grenz’s retrieval of **trinitarian dogma**, his **eschatological** orientation, and his stress on **churchly formation** are welcomed as correctives to reductionist **propositionalism**. Yet significant tensions arise. His **Scripture-tradition-culture triad** appears to recalibrate **Sola Scriptura**, risking a relocation of normativity from **self-authenticating Scripture** to **communal consensus**. His **postfoundationalism** trades the Reformed **covenantal epistemology** of **self-attesting revelation** and **Spirit-wrought certainty** for an eschatologically deferred **critical realism** that can render present doctrinal judgments provisional in a way that undercuts confessional clarity. His **social trinitarianism**, even when balanced by appeals to **inseparable operations** and **consubstantiality**, presses toward a personalist metaphysic difficult to reconcile with **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and the **Creator-creature distinction** at the heart of classical **Reformed orthodox** theology. Anthropologically, the **imago Dei as relational destiny** enriches communal ethics but obscures the confessional pattern of **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness** in covenant with God. Ecclesiologically, a believers’ church shaped by **practices** rightly honors the **community**, but a Reformed account would anchor identity in the **Word and sacrament** as **ordinary means of grace**, interpreted through **covenant** and governed by **regulative worship**. A constructive Reformed alternative would retain Grenz’s **trinitarian** and **eschatological** emphases while securing method in **Scripture’s self-witness**, ontology in **classical theism**, and mission in the **catholicity** of the **covenant of grace**.
