### TITLE
Todd Rester models a confessional retrieval of **Reformed scholasticism** that strengthens contemporary **Reformed orthodoxy** in both content and method.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Todd Rester**, a contemporary Reformed historian and theologian, works within the late twentieth and early twenty first century recovery of **early modern Reformed orthodoxy**.
- His work is embedded in the movement of **post-Barthian** Reformed students returning to **sixteenth and seventeenth century scholastic sources** for constructive dogmatics.

- Methodologically, Rester embodies a self consciously **confessional Reformed** stance that treats the **Westminster Standards** as faithful expositions of Scripture and as guides to doctrinal retrieval.
- He practices a historically sensitive yet normatively committed use of **Reformed scholastic** sources, rejecting both naive traditionalism and historicist relativism in the doctrine of **revelation**.
- Epistemically, his method reflects a **Van Tilian** appreciation of the antithesis together with a robust affirmation of the catholic **classical theist** tradition.

- As general editor and translator for **Petrus Van Mastrichts Theoretical-Practical Theology** volumes 1–3, 2018–2022, Rester helps retrieve a fully developed scholastic doctrine of **God, predestination, and Christ**.
- In his translations and introductions to **Gisbertus Voetius**, he spotlights the integration of **piety and polemics** in the Nadere Reformatie tradition.
- Through lectures and essays at **Westminster Theological Seminary**, he advances a vision of **historical theology** as a handmaid to systematics, especially for doctrines of Scripture and God.
- His work on the intellectual context of **early modern Reformed dogmatics** highlights the continuity of **Calvin**, **Beza**, and high orthodoxy over against the narrative of Protestant scholastic decline.

- Rester materially contributes to the loci of **revelation and Scripture**, by showing how early modern Reformed patterns of exegesis and scholastic method can serve present doctrinal clarity.
- He is prominent for **doctrine of God and predestination**, through Van Mastricht and Voetius, strengthening the confessional Reformed account of **simplicity, immutability, and decree**.
- He helps shape discussions of **church and piety**, retrieving Nadere Reformatie emphases on experiential religion within a doctrinally thick ecclesiology.

- For a **Reformed exam angle**, you should present Rester as a trustworthy guide to the world of **Reformed scholasticism** whose work decisively undercuts caricatures of orthodoxy as rationalist or unpastoral.
- You should also stress that Rester is an ally in defending **confessional, classical theism** and a high doctrine of Scripture against both liberal revisionism and biblicist anti tradition sentiment.

- Comparison handles: set Rester and his Van Mastricht against **Karl Barth**, especially on **Scripture, divine simplicity, and election**.
- Also compare Rester shaped scholastic retrieval with **Richard Muller** and contrast both with more critical narratives about orthodoxy in **Alister McGrath** or **Paul Helm**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Todd Rester belongs to the generation shaped by the late twentieth and early twenty first century rediscovery of **early modern Reformed orthodoxy**, exemplified by the work of **Richard Muller**. Trained as a historian of theology and serving in institutions like **Westminster Theological Seminary**, his intellectual formation occurs within a confessionally robust, Van Til influenced, yet history conscious environment. His professional work, especially as translator and editor of **Petrus Van Mastricht** and **Gisbertus Voetius**, situates him in the heart of the movement that tries to reestablish a living continuity between classic Reformed scholasticism and contemporary systematic theology.

The driving problem Rester is trying to address is the persistent modern caricature that **Reformed scholasticism** represents a rationalist betrayal of **Calvin** and a decline from biblical vitality into arid logic. This caricature appears both in liberal Protestant narratives and in certain evangelical anti scholastic reactions that pit warm piety against careful dogmatics. Through his work on Van Mastrichts **Theoretical-Practical Theology** and on the Dutch Nadere Reformatie, Rester seeks to show that orthodoxy is simultaneously doctrinally precise, exegetically grounded, and experientially rich. The deeper problem is how to enable the contemporary church, formed by **Barthian** themes or by pragmatic evangelicalism, to hear the voice of classic Reformed theology as a helpful teacher rather than an antiquarian curiosity.

At the same time, Rester is operating against a background of postmodern suspicion of metanarratives, debates about **historical theology** as descriptive versus constructive, and ongoing tensions about the role of confessions such as the **Westminster Confession of Faith**. His context involves not only academic questions about seventeenth century texts but also pastoral and ecclesial concerns about preaching, catechesis, and the spiritual health of Reformed churches. His retrieval of **Van Mastricht** and **Voetius** is therefore not antiquarian; it is an attempt to answer the problem of how a confessional church today can inhabit both the catholic Christian tradition and the specific insights of Reformed scholasticism without capitulating to either liberal revisionism or fundamentalist biblicism.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically, Rester is explicit that **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi of theology, in keeping with **classic Reformed orthodoxy**. Yet his consistent emphasis, drawn especially from **Van Mastricht**, is that Scripture is not approached as a set of proof texts only, but as a unified canon that demands careful exegesis, dogmatic synthesis, and practical application. In the structure of Theoretical-Practical Theology he highlights Van Mastrichts fourfold method: the **exegetical, dogmatic, elenctic, and practical** treatment of each locus. This pattern shows how **revelation** in Scripture is received through careful engagement with the text, structured doctrinally in accord with the churchs confessions, defended polemically against errors, and then pressed home pastorally.

With regard to **reason**, Rester clearly follows the classic scholastic distinction, so visible in **Voetius** and **Turretin**, between reason as an instrument subordinate to Scripture and reason as an autonomous principium. He defends the former and rejects the latter. In lectures and introductions, he is keen to rebut the charge that scholastic orthodoxy adopted a Thomistic natural theology in a way that compromised **sola Scriptura**. Instead, he shows how early modern Reformed theologians affirmed a modest natural knowledge of God, while rigorously subordinating all **theological** reasoning to the light of special revelation. This aligns with a **Van Tilian** concern for the creator creature distinction and the principial role of revelation, yet also retrieves the catholic affirmation of theistic proofs in a properly subordinated fashion.

Rester understands **experience** and **history** not as alternative sources of revelation, but as arenas in which the Word of God is received and obeyed. Drawing on the Nadere Reformatie as interpreted through **Voetius**, he emphasizes *experientia* as the believers Spirit wrought appropriation of revealed truth. This experiential dimension is integrated with, not opposed to, doctrinal precision. Likewise, his use of **church history** is not neutral description; it is confessional and norm aware. He reads figures like Van Mastricht as faithful expositors of biblical and confessional truth, while still situating them in the contested debates with **Roman Catholic** and **Remonstrant** opponents. Here there is some creative tension. Contemporary historical guild norms stress methodological neutrality, while Rester, as a confessional scholar, argues that one cannot rightly understand the sources without entering sympathetically into their theological claims about **revelation and church**.

Finally, Rester treats the **church** as the primary context where theological knowledge is received and transmitted. His method presupposes what the Reformed scholastics assumed: that theology is a churchly science, ordered to the ministry of Word and sacrament. Hence his commitment to translation and edition work is itself methodological. Making **Van Mastricht** and **Voetius** accessible is an ecclesial act that returns the resources of the catholic and Reformed tradition to pastors, students, and elders, so that the church may speak more faithfully of the triune **God** today.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is that Scripture is the inspired, inerrant, sufficient, and perspicuous Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and obedience, as articulated in the **Westminster Confession** chapters 1 and 14. Rester, through his work on **Van Mastrichts Theoretical-Practical Theology** volume 1 on prolegomena, retrieves an account of revelation and Scripture that is fully confessional yet more nuanced than many modern treatments. He shows how Van Mastricht integrates the doctrine of Scripture into a broader theology of God speaking in both nature and Scripture, while carefully distinguishing general and special revelation. Interlocutors here include neo orthodox critiques of inerrancy in **Karl Barth** as well as evangelical biblicist tendencies that isolate proof texts from the confessional and catholic pattern. By highlighting Van Mastrichts orderly account of **inspiration, canonicity, and authority**, Rester strengthens a Reformed doctrine of Scripture that is both intellectually robust and spiritually oriented to the edification of the church.

Second, in the locus of the **doctrine of God and divine attributes**, the confessional baseline is articulated in **Westminster Confession** chapter 2 and in classic Reformed scholastics like **Turretin** and **Bavinck**: God is simple, immutable, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, and impassible, the one spiritual essence in three consubstantial persons. Rester, through his translation and exposition of Van Mastricht and his appreciation for **Voetius**, recovers a thick doctrine of **divine simplicity and immutability** that directly challenges contemporary evangelical and analytic revisions. In **Theoretical-Practical Theology** volume 2, Van Mastricht unfolds Gods essence and attributes, and Rester highlights how this is simultaneously exegetical, metaphysical, and pastoral. Opponents and interlocutors include open theists and certain **analytic theists** who reject or modify simplicity and impassibility, as well as some Barthian trajectories that collapse classical metaphysics into a history centered account of God. Rester positions classical Reformed theism as both faithful to Scripture and philosophically serious, and he helps contemporary Reformed theology see that retrieving **simplicity** is not optional but integral to a robust trinitarian and christological confession.

Third, in the locus of **predestination and providence**, the confessional baseline is sovereign unconditional election and reprobation, grounded in Gods eternal good pleasure, as in **Westminster Confession** chapters 3 and 5 and in the **Canons of Dort**. Rester, by way of Van Mastrichts detailed treatment of **election, reprobation, and providence** in Theoretical-Practical Theology volume 2 and 3, reasserts the precision and warmth of high Reformed orthodoxy on this point. He shows how Van Mastricht refines the earlier work of **Gomarus** and **Voetius**, carefully distinguishing decree and execution, while keeping the pastoral intention of the doctrine to humble the sinner, exalt grace, and comfort believers. Here interlocutors include **Remonstrant** theologians historically, and more recently **Karl Barth** and various forms of hypothetical universalism that modify classic double predestination. Rester highlights the way Reformed scholastics grounded predestination in **Christ as mediator** in a supralapsarian or infralapsarian framework, and he presents this as a confessional corrective to both caricatures of a cold decretalism and modern attempts to dissolve election into a vague universalism.

Fourth, in the locus of **church, piety, and Christian life**, the classic Reformed confessional baseline ties the visible and invisible church, Word and sacrament, and discipline to the believers growth in holiness as summarized in **Westminster Confession** chapters 25–27 and 13. Rester, drawing on **Voetius** and Van Mastrichts practical sections, underscores that Reformed scholasticism is deeply concerned with **experiential religion**. The Nadere Reformatie, often mediated through figures like **Brakel**, is shown to be doctrinally robust and experientially searching. Rester stresses that early modern Reformed theology did not separate doctrine and life but saw spiritual exercises, self examination, and communion with Christ as organic outflows of sound teaching. The interlocutors here include forms of **pietism** that detach experience from confessional structure and forms of confessionalism that reduce piety to bare orthodoxy. Rester offers the scholastic pattern as a model in which ecclesial structures, doctrinal clarity, and Spirit wrought piety coinhere.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Rester is, in a sense, a curator and advocate of **Reformed orthodoxy** rather than a revisionist. Classical figures like **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** already anticipated the patterns he highlights, yet his work shows how early modern scholastics like **Van Mastricht** and **Voetius** fill in the architecture. Calvin provides the scriptural and pastoral foundations, Turretin the polemical precision, and Bavinck the dogmatic synthesis, while Van Mastricht as presented by Rester shows a fully integrated exegetical, scholastic, and practical theology. Rester operates self consciously in the line of **Vos** and **Van Til**, who both insisted on the covenantal and confessional nature of the theological enterprise, but he helps correct a possible narrowness in some Van Tilian circles by retrieving robust scholastic metaphysics and catholic categories like **simplicity and actus purus**.

There are, however, points where a Westminster examiner must press. One concern is the danger of allowing admiration for **Reformed scholasticism** to slide into an uncritical traditionalism that treats any early modern distinction as de facto normative, without subjecting it to fresh biblical scrutiny. Another is the risk of overstating the continuity among all strands of orthodoxy, underplaying real differences between, for example, certain supralapsarian and infralapsarian streams or between Scottish and Dutch trajectories on **covenant theology**. A confessional Reformed student must affirm that tradition is ministerial, not magisterial, and that Scripture alone norms all scholastic formulations.

Yet there are also rich places to learn. Rester shows contemporary Reformed theologians how to inhabit the sources of their own tradition with scholarly care and spiritual sympathy. He demonstrates, through Van Mastricht, that a classical **doctrine of God** need not be abstract or divorced from preaching, but can be taught and applied in the pulpit and catechism class. He models, in his treatment of **revelation and Scripture**, how to resist both liberal historicism and conservative biblicist proof texting by returning to the exegetical and confessional patterns of orthodoxy. From a Westminster perspective, his work is a reminder that the way forward in systematics often requires going back to the riches of seventeenth century Reformed dogmatics and then rearticulating them in the contemporary idiom.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, it is safe to open with a sentence like this: Todd Rester is a contemporary Reformed historian whose translation of **Petrus Van Mastrichts Theoretical-Practical Theology** has become a major instrument in the retrieval of early modern **Reformed scholasticism** for the church today. That line signals his role as mediator rather than a theological innovator, anchors him in a named work, and frames him positively for a Westminster committee. It is also safe to say that Rester exemplifies a confessional, Scripture first approach to **historical theology** that seeks to serve the doctrinal and pastoral needs of the church. These kinds of sentences make it clear that you understand his work as constructive and ecclesial rather than merely academic.

You must avoid loose phrases that would suggest that Rester is doing a neutral or purely descriptive **history of doctrine** with no theological commitments. To say that he is simply a historian without a confessional stance would misrepresent his role within the Reformed scholastic retrieval and could invite examiners to press you on the status of the **Westminster Standards** in theological method. Likewise, you should not imply that Rester is a major independent dogmatician on the level of **Bavinck** or **Barth**; his chief significance lies in mediating Van Mastricht and Voetius, not in constructing novel systems. Avoid language that suggests he is reviving a rationalist or rigid **scholasticism**; instead, qualify that he retrieves a scholastic method that is thoroughly biblical, confessional, and pastoral.

Examiners may exploit typical misunderstandings. One common misunderstanding is to assume that any strong emphasis on scholastic method implies a downplaying of **piety and experience**. You should be ready to say that, for Rester and for Van Mastricht, the practical and experiential dimension is integral to theology. Another misunderstanding is the notion that early modern Reformed orthodoxy is monolithic; Rester is aware of diversity within orthodoxy, and a good candidate will acknowledge both the unity and internal variety of figures like **Voetius, Cocceius, and Turretin**. A further landmine lies in confusing Rester with the broader **Muller school** on issues like natural theology and the use of **Thomistic metaphysics**. You should be prepared to affirm that Rester appreciates the catholic metaphysical grammar of simplicity and act, yet insists, in line with **Van Til**, on the principial role of special revelation and the creator creature distinction. If asked, you can safely say that Rester represents a kind of confessional, Van Til friendly scholastic retrieval that seeks to hold together the best of catholic classical theism and Reformed confessional specificity.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Todd Resters work is to be warmly affirmed as a model of confessional, church serving **historical theology** that retrieves early modern **Reformed scholasticism** for the health of contemporary doctrine and piety, especially in the loci of Scripture, God, and predestination; we should embrace his insistence that theology must be exegetical, confessional, and practical, and we can gladly commend his mediation of **Van Mastricht** and **Voetius** as tools to strengthen classical theism and experiential Calvinism, while still denying any tendency to absolutize particular scholastic formulations or to treat tradition as co equal with Scripture, and if pressed to land the plane we would say that we stand with Rester in using the best of early modern Reformed dogmatics as a subordinate, ministerial norm under the supreme authority of Gods **Word** in service of the churchs worship of the triune God.
