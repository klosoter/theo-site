### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and methodological stance
C. John Jack Collins emerges as a contemporary **evangelical** Old Testament scholar whose formation spans **MIT** in the natural sciences and a **PhD in Hebrew linguistics** at the **University of Liverpool** in 1989, culminating in a long professorship at **Covenant Theological Seminary** in the **Presbyterian Church in America**. This dual fluency in technical science and Semitic philology makes his voice distinctive in late twentieth and early twenty-first century discussions of **creation**, **divine action**, and **Scripture’s truthfulness**. He operates self-consciously within a **critical realist** framework, rejecting both naïve biblicism and corrosive skepticism, and he articulates the *sensus literalis* as the communicative intention of the human and divine author discerned through **literary form**, **discourse pragmatics**, and **canonical location**. Influenced by **speech-act theory** and **E. D. Hirsch** on authorial intention, Collins construes biblical texts as acts of divine discourse whose **illocutions** bind readers to theological claims, while their **perlocutions** aim to shape covenantal obedience. The upshot is a hermeneutic that prizes **genre sensitivity** and **plain-sense realism**, never collapsing **theology** into **philology**, yet never abstracting doctrine from the stable *ordo significandi* of the text.

Collins situates this method within classic Christian reflection on **providence** and **creation**, drawing on **Aquinas’s** schema of **primary and secondary causality** to underwrite robust **divine action** in and through creaturely processes. This allows him to affirm *creatio ex nihilo* and ongoing providence *ad extra* without opposing them to creaturely regularities. He embraces **Augustine’s** practical counsel about the limits of technical exegesis when Christians speak before the watching world, while refusing the capitulation of **doctrinal substance** to so-called neutral science. The posture is neither **foundationalist evidentialism** nor **fideistic insulation** but a careful **Reformed realism** that lets **special revelation** norm **general revelation** even as the two are mutually illuminating.

#### 2. Scripture, truth, and the ESV project
In the wake of the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy**, Collins’s program advances a robust doctrine of **Scripture’s truthfulness** that is literarily attuned. As a member of the **ESV Translation Committee** and **Old Testament editor** for the **ESV Study Bible** in 2008, he labored for **transparent equivalence** and careful **discourse analysis** across Hebrew narrative and poetry. His contributions model an inerrancy shaped by **genre realism**: in the Bible, **poetic hyperbole**, **elevated narration**, and **conventional cosmography** can convey real states of affairs without modern scientific packaging. He rejects the false choice between **literalism** as wooden facticity and **nonrealism** as merely edifying story, preferring to speak of **exalted prose narrative** that communicates history with liturgical artistry. The result is an exegetical posture that treats the text as linguistic action performed in Israel’s covenant world, disclosing not only propositions but also **moral ontology**, **teleology**, and a **sacramental vision** of creation.

The epistemic corollary is **critical realism** about historical claims. Collins denies that genre determination permits evacuating **referential truth** from **Genesis 1–11**, and he resists what he sees in **Peter Enns** as a slide from ANE similarity to **canon-level skepticism**. At the same time, Collins deploys ANE comparison to sharpen Scripture’s **polemical monotheism**, refusing both **concordism** with ancient cosmography and any relativizing that would reduce **YHWH’s creatio** to a mythic convenience. In short, **inerrancy**, **authorial intention**, and **genre** function together to preserve both the text’s humanity and its truthful divine discourse.

#### 3. Creation, days, and divine action
The monographic arc from **The God of Miracles** in 2000 to **Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?** in 2003 and **Genesis 1–4** in 2006 sets Collins’s constructive agenda. In **The God of Miracles** he defends a realist account of **special divine action** against naturalist reduction, appropriating **Aquinas** and **Plantinga** to argue that miracle and providence are not rivals to nature but modes of **primary causality** operating with and beyond **secondary causes**. With **Science and Faith**, he extends the case: science’s **methodological naturalism** is tolerable as a research policy if recognized as **provisional** and non-metaphysical, but it becomes idolatrous when converted into **metaphysical naturalism**. This leaves space for Christians to practice rigorous science while confessing **Trinitarian creation** and **providence**.

His **Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary** crystallizes Collins’s view of the **days of creation** as **analogical days**: God’s work is depicted in a week that is like ours but not identical, using **temporal metaphor** and **literary symmetry** to teach theological truth about God’s **ordering wisdom**, **Sabbath climax**, and human **vocation**. The stylistic profile of Genesis 1 is not poetry strictly considered, but **elevated prose narrative** with deliberate figurative features, permitting genuine affirmation that God made the world without forcing a 24-hour chronology. Collins’s approach here stands in conversation with **Meredith Kline’s framework hypothesis** and **Herman Bavinck’s** broad door for pre-fall processes, while resisting both **hyper-literalism** and **anti-realist functionalism**.

On **divine action**, Collins opposes any hermeneutic that restricts God to **non-intervention** or reduces miracle to **phenomenological description**. He argues that the biblical narrative presupposes a world where God can and does perform **signs and wonders** within and beyond ordinary regularities. This is not a counsel of the gaps but a metaphysic of **participation** in which creaturely being depends on God’s continuous upholding and may be especially configured as sign.

#### 4. Image, fall, and moral ontology
Across these works Collins articulates a thick account of the **image of God** as a **royal-priestly vocation**. In **Genesis 1–4**, the image entails rational and moral capacities, relationality, and a commission to be **vice-regents** who extend ordered life under God. The fall of **Genesis 3** is a historical rupture that disorders this vocation, introducing **spiritual death** and, for humanity, **mortality**. Collins is careful with the scope of **pre-fall death**: he entertains that animal death may have been part of the original economy without impugning God’s goodness, while insisting that **human death** and alienation arise through Adam’s sin. His reading of **Genesis 4** further uncovers early culture as ambiguous fruit of common grace in a fallen world, a theme that buttresses his nuanced take on **technology**, **science**, and **wisdom** as creational goods prone to perversion.

Moral knowledge, on this account, is both **creationally embedded** and **textually normed**. Collins appeals to **natural law** in a modest, biblical key, arguing that Romans 1–2 fits a picture of common moral awareness under **covenant accountability**, while the Torah clarifies and deepens that knowledge for Israel’s **priestly nation**. Theologically, this grounds his confidence that **general revelation** can inform ethics and even scientific vocation, though always under the canon’s judicial light.

#### 5. Adam and Eve, history and genealogy
The most widely discussed of Collins’s contributions is **Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care** in 2011. Here he argues for a **historical Adam and Eve** as the first true humans and the **federal head** and mother of the human family, necessary for maintaining **original sin**, **covenant theology**, and **Christ’s federal obedience** as the last Adam. The argument works exegetically through **Genesis 2–3**, **Romans 5**, and **1 Corinthians 15**, linguistically through the semantics of **adam** and **ish/ishah**, and canonically through the plotline from **creation** to **new creation**. He resists proposals from **BioLogos** and **Peter Enns** that treat Adam as a literary everyman, contending that Paul’s argument presupposes an **historical individual** whose sin and headship are not mere archetype.

At the same time, Collins engages candidly with **population genetics** and the claim that humanity descends from an original group rather than a single couple. He neither baptizes nor demonizes current models. Instead, he explores **genealogical** and **socio-cultural** scenarios in which a real Adam and Eve could stand at the headwaters of human story and covenant, becoming universal **ancestors** over time even if genetic lines are complex. This line of reasoning anticipates later **genealogical Adam** proposals and seeks to preserve **theological entailments** without staking everything on disputed scientific reconstructions. The rationale is not concordist desperation but a refusal to allow provisional science to dictate the possibilities of **providence** and **federal theology**.

#### 6. Reading Genesis well: ANE, genre, and truth
In **Reading Genesis Well** from 2018 Collins distills decades of exegetical labor into a pedagogy of **genre realism** and **ANE comparison**. He argues that Genesis 1–11 is **literarily sophisticated historiography**, not modern reportage and not myth emptied of referential content. By attending to **high style**, **repetition**, **parallelism**, and **narrative sequencing**, one can distinguish what the text claims from the pictorial medium it employs. Against **John Walton’s** fully **functional ontology** reading of Genesis 1, Collins affirms that the text speaks about **material origins** as well as functions, even as it embeds those claims in temple and liturgical imagery. Against **young-earth literalism**, he maintains that **analogical days** and literary artifice are exegetically responsible and hermeneutically ancient, with resources in **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and **Bavinck**.

Collins’s use of the **Ancient Near East** guards against two naivetés. First, it refutes the idea that Genesis dropped from heaven devoid of cultural speech; second, it resists the idea that similarity to ANE genres undermines **revelatory uniqueness**. By analyzing both continuities and polemical **monotheistic** contrasts, he positions Genesis as Scripture that domesticates cultural idiom to proclaim **YHWH’s sovereignty**, **human dignity**, and the **moral structure** of reality. The constancy of his **critical realist** posture is evident: Genesis teaches true things about the world through literary artistry, and truth remains truth when uttered as **story**.

#### 7. Science, faith, and public reason
Returning to the science–faith nexus, Collins frames **methodological naturalism** as a restricted tool rather than a universal creed. In **Science and Faith** he rehearses **Alvin Plantinga’s** argument that Christian theism underwrites the **cognitive reliability** required for science, whereas naturalism struggles with self-referential defeat. He also distinguishes **explanatory closure** in a lab protocol from **metaphysical closure** in worldview, warning against the latter’s smuggling into public reason. On contentious areas like **evolution**, Collins allows for a range of Christian positions under the **rule of faith** so long as **divine agency**, **image-bearing**, and **Adam’s historicity** are not traded away. He critiques **Intelligent Design** and **theistic evolution** alike where they overreach, praising ID’s philosophical challenge to materialism while faulting some versions for methodological shortcuts, and praising evolutionary theists for rejecting naturalism while faulting those who decouple **providence** and **special divine action**.

The moral ecology of this public posture is distinctively **Augustinian**. Christians may participate in common projects of knowledge under **common grace**, but they do so as those whose **final authority** is canon, whose **confidence** rests in **providence**, and whose **charity** toward opponents includes clarity about **noetic effects** of sin. In this way Collins practices a chastened **public theology** that is neither triumphalist nor privatized.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and influence
Collins’s interlocutors have included **Peter Enns** on the nature of **myth and history**, **John Walton** on **functional ontology** and ANE backgrounds, **Denis Lamoureux** and **BioLogos** authors on **Adam**, and **young-earth creationists** on **chronology**. He draws strength from **Bavinck** on **organic inspiration** and **creation’s coherence**, **Kline** on the **framework’s** polemical structure and **Sabbath**, and **Aquinas** on **causality**. He also often invokes **C. S. Lewis** for the imaginative capture of **myth that became fact**, a trope that helps modern readers receive Genesis’s **exalted prose** without suspicion.

Institutionally, his long service at **Covenant Theological Seminary**, editorial labor for the **ESV**, and accessible essays have given him wide reach in the **evangelical** and **Reformed** worlds. His work has shaped pastors and teachers who needed a pathway between **hyper-literalist** and **skeptical** hermeneutics, a way to affirm **inerrancy**, **historic fall**, and **doctrinal realism** while engaging modern knowledge practices. The debate continues, but his model has become a recognizable option in evangelical pedagogy.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis and constructive coherence
Across the corpus one can trace a coherent doctrinal synthesis. **Doctrine of Scripture**: truthful divine discourse, grasped via **authorial intention** and **genre realism**. **Doctrine of creation**: *creatio ex nihilo*, **providence** through **primary and secondary causes**, **analogical days** as the textual mode of instruction, and **Sabbath teleology**. **Anthropology and sin**: **image of God** as royal-priestly commission, **historical Adam** as **federal head**, **original sin** as corruption and guilt. **Christology and soteriology**: implicit but steady, in that **last Adam** typology requires the first; **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** anchor atonement’s federal logic. **Public theology**: **critical realism** that refuses both naturalist closure and fideist retreat. The glue is a commitment to **truthful depiction through literary artistry**, a conviction that frames biblical cosmology as communicative vehicle rather than error-prone science.

This synthesis is not an eclectic compromise but a principled **Reformed evangelical** posture. The canon’s authority is supreme, the **covenant** structures of Scripture remain intact, and the church’s **creedal core** constrains speculative freedom. By giving readers tools to distinguish **illocutionary content** from **pictorial medium**, Collins encourages fidelity to what Scripture actually asserts, forestalling both **concordist harmonization** and **historicist deflation**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Collins offers major strengths with notable tensions. Positively, his strong doctrine of **inerrancy**, careful **authorial-intent hermeneutic**, defense of **special divine action**, and robust **historical Adam** align with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. His advocacy of **analogical days** coheres with **Meredith Kline** and can fit the **Westminster Standards** so long as the **Sabbath** as creation ordinance and **providence** as all-encompassing are preserved. His reliance on **Aquinas’s** **primary and secondary causality** and **Plantinga’s** critique of **naturalism** strengthen the metaphysical and epistemic backbone of a **covenantal** worldview. The tensions arise where his qualified acceptance of **methodological naturalism**, openness to **old-earth** temporality, allowance for **animal death** before the fall, and exploration of **genealogical Adam** models may be read by some within **WTS** circles as lending too much deference to shifting scientific consensus and ANE reconstructions. A Van Tilian accent on the **antithesis** and the priority of **revelation** might press Collins to make more explicit how **general revelation** is normed by **special revelation** when apparent conflict arises, and to sharpen the Creator-creature **covenant epistemology** that resists appeals to neutral common ground. Reformed alternatives would stress a more thorough **covenantal apologetic**, center **federal theology** as non-negotiable for any Adam model, and anchor ANE comparison more tightly to **redemptive-historical** and **canonical** control. Yet even with these cautions, Collins’s project remains a valuable contemporary attempt to maintain **doctrinal realism** about **creation**, **fall**, and **Scripture** while navigating modern knowledge, and it can be fruitfully received within **classical Reformed** commitments when tethered decisively to **revelational primacy** and the **covenant** frame.
