- Reformed cue: appreciation for **historical rigor** yet concern for the **regulative principle of worship**, the **verba Domini** in sacramental validity, and the **ordinary means of grace** against liturgical marketization.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and method
Bryan D. Spinks emerges as a leading voice in contemporary **Anglican liturgical theology**, formed in the wake of **Vatican II** and the ecumenically charged **Liturgical Movement** that reconfigured worship across traditions in the 1960s and 1970s. Ordained within the **Church of England** and later long-serving at the **Yale Institute of Sacred Music** and **Yale Divinity School**, he inhabits a space where **historical theology**, **comparative liturgy**, and **pastoral praxis** meet. The intellectual horizon is international, with early attention to **Eastern Christian liturgies** and a career-long engagement with **Anglican rites** from **Cranmer** to **Common Worship**. Spinks’s training in source criticism and ritual history yields a method that treats liturgical texts as primary theological data, often without front-loading confessional conclusions. The resulting stance is a disciplined descriptivism in which *lex orandi, lex credendi* is tested by the empirical record of **anaphoras**, **baptismal rites**, and **eucharistic prayers** across East and West.

This methodological temper owes much to mid-to-late twentieth-century interlocutors. From **Aidan Kavanagh** Spinks adopts the conviction that **liturgy is primary theology**, not a mere expression of prior dogma. From **Paul Bradshaw** he inherits the critical tools of **textual archaeology** and suspicion of tidy origin myths in worship history. From **Alexander Schmemann** and **Gordon Lathrop** he receives a sensitivity to the symbolic density of **anamnesis** and **epiclesis**, as well as the cultural embedment of worship. A feature that distinguishes Spinks is his willingness to hold **Anglican identity** together with the **comparative study of rites**, resisting both denominational insularity and ahistorical universalism. The result is a capacious approach to **inculturation**, wary of procrustean uniformity while attentive to the theological freight carried by gesture, text, and local practice.

#### 2. Anaphoras and the shape of Eucharistic theology
Spinks’s early and enduring contributions cluster around the structure and development of **Eucharistic prayers**. In **The Sanctus in the Eucharistic Prayer** 1991 he traces the rise, theological interpretation, and liturgical location of the **Sanctus** across East and West, showing how the angelic hymn functions as a hinge between **praise** and **consecratory petition**, and how its inclusion refracts debates over **sacrifice**, **presence**, and **eschatology**. The analysis illuminates the elasticity of the **anaphora**, whose grammar is not fixed by a single doctrinal template. Spinks thereby subverts an impoverished equation of validity with a narrow **institution narrative**, highlighting how **epiclesis** and **anamnesis** contribute to the prayer’s consecratory logic. The work exemplifies his readiness to let liturgical patterns unsettle doctrinal reductionisms.

A focal test case is the **East Syrian anaphora of Addai and Mari**, long noted for lacking an explicit **verba Domini**. Through essays and studies reaching into the 1980s and 1990s, Spinks argues for a **dispersed institution** account: the dominical words are not absent but diffused within the anaphora’s theological logic of **thanksgiving**, **memory**, and **Spirit-epiclesis**. He marshals textual witnesses and comparative parallels to show how early **Eucharistic traditions** did not always centralize a verbatim narrative, and he cautions against post-Tridentine Western criteria being retrojected onto Eastern evidence. The ecumenical stakes became conspicuous in 2001, when the **Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith** judged the **Assyrian Church of the East** use of Addai and Mari to be valid. While Spinks does not claim magisterial authority, his work provided scholarly ballast for recognizing a broader grammar of **consecration**, where **anamnesis** and **epiclesis** bear decisive weight.

#### 3. Anglican sources between Reformation and Enlightenment
Spinks’s Anglican scholarship refuses pious nostalgia. In **Liturgy in the Age of Reason: Worship and Sacraments in England and Scotland 1662–c.1800** 2008 he reconstructs post-Restoration practice under the **1662 Book of Common Prayer**, the Scottish **Laudian and Nonjuring** streams, and the complex reception of **epiclesis** in the Scottish 1764 rite that later influenced the American **1789 Eucharist**. The narrative shows how **sacramental theology** in practice was shaped as much by parish life, preaching, and statute, as by **Cranmer** or **Hooker**. Spinks demonstrates the mutations of **eucharistic presence** from **receptionism** to **virtualism**, the contested reintroduction of **weekly communion**, and debates over **confirmation** and **discipline**. The Age of Reason becomes a laboratory in which liturgical conservatism, moral rationalism, and emergent evangelicalism contested the meaning of **Word and sacrament**.

While earlier work attends to Reformation origins, Spinks resists tidy genealogies. He reads **Thomas Cranmer** as both Augustinian and humanist, crafting the **1549** and **1552** rites around a robust **anamnetic** proclamation of Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice and an ecclesially mediated reception. He tracks the later **Richard Hooker** as a theologian who framed **Anglican worship** via **participation** in Christ, not bare memorial. At each point, Spinks presses the historian’s question: what did parishes actually do, sing, and pray, and how did those practices carry **doctrinal meaning**? The answer yields multiple **Anglican uses**, not a monolith, thereby relativizing claims that a single Prayer Book text exhausts Anglican identity.

#### 4. Theologies and rituals of baptism
The twin volumes **Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism** 2006 and **Reformation and Modern Rituals and Theologies of Baptism** 2006–2007 display Spinks’s capacity to interweave rite, doctrine, and culture. He traces the catechumenal arc from **patristic prebaptismal exorcisms** and **scrutinies**, through medieval **sponsorship** and **proxy vows**, to reformational recalibrations under **Luther**, **Calvin**, **Zwingli**, and **Cranmer**. Spinks maps how **infant baptism** reshaped the semiotics of **conversion**, how the **renunciations** and **creed** function catechetically, and how shifts in **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** alter the rite’s theology. The Lutheran affirmation of baptismal **regeneration**, the Reformed stress on **covenant** and **promise**, and the Zwinglian emphasis on **memorial and obedience** are located within concrete ritual ecosystems.

Into the modern era he explores **confirmation** as a moving target, the decline and reinvention of the **catechumenate**, and the ecumenical quest for convergence in **Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry** 1982. Spinks neither canonizes BEM nor dismisses it. Instead he reads it as a symptom of a broader retrieval of **initiation** as an integrated process, balanced precariously between **doctrinal clarity** and **pastoral flexibility**. The volumes stand as exemplars of how to read ritual history theologically, without collapsing **lex orandi** into a thin **lex credendi** slogan or dissolving doctrine into anthropology.

#### 5. Eucharistic synthesis and Anglican plurality
In **Do This in Remembrance of Me: The Eucharist from the New Testament to the Third Millennium** 2013 Spinks offers a grand tour of **Eucharistic theology and practice** across two millennia. He moves from New Testament meals and **Didache** oblations, through patristic accounts of **real presence**, medieval developments in **transubstantiation**, Reformation polemics over **sacrifice** and **presence**, and into modern ecumenical reconfigurations. What distinguishes the treatment is Spinks’s sustained attention to the performative grammar of the **anaphora**: **thanksgiving**, **anamnesis**, **epiclesis**, **intercession**, and **doxology**. He resists any single theory, such as **transubstantiation**, **receptionism**, or **memorialism**, becoming the controlling key, and instead shows how traditions assemble a family of theological notes to articulate **communion with the risen Christ**.

Anglicanism enters as a testing ground for theological plurality disciplined by common prayer. Spinks’s narration attends to **Cranmer’s** shaping of the communion rite around *verbum et sacramenta*, the **1662** settlement’s durable cadences, the **Scottish 1764 epiclesis**, and modern revisions from **Series 3** to **Common Worship**. He stresses how Anglican eucharistic doctrine has ranged from **Calvinian spiritual presence** to **Caroline real presence** and **Tractarian** sacramental realism, all struggling to remain accountable to prayer texts. The upshot is an Anglican via media conceived not as compromise but as a practice of hearing **Scripture**, **tradition**, and **local use** within the anaphoral grammar itself.

#### 6. Worship, culture, and the market
With **The Worship Mall: Contemporary Responses to Contemporary Culture** 2010 Spinks shifts register to thick description of late modern worship ecologies. The central thesis is that churches, including **Anglicans**, now inhabit a marketplace of **liturgical and musical styles** in which identity is negotiated via **genre**, **aesthetics**, and **participatory scripts**. He explores **Pentecostal-charismatic** patterns of praise, **seeker-sensitive** programming, **alternative worship** and **fresh expressions**, and the continued resilience of **choral liturgy** and **cathedral evensong**. Categories such as **authenticity**, **performance**, **embodiment**, and **brand** become indispensable for interpreting why communities adopt or resist particular worship forms. Rather than denounce the market on principle, Spinks asks how **inculturation** can be discerned and disciplined, and how *lex orandi, lex credendi* survives within a consumer milieu.

The argument remains ambivalent, and deliberately so. Spinks suspects that simplistic either-or choices for or against **contemporary worship** fail to grasp how **ritual** carries doctrinal meaning in complex cultural settings. He worries about **aestheticism** and **consumer capture**, but he also prizes local **practical wisdom** and the capacity of churches to pronounce old things new. The net effect is a call for liturgical leadership with **historical memory**, **theological literacy**, and **pastoral feel**, rather than a one-size-fits-all program.

#### 7. Lex orandi, lex credendi recalibrated
Across these projects Spinks recasts *lex orandi, lex credendi* as a dynamic exchange rather than a unilateral rule. In dialogue with **Enrico Mazza** on **sacrifice**, **Paul Bradshaw** on **origins**, and with Anglican forebears like **Hooker**, he argues that **doctrine** and **liturgy** mutually interpret one another, but the locus of primacy often belongs to the enacted **anaphora** and **rite**, not to subsequent scholastic codification. In working with **Eastern liturgies** he widens the horizon of what counts as theologically decisive. When he treats **Anglican history**, he complicates confessional certainties by retrieving the polyphony of **actual parish practice**. And when he turns to **contemporary culture**, he refuses to equate novelty with betrayal or fidelity with stasis, provided the **eucharistic and baptismal grammars** remain legible.

This recalibration does not evacuate normativity. It leans toward a normativity that is thickly historical and ecumenically alert, which means it often arrives through **comparative exemplarity** rather than conceptual fiat. The theologian is admonished to listen to the **prayer** before drafting the **thesis**. That is the key to Spinks’s enduring thesis: **liturgical history functions as theological grammar**, specifying the permissible and fruitful articulations of **presence**, **sacrifice**, **initiation**, and **participation** within and across the Christian traditions.

#### 8. Teacher, editor, and ecumenist
Spinks’s influence radiates through the classroom and editorial work as much as through monographs. At **Yale**, generations of pastors and scholars learned to read **liturgy as theology**, to weigh the **epiclesis** and **anamnesis**, to distinguish **local use** from universal law, and to situate **Anglican worship** within a global Christian frame. In collaboration with figures like **Paul Bradshaw** and in contributions to reference works on **Christian worship**, he helped stabilize a scholarly consensus against romantic origin myths and for evidence-driven **comparative liturgy**. His essays on **Addai and Mari**, his synthesis in **Do This in Remembrance of Me**, and his candid engagement with **The Worship Mall** together model how scholarship can serve both church and academy without capitulating to either partisan apologetic or mere antiquarianism.

Spinks’s Anglicanism is ecumenically porous. He reads **Cranmer** alongside **Chrysostom**, the **1662** alongside **BEM 1982**, **Common Worship** alongside **charismatic praise**, and treats each as a locus of theological learning. The constant is the conviction that **ritual form** and **doctrinal content** belong together, and that attending to the detailed **grammar of the rites** is a primary theological task. In this sense, his work is less a system and more a disciplined habitus: a way of seeing how **God’s economy** becomes audible and visible in the church’s **prayer**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
Reformed readers, especially within a **Westminster Standards** horizon, will salute Spinks’s archival rigor and his chastened claims regarding **lex orandi, lex credendi**, yet raise principled cautions. First, the affirmation of **Addai and Mari** on a **dispersed institution** rationale undercuts the **verba Domini** as constitutive for the Supper in **WCF 27–29**, where the sacramental **sign-word nexus** is bound to Christ’s appointment. The Reformed stress on the **regulative principle of worship** regards explicit dominical authorization as safeguarding the **means of grace** from cultural drift. Second, Spinks’s permissive reading of **inculturation** and his descriptive posture toward the liturgical marketplace in **The Worship Mall** risk normalizing modes of worship whose anthropological logics may contradict a **covenantal theology of Word and sacrament**, where **Scripture** determines the church’s address to God. Third, in Anglican eucharistic history, Spinks rightly credits **Calvin’s spiritual real presence**, yet his broad via media can blur necessary dogmatic discriminations that a Reformed account wishes to keep crisp, such as the denial of **sacrifice of the mass** and the insistence that **faith** receives Christ’s whole person by the Spirit through **preaching** and **elements** joined to the **verba**. A Reformed alternative would integrate Spinks’s historical acumen while reordering the maxim to **lex credendi, lex orandi** under **sola Scriptura**, privileging the **ordinary means** and guarding the Supper’s form and efficacy by Christ’s institution, even as it learns from Spinks to read rites carefully, honor genuine Eastern witnesses, and resist nostalgic simplifications of confessional history.
