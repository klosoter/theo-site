### ESSAY
Stephen Myers stands as a contemporary advocate of **classical Reformed federal theology**, writing and teaching for a generation newly attentive to **covenant categories** and newly embattled by disputes over **republication**, **merit**, and **sacramentality**. Working from the confessional center of North American Reformed churches and seminaries, Myers brings a pastor-scholar cadence to topics once confined to technical scholastic disputations. His horizon is the late modern revival of **Reformed catholicity** that retrieves **Herman Bavinck** and **Johannes Witsius** while refusing to cede biblical-theological gains associated with **Geerhardus Vos**. The setting for his constructive labor includes the aftershocks of **Federal Vision** controversies, the ongoing reassessment of **Meredith Kline** on **Mosaic republication**, and fresh appeals to **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** in covenantal dogmatics. Within this context Myers seeks to ground the church’s doctrine of the covenants in Scripture’s own architecture while stabilizing that doctrine within the durable frame of the **Westminster Standards**.

Myers’s method is a disciplined union of **exegesis**, **dogmatics**, and **historical theology** that treats Scripture as the principium cognoscendi, the basic cognitive source, and the confessions as a tested rule for ecclesial understanding. He favors a scholastic clarity about loci such as the **covenant of works** and the **pactum salutis**, yet he reads these loci through a redemptive-historical lens indebted to **Vos**. The result is not a hybridization but a twofold commitment to the **substance-administration distinction** and to typological development across the canon. He regularly marshals Latin shorthand like *ad intra* and *ad extra* to protect **divine immutability** and *analogia fidei* to safeguard cross-textual argument. The procedural center of gravity is a confessional realism that asserts the knowability of God through his **covenantal self-revelation**, rejects both speculative natural theology unmoored from the economy and historicist reduction of doctrine to history, and embraces a rule of faith normed by **Scripture, creed, and catechism**.

Myers’s chief published statement, **God to Us: Covenant Theology in Scripture** 2022, presents the Reformed covenantal architecture as exegetically motivated and pastorally necessary. The book’s thesis is simple and demanding: the triune God relates to his image-bearing creatures by way of **covenant**, and this covenantal relation is both the medium of revelation and the pathway to eschatological life. In its pages, readers encounter a carefully staged account of the **covenant of works** in Eden, the **covenant of grace** as the postlapsarian economy of salvation, and the **pactum salutis** as the eternal foundation of history’s covenants. Myers structures the argument by moving through Scripture’s covenants with **Noah, Abraham, Moses, David**, and the **new covenant** in Christ, insisting that the unity of redemptive substance is maintained through diverse historical administrations. He deliberately reads **Jeremiah 31**, **Luke 22**, and **Galatians 3** as theological hinge texts, where the exegetical threads of promise, oath, and fulfillment are tightened into Reformed dogmatics.

A defining contribution lies in Myers’s treatment of the **covenant of works**, which he portrays as a graciously established, legally conditioned arrangement for Adam’s attainment of consummate life. Drawing on **Francis Turretin** and **Witsius**, he clarifies that the condition of perfect obedience is not extrinsic to the created order but annexed by divine condescension through covenant. He avoids crass categories of condign merit by speaking of **covenantal reward** and a God-willed eschatological advancement from the *status integritatis* to confirmed Sabbath rest. For Myers, **Genesis 2:15–17** and the **Sabbath motif** disclose a promissory horizon in Eden, while **Romans 5:12–21** yields the legal-federal grammar that makes **Christ as second Adam** intelligible. Within the republication debate, he acknowledges a typological and administrative recapitulation of the works principle at Sinai that is pedagogical and doxological, yet he resists reading the **Mosaic covenant** as a covenant of works in substance. The compass here is the **Westminster Confession of Faith 7 and 19**, where the moral law is republished as rule of life for the redeemed while no postlapsarian covenant is unto life by works.

From here Myers turns to the **covenant of grace** as the single saving substance diversely administered through the economies of **Noah**, **Abraham**, **Moses**, **David**, and **Christ**. The **Noahic covenant** secures a stable theatre of providence for redemption, the **Abrahamic** clarifies the promissory pattern of seed and land that becomes the matrix for justification by faith and global blessing, the **Mosaic** renders the gracious covenant in a national-typological form with a heavy pedagogical law, and the **Davidic** crystallizes the royal line culminating in **Messiah**. Myers’s reading of **Genesis 15** emphasizes divine unilateral oath-making and the passivity of the recipient as hermeneutical keys for **Romans 4** and **Galatians 3**. He draws out the **substance-administration distinction** to maintain unity of salvation across time, arguing that external forms shift with redemptive epochs while the **Christocentric substance** remains identical. In doing so, he engages both **dispensational** alternatives that dissolve unity and **monocovenantal** proposals that flatten law-gospel distinctions.

The **new covenant** occupies pride of place as the climactic administration of the **covenant of grace**, with **Jesus Christ** as its **mediator**, **surety**, and **testator**. Myers insists that **union with Christ** organizes participation in the covenant’s benefits, integrating **justification**, **adoption**, and **sanctification** within a federal frame. He is acute on **Galatians 3–4** and **Hebrews 8–10**, where the forensic grounding of adoption and inheritance is secured in the cross and resurrection. Against the **Federal Vision** and the **New Perspective on Paul**, Myers reasserts **justification by faith alone** as the non-negotiable legal act by which sinners are declared righteous in the courtroom of God, and he locates covenant membership definitively in Christ’s obedience imputed and Spirit-wrought faith bestowed. The **sacraments** are treated as **signs and seals** of the covenant of grace, with **baptism** bearing continuity with **circumcision** for inclusion of the children of believers and the **Lord’s Supper** enacting grateful communion and covenant renewal. Sacramental efficacy, for Myers, is neither automatic nor merely mnemonic, but a Spirit-mediated confirmation to faith consonant with **Westminster** teaching.

Underwriting this federal architecture is Myers’s account of the **pactum salutis**, the intra-trinitarian counsel of peace whereby the Father appoints the Son as mediator and the Spirit as applier of redemption. He retrieves this doctrine as the ontological grounding for the historical covenants while taking pains to guard **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. The pact is not a negotiation that introduces composition in God but a fitting conceptualization of the one simple will of God, appropriated distinctly according to trinitarian relations. Here Myers enlists **Bavinck** and **Turretin** to show that the *ad intra* order of persons and the *ad extra* economy of salvation cohere without collapsing the one into the other. Christ’s **autotheos**, divine aseity, is affirmed in order to secure the full deity of the mediator who assumes covenantal obligations in time, while the Spirit’s mission in the **new covenant** is hailed as the eschatological gift by which the law is written on hearts and communion secured without compromising the Creator-creature distinction.

The ecclesial shape of Myers’s covenant theology is deliberate. The church is the **covenant community**, gathered Lord’s Day by Lord’s Day under the **means of grace** to hear the law and gospel, confess faith, and receive the **sacraments**. He treats **discipline**, **catechesis**, and **public worship** as covenantal acts governed by the headship of Christ and ordered by the **regulative principle**, without collapsing prudence into prescription. Covenant obligations of **obedience** and **gratitude** are tethered to the indicatives of redemption, evidencing a robust **third use of the law** within sanctification. The eschatological horizon of **Sabbath rest** functions as a teleological anchor for Christian pilgrimage. Myers’s pastoral prose aims to wean churches from either antinomian quietism or moralistic activism by re-centering life in the **federal headship** of Christ.

Myers’s conversation partners include the 17th-century federal divines as well as modern exponents of biblical theology. Against **Karl Barth**, he preserves a real **covenant of works** and a real distinction between law and gospel, contending that Barth’s rejection of the former undermines the Adam-Christ parallel in **Romans 5** and weakens the forensic structure of **justification**. With **Meredith Kline**, he shares a sophisticated typological sensitivity and an appreciation for **intrusion ethics**, yet he worries that strong forms of **republication** risk rendering the **Mosaic covenant** a works covenant in substance rather than an administration of grace annexed to typological national life. In contrast with **Baptist new covenant theology**, he argues that **Abrahamic continuity** grounds infant membership without undermining the newness of the **new covenant**. He critiques **dispensational** disjunctions that multiply covenants without a substantial unity, and he resists **monocovenantal** conflations that erase the probationary order of creation. Throughout, he keeps **Witsius’s Economy of the Covenants** and **Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics** near at hand as canonical guides for synthesis.

The coherence of Myers’s account is finally tested in its soteriological center and its doxological edge. The **obedience of the second Adam**, active and passive, is expounded as covenantally necessary for a real **imputation** that grounds peace with God. The **Spirit’s** ushering in of the **new covenant** by writing the law on hearts is not a shift from forensic to participatory paradigms but the grace that makes the justified to live as sons and heirs. The **church’s sacraments** function covenantally, strengthening faith in the promises of God and marking a people who belong to the Lord. Each of these notes is sounded with the gravitas of **Westminster’s** legal-gospel symmetry and the hope of **Jeremiah’s** new-heart promise. In this way, Myers writes for preaching and catechesis as much as for examination halls, pressing the case that covenant doctrine is the grammar of the gospel.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Myers’s covenant theology commendably renews **classical Westminster federalism** with exegetical care and ecclesial tact, and his defense of the **pactum salutis**, **covenant of works**, and **law-gospel** distinction aligns with the best of **Bavinck** and **Witsius**. From a **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, strengths include his redemptive-historical sensitivity and his refusal to let typology corrode the **substance-administration distinction**. Two tensions invite further refinement. First, his cautious account of **republication** protects the unity of the **Mosaic administration**, yet a Vosian and Klinean emphasis on the typological works principle within Israel’s theocratic layer could be granted greater sharpness without surrendering gracious substance. Second, his preference for **covenantal reward** language successfully avoids crass merit but may understate how Reformed orthodox authors deployed qualified merit to secure the parallelism between Adam and Christ. A WTS alternative would press the creator-creature covenantal frame to affirm both the gratuitous origin of the probation and the real, covenantal justice of the reward. On sacraments and church, Myers’s stance is robustly confessional, though a WTS-inflected admonition will keep the priority of **special revelation** and the **means of grace** central against pragmatic ecclesiologies. In sum, his project is a reliable map of the covenantal terrain, marked by a classical compass and calibrated for Scripture’s contours, even where topographical details admit multiple faithful renderings within the Reformed tradition.
