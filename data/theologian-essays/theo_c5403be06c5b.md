### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
David B. Garner has emerged as a careful voice in contemporary **Reformed dogmatics**, shaped by the institutional and intellectual milieu of **Westminster Theological Seminary** and the ecclesial demands of the **Presbyterian Church in America**. His academic career at Westminster, where he has taught **systematic theology** and served in editorial leadership for the **Westminster Theological Journal**, unfolds against the late twentieth and early twenty-first century debates over **biblical authority**, **hermeneutics**, and **global mission**. Trained within the **Vos–Murray–Gaffin** tradition, Garner has appropriated a **redemptive-historical** and **covenantal** method that integrates exegesis and dogmatics under the primacy of **self-attesting Scripture**. His theological stance is palpably **Van Tillian**: knowledge of God is covenantal, analogical, and dependent on **revelation**, such that both theological method and doctrinal content proceed *ab initio* from **God’s triune speech** rather than from autonomous **natural theology**. This method colors his work on **inerrancy** and illuminates his constructive soteriology, where **union with Christ** provides the architectonic horizon for the grace of **adoption**.

The broader historical context for Garner’s work includes the post-1970s consolidation of **evangelical inerrancy** after the **Chicago Statement**, the rise of **postconservative** and **trajectory** hermeneutics, the creation–redemption systematic that seeks deeper **Trinitarian** integration of **biblical theology**, and the missiological challenges posed by **Insider Movements** and the translation of **divine familial terms** in Muslim contexts. Situated within these disputes, Garner’s work is neither reactive nor merely synthetic. It advances a thickly **Trinitarian**, covenantally **economical** reading of Scripture in which God the **Father** adopts sinners into filial union with the **Son** by the **Spirit of adoption**. This **ordo historiae** sensibility attends to the proper distinction and ordered unity of the benefits of Christ, resisting fragmentation of **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption** and resisting reduction of mission to sociological accommodation.

#### 2. Scripture, knowledge, and the authority of God’s Word
Garner’s editorial volume **Did God Really Say? Affirming the Truthfulness and Trustworthiness of Scripture** (2012) crystallizes his **bibliology** and **epistemology**. Here the lineaments of a **covenantal epistemology** come to the fore: Scripture is **self-attesting** because its divine author is self-attesting, and the **Holy Spirit** authenticates the Word’s authority to the church. Drawing appreciatively on **B. B. Warfield** and the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, Garner contends for **inspiration** and **inerrancy** as corollaries of the **Lordship** of the triune God, clarifying that biblical **truthfulness** is not a modern imposition but an entailment of God’s **veracity** in covenant. By embedding **inerrancy** within the categories of **covenant**, **Trinity**, and **self-attestation**, he pushes beyond a merely defensive posture and offers a constructive account resistant to **postconservative** claims that authority is principally located in ecclesial reception or in a **trajectory** beyond the text.

Methodologically, this bibliology functions for Garner as a dogmatic axiom. The **autopistic** authority of Scripture determines not only his exegesis of **adoption** in **Romans 8** and **Galatians 4** but also his missiological judgments about rendering **Son of God** and **Father** in translation. In both fields, he sees fidelity to **divine speech** as the determinative norm: to alter familial language in mission compromises **Trinitarian** revelation and to treat **adoption** as a mere sociological metaphor compromises the covenantal intent of **redemption**. The epistemic stance is thus not an extraneous preface but the very warp and weft of Garner’s **systematic theology**.

#### 3. Sons in the Son: adoption as integrative soteriology
Garner’s most substantial constructive contribution is **Sons in the Son: The Riches and Reach of Adoption in Christ** (2016), a monograph that seeks to reposition **adoption** within **Reformed soteriology**. While acknowledging influential antecedents such as **J. I. Packer’s** warm pastoral essay on adoption and exegetical studies by **Trevor J. Burke**, Garner argues that adoption has been underdeveloped in dogmatic treatments and frequently subordinated to **justification** and **sanctification**. Against both marginalization and sentimentalization, he contends that adoption is not a decorative metaphor but an ontological and covenantal reality given with **union with Christ**. The book’s thesis is succinct: by the **Spirit of adoption** believers are brought into the filial status and privileges of the **incarnate Son**, enjoying participation in his **sonship** without confusion of natures.

The argument unfolds canonically. Garner traces the theme of **sonship** from **Adam** as royal son, through **Israel** as corporate son and the **Davidic** king as filial representative, to the climactic advent of **Jesus Christ**, the **eternal Son** who assumes our nature and accomplishes a filial redemption. On this reading of **historia salutis**, adoption is not an ancillary benefit but the achievement of God’s **pactum salutis** in which the Father wills a family conformed to the **image of the Son**. Crucially, Garner anchors the doctrine in texts like **Ephesians 1.5** and **Romans 8.15–23**, emphasizing both the present reality and the eschatological consummation of adoption, the latter marked by the **redemption of our bodies**. By bringing the *Abba* cry of **Galatians 4.6** into conversation with **pneumatology**, he articulates adoption as a distinctly **Trinitarian** grace: from the **Father**, in the **Son**, by the **Spirit**.

#### 4. Trinitarian and patristic texture: from Irenaeus to Westminster
One of the striking features of Garner’s **adoption** theology is its patristic and classical texture. Engaging **Irenaeus** on recapitulation and **Athanasius** on the Son’s unique divine **filiation**, he insists that believers are **sons by grace** precisely because Christ is **Son by nature**. This distinction of **filiatio naturae** and **filiatio gratiae** guards classical **Christology** while allowing robust participation language in **union with Christ**. The retrieval is disciplined by **Reformed scholastic** categories: the **pactum salutis** as eternal determination of filial glory for a redeemed people, the duplex schema of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, and the precision of **adoptio** as a forensic and relational act. Garner’s debt to **Herman Bavinck** appears in the attention to the **Trinity ad intra** and *ad extra*, while the imprint of **John Murray** and **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** shows in the unification of **forensic** and **transformative** soteriology under **union with Christ**.

This retrieval also corrects distortions. By grounding adoption in **Christ’s person** rather than in a generalized notion of divine fatherhood, Garner disputes **modern universalism** and **liberal paternity** conceptions. Election unto sonship in **Ephesians 1** defines the church as God’s adoptive family, not humanity in general. At the same time, he refuses to collapse adoption into **justification**, arguing that while the **forensic** dimension is irreducible, adoption’s **filial** content exceeds courtroom imagery and summons believers into household intimacy and inheritance. Thus a **both-and** emerges: adoption is juridically enacted and covenantally familial, always in and with **union with Christ**.

#### 5. Adoption, justification, sanctification, and the ecclesial economy
In Garner’s soteriological construction, **union with Christ** is the fountainhead of every **benefit of redemption**. Within this headwater, **justification** constitutes the definitive verdict and **adoption** the definitive status and relationship; **sanctification** and **perseverance** are the Spirit’s ongoing filial formation of the family of God. This coordination resists competitive sequencing in the **ordo salutis** while affirming a material ordering: **effectual calling** unto faith unites to Christ, and in that union God declares the ungodly righteous and at once installs them as sons. The Spirit’s witness in **Romans 8** is therefore both justificatory assurance and filial assurance. Garner’s exegesis stresses the eschatological vector: adoption’s fullness awaits **resurrection**, rendering Christian hope irreducibly **filial eschatology**.

Ecclesially, the household of God becomes the theater of **adoption**. Baptism and the Supper, as means of grace, serve not merely individual piety but family identity: baptism signifies incorporation into Christ’s body as sons and daughters, the Supper nourishes family communion at the Father’s table. Garner’s account thus threads **ecclesiology** into **soteriology**, and extends to **mission**: the gospel summons the nations to the household of the **Father** through union with the **Son** by the **Spirit**. This missionary extension gives dogmatic ballast to the church’s global vocation without relaxing commitment to **confessional** and **Trinitarian** clarity.

#### 6. Interlocutors: Paul, Packer, Wright, and exegetical refinement
Garner’s exposition of **adoption** engages Scripture with awareness of exegetical and theological interlocutors. With **J. I. Packer**, he extols adoption’s pastoral sweetness; with **Trevor J. Burke** and other Pauline scholars, he attends to the Greco-Roman legal background of *huiothesia*, yet he resists reducing the doctrine to ancient legal convention by embedding it in **covenantal** and **Trinitarian** frames. In critical dialogue with **N. T. Wright** and the **New Perspective**, Garner affirms the corporate dimension of **justification** and **adoption**, yet he insists on the irreducible **forensic** core as God’s judicial act, not simply a badge of membership. He likewise pushes back against tendencies to construe **union with Christ** as a mere metaphor for communal solidarity, arguing instead for a Spirit-wrought existential and federal union that grounds every spiritual blessing, including **adoption**.

Theologically, Garner seeks to coordinate the variegated accents of **Reformed** teachers. From **Calvin** he appropriates **filiatio** as the apex of grace and the pastoral accent on God as **pater benignus**. From **Murray**, he inherits the insistence on **definitive sanctification** and on the indivisibility of salvation, even as he differentiates **adoption** from both **justification** and **sanctification**. From **Gaffin**, he receives the **eschatological** shape of salvation and the centrality of the **resurrection** of Christ as the life-giving center of filial glory. The result is an integrated dogmatics in which **adoption** is neither an afterthought nor a rival to other doctrines, but a clarifying lens through which the whole of **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** may be seen.

#### 7. Mission, translation, and the stakes of divine filiation
Garner’s dogmatic concentration on **adoption** naturally overflows into **mission**, particularly in disputes about **Insider Movements** and the translation of **divine familial terms** in Islamic contexts. As a **PCA** teaching elder and theological leader, he contributed to the denomination’s **Ad Interim Study Committee on Insider Movements** reporting to the **General Assembly** in the early 2010s. The committee’s work, which he helped shape, argued that rendering **Father**, **Son**, and **Son of God** in non-familial terms in order to mitigate Muslim offense does violence to **revelation** and obscures **Christology** and **Trinitarian** identity. For Garner, translation is never merely lexical; it is dogmatic and covenantal, because faith comes by hearing the Word the **Father** actually speaks concerning his **Son**. The adoption of believers into God’s family depends upon, and therefore must confess, the eternal **filiation** of the incarnate Son.

This missional stance also critiques **syncretism** and the sociological reduction of conversion implicit in some **Insider Movement** methodologies. Garner’s framework maintains that the **church** as God’s household is the proper locus of Christian identity, and that conversion entails visible transfer of covenantal allegiance. Theologically, adoption cannot be abstracted from **ecclesiology** without losing its covenantal substance. Strategically, Garner commends culturally sensitive mission under the non-negotiable lordship of **Christ** and the irreformable **Trinitarian** grammar of the gospel.

#### 8. Ecclesial service, editorial leadership, and teaching within the Westminster tradition
Alongside his publications, Garner’s influence stems from ecclesial and academic service. At **Westminster Theological Seminary**, he has taught **systematic theology** in the **Vos–Murray–Gaffin** lineage, forming ministers who grasp **union with Christ**, **adoption**, and **biblical inerrancy** as mutually implicating truths. His leadership with the **Westminster Theological Journal** in the 2010s curated scholarship consonant with **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**, while remaining engaged with contemporary discussions in **Pauline studies**, **hermeneutics**, and **missiology**. In the **PCA**, his committee work on **Insider Movements** and ongoing pastoral-theological teaching demonstrate a sustained commitment to the church’s health under the rule of **Scripture**.

Garner’s pedagogy reflects a consistent method: **self-attesting Scripture** governs theological reason; **covenant** supplies the economy within which doctrines coinhere; **Trinity** is not a prolegomenal addendum but the living source and end of dogmatics; and **union with Christ** binds the benefits of redemption in their ordered unity. His students and readers meet not a fragmented set of topics but a single economy of grace whose climactic gift is **adoption** by the **Spirit** into the Son’s filial communion with the **Father**. In a time of methodological eclecticism and ecclesial fragmentation, this integrated account of **dogmatics**, **exegesis**, and **mission** is the signature of Garner’s contribution.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From within **classical Reformed orthodoxy**, Garner’s work offers notable strengths and invites precise questions. Strengths include the **Trinitarian** thickening of **adoption**, the canonical and **redemptive-historical** rooting of **sonship**, the integration of **bibliology** with **covenantal epistemology**, and the principled missional defense of **divine familial terms**. His insistence that **adoption** is a constitutive benefit of **union with Christ** corrects neglect and adds pastoral power, especially in the church’s identity and hope. Questions arise at points of ordering and emphasis. Some will worry that elevating **adoption** as an integrative lens risks blurring the dogmatic primacy of **justification** as the article by which the church stands or falls, or that the familial idiom might obscure the legal and federal dimensions dear to **Turretin** and **Hodge**. Garner himself guards the **forensic** character of adoption and coordinates it with **justification**, but vigilance is warranted lest homiletical warmth displace dogmatic structure. On **bibliology**, his robust **self-attestation** posture tracks closely with **Van Til** and **Warfield**, though one might query whether the appeal to communicative action idioms, when employed, requires firmer delimitation to avoid importing extraneous **speech-act** frameworks that could relativize the text’s determinate authority. Finally, in mission, his critique of **Insider Movements** is compelling in principle; the pastoral task will be to pair this with patient catechesis so that confessional **Trinitarian** speech becomes intelligible across cultures. In sum, judged by **WTS** and wider **Reformed** standards, Garner’s contribution is a constructive retrieval: **adoption** is raised from footnote to focal point without abandoning the **confessional** architecture of **union with Christ**, **justification**, and **sanctification**, and **Scripture** is treated as the living voice of the **triune God** for the church and the world.
