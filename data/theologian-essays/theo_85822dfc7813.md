### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul F. M. Zahl is a contemporary **Anglican theologian** forged within the late modern crucible of the **Episcopal Church USA**, where disputes over **authority, morality, and doctrine** pressed ministers toward the ground of lived pastoral judgment. Serving in parish ministry in the 1970s and 1980s, then as dean of the **Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham** in the mid to late 1990s, and later as dean and president at **Trinity School for Ministry** in the mid 2000s, he developed a resolutely **kerygmatic theology** that privileges **proclamation** over speculation. His setting included the post-1960s unraveling of old Protestant establishments, the rise of **therapeutic culture**, and the late twentieth-century **evangelical retrieval** of **Reformation soteriology**. He understood the pastoral field to be defined by despair, addiction, failed intimacy, and death anxiety, and in that setting he put **Luther's law and gospel** to work as a hermeneutic for Scripture and a medicine for the soul.

Zahl's method is unapologetically **pastoral-existential**, yet insistently doctrinal. He treats preaching as the locus of **divine action** where **law** exposes the self *coram Deo* and **gospel** delivers Christ *extra nos*. His writing fuses **Augustinian anthropology** with **Lutheran forensic justification**, animated by a determined refusal to make **sanctification** precede or displace **absolution**. He does not eschew critical scholarship, but he subordinates **historical-critical insights** to the **kerygma** of **Christ crucified and risen**, arguing that theology must be tested by its impact on the **enslaved conscience**. This approach yields a working epistemology in which truth shows itself as **consolation of the terrified** and **release of the bound**, a wager that echoes **Luther's Anfechtung**, **Cranmer's penitential liturgy**, and modern **AA realism** about human bondage.

He is at home with **Augustine's concupiscence**, **Luther's simul iustus et peccator**, **Barth's Christocentric correction** of natural theologies, and the **Book of Common Prayer's** penitential grammar. Interlocutors like **Fleming Rutledge** supply homiletical allies in the recovery of **substitutionary atonement** as good news rather than a theory, and the **psychodynamic tradition** offers corollaries for the doctrine of sin as repetition compulsion. His milieu includes the founding of the **Mockingbird** network, associated with his family, as a platform for **one-way love**, but his textual spine remains classic **Reformation dogmatics** refracted through pastoral crises of modern people.

#### 2. Major works and programmatic theses
Zahl's early monograph **Who Will Deliver Us? The Present Power of the Death of Christ** in 1991 set his thesis in bold relief. He contends that **Christ's cross** is not merely a past event or legal transaction but a present, operative **deliverance** that addresses compulsions and guilt in the now. He argues for **substitutionary atonement** without scholastic apparatus, pressing that the **death of Christ** is a power that severs the accusatory hold of **the law** as an existential force. The accent falls on **imputation** that clothes the sinner with an alien righteousness, which in pastoral effect generates the first real possibility of change. This is **Lutheran monergism** transported into the therapist's office and the confessional.

In **A Short Systematic Theology** in 2000 he gives a compact dogmatics ordered by **law and gospel** rather than by a scholastic or narrative sequence. **God**, **creation**, **sin**, **Christ**, **salvation**, **church**, and **last things** are treated in a kerygmatic manner, where the criterion is the **deliverance of the conscience** rather than encyclopedic coverage. He resists metaphysical extension of doctrines like **divine simplicity** and refrains from speculative **trinitarian taxis** beyond what the gospel requires for proclamation. His **Christology** is robustly **Chalcedonian** yet narratively driven by **crucifixion and resurrection**, and his **soteriology** foregrounds **justification by faith alone**, **assurance**, and **pastoral absolution** as the lifeblood of Christian existence.

With **Five Women of the English Reformation** in 2001 he executes a retrieval of **English Reformation piety** through the lives of **Anne Askew**, **Catherine Willoughby**, **Anne Boleyn**, **Catherine Parr**, and **Jane Grey**. This historical work is also dogmatic through narrative, exhibiting **Cranmerian** evangelicalism and the costliness of **sola fide**. In **The First Christian** in 2003 he presses the **universality of Jesus teaching**, arguing that the **kerygma** of **grace for sinners** is translatable across cultures because it answers what is universally wrong in us. The texts explore **Jesus radical mercy**, thereby reinforcing **unconditional grace** against recurrent moralism.

His capstone **Grace in Practice: A Theology of Everyday Life** in 2007 extends a single concept, **one-way love** or **grace**, into the quotidian spheres of **family**, **friendship**, **work**, **law and politics**, **religion**, and **self**. The book functions as a practical dogmatics of **grace**, construing each sphere as pervasively invaded by **law** as demand and therefore set free only by **gospel** as gift. Zahl argues that **only absolution produces transformation**, that **love precedes loveliness**, and that efforts to use **law** as a sanctifying instrument backfire into either **despair** or **pride**. The leitmotif is the rhythm of **death and resurrection** as an operative pattern in human relations, in which **forgiveness** is the only creative act that generates newness.

Finally, **PZ's Panopticon** in 2011 canvasses **world religions** from the vantage of human need and **one-way love**. Zahl appreciates religious brilliance yet returns to **Christ crucified** as uniquely addressing **guilt**, **shame**, and **fear of death**. The comparative stance is unembarrassedly confessional, interpreting the religions by the yardstick of **law and gospel**. He reiterates **low anthropology** vis-a-vis moralization within religions, arguing that without **alien righteousness** religions cannot deliver what they demand. The whole corpus reads like a commentary on **Romans 7 and 8**, with **gospel** as God doing for us what we cannot do for ourselves.

#### 3. Doctrinal loci: anthropology, atonement, justification, sanctification
Under anthropology, Zahl advances a stark **low anthropology** that trades in **Augustinian concupiscence** and **Luther's bondage of the will**. Human beings are not basically well or morally improvable by degrees but are addicts to self-justification and control. The psychological corroboration comes from **AA's first step**, the insight that the will is not the solution but the problem. This leads to a pervasive deployment of **law** as demand, measuring rod, and accusation, not only in Torah or divine commands but in relational expectations, success metrics, and internalized ideals. The consequence is the ubiquity of **shame**, **fear**, and **denial**, with the gospel as the only word that can silence the inner prosecuting attorney. Zahl's anthropological axiom is **the sinner is loved and declared righteous while still a sinner**, the **simul iustus et peccator** that undergirds everything else.

In atonement, he is adamant about **substitution**. **Who Will Deliver Us?** already signaled this, and **Grace in Practice** reiterates that only **a death for me** breaks the dominion of **law** as curse. He resists **moral exemplar** theories because they add law to law, and he recasts **penal substitution** not as a mechanistic bookkeeping but as the heart of **divine love** that bears away the curse. This is a pastoral construal of **2 Corinthians 5.21** and **Romans 3.21-26**, framed as liberation rather than speculation. He engages modern objections to **divine violence** by insisting that only a **God who bears wrath** can be trusted to forgive enemies and to end the cycle of retaliation in human hearts. The cross is the end of **sacrifice as project** and the opening of **forgiveness as gift**.

Justification sits at the center. Zahl deploys a consistently **forensic justification** with **imputation rather than infusion** as the doctrinal lynchpin. **Assurance** follows inevitably, since justification rests on **Christ extra nos**, the righteousness of another. The corresponding hermeneutic is that any teaching that conditions acceptance on transformation reintroduces **law** into the **gospel** and undermines assurance. He expounds the **sola fide** by way of pastoral absolution, arguing that the only truly transformative force is being told in the present tense what God has done and says about you in Christ. This gives rise to his credo that **absolution precedes transformation**, a reordering of **ordo salutis** that makes **sanctification** the fruit and not the root, the consequence and not the condition.

On sanctification, Zahl is suspicious of the **third use of the law** construed as a guide for the regenerate. In his view the psychology of law remains accusatory and, given **low anthropology**, cannot become a benign tutor. He prefers to speak of **sanctification by surprise**, a transformation that occurs under the pressure of **one-way love**, where the experience of being forgiven creates concrete changes in desire and practice. He aligns this with **union by faith** yet rarely foregrounds **mystical union** or **participation** language. The net effect is a pastoral monergism where God alone acts to sanctify by justifying, where human effort untethered from absolution is spiritually deadly. He is sympathetic to **Barth's** concern to protect grace from synergism, but he operationalizes it in parish life through preaching and counseling aimed at **relief from law**.

#### 4. Scripture, church, sacraments, and public life
Zahl reads **Scripture** through law and gospel, following a **Lutheran hermeneutic** that regards the distinguishing function of texts as determinative for preaching. The point is not to deny **inspiration** or the reality of **history**, but to insist that the Bible is finally the **voice of Christ absolving sinners**. He welcomes the descriptive work of **critical scholarship** so far as it illuminates the path of proclamation, yet he resists allowing the academy to set the agenda. This generates a pragmatic **canon within the canon** that privileges **Romans**, **Galatians**, and **Luke-Acts**, while reading the Old Testament as a complex field where **law** and **promise** are in theological combat, a move in line with **Luther's** own practice.

In ecclesiology, Zahl is a **Prayer Book evangelical**. He reveres **Thomas Cranmer's liturgy** for its penitential logic and clear absolutions. Yet he tends to de-institutionalize **church** in favor of preaching as event, the moment when **Christ encounters the sinner**. His accounts of **baptism** and **Eucharist** honor their pastoral efficacy but avoid claims of automatic sanctifying effects. He worries that **sacramentalism** can become yet another technology of **law**, turning the means of grace into instruments of spiritual control. The church is authentic, on his view, when **confession and absolution**, **preached cross**, and **forgiveness in practice** orchestrate a community of relief and joy. He loves **Anglican history** as seen in **Five Women of the English Reformation**, yet the ruling interest is not identity but gospel.

Zahl extends his theology into public and domestic spheres in **Grace in Practice**, where **one-way love** is applied to **marriage**, **parenting**, **friendship**, **work**, and **politics**. He critiques **law-based parenting** that breeds rebellion or despair and proposes **forgiveness-forward families**. In the workplace he exposes the hidden **law** of metrics and achievement and calls for a culture of **grace** that resists totalizing identities. In politics he is allergic to **eschatologized activism** that turns the nation into a theater of righteousness. He argues instead for modesty, mercy, and a suspicion that **law** cannot deliver the goods it promises in public life. This is not quietism but a chastened **Augustinian realism** that refuses to preach **civic law** as gospel.

Interlocutors remain central. **Augustine** supplies a grammar of the heart, **Luther** lends the law-gospel engine, **Cranmer** gives liturgical embodiment, and **Barth** sanctions Christocentric unconditionality. He appreciates **Fleming Rutledge's** homiletical defense of the **crucifixion** as public truth, and he borrows from **psychodynamic theory** an account of the self's compulsions and defenses. While he engages with the **New Perspective on Paul** obliquely, his emphasis on **forensic justification** and **assurance** puts him at odds with readings that dilute **imputation**. His mordant critiques of **moralism** in liberal, Catholic, and evangelical registers reveal a constant polemical target: any system that smuggles **law** into **gospel**.

The theological style is anecdotal and aphoristic, yet the substance coheres. From **Who Will Deliver Us?** to **Grace in Practice**, Zahl pursues one idea: that **God's one-way love** disclosed in the **substitutionary cross** and delivered in **absolving proclamation** is the only power that changes human beings. He aims to heal people seized by **Romans 7** despair with the fresh air of **Romans 8** sonship. The media include sermons, essays, lectures, and later **Mockingbird** podcasts, but the touchstone remains the ministerial act of announcing **Christ for you**. Where some seek transformation by intensifying disciplines or doubling down on resolve, Zahl insists on a simple order: **absolution first**, and then watch what happens.

In sum, Zahl's contribution is to reassert with fresh ordinary-language vividness the classic **Reformation trilogy** of **sin, cross, and justification** as the living center of Anglican theology. The term **one-way love** gives a contemporary idiom to **sola gratia**, rendering the gospel audible to people shaped by **therapeutic culture** and **achievement idolatry**. The result is a theology that is remarkably accessible without ceasing to be theological, that is unapologetically bold about **substitutionary atonement** without rancor, and that is oriented toward the concrete wounds that parish ministers confront daily. His pages are a sustained attempt to make **Christ's absolution** sound like what it is, the best news the world has ever heard.

From a Reformed and WTS vantage, Zahl is a welcomed ally on **total depravity**, **forensic justification**, **penal substitution**, and **assurance**, yet questions remain on **law's third use**, **covenantal union**, **Scripture's authority**, and **means of grace**. His construal of **law** as only accusatory risks eclipsing the **normative third use** as a thankful guide flowing from **union with Christ**. His emphasis on **absolution** can appear to compress **sanctification** into the psychology of relief, underplaying **mortification and vivification** by the Spirit and the covenantal pattern of **indicative and imperative**. His ecclesial minimalism can thin out **Word and sacrament** as ordinary means that the **Westminster Standards** identify as instrumental for growth in grace. His kerygmatic use of **Scripture** rightly centers **Christ for us**, yet Reformed theology would press for a thicker **redemptive-historical** and **covenantal** architecture in which **union with Christ** frames justification and sanctification together, with the **Decalogue** as rule of life. The constructive alternative is not moralism but a Reformed synthesis where **free justification** and **transformative union** coinhere, where the **third use of the law** functions as grateful guidance empowered by the Spirit, and where **preaching and sacraments** together administer **Christ and his benefits** in the covenant community.
