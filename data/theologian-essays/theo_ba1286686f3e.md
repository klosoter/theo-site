### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation in a redemptive-historical tradition
Sidney Greidanus emerged from the **Dutch Reformed** world whose mid-twentieth-century homiletical battles forged the modern **redemptive-historical** method. A child of the Netherlands who emigrated to Canada, he ministered and taught in the **Christian Reformed Church** and eventually became professor of preaching at **Calvin Theological Seminary**, where the legacy of **John Calvin** and the Reformed confessions gave his work a distinctly ecclesial orientation. The intellectual climate he inherited was split between the **historical-critical** dissection of Scripture and a more **pragmatic evangelical** homiletics that defaulted to moral exhortation. Against this background Greidanus sought to show that the church can preach the ancient **Old Testament** as Christian Scripture without falling into **allegory** or **exemplaristic moralism**, crafting a disciplined path from text to pulpit grounded in **Sola Scriptura** and the unity of **redemptive history**.

Greidanus was deeply shaped by the Dutch **redemptive-historical** preachers **Klaas Schilder** and **Benne Holwerda**, as well as the biblical-theological synthesis of **Geerhardus Vos**. Through Vos he learned to see Scripture as the unfolding of the **Historia salutis**, culminating in Christ and interpreted by the **New Testament**. Through Schilder and Holwerda he learned to resist a fragmented, episodic **moralizing** that treated Old Testament figures as timeless heroes rather than actors within the covenantal drama. At the same time, he engaged the insights of **Brevard Childs** on **canonical context** and the practicality of **expository preaching** in North American seminaries. His enduring thesis grew from the crucible of these influences: preach every text as part of the **one canon**, focusing first on the text’s own **authorial intent** and function, then moving within the canon to its relation to **Christ** and the **gospel**.

#### 2. Method: theocentric reading ordered to Christ
Greidanus’s hallmark is a staged hermeneutic that is resolutely **theocentric** and rigorously **Christocentric** without being **christomonistic**. In **Preaching Christ from the Old Testament** 1999 he insists that the preacher must begin with the **grammatical-historical** meaning of the text, establishing its **genre**, structure, and intention, and clarifying its **theocentric** thrust as revelation of the covenant God. Only then should the preacher move to the text’s **Christological** fulfillment. This double move protects both the integrity of the human author’s meaning and the unity of the **divine author’s** canonical design. He rejects a free **sensus plenior** that detaches later meaning from original sense, yet he affirms a canonical deepening in light of the **apostolic witness**, arguing that the **New Testament** functions as interpretive apex within the **analogia fidei**.

To discipline the movement from the **Old Testament** to **Christ**, Greidanus proposes seven controlled strategies. He names these as **redemptive-historical progression**, **promise-fulfillment**, **typology**, **analogy**, **longitudinal themes**, **New Testament references**, and **contrast**. The first four recapitulate the classic **covenant-history** routes while the latter three secure the sermon in explicit **canonical** and **apostolic** moorings. By insisting that the text’s **function** and **theme** be clarified before any Christological move, he avoids mere **proof-texting** and **allegorizing**, and by offering plural routes he resists a single formula while still securing a **Christ-centered** outcome.

#### 3. The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text: integrating exegesis and homiletics
In **The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text** 1988 Greidanus developed a full ordo from **exegesis** to **exposition**. Against a common divide between academic exegesis and pastoral preaching, he treats hermeneutics and homiletics as a single practical discipline. His method begins with determining **genre** and rhetorical form, whether **narrative**, **law**, **prophecy**, **wisdom**, **psalm**, or **apocalyptic**, then identifying the **textual theme** and **goal**, and finally crafting an expository structure that reflects the text’s own movement. The book is a sustained argument for letting **biblical literature** govern sermon form. Where **form criticism** atomized texts and ended in skepticism, Greidanus redeploys attention to form for **canonical** reading and applied proclamation.

A driving contrast in this work is **theocentric** versus **anthropocentric** preaching. The former preaches God’s acts and character in the **covenant**, while the latter reduces Scripture to timeless moral lessons. Greidanus holds that authentic **application** must flow from the text’s **redemptive-historical** function rather than imposed **exemplarism**. In this respect he stands close to **Edmund Clowney** and the **Vosian** tradition, yet his distinctive contribution is the careful mapping of literary form to homiletical strategy. He teaches preachers to honor **authorial intent** without losing the **evangel** as the sermonic telos.

#### 4. Christ from the Old Testament: seven pathways within one canon
The short formula most associated with Greidanus is his catalog of seven ways from text to **Christ**, elaborated in **Preaching Christ from the Old Testament** 1999. **Redemptive-historical progression** situates the text within the advancing covenant story that culminates in the **incarnation**, **cross**, and **resurrection**. **Promise-fulfillment** traces explicit promissory lines as the **Abrahamic**, **Davidic**, or **new covenant** promises are realized in **Jesus the Messiah**. **Typology** identifies persons, events, or institutions such as **Adam**, **Exodus**, **tabernacle**, **sacrifice**, **king**, or **prophet** as divinely intended patterns recapitulated in Christ. **Analogy** permits ethical and pastoral parallels grounded in shared covenant realities without collapsing type and antitype. **Longitudinal themes** follow motifs like **kingdom**, **wisdom**, **priesthood**, or **mission** across Scripture’s span. **New Testament references** make explicit use of apostolic interpretation, and **contrast** highlights the surpassing character of the **new covenant** relative to the **old**.

Central to the strategy is the distinction between **typology** and **allegory**. Typology is historically rooted and covenantally warranted, whereas allegory bypasses history and invents **spiritual** meanings. Greidanus couples typology with **authorial intent** and the **analogia fidei**, treating the **apostolic** use of the Old Testament as normative. He insists that while every sermon should lead to **Christ**, not every text does so in the same way. This disciplined plurality is a hallmark of his **canonical** hermeneutic and a safeguard for **expository preaching**.

#### 5. Genre-specific applications: Genesis, Ecclesiastes, Daniel, Esther, Psalms
Greidanus’s later volumes demonstrate his method across diverse genres. In **Preaching Christ from Genesis** 2007 he develops **narrative** strategies for patriarchal stories, resisting **exemplaristic** heroism while tracing **covenant** expansion from **Abraham** through **Joseph**. He shows, for example, how the **Joseph** narrative can be preached through **providence** and **promise-fulfillment** culminating in **Christ’s** saving lordship. In **Preaching Christ from Ecclesiastes** 2010 he treats **wisdom literature**, emphasizing **vanity** and the quest for meaning as a **longitudinal theme** fulfilled in **Christ as wisdom** and **resurrection life**. The tone remains **theocentric**, with human striving relativized by divine sovereignty.

With **Preaching Christ from Daniel** 2012, Greidanus engages **apocalyptic** and **court narrative**. He argues that the **Son of Man** vision provides a direct **messianic** line, while the fiery furnace or lion’s den are not mere **moral lessons** in courage but windows into the **kingdom of God** amidst empire, finding resolution in **Christ’s** suffering and enthronement. In **Preaching Christ from Esther** 2015 he treats a book without explicit divine reference by highlighting **providence**, **reversal**, and **deliverance**, moving via **redemptive-historical progression** and **contrast** to the cross where hiddenness gives way to revelation. Finally, **Preaching Christ from Psalms** 2016 attends to **poetic** form, **lament**, and **praise**, expounding **Davidic** kingship and **righteous sufferer** motifs as **typology** of **Christ’s** prayer and praise for the church.

Across these volumes, Greidanus supplies sample sermon structures, exegetical notes, and routes to **Christ** that reinforce his central claim that the **Old Testament** is Christian Scripture. His method refuses both **flattening** the canon into proof-texts and divorcing **application** from **gospel** proclamation.

#### 6. Doctrinal underpinnings: Scripture, canon, and covenantal unity
Beneath Greidanus’s homiletics lie commitments about **Scripture** and **revelation**. He affirms the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture under **Sola Scriptura**, seeking the **single meaning** of the text in its historical horizon while acknowledging a canonical surplus realized within **apostolic** usage. He does not trade on a free-floating **sensus plenior** but defends a confessional reading ordered by the **canon**, with the **New Testament** as interpretive capstone. The doctrine of **covenant** anchors the unity of **redemptive history**, and the **Triune God** is the ultimate subject of the text, which is why his hermeneutic is **theocentric** before it is explicitly **Christocentric**.

Closely related is his alignment with the **Vosian** distinction between **Historia salutis** and **Ordo salutis**. Preaching should prioritize the accomplishment of redemption in history before drawing out the benefits of redemption applied. This guards against **moralism** and anthropocentricism and gives doctrinal depth to **application**. Consequently, when he uses **analogy** or draws **ethics** from the text, he does so in union with **Christ** and within the **covenant** frame, not by extracting portable virtues from Old Testament saints.

#### 7. Dialogue partners and contrasts: Childs, Clowney, Chapell, and criticism of moralism
Greidanus stands in fruitful dialogue with several twentieth-century figures. From **Brevard Childs** he appropriates **canonical** sensibility without adopting critical skepticism. From **Edmund Clowney** he shares a **Christ-centered** homiletic grounded in **biblical theology**, though Greidanus develops a more detailed taxonomy of routes from text to **Christ**. With **Graeme Goldsworthy** he resonates in kingdom-centered **biblical theology**, yet Greidanus’s homiletic is more exegetically controlled by **genre**. In conversation with **Bryan Chapell**, whose **Christ-centered preaching** employs a **fallen condition focus**, Greidanus appreciates the gospel telos but cautions against any method that might obscure the text’s own **redemptive-historical** function. The shared goal is proclaiming **grace**, the divergence is where one begins and what constrains the pathway.

His sustained critique of **exemplaristic moralism** lands particularly on the popular evangelical practice of preaching **David** as courage or **Daniel** as resolve. For Greidanus such sermons mislocate agency and ignore **covenant** context. His alternative is to preach **God’s acts** and promises in Christ and then draw out **analogy** for the church’s life. At the same time, he maintains that **imperatives** rightly arise from the **indicatives** of redemption and that **sanctification** is not sidelined but grounded in **union with Christ**.

#### 8. Pedagogy, ecclesial embedding, and influence
As a long-time teacher in the **Christian Reformed** orbit, Greidanus shaped a generation of pastors to hold together **exegesis** and **proclamation**. His courses and books modeled how to move from detailed textual work to **expository** sermons in the life of the church. The pastoral setting of his work kept him attentive to **clarity**, **structure**, and **application**, even as he pursued a rigorous **canonical** method. His practical volumes are filled with outlines and case studies, reflecting a teacher’s concern to hand on a craft grounded in **biblical theology**.

Greidanus’s influence extends beyond the CRC to **Presbyterian**, **Baptist**, and broader **evangelical** contexts committed to **Christ-centered** preaching. Seminaries influenced by **Vos** and **Clowney**, including **Westminster Theological Seminary**, have employed his works as companions to courses in homiletics and **biblical theology**. His model has also contributed to the ongoing discussion of **christocentric** versus **christotelic** hermeneutics, with Greidanus representing a robustly **christocentric** approach that appeals to **authorial intent** and **apostolic** precedence rather than postulating a later-added telos without organic textual warrant.

#### 9. Legacy and a Reformed WTS evaluation
Sidney Greidanus’s legacy is the demonstration that disciplined **exegesis**, attentiveness to **genre**, and a full-orbed **redemptive-historical** imagination can yield sermons that are both **theocentric** and richly **Christocentric**. He gave pastors a set of tested **paths** from any **Old Testament** text to **Christ**, without collapsing into **allegory** or truncating the gospel to ethics. His insistence on **authorial intent**, **canonical context**, and the **New Testament’s** interpretive authority has provided a durable standard in an age of **reader-response** and **therapeutic** pulpiteering. For the Reformed tradition, he has secured the homiletical entailments of **Sola Scriptura** and the unity of the **covenant**.

From a unified **Reformed** and **WTS** evaluation, the strengths are manifest. Greidanus’s **Vosian** commitments to **Historia salutis**, his clear defense of **typology** over **allegory**, and his pastoral refusal of **exemplarism** accord with the **Westminster Standards** and the classic Reformed insistence that both **law** and **gospel** be preached within the economy of grace. Two cautions follow. First, his seven ways can be treated as **technique** rather than as disciplined wisdom, which risks proceduralism and the temptation to force a **Christ-connection** that the text’s own function would not suggest. A WTS corrective would be to subordinate method more explicitly to **covenantal** structures and **Trinitarian** economy, reinforcing a movement that is not merely **christocentric** but fully **Trinitarian** and ecclesial. Second, his polemic against **moralism** can make some readers hesitant to press **imperatives** with the vigor modeled by **Calvin** and the **Puritans**. A Reformed alternative is to let **union with Christ** govern a robust ethic where the **Spirit** applies **law** as rule of gratitude within the **new covenant**, preserving the grace-imperative dynamic. Within these bounds, Greidanus’s project stands as a major contemporary instance of classical Reformed preaching, attuned to **biblical theology**, shaped by **canon**, and ordered to proclaim **Christ** from all the Scriptures.
