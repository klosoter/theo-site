### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the wager of ressourcement
Hans Boersma, born in 1961 and raised within a Dutch **Reformed confessional** milieu, matured theologically within the late twentieth-century crisis of **disenchantment** and the fragmentation of evangelical identity. His North American career at **Trinity Western University** and **Regent College** in Vancouver, followed by appointment in 2019 to **Nashotah House** as a professor of ascetical theology, marks a pilgrimage from conservative **evangelicalism** toward a robustly catholic retrieval. The abiding thesis of Boersma’s project is that only a recovered **sacramental ontology** can counter the twin reductionisms of modern **nominalism** and **historicist biblicism**. The need is not antiquarianism but **ressourcement**, a return to the sources as embodied in **Aquinas**, **Augustine**, and the **Greek Fathers**, guided by twentieth-century mediators such as **Henri de Lubac** and **Hans Urs von Balthasar**. Against the background of **secular modernity**, he argues that a participatory metaphysics re-enchants Christian doctrine and practice by rejoining creation to God through **participatio**, **anagogy**, and liturgical **real presence**.

#### 2. Method: sacramental ontology, participation, and analogical excess
Boersma’s methodological center is **sacramental ontology**, the claim that created realities are not inert facts but symbolic participations that render God present as both **sign** and **res**. He uses the patristic grammar of *anagogy* to describe movement from visible to invisible, and he retrieves **analogia entis** as the metaphysical condition for creatures to truly yet analogically participate in God. The stress on **participatio** engages **Thomas Aquinas** while also receiving **de Lubac’s** controversial thesis about the **natural desire for the supernatural**. For Boersma, the modern fracture between **nature and grace** is a misbegotten extrinsicism: a denial that created nature is ordered to **beatific communion**. He pushes beyond a narrowly **forensic** construal of salvation toward **deification** without rejecting **atonement** or **justification**. Methodologically he integrates **theological interpretation of Scripture**, arguing that **figural exegesis** is the scriptural correlate of sacramental ontology. The method resists **Barthian** suspicion of natural theology, yet it hews close to **classical theism** through commitments to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **providence** rendered sacramentally.

#### 3. Learning from nouvelle theologie: de Lubac, Balthasar, and ressourcement
Boersma’s **Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology** of 2009 is a historical and constructive defense of **de Lubac** and the ressourcement agenda. He contends that a post-Tridentine **neo-scholastic** separation of **nature and grace** generated a purely extrinsic account of salvation while inadvertently feeding modern **secularization** by granting nature autonomy. Against this, he argues with **de Lubac** that grace is not an add-on but the fulfillment of nature’s God-ordered telos, the **vision of God**. He mobilizes **Balthasar’s** aesthetic and dramatic theology to underscore the revelatory surplus that draws creatures into **participatory communion**. While appreciative of **Aquinas**, he reads Thomas through ressourcement lenses that favor an integral ordering of nature to grace, rehabilitating **analogia entis** and nuancing older readings of **Duns Scotus** and **Ockham** as catalysts of **nominalism**. In this historiography, Boersma shapes an evangelical catholic posture that rejects both **immanentist secularism** and thin **biblicism**, seeking instead a metaphysically serious account of **sacramentality** that unites theology, spirituality, and exegesis.

#### 4. Atonement, hospitality, and the scandal of divine peace
In **Violence, Hospitality, and the Cross** from 2004, Boersma addresses modern anxieties about **atonement** and violence, responding to thinkers like **Derrida**, **Hauerwas**, **Volf**, and **Girard**. He insists that the **cross** is the hospitable self-giving of God that reconciles enemies through sacrificial **substitution** and transformative **participation**. He refuses both a pacifist disavowal of **penal substitution** and a violent caricature of divine wrath, arguing that sacrificial love operates within the sacramental economy of **satisfaction** and **deification**. The key is not to discard traditional **atonement doctrines** but to locate them inside a **sacramental ontology** where God’s peace is enacted through ecclesial practices of **hospitality** and **Eucharist**. This work anticipates later themes: doctrine and ethics are united because participation in Christ renders the church the site of **real presence** and reconciled **communion**. Boersma thus positions **atonement**, **liturgy**, and **virtue** as a single tapestry, knitting together patristic insight and evangelical proclamation.

#### 5. Heavenly participation and the re-enchantment of the world
With **Heavenly Participation** in 2011, Boersma offered an accessible manifesto for evangelicals. The book argues that modern **disenchantment** stems from the eclipse of **participatory metaphysics** under the pressures of **nominalism**, **empiricism**, and strong **historicism**. He proposes the recovery of **Platonically inflected Christian realism** as a remedy. The world is not closed but open to God’s **presence**, with creatures serving as **sacramental signs** pointing to their heavenly archetypes. Boersma reintroduces the patristic distinction of **sacramentum** and **res**, and the pattern of **exitus-reditus** whereby creation proceeds from and returns to God through Christ’s **incarnation** and **ascension**. This re-enchantment culminates in prioritized **Eucharistic** and **ecclesial** practices where **Christ’s presence** structures Christian knowing. By commending **participation**, **analogia entis**, and **deification**, Boersma seeks to recalibrate evangelical imagination away from reductionist **materialism** toward thick **sacramentality** that validates doctrinal confession and spiritual formation as a single act of knowing-in-worship.

#### 6. Scripture as real presence: figural exegesis and the surplus of the text
In **Scripture as Real Presence** from 2017, Boersma develops a hermeneutic that correlates **figural reading** with **sacramental ontology**. He argues that the **patristic** and **medieval** practices of **allegory**, **typology**, and **anagogy** are not arbitrary but reflect the metaphysical conviction that the **literal sense** is ordered to Christic fulfillment as **res**. The book offers case studies in **Augustine**, **Gregory of Nyssa**, **Chrysostom**, and **Aquinas**, showing how **Christological** and **ecclesial** readings make Scripture a site of **real presence**. Boersma does not abandon **historical-critical** methods but subordinates them to **rule of faith** interpretation within the **church’s canon**. He contends that **sola Scriptura** is best served by a communal, liturgically embedded exegesis governed by **creedal** confession and oriented to **beatific vision**. The conceptual anchor remains **participatio**: texts, like sacraments, signify what they contain and contain what they signify. The hermeneutic fruit is a chastened confidence that God gives himself through **Scripture**, not as bare data but as transformative **presence**.

#### 7. Gregory of Nyssa, virtue, and the beatific vision
Boersma’s **Embodiment and Virtue in Gregory of Nyssa** published in 2013 and **Seeing God** in 2018 extend sacramental ontology into **ascetical theology**. In Gregory he finds an **anagogical ascent** of desire shaped by **virtue**, reading the body as a site of **participatory transformation** through the Spirit. **Epektasis**, the unending progress in God, becomes a leitmotif for Christian existence ordered to **beatific vision**. In **Seeing God**, Boersma reconstructs the **beatific vision** across **patristic**, **medieval**, and **modern** sources, arguing that the Christian telos is contemplative **visio Dei** that begins sacramentally in church and consummates **eschatologically**. He defends the compatibility of **beatific vision** with **incarnational realism**, insisting against modern suspicions that vision neither evacuates bodiliness nor depreciates **creation**. The pattern of **participation** is again central: the **sacramental economy** is ordered to the **beatific end**, and the moral life is an apprenticeship in **deification**. Here Boersma aligns **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Gregory**, articulating a traditioned catholicity meant to tutor broad **evangelical** piety.

#### 8. Ecumenical posture, academic leadership, and sacraments
Beyond monographs, Boersma co-edited with **Matthew Levering** the **Oxford Handbook of Sacramental Theology** in 2015, consolidating the field’s themes across **patristic**, **medieval**, and **modern** strata. His teaching at **Regent College** and later **Nashotah House** situates him at an evangelical-Anglican interface, with the legacy of **J. I. Packer** shaping a serious doctrinal ethos even as Boersma moves toward **Anglo-Catholic** commitments. In **Five Things Theologians Wish Biblical Scholars Knew** from 2021, he presses for **dogmatic** and **ecclesial** guardrails to constrain interpretive autonomy, urging retrieval of **creedal rule**, **liturgical context**, and **canon**. Across essays and lectures, he advances an ecumenical convergence grounded in **classical theism**, **Trinitarian orthodoxy**, and **Eucharistic realism**, while resisting **historicist** and **pragmatist** reductions of theology to culture. His ecumenism is principled, aiming at a patristically rooted **catholicity** that can address evangelical fragmentation by offering a shared **sacramental metaphysics** and common **spiritual practices**.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis: nature, grace, church, and Scripture
Across his corpus, Boersma engineers a synthesis that aligns **nature and grace** by way of **participatory metaphysics**, locates **church and sacraments** as the site of **real presence**, and reconceives **Scripture** as sacramentally charged **figural discourse**. **Atonement**, **virtue**, and **beatific vision** are not discrete loci but inseparable movements of the one **economy**: God draws the world through Christ into deifying **communion**. The metaphysical grammar of **analogia entis** underwrites the possibility of **sacramental signs** that truly communicate their **res**, while the hermeneutical grammar of **anagogy** resists **flattened literalism**. Boersma’s constructive ambition is evangelical in seriousness about **Scripture** and **mission**, and catholic in reliance upon **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and the **Greek Fathers**. His polemical targets are the **nominalist** eclipse of participation and the **historicist** eclipse of figuration. The result is a program for re-enchantment: the world, the text, and the church are knit together by **Christ’s presence** as anticipatory foretaste of the **beatific end**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: participation under covenant and the rule of Scripture
From a classical **Reformed and WTS** vantage, Boersma’s retrieval of **classical theism**, **beatific vision**, and patristic **figural exegesis** offers salutary correctives to thin **biblicism** and functional **nominalism**. Yet significant tensions emerge. First, the ressourcement reading of **nature and grace** that adopts **desiderium naturale visionis Dei** risks softening the **Creator-creature distinction** that Reformed divinity guards through **covenant** and **federal theology**; a nature teleologically ordered to **beatific vision** can be read as compromising the gratuity of **grace**, whereas Reformed dogmatics prefers an extrinsic covenantal ordination grounded in **divine freedom**. Second, the embrace of **analogia entis** sits uneasily with **Van Tilian** commitments to **revelational epistemology**, where all true knowledge is covenanted through **special revelation** and where **natural theology** cannot norm hermeneutics. Third, while Boersma affirms **atonement**, his sacramental and **deification** idiom can obscure the central **forensic** axis of **justification by faith alone**, threatening to displace the **legal-covenantal** with the **ontological-mystical**. Fourth, the robust commendation of **figural exegesis** rightly resists historicism but must be chastened by **sola Scriptura** and the **analogia fidei**, lest ecclesial **tradition** norm the canon. A Reformed alternative would receive Boersma’s **classical theism**, **beatific vision**, and a disciplined **typology**, while re-grounding **participation** under the **covenant of grace**, insisting upon the primacy of **Word and Spirit**, and safeguarding the gratuitousness of salvation through **imputed righteousness** rather than intrinsic **deification**. In this exchange, Boersma is a serious ally for retrieval yet a provocative interlocutor calling Reformed theology to clarify its own metaphysical and hermeneutical first principles.
