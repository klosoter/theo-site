### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the retrieval horizon
Craig A. Carter emerges as a contemporary Canadian theologian whose work is situated at the intersection of **evangelical Protestantism** and a renewed **patristic and scholastic retrieval**. His academic career at Tyndale University places him within a North American discourse in which confessional Protestants face a twofold crisis: the fragmentation of **hermeneutics** under historicism and the evaporation of **classical metaphysics** under modern analytic and personalist revisions of **doctrine of God**. Carter’s self-conscious response is a program of **ressourcement** oriented by the **Great Tradition**, in which classical trinitarian and metaphysical commitments are not optional philosophical add-ons but the intrinsic grammar of **Nicene Christianity**. Insofar as contemporary theological method has wavered between **Barthian actualism** and **analytic theistic personalism**, Carter presses for a return to **Christian Platonism** as the metaphysical idiom undergirding *homoousios* and the **rule of faith**.

This project prioritizes **metaphysical realism** over nominalism, **participation** over univocal predication, and an **analogical** mode of God-talk over voluntarist or historicist reductions. Carter’s wager is straightforward: recover **Nicene metaphysics** and one recovers a normative **theological exegesis** of Scripture; lose **divine simplicity** or **impassibility** and the exegetical tradition that binds patristic, medieval, and Reformation theologians dissolves. He reads the ecclesial past as a coherent **Great Tradition**, centering **Augustine**, **Athanasius**, and **Aquinas**, yet seeking demonstrable points of convergence with **Calvin**, the post-Reformation **orthodox**, and **Bavinck**’s synthesis of **catholicity** and **Reformed distinctives**.

#### 2. Early works and the post-Christendom question
Carter’s early contributions addressed ecclesial public posture and ethics in the wake of cultural disestablishment. In **The Politics of the Cross** (2001) he assessed **John Howard Yoder**, testing Anabaptist social ethics against classical theological commitments to the **Cross** as revelation and reconciliation. In **Rethinking Christ and Culture** (2007), he examined the legacy of **H. Richard Niebuhr** and the permutations of Christian cultural engagement in a **post-Christendom** moment. These works frame Carter’s abiding concern with the church’s intellectual habitus: without **doctrinal catholicity** and **metaphysical clarity**, ecclesial practice defaults to partisan capture. The point is already methodological: theological ethics is downstream from **doctrine of God** and **Scripture**; remove **classical theism** or sever **exegesis** from the **rule of faith**, and the church loses its capacity to witness to the **lordship of Christ** in late modern society.

This early phase signals Carter’s conviction that the crisis of public theology is at root a crisis of **theological ontology**. The retrieval of **participatory metaphysics** is not antiquarian; it is the necessary precondition for a humane and cruciform public witness. Against both secular liberalism and reactionary theopolitics, Carter insists that only a church schooled by **Nicene trinitarianism** and **biblical catholicity** can articulate a distinctive **politics of the Cross**.

#### 3. Interpreting Scripture with the Great Tradition
The pivotal methodological text is **Interpreting Scripture with the Great Tradition** (2018), in which Carter argues that modern hermeneutics constrained by **historicism** have bracketed or displaced **theological exegesis**. He champions a robust **rule of faith** as a canonical horizon that governs reading, contending that the *regula fidei* is not an extrinsic imposition but the Spirit-given summary of **Scripture’s unity**. Carter commends **figural reading**, including typology and spiritual sense, yet he locates these within a disciplined account of the **literal sense** as the sense intended by the divine author who providentially orders history. The upshot is that the **literal sense** can be richly Christological in line with **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Calvin** without collapsing into arbitrary allegory.

Carter’s hermeneutics resist the dichotomy of **grammatical-historical** versus **theological** readings by insisting that the divine author’s **providence** grounds the unity of **theologia** and **oikonomia**. The same God who is **simple**, **immutable**, and **impassible** acts *ad extra* in ways consistent with who he is *ad intra*; hence **inseparable operations** secure the Christological telos of the canon. Against **Barthian** construals that detach theology from **metaphysical realism**, and against **postliberal** attempts to reduce Scripture to intratextual grammar, Carter retrieves **participation** and **analogy** so that **exegesis** can confess the **homoousion** and its ontological entailments.

#### 4. Contemplating God with the Great Tradition: Classical Theism retrieved
In **Contemplating God with the Great Tradition** (2021) Carter prosecutes a full-scale defense of **classical theism**. He contends that **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, **aseity**, and **eternality** are not speculative accretions but entailments of biblical revelation once read under **Nicene metaphysics**. He argues that **eternal generation** of the Son and **spiratio** of the Spirit, together with **inseparable operations**, preserve both the **unity of essence** and the **distinctions of persons**. The conceptual infrastructure is squarely **Christian Platonism**, by which he means a participatory ontology of creatures as dependent beings whose perfections are participated likenesses of the **actus purus** of God.

Carter identifies **theistic personalism** and **open theism** as major evangelical departures. He critiques **Alvin Plantinga**-style freedom theodicies when they presuppose a univocal ontology and **William Lane Craig**-type neo-theisms when they embrace mutable, temporal models of God. He aligns with recent Protestant retrievals represented by **James Dolezal** on **divine simplicity**, as well as the Dominican analytic of **Brian Davies**, while remaining attentive to **Calvin’s autotheos** and **Bavinck’s** richly textured doctrine of God. For Carter, the patristic bequest reaches its dogmatic crown in **Aquinas’s** synthesis, not because of Aristotelianism as such, but because of the Thomistic refinement of **analogy**, **participation**, and **simplicity** in service of **Nicene trinitarianism**.

#### 5. Christian Platonism and Nicene metaphysics
Central to Carter’s project is the insistence that **Christian Platonism** names the metaphysical grammar through which the church articulated **homoousios**, the **eternal generation** of the Son, and the **simplicity** of the divine essence. He does not propose a baptizing of Plato, but rather a christological transformation of **participation** under the authority of **Scripture** and the **creedal rule**. The **analogia nominum** by which predicates are said of God and creatures analogically protects **divine transcendence** while enabling true discourse about God. The result is a robust commitment to **divine names** according to **perfection**, a doctrine of **exemplar ideas** by which God is the cause and final end of creatures, and a reading of causality as **exitus et reditus** that secures both **creation ex nihilo** and the **beatific end**.

Here Carter offers a strategic criticism of both **modern nominalism** and late modern historicism. Where nominalism undermines universals and thus destabilizes **theological predication**, historicism renders biblical meaning hostage to authorial psychology and contingent contexts. By retrieving **participatory ontology**, Carter contends that biblical realities such as **wisdom**, **goodness**, and **being** can be predicated of God analogically and of creatures by participation. This metaphysical work is not a rival to **biblical exegesis**; it is the grammar without which **doctrine of God** descends into personalist projection or mythic narrative.

#### 6. The Trinity, inseparable operations, and Christology
Carter’s Nicene trinitarianism coheres tightly with **inseparable operations** and **eternal generation**. The one simple God acts indivisibly *ad extra*, though the **personal properties** of **paternity**, **filiation**, and **spiration** ground fittingness in missions. Thus the **mission of the Son** is an extension of **eternal generation**, and the **mission of the Spirit** corresponds to **procession**. This paradigm safeguards **Christology**: the incarnate Son, one person in two natures, reveals the Father because he is **consubstantial** with the Father. Against **social trinitarianism**, Carter argues that interpersonal models fragment the divine unity and collapse into tritheism. Against **Eternal Functional Subordination**, he maintains that role subordination in the economy must not be projected into **immanent Trinity**; otherwise **simplicity** and **immutability** are compromised.

Carter’s Christocentrism emerges precisely from classical theism. By refusing to posit change or passibility in God, he heightens the soteriological significance of the **hypostatic union** and the **communication of idioms**. The **Cross** is salvific in the flesh of the Son without introducing suffering into the divine nature. Such careful deployment of **Chalcedonian** logic is a hallmark of his method: exegesis, creed, and metaphysics in a single ordered vision.

#### 7. Theological exegesis, canon, and the rule of faith
Returning to Scripture, Carter develops a canonical practice grounded in **divine authorial intent** and **providence**. The *regula fidei* frames the reading, while **good and necessary consequence** guides doctrinal inference. He endorses **typology** as the sense in which events and persons in the Old Testament prefigure Christ, while warning against decontextualized allegoresis. In dialogue with **Kevin Vanhoozer** and **Brevard Childs**, he presses beyond postliberal intratextuality to a realist account in which the canon renders true judgments about **God** and **creation**. His critique of **Barth** targets the reluctance to affirm strong **natural theology** as metaphysical grammar. Yet Carter differentiates his view from Roman Catholic deployments of **analogia entis** by stressing that the **rule of faith** and **creedal theology** regulate metaphysics, not vice versa. The **Great Tradition** is neither a rival source alongside Scripture nor a magisterial court; it is the Spirit’s providential echo of Scripture in the church reading Scripture.

This hermeneutical posture generates an ecclesial confidence without triumphalism. Carter commends a disciplined return to the **fathers** and **scholastics**, encouraging pastors and scholars to read **Augustine’s De Trinitate** and **Aquinas’s Summa Theologiae** as biblical theology writ large. The aim is not mimicry but apprenticeship in **doctrinal reasoning** where **exegesis** and **metaphysics** coinhere.

#### 8. Modern challenges: analytic theism, historicism, and evangelical drift
Carter engages contemporary **analytic theism** with qualified appreciation and strong warning. He affirms clarity and argument but opposes **univocal predication** and **temporalist** models of God that deny **immutability** or **impassibility**. He critiques **open theism** for evacuating sovereignty and **process theism** for dissolving the Creator-creature distinction. He reads **Rahner’s rule** as salutary for economy-immanent correlation but resists its deployment when it smooths out the **immanent Trinity** into economy-driven conceptualism. His reading of **Barth** finds real gains in the centrality of revelation but inadequate metaphysical commitments to underwrite **divine simplicity** and **natural knowledge of God**.

Within evangelicalism, Carter identifies a drift toward **theistic personalism**, **pragmatism**, and **biblical positivism** that lacks metaphysical depth. He contends that exegesis detached from **Nicene** commitments becomes susceptible to **subordinationism** or to a voluntarist doctrine of God, and that apologetics without **participation** and **analogy** cannot sustain catholic confession. The path forward is neither a repristination of medieval systems nor a retreat into biblicism, but a **Reformed catholicity** wholeheartedly owning **classical theism** as the grammar of gospel proclamation.

#### 9. Influence, reception, and ongoing program
Carter’s retrieval has been received among confessional Protestants as part of a broader renaissance of **classical theism**. In conversation with **James Dolezal** on **simplicity**, **Scott Swain** and **Michael Allen** on **trinitarian theology**, and **Hans Boersma** on **sacramental ontology**, Carter’s distinctive contribution is to weld **Nicene metaphysics** directly to **hermeneutics**. Whereas many retrievals operate at the level of dogmatic prolegomena, Carter’s 2018 and 2021 volumes show how **Christian Platonism** clarifies **the literal sense** and stabilizes preaching and catechesis. His work functions catechetically for pastors and academically for doctoral students, positioning the **Great Tradition** as an evangelical birthright rather than an alien inheritance.

The program is ongoing. Carter anticipates further work on the **Trinity** and on the comprehensive implications of **Nicene metaphysics** for ecclesiology and ethics. The horizon remains consistent: the church’s future lies in re-communion with its past, under Scripture, guided by **creedal orthodoxy**, and schooled by **Augustine** and **Aquinas** alongside **Calvin** and **Bavinck**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a confessional Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Carter’s achievement is considerable. His defense of **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, **immutability**, **eternal generation**, and **inseparable operations** accords with **Reformed orthodoxy** from **Turretin** to **Bavinck**. His **rule-of-faith** hermeneutics commendably aligns with **WCF 1.6** on **good and necessary consequence** and **WCF 1.9** on **Scripture interpreting Scripture**, while his critique of **theistic personalism** and **EFS** protects Nicene faith. Tensions arise in the label **Christian Platonism** and in the calibration of **analogia entis**. Reformed theology can affirm **analogical predication** and **participation** as modes of dependence while demurring from stronger nature-grace schemas often associated with **Thomism**. Carter’s account largely avoids a two-tier nature-grace framework by subordinating metaphysics to the **rule of faith**, yet vigilance is needed to ensure that **covenant** and **redemptive history** are not overshadowed by a static ontology. Hermeneutically, his advocacy of **figural exegesis** is welcome if disciplined by the **grammatical-historical** sense and canonical context; the **WTS** tradition will urge that typology be text-driven and covenantally located. The best Reformed alternative is not opposition but integration: receive Carter’s **Nicene metaphysics** and **classical doctrine of God** as non-negotiable, deploy them explicitly in **covenantal exegesis**, and articulate **Reformed catholicity** where **participation** is framed by **federal theology** and the **Christ-centered** unity of Scripture.
