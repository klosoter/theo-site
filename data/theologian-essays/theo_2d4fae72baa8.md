- Central terms: **tacit knowledge**, **subsidiary and focal integration**, **indwelling**, **universal intent**, **heuristic passion**, **convivial order**, **polycentricity**, **emergence** and **boundary conditions**.  
- Interlocutors and influences: **Gestalt psychology**, **Einstein and Planck**, debates with **Carnap and Ayer**, convergences and divergences with **Popper** and **Kuhn**, affinities with **Hayek** and later **Wittgenstein**.  
- Reformed cue: strong resonance with **covenantal epistemology**, **tradition and authority** in knowledge, and **critical realism**, yet tensions with **emergentist ontology** and an immanent account of **faith** lacking **special revelation**.

### ESSAY
Born in Budapest in 1891 and formed amid the late **Austro-Hungarian** ferment, **Michael Polanyi** became one of the twentieth century’s most original critics of **positivism** and defenders of a humane republic of science. Trained in medicine and physical chemistry and working at the **Kaiser Wilhelm Institute** in Berlin, he fled the political degradation of interwar Europe and took a chair in chemistry at the **University of Manchester** in 1933. That move, partly prompted by the threat of **totalitarianism**, seeded the convictions that would guide his mature philosophy: an insistence on the authority of truth over power, and a defense of the spontaneous, **convivial order** of science against centralized control. With the shadow of **Lysenkoism** and the exposure of scientistic hubris, Polanyi turned from laboratory mastery to the moral sources of inquiry, arguing in **Science, Faith and Society** 1946 that all science rests upon **faith-like commitments** within traditions of apprenticeship and public testing.

The trajectory from chemist to philosopher matured as he was appointed to Social Studies at Manchester in 1948 and delivered the **Gifford Lectures** in 1951 to 1952, later forged into **Personal Knowledge** 1958. There he rejected the ideal of **objectivist detachment** and offered a **post-critical** alternative: knowledge is a skillful, responsible performance, an achievement of a person whose attention, judgment, and trust indwell the tools and theories he or she relies on. This account drew on **Gestalt psychology** and on the craftlike structure of discovery, where pattern recognition and integrative seeing outrun explicit rules. The famous maxim We know more than we can tell encodes his doctrine of **tacit knowledge**, the inarticulate subsidiaries by which we attend to and contact the realities we seek to know.

At the heart of Polanyi’s method lies the **fiduciary program**. To doubt methodically is parasitic upon prior **fiducia**, since the scientist must trust mentors, instruments, language, and exemplars before any critical test can be meaningful. **Personal knowledge** thus names an epistemic stance, not a psychological idiosyncrasy. It is fiduciary because it begins in trust and is oriented by **universal intent**, a normative claim that the knower submits to the authority of reality and intends to speak truth for all, even while acknowledging fallibility. It is embodied because knowing is an act of **indwelling** that integrates **subsidiary** clues into a **focal** pattern, a structure he called from-to knowing. It is moral because discovery is sustained by **heuristic passion**, a responsible love for hidden order, disciplined by tradition and corrigible in a public community.

Polanyi’s polemic against the **objectivist ideal** was not a retreat into subjectivism but a reconfiguration of **realism**. Against **A. J. Ayer** and the verificationism of **logical positivism**, he argued that explicit criteria never suffice to determine theory choice, that rules cannot foreclose judgment, and that  silence in the tacit dimension grounds the possibility of explicit science. His is a **critical realism** because it names the mind’s fallible but genuine **contact with reality**, mediated by practices, symbols, and tools. The fiduciary stance is therefore not carte blanche belief but trained submission to the independent personhood of reality, an epistemic **kenosis** that unites authority and freedom within communal inquiry.

From these epistemic commitments flowed an account of the social ecology of knowledge that is as political as it is philosophical. In **Science, Faith and Society** and **The Logic of Liberty** 1951, Polanyi portrayed science as a **convivial order** sustained by **polycentricity**, where authority is diffused across many centers of competence and inquiry is guided by mutual authority and criticism. The market metaphor, shared in part with **F. A. Hayek**, emphasizes a spontaneous order that coordinates tacit information no planner can centralize. The lesson he drew from **Soviet** control of science and from the tragedy of **Lysenko** was that state monopoly of definition destroys truth-seeking. The republic of science depends on tradition, apprenticeship, and the freedom to pursue **self-coordinated discovery**, rooted in reverence for the truth that surpasses any individual claim.

Polanyi deepened the psychology of knowing in **The Tacit Dimension** 1966 by elucidating the **proximal** and **distal** poles of attention and the logic of **subsidiary-to-focal integration**. The pianist attends from finger feel to musical phrase; the radiologist indwells radiographic clues to focus on the lesion; the scientist indwells a conceptual vocabulary to focus on an emerging pattern. This is how **indwelling** operates: we assimilate tools and signs into the body, thereby extending the reach of perception and agency. The result is a semiotic and bodily account that converges with later **Wittgenstein** on practices and with **Merleau-Ponty** on embodiment, though Polanyi binds embodiment to objective **contact with reality** rather than confining it to language games. For him, discovery is a venture of hope under authority, disciplined by communities and authenticated by a deepening sense of reality’s resistance and gracious self-disclosure.

A further strand in Polanyi’s project is ontological. In essays gathered in **Knowing and Being** 1969 and in the scientific article **Life’s Irreducible Structure** 1968, he defended **emergence** and **stratified reality** against reductionism. Higher-level entities operate by **boundary conditions** and **operational principles** that are not deducible from lower-level physics, though they are consistent with it. The watch is constrained by the laws of physics yet functions by the logic of design; likewise, **organisms** exhibit teleological coordination not captured by blind mechanics. Polanyi’s **anti-reductionism** targeted both **behaviorism** in psychology and **mechanism** in biology, proposing a layered cosmos where new forms of control and meaning appear, irreducible to base-level descriptions. This account opened a path for a chastened natural theology by making room for form, purpose, and meaning within the sciences without collapsing into vitalism.

Late in life Polanyi turned to symbol and culture. In **Meaning** 1975, coauthored with **Harry Prosch**, he explored **semantic integration** across levels of meaning in art, myth, ritual, and religion. The same tacit dynamics by which we indwell clues to grasp a physical pattern underwrite our **connoisseurship** of paintings, our entrance into liturgical action, and our capacity to be grasped by a comprehensive vision. The arts are not decorative epiphenomena but conduits of **reality-disclosure**, shaping a person’s orientation to the world. Polanyi stopped short of confessional dogma but treated **religion** as the field in which ultimate **universal intent** is at stake. Myth and symbol, on his account, can be true by manifesting contact with the real, a claim that reconfigures **natural theology** beyond proofs and toward lived indwelling of revelation-like meaning.

Polanyi’s work is a sustained conversation with contemporaries and predecessors across philosophy and science. With **Karl Popper**, he shared fallibilism and respect for criticism, yet he faulted Popper’s **falsificationism** for underestimating the positive, skillful dimension of discovery and the authority of **tradition**. With **Thomas Kuhn**, he anticipated the social shape of paradigms and the nonrule-governed nature of theory change, but he resisted any slide into **relativism** by insisting on **universal intent** and increasing contact with reality. Against **Carnap** and **Ayer**, he exposed the inadequacy of verificationism and the myth of a rule-pure language. He learned from **Gestalt psychology** the holistic, figure-ground structure of perception and from **Einstein** and **Planck** the moral passion and ontological depth of science. Echoes of **Collingwood** and **Whitehead** mark his appreciation for the historical and processive texture of knowing, though his own **critical realism** is soberly anchored in laboratory and clinic.

The theological reception of Polanyi has been rich and varied. **T. F. Torrance** seized on **personal knowledge** and **indwelling** to argue that theological science shares with natural science a realist orientation under the authority of object, in this case the **self-revealing Triune God**. **Lesslie Newbigin** mobilized **universal intent** against postmodern relativism to defend the **public truth** of the gospel within a pluralist society. **J. Wentzel van Huyssteen** elaborated a **postfoundationalist** rationality that draws deeply on **tacit knowledge** and cross-disciplinary **transversality**. Within evangelical and Reformed circles, **Esther Meek** transposed Polanyi’s fiduciary and indwelling themes into **covenant epistemology**, framing knowing as pledged love under **Word and Spirit**. The result is a pattern of appropriation in which **tradition, authority, and skill** are rehabilitated for theology without abandoning **critical realism**.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Polanyi’s contribution is both a gift and a provocation. He recovers a **fiduciary** structure of knowing that resonates with **faith seeking understanding**, with **Calvin’s sensus divinitatis**, and with the Reformed insistence that all reason is **covenantally** situated. His **critical realism** comports with **creation** and **providence**, acknowledging that creaturely knowers indwell the given order and that truth claims possess **universal intent**. Yet his **emergentist ontology** can appear theologically thin if it implies a self-transcending nature without doxological reference to **creatio ex nihilo** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. His generic account of **faith** and **tradition** lacks the principial role of **special revelation** and **Scripture** as principium cognoscendi, and his diagnosis of error underestimates the **noetic effects of sin** that Reformed theology locates within the covenantal relation. A constructive path begins by receiving Polanyi’s **tacit knowledge** and **indwelling** as a creational grammar of knowing, aligning his **convivial order** with **sphere sovereignty**, and then norming universal intent by the **Word and Spirit** who summon, judge, and renew our personal knowledge within the covenant of grace.
