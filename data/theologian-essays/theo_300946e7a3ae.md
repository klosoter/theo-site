### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation in Roman Africa and the crisis of empire
Thascius Caecilius **Cyprian of Carthage**, born in the early third century into a prosperous municipal family, entered the church as a classically trained rhetor who read **Tertullian** and learned the idiom of forensic persuasion. His conversion around 246, narrated in **Ad Donatum**, framed Christian life as a deliverance from civic vice and philosophical vacuity into the luminous order of **baptismal regeneration**. Elevated rapidly, he became bishop of **Carthage** in 248 or 249, just as the edict of **Decius** in 250 forced public sacrifice to imperial gods. The African church fractured under the pressure of persecution and opportunism, creating the concrete setting for Cyprian's theology of **unitas ecclesiae** and **episcopatus unus**, forged not in scholastic disputation but in the heat of governance, schism, and martyrdom. The wider imperial crisis, plague, and administrative suspicion of associations made Carthage a laboratory for thinking **church, sacrament, and authority** as matters of life and death.

Cyprian's context determined his emphasis on **visible unity** and **discipline**. The Decian demand for certificates, called **libelli**, created categories of the **lapsi** who had sacrificed or feigned sacrifice. A cohort of confessors, lauded for steadfastness, issued **libelli pacis**, notes of peace requesting leniency for the lapsed. A presbyter named **Novatus** and a deacon **Felicissimus** exploited the situation in Carthage, fostering a rival communion. In Rome **Novatian** advanced a rigorist alternative. Cyprian met this with a pastoral and juridical program grounded in Scripture, tradition, and his theory of the **one episcopate**, shaping his enduring themes of **extra ecclesiam nulla salus** and **sacramentum unitatis**.

#### 2. Method, Scripture, and the habit of argument
The method of **Cyprian** combined rhetorical craft, juridical exactness, and a biblical hermeneutic of **catenae**. His **Testimonia ad Quirinum** collected Old and New Testament proof texts under doctrinal headings, mapping a canonical web where the **ark of Noah**, the **seamless garment** of Christ, and the **dove** figure the **unity of the church**. He cited a Latin Old Testament and the Gospels with an eye toward direct application rather than speculative synthesis, so his theology is doctrinally clear and architecturally concise. The style of **Tertullian's** moral severity and antithetical rhetoric is reworked into a more episcopal and collegial register, but the same binary cast remains, expressed in sharp contrasts like **church and schism**, **martyr and apostate**, **truth and custom**.

Cyprian's epistemic stance privileged **traditio** received in the college of bishops. Yet he refused to absolutize practice without truth, writing that **consuetudo sine veritate vetustas erroris**, custom without truth is the antiquity of error. This maxim governed his resistance to Roman claims in the rebaptism controversy and his adjudication of the **lapsi**. He processed disputes by **African councils** in 251 and 256, enshrining collegial discernment as an ecclesial epistemology. His letters, the **Epistulae**, serve as case-law precedents where Scripture, martyr authority, episcopal consent, and pastoral prudence converge to render binding judgments for a fragile communion.

#### 3. De Lapsis and the pedagogy of penance
The first major crisis yielded **De Lapsis** in 251, a treatise that combined prophetic rebuke with a constructive regime of **poenitentia**. Cyprian classified the fallen into **sacrificati**, those who offered, **thurificati**, those who burned incense, and **libellatici**, those who obtained certificates. He rooted apostasy in moral laxity before persecution and in the shameful overconfidence of a church that forgot **baptismal discipline**. He condemned the trading of **libelli pacis** and the presumption that confessor merits could be reckoned as transferable without episcopal oversight. Yet he provided a graded path to reconciliation, with **satisfactio** through fasting, almsgiving, and tears, punctuated by public confession and ultimately restoration by the **laying on of hands**.

Here Cyprian developed his account of **episcopal authority** as medicinal rather than merely judicial. The bishop holds keys for penitent reconciliation, yet he is bound to the witness of martyrs and the consent of the local church as represented in synod. **De Lapsis** shows a sacramental economy where sin affects the whole body, restoration is communal, and the **Eucharist** is both the eschatological gift and the test of unity. The trope **extra ecclesiam nulla salus** arises precisely from this pedagogy: salvation requires incorporation into the church that holds the Spirit and the sacrifices of Christ, a thesis he amplifies in **De Unitate Ecclesiae**.

#### 4. De Unitate Ecclesiae, the one episcopate, and the cathedra Petri
In **De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate** of 251, revised in 256, **Cyprian** articulated the core of his ecclesiology. The **unitas ecclesiae** is a divine fact grounded in Christ's institution, figured as the **seamless tunic**, the **one spouse**, the **one mother**, and the **ark** that alone saves. The church is not a mere association but a **sacramentum unitatis**, a visible sign that confers what it signifies in the life of grace. This unity is protected by the **one episcopate**, **episcopatus unus**, a single corporate office diffused across local bishops who each hold the whole in part. In his idiom, the episcopate is one, a column of many rays from the same sun, a plurality that is unity in origin and nature.

The controversial theme of the **cathedra Petri** serves as the symbol of unity. Cyprian affirms a Petrine primacy of origin, the rock and chair representing the unity of the apostolic college and therefore the unity of the episcopate. In the first edition of **De Unitate**, he linked the building of the church to Peter with greater emphasis, while the revision accentuated the equality of apostles within an undivided college. The shift reflects his developing conflict with **Stephen of Rome**. His final position rejects unilateral Roman jurisdiction while maintaining Rome's honor as a principal see and memory of Peter. He never collapses **episcopatus unus** into a single juridical head, because for him the Spirit's gift of unity resides corporately in conciliar communion, not in solitary supremacy.

#### 5. Discipline, councils, and the shape of catholicity
Cyprian's episcopacy was conciliar from the start. In 251 the **Council of Carthage** adjudicated the **lapsi** and took measures against Felicissimus's schism. He insisted that no bishop can impose norms on another, since each holds judgment from Christ, yet all are bound to the consensus of the whole. This is neither fragmented autonomy nor Roman centralism, but a **catholicity of concord**. The African synods of 255 and 256, dealing with **baptism by heretics**, exemplify this collegiality. Bishop after bishop spoke his **sententia** in turn, creating a juridical chorus grounded in Scripture and the tradition of their own sees. Cyprian kept careful records through the **Epistulae**, schooling future bishops in the procedural virtue of publicity, memory, and mutual accountability.

This conciliar habit underwrote his appeals to the authority of **martyrs and confessors** without ceding the bishop's discernment. He honored their **charism of perseverance** yet disciplined their excess. The councils taught that the peace of martyrs does not abolish **penitential order**. Thus Cyprian's discipline functioned as a liturgy of reconciliation that enacted his doctrine of **sacramentum unitatis**. The Eucharist remained the sacrament of peace restored, and the bishop the visible focus of the church's identity as one body. Catholicity meant the agreement of many sees in one faith and life, expressed in letters, synods, and mutual recognition, not simply numerical universality.

#### 6. Baptism, the Spirit, and the rebaptism controversy
Cyprian's sacramental theology turns on the inseparability of **Spirit and Church**. Heretics, who are outside the unity, cannot give what they do not have. This axiom, **non potest dare quod non habet**, generated his insistence that there is no valid **baptismus haereticorum**. Those baptized in schismatic or heretical communions must be baptized upon entry into the church, not merely reconciled by imposition of hands. He appealed to the unity of **Ephesians** and the singularity of **one baptism**, arguing that duplication is only apparent, since the prior rite was no baptism at all. The African councils codified this position, which also had support in parts of Asia Minor.

Against him **Stephen of Rome** maintained that baptism conferred in the triune name retained validity regardless of the minister's communion, and that reconciliation should proceed by **impositio manuum**. Stephen excommunicated dissenters, invoked Roman custom, and asserted a **Petrine claim** of normativity. Cyprian answered with the maxim **consuetudo sine veritate vetustas erroris** and kept communion with bishops who disagreed while rejecting the Roman sentence. He framed the issue as one of truth in charity, not of domination. The theological cleavage is deep. Cyprian sees sacramental efficacy as tethered to **visible unity** and **orthodox confession**. Stephen sees validity tied to **form and intention** grounded in Christ's institution. Later **Augustine** sided with Stephen on validity, but he harvested Cyprian's principles of unity and charity to dismantle **Donatist** rigor. The controversy thus became a hinge for Latin sacramental theology, with Cyprian as both progenitor and foil.

#### 7. Ascetic pedagogy, prayer, and almsgiving
Beyond crisis treatises, **Cyprian** wrote ascetical and catechetical works that gave spiritual depth to his ecclesiology. In **De Oratione Dominica** he expounds the Lord's Prayer as the grammar of Christian existence, a corporate prayer that trains believers in **filial boldness** and **ecclesial charity**. **De Habitu Virginum** addresses modesty and discipline among consecrated women, coloring his moral theology with the beauty of ordered desires in the household of God. During plague he composed **De Mortalitate** to steady the faithful with eschatological hope and to valorize **martyrdom** as the crown of Christian life, which he called **baptism of blood** for catechumens who die confessing Christ.

The strongest point of divergence with later Protestant sensibilities lies in **De Opere et Eleemosynis**. Here **Cyprian** urges generous almsgiving as **medicinal satisfaction** for post-baptismal sins, appealing to Scripture that love covers a multitude of sins and that alms deliver from death. He does not deny the primacy of **Christ's sacrifice**, but he deploys an ontology of participation in which **works of mercy** apply the fruits of Christ as healing remedies within the body. The logic is ecclesial and medicinal, yet the language of **merit** and **expiation** through alms is unmistakable. Still, even this treatise keeps the axis of **unity and reconciliation** in view, since almsgiving strengthens the **sacramentum unitatis** by binding rich and poor in mutual care.

#### 8. Martyrdom, death, and reception in later controversies
In 257 **Valerian** targeted bishops and clergy. **Cyprian** was exiled to Curubis and then recalled for trial. On 14 September 258 he was beheaded outside Carthage, entering the martyrological canon as a bishop who matched his **De Mortalitate** with deed. His **Acts** frame his martyrdom as a final seal upon the **sacramentum unitatis** he taught, a witness to the inseparability of **truth, charity, and order**. The immediate legacy was ambiguous. African rigorists and later **Donatists** found in his invalidation of heretical sacraments and in his high doctrine of **church holiness** a charter for their separatism. **Augustine** and **Optatus** reclaimed Cyprian as an exemplar of charity who suffered for unity and argued that his error on baptism was corrected by the wider church without his ceasing to be a saint.

In the West, **Roman Catholic** theology appropriated the **cathedra Petri** language while carefully underscoring Cyprian's collegiality. In the East, his emphasis on conciliarity and the one episcopate resonated with a more **synodal** model of governance. Medieval canonists mined his **Epistulae** for precedents, while Reformers debated **extra ecclesiam nulla salus** under the new problem of the gospel's visibility. His rhetorical images still shape ecumenical discourse about **communion and schism**, and his claim that unity is sacramental rather than optional continues to unsettle reductionist accounts of church as voluntary society.

#### 9. Integrated synthesis and Reformed or WTS evaluation
Cyprian's theology is best seen as an intellectual architecture built from crisis toward **unitas ecclesiae**. The bishop stands at the knot where **Word, sacrament, and discipline** converge. **De Lapsis** gives the medicine of penance under episcopal oversight. **De Unitate** declares the **episcopatus unus** as the instrument and sign of visible unity. The **rebaptism** stance binds sacramental efficacy to communion with the church that bears the **Spirit**. His ascetical treatises train the body for peace and patience, while **De Opere et Eleemosynis** articulates an economy of healing where works of mercy participate in the reconciling **sacrifice of Christ**. The method is not speculative but canonical and conciliar, shaped by **Scripture** and lived tradition, articulated in letters and councils, and sealed in martyrdom.

A Reformed and WTS evaluation presses several lines. First, Cyprian's insistence that unity is a **sacramentum** is a salutary corrective to privatized faith. The Reformed doctrine of the **marks of the church**, pure preaching and right administration of **sacraments** with discipline, is in genuine alignment with his passion for visible order and holiness. Yet his grounding of sacramental validity in **visible communion** rather than in Christ's institution creates a fault line. Classical Reformed teaching holds that the efficacy and validity of **baptism** depend upon Christ's promise, not upon the minister's communion or moral state, while the fruitfulness of the sacrament depends on **faith** wrought by the Spirit. Cyprian's axiom **non potest dare quod non habet** anticipates **Donatism**, even if he himself remained catholic in charity, and his refusal of **baptismus haereticorum** sits at odds with the Reformed defense of a once-for-all baptism done in the triune name. Second, his maxim **extra ecclesiam nulla salus** requires calibration by the Reformed distinction between **visible and invisible church**, where the covenant people under the Word extend beyond any one jurisdiction and where unity is constituted primarily by **truth of the gospel** rather than by a conciliar chain to a corporate episcopate. Third, the medicinal idiom of **satisfactio** and the claim in **De Opere et Eleemosynis** that alms expiate post-baptismal sin conflict with the Reformed confession of **sola gratia** and **sola fide**, which reserve expiation to the finished work of Christ and locate good works as the necessary fruit of faith within **covenant** sanctification, not as instruments of atonement. At the level of principle, a WTS analysis would say that Cyprian's ontology of the church sometimes subordinates **revelation** to **institution**, whereas Reformed theology subordinates ecclesial form to the **self-attesting Word** and its covenantal administration. The best Reformed appropriation of Cyprian receives his **zeal for unity, discipline, and catholic peace**, learns from his conciliar instincts, and corrects his sacramental and meritorious overreach by anchoring **unity in truth**, **sacrament in promise**, and **order in covenantal Word**.
