### TITLE
Cornelius Van Til rearticulates classic Reformed orthodoxy for the modern age by arguing that the triune Creator–creature distinction demands a consistently presuppositional theology and apologetic, where all facts are already God-interpreted and all reasoning is covenantally obedient or rebellious.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Cornelius Van Til** (1895–1987) stands at the crossroads of Old **Princeton** and **Westminster Seminary**, responding to **Kantian** and **idealistic** challenges to Christian theism in the early twentieth century.
- Working in the era of **neo-orthodoxy** and American **fundamentalism vs. modernism**, Van Til crafts a distinctive Reformed response to **liberalism** and **Barthian** revisionism.

- Van Til develops a thoroughly **presuppositional** method that insists all reasoning rests on ultimate religious commitments before any purportedly neutral facts.
- His method grounds **epistemology** in the self-attesting **Triune God** of Scripture, rejecting autonomous **reason** while affirming a robust use of the intellect in submission to revelation.
- He frames all knowledge in terms of **covenant** and **antithesis**, with the believer and unbeliever inhabiting incommensurable worldviews that nevertheless share a common **creation**.

- In **The Defense of the Faith** (1955), Van Til argues that Christian apologetics must reason from the **self-attesting Christ of Scripture** and not from shared neutral principles.
- In **The New Modernism** (1946), he contends that **Karl Barth** and **neo-orthodoxy** represent a subtler form of modernism that undermines the **authority of Scripture** and the Creator–creature distinction.
- In **A Christian Theory of Knowledge** (1969), he articulates a Reformed **epistemology** in which all facts and laws are exhaustively interpreted by God and known analogically by man.
- In **Common Grace and the Gospel** (1972), he expounds the doctrines of **common grace**, the **antithesis**, and **point of contact**, engaging debates with **Kuyperian** and **Dutch Reformed** interlocutors.

- Van Til is decisive for the loci of **revelation and Scripture**, especially the authority and self-attestation of the Word of God against **autonomous reason**.
- He significantly shapes Reformed approaches to **apologetics and culture**, emphasizing **antithesis**, **common grace**, and the impossibility of religious neutrality.
- His work on **Trinity and epistemology** makes the doctrine of God, particularly the **ontological Trinity**, structurally central for all knowledge claims.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to affirm Van Til as a faithful **Reformed confessionalist** who defended the **inerrant Scripture** and classical **theism** in a hostile modern setting.
- They will also want you to nuance his polemics, showing how **Van Til** can be honored while carefully handling his critiques of **natural theology** and **Karl Barth**.

- You should be ready to compare **Van Til vs. Clark** over the issues of **analogical knowledge** and the nature of **logic** and revelation.
- You should also prepare **Van Til vs. Aquinas** comparisons on **natural theology**, and **Van Til vs. Barth** on **revelation** and the self-attestation of Scripture.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Cornelius **Van Til** was born in 1895 in Grootegast in the Netherlands and immigrated to the United States as a child, eventually studying at **Calvin College**, then at **Princeton Seminary** and **Princeton University**. He imbibed the Old Princeton tradition through figures like **B. B. Warfield** and **Geerhardus Vos**, while also encountering **Kantian** and **idealistic** philosophies in university studies. The early twentieth century context of the **fundamentalist–modernist controversy**, the reorganization of Princeton Seminary, and the rise of **neo-orthodoxy** in Europe created a crucible in which Van Til had to articulate a Reformed response to both liberalism and subtler revisions of orthodoxy. His eventual move in 1929 to help found **Westminster Theological Seminary** under **J. Gresham Machen** placed him at the institutional heart of confessional Presbyterian resistance to theological modernism.

The driving problem for Van Til is how the **Reformed doctrine of God** and the **Creator–creature distinction** should shape not only dogmatics but also **epistemology** and **apologetics**. He believed that both liberal theology and much conservative apologetics shared a fatal assumption of **autonomous reason**, treating the human mind as capable of standing in judgment over God. Influenced by **Kuyperian** insights on **worldview** and **antithesis**, he asked how a consistently Reformed theology could reject neutrality and assert that every fact and every thought is already God-interpreted. For Van Til the key problem is: can Christians defend the faith in a way that does not betray the **self-attesting** character of divine **revelation** and the comprehensive lordship of the triune God over all knowledge and culture.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Van Til insists on the primacy of **Scripture** as the self-attesting revelation of the **Triune God**, yet he also sees Scripture as always already interpreted by the God who speaks and by the church who receives it. In works like **The Defense of the Faith**, he argues that revelation is not merely information but the exhaustive interpretation of reality by God Himself. All facts are what they are by virtue of Gods plan, and all laws of logic and science are what they are by virtue of His character. Human **knowledge** is therefore analogical: we never know as God knows, but we can truly know because our thoughts are meant to think Gods thoughts after Him. This **analogy** is grounded not in *analogia entis* in a Thomistic sense, but in the Reformed emphasis on the **Creator–creature distinction** as articulated by theologians like **Calvin** and **Bavinck**.

Regarding **reason** and **experience**, Van Til is sharply critical of any notion of neutral rationality. He claims that every use of reason is covenantal, either in obedience or in rebellion against the **covenant Lord**. Experience is never a raw given but always interpreted within a worldview. In **A Christian Theory of Knowledge**, he builds on **Kuyper** and **Dooyeweerd** to argue that the unbeliever suppresses the truth of God revealed in **general revelation** and so constructs a false interpretive framework. Nevertheless, due to **common grace**, unbelievers can make many true claims and contribute to culture and science, though they do so inconsistently with their deepest presuppositions. For Van Til, the church as the community of the **Word and Spirit** stands as the true interpretive community that receives, preserves, and confesses Gods revelation in history.

Van Til constantly interprets **history** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **covenant**, in continuity with **Vos**. He sees the historical development of philosophy from **Plato** and **Aristotle** through **Kant**, **Hegel**, and **modernism** as various suppressions of the clear revelation of God in creation. Yet he also studies these traditions carefully, drawing out their internal tensions in order to show that only the Christian worldview provides the preconditions for intelligible experience. The tension with classical Reformed method arises primarily where earlier writers like **Turretin** used more straightforward **natural theology** and arguments from causality or design. Van Til does not reject the truths of such arguments, but he insists that they must be framed within a **covenantal**, not neutral, epistemology. One must argue transcendentally, asking what must be true for logic, science, and morality to be possible at all, and then show that only the **triune God of Scripture** can supply those conditions.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, at the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is that God reveals Himself in **general** and **special revelation**, with Scripture as the inerrant, sufficient, and final authority for faith and life. Van Til radicalizes the implications of this by arguing that **revelation** is inherently and inescapably self-attesting and cannot be placed under the bar of independent human reason. In **The Defense of the Faith** and in his essays on **Scripture and epistemology**, he contends against both **liberalism** and **evidentialist apologetics** that seek to verify Scripture by criteria external to it. Against evidentialists like **J. Oliver Buswell**, Van Til maintains that Christian apologetics must start with the triune God speaking in Scripture as the ultimate criterion of truth, and then show that denial of this presupposition destroys the possibility of knowledge. The Bible is not just another source among many but the principium cognoscendi of theology, the foundational norm through which we interpret all other revelations of God.

Second, in the locus of **doctrine of God and Trinity**, the Reformed confessions affirm one simple and spiritual **God**, subsisting in three persons, who is independent, immutable, and sovereign over all things. Van Til makes the **ontological Trinity** structurally central to epistemology and metaphysics, developing an argument that only the triune God provides the necessary unity and diversity in reality and knowledge. In his essay **God and the Absolute** and scattered throughout **A Christian Theory of Knowledge**, he critiques **idealism** and **pantheism** for failing to do justice to the equal ultimacy of the one and the many. For Van Til, every attempt to ground reality in pure unity collapses into a faceless absolute, while every attempt to ground it in pure plurality dissolves into chaos. The Christian doctrine of the **Trinity** uniquely secures both a real unity of the divine essence and a real diversity of persons, thereby underwriting the coherence of logic, language, and science. His chief interlocutors here are **Hegelian idealists** and also classical **Thomists**, whom he accuses of relying on a form of abstract simplicity that does not adequately integrate the personal richness of the triune God.

Third, in the locus of **creation, common grace, and culture**, the Reformed baseline insists that God created the world good, that man fell into sin, and that God nevertheless bestows **common grace** that restrains sin and allows for cultural life and advancement. Van Til seeks to hold together a strong doctrine of **antithesis** between belief and unbelief with a robust affirmation of **common grace**. In **Common Grace and the Gospel**, he engages both **Abraham Kuyper** and later Dutch Reformed debates, arguing that there is a genuine point of contact between believer and unbeliever because both are image bearers in the same created world. Yet this point of contact is not neutral territory; it is rather the inescapable revelation of God in creation that the unbeliever suppresses. Against more optimistic readings of culture, Van Til stresses that the noetic effects of sin are radical and pervasive, so that all cultural products are religiously motivated. However, against a fundamentalist retreat, he insists that Christians, by virtue of **special grace** and regeneration, can enter cultural endeavors with a distinctively Christian worldview that honors Christ as Lord over all.

Fourth, at the locus of **apologetics and the use of reason**, older Reformed orthodoxy maintained that reason is a ministerial instrument that can serve faith through arguments for the existence of God and the truth of Christianity, while always subordinated to revelation. Van Til does not deny the use of **arguments**, but he reshapes their form through a **transcendental** approach. In his critiques of **Roman Catholic** and **Arminian** apologetics, he opposes methods that assume shared principles of autonomous reason. His well-known clash with **Gordon Clark** over the nature of knowledge and **logic** highlights his insistence that human knowledge is never identical with divine knowledge but always analogical. Van Til develops the notion of the **impossibility of the contrary**: the claim that Christianity must be proved not by meeting unbelieving standards of proof but by showing that the denial of Christian theism undermines the intelligibility of any proof whatsoever. This offers a distinctive Reformed apologetic that seeks to be self-consciously controlled by the doctrines of **revelation**, **sin**, and **grace**.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Van Til saw himself as operating in deep continuity with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and particularly **Bavinck** and **Vos**. He often appealed to Calvin on the **sensus divinitatis** and the **spectacles of Scripture**, and to Bavinck on the organic relation between **creation**, **revelation**, and **theology**. Westminster theologians like **John Murray** and **Ned Stonehouse** appreciated his defense of inerrancy and the authority of Scripture, while later presuppositionalists like **Greg Bahnsen** and **John Frame** developed and sometimes modified his insights. Yet there are also critical questions raised by Reformed scholars regarding his handling of **natural theology** and his sharp polemics against **Karl Barth**. Some, like **Richard Muller**, suggest that earlier Reformed orthodoxy has more positive use of the **sensus divinitatis** and **natural knowledge of God** than Van Til appears to allow. Others argue that he could have distinguished more carefully between illegitimate autonomous reasoning and a legitimate, subordinate use of **philosophical tools**.

A Westminster examiner must object wherever Van Til might appear to deny outright the reality of **natural revelation** or the confessional teaching on a natural knowledge of God, for the **Westminster Confession** affirms that the light of nature and the works of creation clearly manifest the existence of God. They will also press his sometimes sweeping critique of **Thomas Aquinas** and **Barth**, asking for nuanced evaluation rather than blanket rejection. At the same time, Reformed theologians can and should learn from Van Til in his relentless insistence that theology and apologetics be governed by the **Creator–creature distinction**, the **self-attestation of Scripture**, and the radical noetic effects of sin. His **transcendental** approach offers a powerful way to expose the internal incoherence of unbelief and to commend the faith as the only foundation for rationality, morality, and science.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams the safest opening sentence about Van Til is something like: **Van Til sought to apply the Reformed doctrine of the triune God and the Creator–creature distinction consistently to epistemology and apologetics, arguing that all reasoning is covenantally conditioned and that Scripture is self-attesting.** Such a sentence highlights his continuity with **Reformed orthodoxy** and his central categories of **presupposition**, **antithesis**, and **self-attestation**. Another safe line is: **Van Til was a confessional Presbyterian who defended the inerrant Scripture against liberalism and neo-orthodoxy while critiquing conservative apologetics for compromising with autonomous reason.** These formulations show that you understand his pastoral and ecclesial concerns as well as his philosophical ones.

The landmines arise if you speak as though Van Til rejected **natural revelation** or denied any value to **natural theology**. You should avoid unqualified phrases such as: **Van Til denied natural theology** or **Van Til rejected all evidences**. Instead, say that he **restructured natural theology within a presuppositional framework** and **insisted that evidences be presented as expressions of the Christian worldview, not as neutral data.** Likewise, be careful when echoing his critique of **Aquinas** or **Barth**. Do not simply say, **Aquinas was unbiblical** or **Barth was a modernist**. Rather, explain that in **The New Modernism** Van Til argued that Barth, despite his strong language about revelation, retained a dialectical pattern that blurred the **Creator–creature distinction**, and that he judged Thomistic natural theology to be compromised by **autonomous reason**. You can then add that many scholars have nuanced or questioned aspects of these critiques.

Examiners will often probe misunderstandings, such as the notion that Van Til abolishes the **point of contact** with unbelievers or that he denies common ground in any sense. You should insist that he affirms a rich point of contact in **creation** and **imago Dei**, but denies that this point of contact is religiously neutral. Another misunderstanding is that his claim of the **incommensurability** of worldviews implies that believers and unbelievers share no common logic or language. Here you should say that Van Til affirms a shared **created rationality** and shared **logic**, yet he holds that these are always used within antithetical religious frameworks. Also clarify that **analogical knowledge** does not mean uncertainty or skepticism; it means that our knowledge is genuinely true yet never identical in mode or extent with Gods knowledge. Examiners may also ask about **Van Til vs. Clark**, so you should be ready to say that Van Til rejected the idea that human propositions are identical with divine propositions and stressed the incomprehensibility of God even in His revelation. Throughout, show appreciation for Van Til while acknowledging that later Reformed thinkers have sought to clarify and sometimes correct aspects of his formulation.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Van Til is a pivotal figure who vigorously reasserted classic **Reformed confessionalism** against **liberalism** and **neo-orthodoxy**, and who fruitfully pressed the **Creator–creature distinction**, the **Trinity**, and the **noetic effects of sin** into the realm of epistemology and apologetics. We affirm his insistence that Scripture is **self-attesting**, that there is no religiously neutral ground, and that all reasoning is covenantally conditioned, as well as his transcendental argument that Christian theism alone provides the preconditions for intelligibility. We must deny any readings of Van Til that would flatten or contradict the Reformed affirmation of **natural revelation** and a true, though always analogical, natural knowledge of God, and we should resist overly polemical dismissals of **Aquinas** or **Barth** where he may have overstated his case. If asked where we land, we would say: we stand with **Van Til** in a presuppositional, Trinitarian, confessional Reformed apologetic that starts from Gods self-revelation in **Scripture**, gratefully receiving his insights, while also integrating them critically with the broader **Reformed orthodox** tradition on natural theology, common grace, and the catholic heritage of the church.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Cornelius **Van Til** is the Reformed apologist who sought to apply the Creator–creature distinction and the authority of Scripture consistently to epistemology and apologetics in the face of modern and neo-orthodox challenges.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1895 in the Netherlands, trained at **Princeton Seminary**, and helped found **Westminster Theological Seminary** in 1929 in response to the modernist reorganization of Princeton.
- In **The Defense of the Faith** (1955), Van Til presents his mature presuppositional apologetic grounded in the self-attesting Christ of **Scripture**.
- In **The New Modernism** (1946) and **A Christian Theory of Knowledge** (1969), he critiques **Karl Barth** and develops a distinctively Reformed epistemology and theory of knowledge.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Van Til argues that all knowledge is **analogical** and covenantally conditioned, since only the **Triune God** comprehends reality exhaustively and humans must think Gods thoughts after Him.
- He insists that **Scripture** is the self-attesting principium of theology and that there is no religiously neutral **reason** that can judge Gods Word from above.
- He uses a **transcendental** method in apologetics, arguing that Christian theism alone provides the preconditions for logic, science, and morality in human **experience**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Van Til centers the **Creator–creature distinction** and the **Trinity** as the structural key to all metaphysics and epistemology, making the ontological Trinity solve the problem of the one and the many.
- He develops a presuppositional view of **revelation** and **Scripture**, claiming that the Bible cannot be placed under autonomous tests but must be received as self-attesting.
- He reconfigures **natural theology** and the point of contact, affirming **common grace** and natural revelation while denying any religiously neutral common ground.
- He emphasizes **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, asserting that all thought is either covenantally obedient or rebellious, yet that unbelievers inconsistently use borrowed capital from the Christian worldview.
- In critiquing **Barth** and **neo-orthodoxy**, he argues that their dialectical theology undermines the Creator–creature distinction and fails to secure a stable, authoritative **Word of God**.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Examiners will press whether Van Til denies or merely reforms **natural theology**, and how he relates his presuppositionalism to the confessional doctrine of natural revelation and the **sensus divinitatis**.
- They will ask you to nuance his critique of **Aquinas** and **Thomism**, making clear where he objects to autonomous reason and where he can still appropriate classical **theism**.
- They may probe his strong opposition to **Karl Barth**, asking whether his claim that Barth is a new form of modernism is fully justified and how to read Barth more carefully.
- They will test your grasp of **analogical knowledge**, ensuring you do not slip into skepticism or into the **Clarkian** notion of identical propositions between Gods knowledge and ours.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Van Til vs. Aquinas** on **natural theology** and the use of reason, with Van Til insisting on presuppositional, covenantal epistemology while Aquinas affirms a more positive account of natural reason under grace.
- **Van Til vs. Barth** on **revelation and Scripture**, with Van Til stressing self-attestation and inerrant propositional revelation and Barth emphasizing dialectical encounter and Christ as the only Word of God.
- **Van Til vs. Clark** on **analogical knowledge** and the nature of logic, contrasting Van Til’s insistence on the incomprehensibility of God with Clark’s stronger identity claims about divine and human propositions.
- **Van Til vs. Warfield** on apologetic method, comparing Van Til’s presuppositional, transcendental argument with Warfield’s more classical **evidential** and **theistic proofs** within Old Princeton.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Van Til is a profoundly constructive Reformed theologian of knowledge and apologetics whose presuppositional insights should be gratefully received and critically integrated with the wider confessional tradition on **natural revelation**, **Trinity**, and **Scripture**.
