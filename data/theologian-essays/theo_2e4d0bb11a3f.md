### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The intellectual itinerary of **Walter J. Ong, SJ** belongs to the long twentieth century in which **modern** anxieties about technology and culture drew theologians back to the texture of communication itself. Born in 1912 and dying in 2003, Ong entered the **Society of Jesus** in 1935, studied at **Saint Louis University**, and worked early under **Marshall McLuhan**, then completed his Harvard doctorate under **Perry Miller** in 1955 on **Peter Ramus** and the transformation of rhetoric. This formation located Ong at the crossroads of **rhetorical history**, **media ecology**, and a Catholic sense of **sacramentality**. His method is a **historical phenomenology of consciousness**: he maps how different media environments reshape the human **noetic economy**, the felt structure of knowing, memory, and sociality. He is less a system-builder than a magisterial interpreter, yet beneath his descriptions runs a theological thesis about the **Word as event** and the **sacramental presence of sound**, drawn from **Augustine** on *verbum interius* and an **Ignatian** attention to embodied practice. Across a vast corpus, Ong shows how the shift from **orality** to **literacy** to **typography** and then to **electronic secondary orality** recasts religious experience and doctrine.

At the center of Ong’s method is the conviction that **sound** as a medium is evanescent, relational, and communal, whereas **writing** and **print** stabilize and spatialize discourse, fostering **visualism** and analytical abstraction. The consequences for theology are not incidental. The **kerygmatic** power of preaching, the shape of **liturgy**, the form of **catechesis**, and the articulation of **doctrine** all respond to the dominant media ecology. These claims unfold through a thick engagement with **Milman Parry and Albert Lord** on oral epic, **Harold Innis** and **McLuhan** on communication bias, and **Eric Havelock** and **Jack Goody** on literacy’s cognitive effects. Ong’s Catholic idiom gives his work a constant undercurrent of **sacramentality**, insisting that the **word** mediates presence, not merely information. The result is an interpretive framework in which **media** are not peripheral instruments but structural determinants of how **faith** is believed, expressed, and transmitted.

#### 2. Ramus, the methodizing of knowledge, and the decline of dialogue
Ong’s first monumental contribution, **Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue (1958)** together with **Ramus and Talon Inventory (1958)**, documents how **Peter Ramus** and his ally **Omer Talon** reconfigured the canons of **rhetoric** and **dialectic** in the sixteenth century. In an era electrified by **chirography** and **typography**, Ramus reunified knowledge under diagrammatic **method**, collapsing the agonistic give-and-take of **Ciceronian** and **scholastic** dialogue into visual trees and dichotomies. For Ong, **Ramist method** is not simply pedagogical technique; it crystallizes the impact of **print** on thought, privileging **analysis**, **classification**, and ocular clarity over oral disputation. The theological reverberations are acute. **Protestant**, particularly **Reformed** and **Puritan**, pedagogy and homiletics absorbed Ramist schematization, yielding the familiar sermon architecture of **doctrine, reasons, and uses**, a paper-driven rhetoric that made **Scripture** newly accessible yet newly flattened.

In narrating this **decay of dialogue**, Ong is neither nostalgic nor neutral. He recognizes that **typography** democratized learning and enabled the wide distribution of **Bibles**, catechisms, and confessions. But he also insists that the **dialogical** and **communal** energies of an oral and manuscript culture receded as **method** hardened into grid. The effect on **theology** included a heightened **propositional** clarity and a consolidated **systematics**, while the **liturgical** and **homiletical** arts tilted toward didactic efficiency. Ong’s analysis thus ties the **Reformation** and **Counter-Reformation** alike to a media-conditioned recoding of faith’s discourse. The **Jesuit** Ratio Studiorum resisted Ramism yet operated within the same typographic confidence, confirming for Ong that **media ecology** cuts across confessional differences and presses theology into new forms.

#### 3. The Presence of the Word: sacramentality, sound, and religious knowing
Ong’s most explicitly theological book, **The Presence of the Word: Some Prolegomena for Cultural and Religious History (1967)**, distills his thesis that sound’s ontological profile suits Christian claims about **presence**, **incarnation**, and **revelation**. Sound, he argues, situates persons in a field of mutual address; it occurs as **event** rather than residue; it involves the whole body and creates **communion**. Hence the **word** in Scripture, in **preaching**, and in **liturgy** mediates more than content; it mediates a presence that is analogically **sacramental**. Ong’s use of **Augustine** on *verbum interius* and **Ignatius of Loyola** on meditative hearing indicates a Catholic **sacramental ontology**, where the sensible and the intelligible interpenetrate. The subtitle’s prolegomena signals a guardedness: Ong offers not dogma but conditions for a **cultural theology** of revelation.

In this key text, Ong aligns **orality** with a dense **noetic economy** marked by aggregation, redundancy, homeostasis, and an agonistic but communal style. **Textuality** and **typography** stabilize discourse, enabling systematic **doctrine**, long-distance **authority**, and archival memory, but often at the cost of dialogical encounter. Ong does not propose a return to pure orality. Instead, he calls theologians to read the **history of dogma**, **catechesis**, and **devotion** through the shifting sensorium, recognizing that the **presence of the Word** manifests differently in **oral proclamation** than in **printed** or **electronic** mediation. This hermeneutic of media allows renewed appreciation for preaching as an event of **presence**, for **chant** and **song** as formative, and for the concrete ways **Scripture** was once heard before it was primarily read.

#### 4. Orality and Literacy: psychodynamics and cultural theology
The synthetic statement **Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982)** is Ong’s most cited work, systematizing differentiations between **primary orality** in non-literate cultures, **residual orality** in literate societies that retain oral patterns, and **secondary orality** produced by electronic media such as radio and television. He famously catalogues the **psychodynamics of orality**: additive rather than subordinative syntax, formulaic and aggregative speech, a conservative or homeostatic mnemonic bias, empathetic participation, presentness, situational rather than abstract conceptualization, and a tendency toward **agonistic** expression. By contrast, **literacy** and especially **typography** foster abstraction, categorization, self-distancing, and **visualism**, making possible **logics**, carefully ordered **theologies**, and bureaucratic **ecclesiologies**.

The theological yield is double. On the one hand, **print culture** underwrites the codification of **creeds**, the precision of **systematic theology**, and the global extension of **mission** through standardized texts. On the other hand, Ong shows how **oral** features remain integral to any healthy **church**, particularly in the primacy of **preaching**, **testimony**, and **liturgical** performance. The emergence of **secondary orality** in electronic media challenges churches shaped by typographic rationality to recover sonic and dialogical forms without surrendering to spectacle. In all this, Ong avoids crude **technological determinism**: media do not mechanistically cause belief; they condition the **noetic economy** within which belief is articulated and shared. The theologian’s task becomes discerning the **form** of the word appropriate to the gospel’s **content**.

#### 5. Interfaces, technology, and contest: widening the inquiry
Several volumes deepen and extend these insights. **Rhetoric, Romance, and Technology (1971)** tracks how **technology** affects expressive genres, showing how modernity’s romance with technique refigures **rhetoric** and literary form. **Interfaces of the Word (1977)** examines contact-zones where **orality** and **literacy** intersect, including **catechetical** and **missionary** exchanges, thereby sharpening the sense that media environments are rarely pure. **Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (1981)** ventures into cultural anthropology, arguing that the **agonistic** character of oral cultures persists and is recoded in literate societies, including in male patterns of **competition** and institutional life. Each of these studies returns to the same claims about **sound**, **visualism**, and the **noetic economy**, but now explicit theological consequences accumulate: pedagogy in seminaries, the architecture of **homiletics**, and the dynamics of **pastoral care** must be rethought in light of media-conditioned habitus.

Ong also continued a strand of work on **Gerard Manley Hopkins** culminating in **Hopkins, the Self, and God (1986)**, where the interplay of **poetic form**, **selfhood**, and **theology** exemplifies how **word as sound** can mediate intense **theological** vision. The Hopkins project serves as a microcosm of Ong’s thesis: poetic diction generates an **event** of presence and a mode of **interiority** that engages **God** not as object but as addressing subject. Across these volumes, Ong’s Catholic sensibility affirms a **sacramental** thickness to language and an **incarnational** density to discourse, even as his descriptive apparatus remains accessible across confessions.

#### 6. Interlocutors and comparative frames
Ong’s conversation with **McLuhan** is a signature feature of his oeuvre. Where **McLuhan** privileges sweeping media aphorisms, Ong offers the archive: the careful catalog of **orality’s psychodynamics**, the documentation of **Ramist** textbooks, the close reading of **catechisms** and sermons. With **Harold Innis**, he shares the sense that media have **biases** toward time or space, but Ong’s **sacramental** emphasis departs from economic determinism. In respect to **Havelock** and **Goody**, Ong both appropriates and moderates claims about literacy’s cognitive revolution, repeatedly insisting that **oral** and **literate** modes persist in mixture and that **Christian** communities must steward both. Inside theology, he invites dialogue with **Augustine** on *verbum*, **Aquinas** on sign and sacrament, and modern hermeneutics such as **Gadamer** on **Tradition** and **Vorurteil**, while maintaining that **media ecology** adds a dimension often neglected by purely philosophical hermeneutics.

This comparative posture emerges as well in Ong’s histories of education. In mapping **Ramus** into **Protestant** schools and **Puritan** pulpit practice, Ong positions **Reformed** theology inside a broader **typographic** shift, connecting **systematic loci**, scholastic **method**, and printed **confessions** to a visual bias. Conversely, the **Jesuit** defense of **Ciceronian** rhetoric and **scholastic disputation** shows an alternative path that nonetheless shares **print** confidence. These cross-confessional analyses yield a neutral platform for theological conversation, but Ong’s insistence on the **presence of the Word** and the **sacramentality of sound** gives the work a metaphysical depth that resists simple sociology.

#### 7. Scripture, tradition, and proclamation under shifting media
A distinctive achievement of Ong’s project is the reframing of **Scripture**, **Tradition**, and **Magisterium** within the transitions from **primary orality** to **chirography** to **typography** and beyond. The Bible’s earliest strata belong to **oral** composition and performance; its editing and canonization belong to **manuscript** and **print** cultures; its reception now occurs through **electronic** platforms characterized by **secondary orality**. Theological claims about **inspiration**, **illumination**, **authority**, and **perspicuity** must, on Ong’s account, be articulated with attentiveness to these **media** conditions. A purely **propositional** model of Scripture’s authority risks reducing the **word** to information, whereas a purely **experiential** model risks dissolving content into performance. Ong’s thesis of the **word as event** seeks a middle path, honoring **liturgy** and **preaching** as privileged modes of Scripture’s self-presentation while affirming the gift of **print** for doctrinal clarity and catechetical durability.

This mediological insight has pastoral consequence. Homiletics that forget **sound’s** power to create **presence** become lectures; liturgies that disdain textual density become spectacle. Catechesis that worships **method** can forsake **dialogue**, while free-form testimony can lose **truth**. Ong’s analysis calls for a chastened, discerning catholicity of media within the church’s **mission**, stewarding **oral** and **literate** forms for the **evangel**. Such stewardship resists the despair and triumphalism common in technological discourse, seeking instead a theological prudence that recognizes how the **Word** never comes bare but always clothed in a **noetic economy**.

#### 8. Criticisms, clarifications, and limits
Critics have charged Ong with **technological determinism**, a romanticization of **orality**, and insufficient attention to **political economy** and **power**. Ong anticipates these objections by describing media effects as **probabilistic** and cultural rather than mechanistic, by acknowledging **violence** and **agonism** within oral worlds, and by tracing institutional entanglements across **church** and **school**. Yet the criticisms draw blood. His dense attention to **sensorium** can eclipse specific theological controversies, and his Catholic **sacramental** intuition, while fruitful, is rarely unpacked dogmatically in terms of **Trinity**, **Christology**, or **ecclesiology**. The work’s strength is its breadth and descriptive nuance; its weakness is the limited constructive **doctrinal** development that would anchor the phenomenology within a determined **dogmatic** horizon.

Nevertheless, the explanatory power of Ong’s lead ideas remains striking. The linkage of **Ramist method** to **Puritan** homiletics persists as a paradigm case of how **typography** reorganizes ecclesial practice. The distinctions between **primary**, **residual**, and **secondary orality** still govern discussions of **digital media**, **podcasting**, and **streamed liturgies**. And the governing intuition of **word as event** continues to inspire theological accounts of **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **catechesis**. The limits are real, but the frame is generous: Ong invites exegetes, dogmaticians, and pastors to reckon with the fact that the **gospel** does not hover outside its modes of communication.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Ong’s account of **orality** and the **sacramental presence of sound** offers a salutary reminder of the primacy of **preaching** within the **means of grace** and the corporate, dialogical nature of **covenant** address. His genealogy of **Ramus** sharpens our grasp of how **print culture** helped form **Puritan** and **Reformed** pedagogies and the clarity of **loci** in **systematic theology**. The description of **secondary orality** can aid churches committed to **sola Scriptura** in navigating electronic media without capitulating to entertainment. Yet tensions remain. First, Ong’s metaphysics of the **word as event** risks subordinating **propositional truth** to phenomenology, whereas classical Reformed theology insists that **special revelation** is both event and authoritative **verbum** whose cognitive content is irreducible. Second, the **sacramental** accent of sound can blur the distinction of **word and sacrament** as distinct ordinances; Reformed theology can appropriate Ong’s insight by treating **preaching** as God’s living **speech-act** without collapsing it into sacrament, drawing on a covenantal **speech-act** account of **inspiration** and **illumination**. Third, while Ong correlates doctrinal formations with **media**, a Reformed theology of **providence** and **antithesis** maintains that the **Spirit** sovereignly binds the **Word** to faith across media, so that technological conditions neither guarantee nor preclude fidelity. A constructive alternative is to take Ong’s **media ecology** as a prudential wisdom tradition within a high view of **Scripture’s sufficiency**, integrating his warnings about **visualism** and his commendations of **sound** with a robust theology of **covenant communication**, **organic inspiration** and the church’s disciplined stewardship of **forms** in service of the gospel’s norming **content**.
