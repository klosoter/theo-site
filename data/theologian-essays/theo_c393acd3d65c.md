### ESSAY
Jens Schröter, born 1961, stands among the most influential contemporary German New Testament scholars shaping the international discussion on the **historical Jesus**, the **origin of early Christology**, and the **formation of the New Testament canon**. Formed within the postwar trajectory of **historical-critical** exegesis that moved from **Formgeschichte** and **Redaktionsgeschichte** through hermeneutical self-reflection, his work revisits classic problems raised by **Martin Kähler** and **Rudolf Bultmann** while rearticulating them under late modern theories of **Wirkungsgeschichte** and **soziales Gedächtnis**. Schröter is best known in English for the essay collection **From Jesus to the New Testament** 2013, which distills two decades of research on **early Christian theology** and **canon formation**, and for **Jesus of Nazareth: Jew from Galilee, Savior of the World** 2014, a synthetic presentation of Jesus research that foregrounds **Easter faith** and the communal processes by which the figure of Jesus was remembered and confessed as **Kyrios**. Set within the institutional context of German Protestant faculties and their dual service to church and university, he positions critical investigation as a theological practice oriented to the **Geltungsanspruch** of biblical texts.

At the level of method, Schröter advances a chastened **historical-critical realism** that resists both positivist reconstructions and skeptical agnosticism. Two claims anchor his stance. First, early Christian texts possess **referentiality**: they are not sealed linguistic worlds but point to events in the past, above all to the life and death of Jesus and to the **Ostererfahrung** of the earliest witnesses. Second, because the past is available only in mediated form, the historian must track the dynamics of **memory** and **tradition**. Drawing on **Maurice Halbwachs** and **Jan Assmann**, he argues that **soziales Gedächtnis** accounts for both stability and transformation as Jesus traditions circulate, are framed by communal needs, and crystallize into narrative **Gospels**. In this way, classic **Formgeschichte** and **Redaktionsgeschichte** are not discarded but reframed: forms and redactions are social acts of remembering that bind **Geschichte** and **Glaube**. Here Schröter is in explicit conversation with **Ernst Käsemann** on the continuity between the **historical Jesus** and the **kerygma**, pushing beyond **Bultmanns Entmythologisierung** by granting a thicker historical referent to the *Verkündigung* without collapsing theology into brute fact.

The programmatic essays collected in **Von Jesus zum Neuen Testament** 2007, translated as **From Jesus to the New Testament** 2013, articulate the methodological hinge: how the figure of Jesus becomes the content of early **theology** and the seed of **canon**. Schröter insists that the New Testament arises from a double movement. There is retrospective interpretation in light of **Easter**, which confers a **Kyrios-Christologie** on the crucified. There is also prospective institutionalization as communities textualize their memory in correspondence, narrative, and homily, gradually accrediting certain writings as bearing enduring **Geltungsanspruch**. The canonical process is not an external imposition upon texts; it is the *Wirkungsgeschichte* of Jesus’ significance taking normative form. In these essays he repeatedly engages **E. P. Sanders** on Jesus’ Jewishness, **John P. Meier** on criteria of authenticity, and **James D. G. Dunn** on remembering Jesus, positioning his approach between Sanders’s covenantal nomism and Dunn’s **memory** paradigm, while critically addressing **Richard Bauckham** on eyewitness claims.

In his synthetic monograph **Jesus von Nazaret: Jude aus Galiläa – Retter der Welt** 2006, Eng. **Jesus of Nazareth** 2014, Schröter reconstructs Jesus as a Galilean Jew announcing the **basileia tou theou**, gathering a renewal movement marked by table fellowship, healings, and a prophetic critique culminating in the symbolic action at the **Temple**. The crucifixion under **Pontius Pilate** emerges as a historically secure datum that demands theological interpretation. Schröter evaluates classic criteria such as **multiple attestation** and **dissimilarity** yet stresses they function properly only within a broader model of **tradition history** and **memory**. The result is neither a heroic life of Jesus nor a retreat to purely kerygmatic statements; it is a thick description where Jesus’ praxis and parables underwrite post-Easter claims. Here he disputes both radical minimalism and maximalist harmonization, offering instead a historically plausible Jesus whose **eschatological** horizon, martyr-like obedience, and experience of divine authority are recognized through the communal **Ostererfahrung** that confesses him as **Kyrios**.

Regarding the genesis of **Christology**, Schröter refuses a sharp dichotomy between a low, purely functional Christology of the earliest strata and a later ontological ascent. He argues for an early **Kyrios-Christologie** produced as the communities reread Israel’s Scriptures, reconfigure monotheistic praxis, and interpret visions and meals as encounters with the risen Lord. Titles such as **Christos**, **Kyrios**, **huios tou theou**, and the **Son of Man** complex accrue in a process that is swift but layered. Schröter reads **Philippians 2** and **Romans 1** as witness to an exaltation logic in which **resurrection** and enthronement provoke retroactive contemplation of Jesus’ identity, while allowing that preexistence language soon follows within a Jewish symbolic universe. Against a simple **evolutionary** model, he underscores a hermeneutical spiral: **Easter** opens Scripture, Scripture shapes confession, confession stabilizes narrative, and narrative feeds back into communal **Wirkungsgeschichte**. Interlocutors here include **Larry Hurtado** on devotional practice, **Richard Bauckham** on divine identity, and **Dale C. Allison** on apocalyptic imagination; Schröter appreciates their emphasis on early intensity yet insists that communal **memory** and textual production are the engines that carry high claims into shared normativity.

On the **Gospels**, Schröter works within the mainstream **Zweiquellentheorie** with **Markan priority** and **Q** as a sayings source, yet he integrates this compositional model with a hermeneutic of **memory** and reception. **Mark** is read as the first continuous narrative forging a **Passion-centered** portrait where the cross interprets Jesus’ life, a move that profoundly shapes subsequent **Wirkungsgeschichte**. **Matthew** and **Luke** are then construed as redactional acts of communal remembrance, suturing additional traditions and Scripture allusions into Mark’s plot, while **John** represents a more reflective, symbolic remembering that articulates a cosmic **Logos-Christology**. Schröter’s essays track how variant pericope sequences, christological titles, and narrative emphases reflect both the pressure of local pastoral realities and the broader drive toward **canon**. He also probes apocryphal materials such as the **Gospel of Thomas** as instances of alternative remembering, sharpening what is distinctive about the canonical four without collapsing them into a harmonized account.

Canon formation, for Schröter, is neither accidental nor merely ecclesiastical fiat but the historical stabilization of the **Geltungsanspruch** embodied in certain writings. He follows the emergence of a Pauline letter corpus, the formation of Gospel collections, and the convergence toward a fourfold Gospel as a network of practices that conferred authority through use, liturgical reading, and rule of faith. The **Marcion** crisis and the reflections of **Irenaeus** are interpreted as moments when the implicit normativity of these texts is made explicit and contested. Schröter highlights regional variation and the protracted status of texts like **Hebrews**, **Revelation**, and **James**, yet he insists the drive toward a **New Testament** is intrinsic to the early Christian project because the communities sought to preserve and regulate their **memory** of Jesus and the apostles. This yields a canon that is at once the product of historical negotiation and the bearer of a theological claim to normativity, a claim that must be critically received and interpreted.

A constant thread in Schröter’s oeuvre is the calibrated relation of **history and theology**. He rejects both a purely descriptive antiquarianism and a dogmatic closure that would short-circuit historical inquiry. Instead, he promotes a dialectic where **critical historiography** serves theology by clarifying the processes by which **Jesus** became the content of **early Christian doctrine** and by tracing how **texts** came to claim **authority**. He learned from **Gadamer** that understanding is tradition-laden, so he performs exegesis conscious of its own **Wirkungsgeschichte**, even as he presses for intersubjectively arguable claims about the past. This methodological humility has ecclesial consequences: faith does not rest on a reconstructed archive but engages the **canonical witnesses** as historically mediated testimony through which the risen **Kyrios** continues to address the church.

Schröter’s dialogue with predecessors and contemporaries is wide and deliberate. With **Kähler**, he repudiates the fantasy of a neutral life of Jesus while refusing to sever the **Christ of faith** from the **Jesus of history**. With **Bultmann**, he gratefully uses **Formgeschichte** and acknowledges existential interpretation, yet he resists **Entmythologisierung** when it detaches proclamation from historical reference. With **Käsemann**, he maintains the continuity of Jesus and kerygma but tightens the account through **memory** studies. With **Sanders** and **Meier**, he shares a commitment to Second Temple Jewish context and methodological clarity, though he distrusts the mechanical application of authenticity criteria. With **Dunn** and **Allison**, he explores the plausibility of **memory** as explanatory matrix, sharpening the case by integrating **canon** and **Wirkungsgeschichte**. Against **Bauckham**, he tempers eyewitness paradigms by insisting on the communal, not merely individual, character of remembering and textualization. The resultant posture is historically cautious, theologically engaged, and programmatically oriented to the **New Testament** as the church’s normative textual memory of Jesus.

In sum, Schröter’s distinctive contribution is a comprehensive vision in which **Ostererfahrung**, **soziales Gedächtnis**, and **Kanonbildung** belong together. The crucified and risen **Kyrios** is encountered in communal experiences that catalyze rereadings of Israel’s Scriptures, generate titles and practices of devotion, and crystallize in Gospel narrative and apostolic correspondence. As these texts circulate, are collected, and defended, they consolidate a **canon** whose authority is the historical form of the church’s confession. The scholar’s task is to account for this genesis with historical rigor and theological sensitivity, acknowledging both the **referentiality of texts** to the past and the constitutive role of their **Wirkungsgeschichte** in shaping Christian identity.

From a Reformed and WTS evaluation, Schröter’s strengths are considerable: a robust insistence on the **referentiality** of the biblical witnesses, an integrated account of **history and theology**, and a salutary resistance to both skepticism and fundamentalist harmonization. Yet principial tensions remain. First, his model of **Kanonbildung** as negotiated normativity tends to relativize the church’s confession of **inspiration** and the providential closure of the canon, whereas classical Reformed doctrine grounds the canon’s authority in the **self-attestation of Scripture** and the **internal testimony of the Spirit**, not in communal recognition alone. Second, his developmental **Kyrios-Christologie**, though early and intense, can mute the New Testament’s witness to a from-the-beginning **high Christology** in which the resurrection vindicates rather than generates Jesus’ divine identity. Third, the centering of **soziales Gedächtnis** may underplay the covenantal unity of **redemptive history**, where the Spirit ensures not only the church’s remembrance but the truthful inscription of revelation in Scripture. A Reformed alternative would retain Schröter’s historical attentiveness and his unity of **Jesus and kerygma**, while grounding memory and canon in the triune economy of **revelation**, affirming a providentially guided **organic inspiration** that secures the trustworthiness of the witnesses and the ontological finality of the **resurrection** as the decisive act of God in history.
