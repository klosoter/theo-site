### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Derek C. Schuurman emerges as a leading voice in a distinctively **Reformational theology of technology**, forged within late-modern **digital culture** and nurtured by the **Kuyperian** conviction that Christ claims every square inch. Trained as an **engineer and computer scientist** and teaching in **Christian liberal arts** settings, he addresses the theological stakes of **software, networks, and automation** not as a visiting ethicist but as a practitioner-theologian. His formation bears the imprint of **Abraham Kuyper’s** **sphere sovereignty**, **Al Wolters’s** **structure and direction**, and **Herman Dooyeweerd’s** analysis of **creational modal aspects**, all situated in the biblical drama of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**. The early 2000s rise of **ubiquitous computing**, **social media**, and **AI** pressed him to craft a coherent **Christian worldview** for engineers who would build the systems that now shape attention, labor, and public life. Against both **technological determinism** and bare **instrumentalism**, he insists that technology is neither fate nor neutral tool but a **cultural unfolding** of creation ordered to **shalom** under **Christ’s lordship**.

At the level of method, Schuurman practices a **Reformational critical realism**: the world is a given **creational order** with real **norms**, yet all human knowing and making are **directionally** bent by **idolatry** or reoriented in **Christ**. The epistemic center remains **Scripture** as **norma normans**, while **general revelation** yields insight into **structures** and **modal aspects** that guide **design**. He reads **Genesis 1–2** as charter for the **cultural mandate**, **Exodus 20** as limits through **Sabbath** and **truth-telling**, and **Proverbs** as craft wisdom for **engineering judgment**. His theological posture is confessional yet public: draw on **Reformed orthodoxy** to contest the gods of **efficiency**, **speed**, and **surveillance**, while articulating humane norms intelligible in broader **technology ethics** discourse with **Albert Borgmann** and **Langdon Winner**.

#### 2. Shaping a Digital World: thesis and architecture
The flagship work, **Shaping a Digital World: Faith, Culture and Computer Technology (2013)**, crystalizes Schuurman’s constructive project. Its thesis is Kuyperian yet chastened by **Ellul**: computing belongs within the **goodness of creation** as a venue for obedient **cultural development**, but its **direction** can be bent toward **idolatry** and **deformation**. The book opens with **imago Dei** as vocational grounding for **making**, arguing that human creative labor reflects God’s **forming and filling** of the world and that **software** is a site where such image-bearing takes responsible, communal shape. It then introduces **structure and direction** as the analytical hinge: the **structure** of digital artifacts involves lawful coherence across **Dooyeweerdian aspects** like the **analytical**, **formative**, **lingual**, **social**, **economic**, and **juridical**, while **direction** speaks to orientation toward **shalom** or toward rival **liturgies** of domination.

The middle chapters of **Shaping a Digital World** confront **technological determinism**, rejecting both utopian and dystopian monisms by retrieving **sphere sovereignty**. The household, church, civil polity, market, and academy bear distinct **teloi** that must not be collapsed into technical or economic control. He appropriates **Ellul’s** warning about the **autonomy of technique** while resisting Ellul’s despair, aligning more with **Borgmann’s** call to resist the **device paradigm** through focal practices. The book’s constructive punch arrives in his account of **Sabbath and limits**: computing disciplines must be ordered by rhythms of **rest**, **embodied presence**, and **truthful speech** that resist **attention capture** and **disembodiment** online. In a chapter on **vocation**, he presses engineers toward **proximate justice** in design, borrowing the term from **Nicholas Wolterstorff** while grounding it in **Leviticus** and **Deuteronomy** concerns for the vulnerable, translated into **accessibility**, **privacy**, and **usability** norms in computing.

#### 3. Normative design and the Field Guide
With **A Christian Field Guide to Technology for Engineers and Designers (2022)**, Schuurman moves from worldview scaffolding to concrete **design heuristics**. The **Field Guide** operationalizes **creational norms** across the design life cycle: problem framing, requirements, prototyping, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance. The controlling claim is that design always carries **moral weight** because artifacts shape **practices**, **habitus**, and **possibilities** for neighbor-love. He articulates a cluster of **norms**: **transparency** against opaque black-boxing; **privacy** as respect for personhood; **accessibility** as justice for those with disabilities; **safety and non-maleficence** echoing a Reformed reading of the **sixth commandment**; **stewardship and sustainability** to curb **e-waste** and ecological harm; **inclusivity and fairness** in the face of **algorithmic bias**; and **accountability** via traceable **data governance**. Case sketches in the **Field Guide** demonstrate how **sphere sovereignty** informs institutional design: do not let market interests swallow educational integrity, nor let state surveillance overtake familial privacy in school technologies.

Crucially, Schuurman embeds these norms within **Dooyeweerd’s modal aspects** to discipline reductionism. A design that maximizes **economic** efficiency while violating the **juridical** aspect of justice or the **ethical** aspect of love is directionally disordered. He thereby resists both **cost-benefit** utilitarianism and thin **duty** ethics, proposing a **normative pluralism** tuned to the irreducible richness of God’s world. The **Field Guide** also interlaces spiritual disciplines with design practice: **prayer**, **communal discernment**, and **Sabbath** as formative constraints that recalibrate engineers away from 24/7 **deployment** culture. Throughout, he keeps **Christ’s lordship** as the decisive horizon and **new creation** as eschatological hope that legitimates patient pursuit of **proximate goods** amid systemic fracture.

#### 4. AI, personhood, and the limits of computation
In essays and talks adjacent to **Shaping a Digital World**, Schuurman tackles **artificial intelligence** and **robotics** with theological clarity. He rejects **AI personhood** on the grounds of **imago Dei**: personhood is not a computational emergent but a divine vocation grounded in **covenantal** relation to God and neighbor. Against **transhumanism** represented by **Nick Bostrom**, he argues that the **humanum** cannot be surpassed by optimization because it is teleologically defined by **love of God and neighbor**, not by **processing power** or **longevity**. He appreciates **Kate Crawford’s** critique of **AI’s** extractive infrastructures and adds a **Reformed** account of **idolatry**: when data and prediction become quasi-omniscient, they mimic **divine attributes** and demand liturgical submission through surveillance.

At the same time, Schuurman refuses to romanticize ignorance. He calls for **explainable AI**, **auditable datasets**, and **algorithmic impact assessments** to secure **justice** for the marginalized. He highlights the **noetic effects of sin** in model assumptions and labels, mandating humility before biased training corpora and false inferences. Echoing the **ninth commandment**, he frames misinformation and deepfakes as violations of **truth-telling** that corrode trust. His design counsel prioritizes **aligning reward functions** not simply with user engagement but with **neighbor-regarding goods**, measured through **juridical** and **ethical** aspects rather than raw **economic** or **analytical** metrics. The boundary of the computational remains firm: while tools can augment cognition, they cannot confer **pistical** faith or **ethical** love, which are Spirit-given.

#### 5. Liturgies, discipleship, and education for engineers
Schuurman integrates **James K. A. Smith’s** account of **cultural liturgies** to diagnose how digital systems enact rival **habitus**. Phones, feeds, and frictionless interfaces catechize users into **immanent frame** expectations of instantaneity and self-curation. He therefore commends **Sabbath**, **fasting from devices**, **embodied worship**, and **communal presence** as counter-liturgies that retrain attention. This is not pietistic add-on but integral **engineering pedagogy**: students must learn to design while resisting the captivities these systems impose. In Christian colleges, capstone **design studios** can embed teams in **service-learning** partnerships, translating **love of neighbor** into **accessibility** features, ethical **data governance**, and sustainable **life-cycle** planning.

His curricular proposals braid **computer science** with **biblical theology** and **Reformational philosophy**. Courses in **discrete structures** and **operating systems** sit alongside seminars on **technology and society**, reading **Ellul**, **Borgmann**, **Winner**, and **Postman** in conversation with **Kuyper** and **Dooyeweerd**. Assessment values not only functional correctness but also **directional obedience** to **creational norms**. Such pedagogy aims to form engineers who recognize that debugging code is tied to **sanctification** in the ordinary, that **truthful documentation** and **transparent APIs** are forms of neighbor-love, and that **limits** are gifts, not defects. The telos is engineers whose technical excellence and moral discernment are indivisible under **Christ’s lordship**.

#### 6. Church, public life, and governance of big tech
Beyond the academy, Schuurman speaks to the **church** about wise use of **digital media**. He honors the **catholic** insight that sacraments are irreducibly **embodied**, warning that streaming **worship** cannot become norm without attenuating gathered **koinonia**. He urges pastoral attention to **attention stewardship**, **catechesis** about online speech under the **ninth commandment**, and a churchly witness against **pornography** and **gambling** economies embedded in platforms. For public life, his **sphere sovereignty** lens resists conflating governance with either unregulated corporate will or totalizing state control. He calls for **antitrust enforcement**, **data privacy law**, **right-to-repair**, and procurement standards that privilege **accessibility** and **security**. Such policies are not baptizing technocracy but protecting the differentiated **spheres** within which human flourishing occurs.

In environmental terms, Schuurman ties **creation care** to digital infrastructures. He highlights the ecological cost of **data centers**, **rare-earth mining**, and **e-waste**, pressing for **sustainability standards**, circular design, and transparent supply chains. The **economic** aspect must be bent toward the **juridical** and **ethical** aspects so that benefits do not fall on the privileged while costs accrue to the poor. In labor policy, he counsels that **automation** must be yoked to **vocational retraining** and just transitions, resisting the idol of productivity that treats workers as disposable. The public, churchly, and personal converge in a single **discipleship**: deliberate practice of love and justice in the making and governance of tools.

#### 7. Dialogue partners and distinctive positioning
Schuurman’s distinctiveness emerges in triangulation with **Ellul**, **Borgmann**, and **Winner**. He absorbs **Ellul’s** prophetic exposure of **technique’s** totalizing drift but refuses resignation, arguing that **common grace** sustains the possibility of **proximate justice** in design. He echoes **Borgmann’s** critique of the **device paradigm**, translating focal practices into design criteria that prize **presence**, **place**, and **community** over frictionless consumption. With **Winner**, he insists that artifacts have **politics**, or what he reframes as **direction**: code carries normative load that configures power relations. Yet he supplements these secular analyses by grounding normativity in **creational order** and **eschatological hope** rather than procedural consensus or nostalgia. His appropriation of **Dooyeweerd’s modal aspects** distinguishes his approach among Christian technologists, offering a thick, non-reductive grammar for evaluating digital systems.

His engagement with secular **AI ethics** names **Nick Bostrom**, **Stuart Russell**, and **Kate Crawford** while reframing their concerns theologically. Where **Bostrom** imagines **superintelligence** as risk calculus, Schuurman treats it as an occasion to confess **creaturely limits** and to expose **idolatry** in fantasies of control. Where **Crawford** unmasks the political economy of data extraction, he adds **covenantal** language about truth, trust, and neighbor-love. Among Christians writing on technology, he stands between **instrumentalist** optimism and **neo-Anabaptist** separatism, maintaining **Christ’s lordship over culture** while foregrounding **Sabbath** and **limits** as countersign to technophilia. The result is a patient, norm-governed vision credible to practitioners and responsive to the church’s pastoral needs.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and eschatological horizon
Doctrinally, Schuurman’s work interlaces **creation theology**, **anthropology**, and **ethics**. His **imago Dei** is functional and relational without dissolving into mere capacity talk; he resists reducing image-bearing to **rationality** or **creativity** alone, anchoring it in **covenantal vocation** under God. His **hamartiology** marks the **noetic effects of sin** as deep and structural, evident in biased datasets, extractive platforms, and coercive interfaces. Redemption is not a sacralization of gadgets but **directional reorientation** toward **shalom** through the Spirit, seen in designs that tell the truth, elevate the vulnerable, and respect bodies. He reads **ecclesiology** as the training ground for technological discernment, where **Word and sacrament** form a people resistant to the empire of screens. His **eschatology** refuses both the fantasy of a redeemed smartphone in the New Jerusalem and the despair that consigns technology to Babylon; instead, he holds to **resurrection** and **new creation** as charter for non-naive hope in **proximate justice** now.

The unity of his synthesis is visible in his use of **structure and direction** as a master key. The **structure** of technology is good, a gift latent in creation that human making can unfold across **modal aspects**; the **direction** of technology must be discerned and reformed through **Scripture**, **prayer**, and **communal wisdom**. The practical outworking is a thick account of **normative design** that can critique **surveillance capitalism**, specify **privacy-by-design**, mandate **accessibility**, and commend **Sabbath** as productive constraint. The theological cadence is Reformed: **soli Deo gloria** in the studio, **sola Scriptura** governing norms, and **solus Christus** naming the Lord of algorithms. In the present flux of **AI**, **VR**, and **platform governance**, his approach equips engineers and pastors to ask not only what can be built, but what ought to be built before God and neighbor.

In a Reformed and Westminster evaluation, Schuurman’s strengths are substantial: clear affirmation of **Christ’s lordship over all of life**, sober attention to the **antithesis** and **noetic effects of sin**, and concrete application of the **moral law** to design. Tensions arise where **creational norms** and **Dooyeweerdian modal aspects** risk outpacing explicit **exegesis**. A **Van Tilian** critique would warn against treating **general revelation** and philosophical **modal analysis** as sufficiently determinate apart from **special revelation**, urging fuller derivation of norms from **covenant law**, **wisdom literature**, and the **Two Kingdoms** distinction or, alternately, a more confessional **sphere sovereignty** guarded by churchly **means of grace**. Likewise, a Westminster caution would press his cultural optimism to reckon with **total depravity** in institutional structures and to prioritize the **church’s pilgrim identity** over comprehensive cultural programs. Still, within classical Reformed orthodoxy, his basic alternatives are available: pair his **structure-direction** grammar with a stricter **Van Tilian** epistemology, tether design norms more tightly to the **Decalogue**, and let **Sabbath and Word** govern both pace and purpose of innovation. Such adjustments refine rather than overturn his core thesis, leaving a robust path for faithful making amid the digital age.
