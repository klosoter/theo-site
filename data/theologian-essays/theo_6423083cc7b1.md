### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The career of **Mark S. Kinzer** unfolds within the post-1960s rise of **Messianic Judaism**, a movement seeking Jewish faithfulness to **Yeshua the Messiah** without relinquishing **Israel’s covenantal identity**. Converted in the early 1970s amid evangelical ferment and the Jesus movement, and later serving as a rabbinic leader within Messianic congregations, Kinzer came of age theologically under the shadow of the Shoah and the promise of **Nostra Aetate** 1965. These two poles generated his enduring thesis: the **election of Israel** is irrevocable, and the **Church** discovers its true identity only as it lives in communion with Israel. To this end he founded Hashivenu in 1997 and has taught for the **Messianic Jewish Theological Institute**, building a theological cadre committed to **covenant fidelity** and rigorous biblical-theological reflection. The intellectual context includes the **New Perspective on Paul**, the retrieval of **Jewish roots of Christianity**, and the ecumenical turn to **communion ecclesiology**, all of which Kinzer transposes into a distinctly **post-supersessionist** Messianic register.

Kinzer’s method binds **theological exegesis** to ecclesial judgment. He reads **Torah, Prophets, and Apostolic Writings** canonically, privileging the narrative unity of **Israel and the nations** in the Messiah. Drawing on **R. Kendall Soulen’s** typology of economic, punitive, and structural **supersessionism**, Kinzer argues that traditional Christian theology severed the **biblical economy** from **Israel’s concrete life**. He appropriates **communion ecclesiology** from Catholic ressourcement to propose a bilateral structure of the **one people of God**, retrieving the early Church’s memory of an *ekklesia ex circumcisione* alongside an *ekklesia ex gentibus*. His constructive work engages **rabbinic halakhic** reasoning to specify Jewish norms of life in Christ, treats **Acts 15** as enduring **Apostolic Decree** for Gentile believers, and reads **Romans 9 to 11** as the central canonical witness to the abiding **mystery of Israel**. The result is a theological stance that is evangelical in its confession of **Jesus as Israel’s Messiah**, catholic in its **communion** categories, and Jewish in its insistence on **Torah-shaped covenant fidelity** for Jews who follow the Messiah.

#### 2. Postmissionary Messianic Judaism and bilateral ecclesiology
Kinzer’s foundational book, **Postmissionary Messianic Judaism: Redefining Christian Engagement with the Jewish People** 2005, sets forth his program. The term **postmissionary** does not deny the gospel’s universality, but it relocates the Church’s approach to Jews from targeted proselytism to **covenantal witness** and **ecclesial communion**. The conceptual center is **bilateral ecclesiology**: within the one Messiah, God orders two visible, interdependent communions, a Jewish **ecclesia ex circumcisione** and a Gentile **ecclesia ex gentibus**. The former maintains **Torah observance** as a sign of Israel’s **irrevocable calling** Romans 11.29, while the latter lives free from the yoke of Jewish halakhic obligation, guided by the **Acts 15 Apostolic Decree** as a minimal rule and by the **law of Christ** Galatians 6.2. Kinzer reads **Matthew 5.17 to 19** as affirming the ongoing validity of **Torah** for Jews in Messiah and interprets the **dividing wall** of Ephesians 2 as hostility rooted in the misuse of boundary markers, not as the abrogation of Israel’s covenantal disciplines.

The ecclesial and missional consequences of **Postmissionary Messianic Judaism** are far-reaching. Jewish Yeshua-believers should remain in solidarity with **klal Yisrael**, practicing **circumcision, Shabbat, and kashrut** as acts of **covenant fidelity** and as sacramental signs of Israel’s vocation among the nations. Gentile churches should recognize both the **ongoing election of Israel** and the distinct **Jewish ecclesial form** within the body of Christ, thereby repudiating **supersessionism**. Evangelism toward Jews becomes a mode of humble **witness and dialogue** that seeks Jewish communion in Messiah while honoring God’s own governance of Israel’s historical life. Against assimilationist pressures, Kinzer sketches a normative **Messianic Jewish halakhah** capable of shaping congregational life, liturgy, and catechesis, thus forestalling both **Hebrew Roots** syncretism and thin evangelical minimalism. The **Romans 11 olive tree** governs the whole account: Gentiles are grafted in among the natural branches and thus share Israel’s root, while Israel remains the living bearer of the promises whose corporate destiny is bound up with the Messiah’s fullness.

Kinzer’s collected essays in **Israel’s Messiah and the People of God: A Vision for Messianic Jewish Covenant Fidelity** 2011 extend these themes. There he clarifies the grammar of **covenant fidelity** for Jews in Christ, defends the ecclesial legitimacy of **Messianic synagogues**, and treats the **sacraments** as compatible with Jewish liturgical life. He engages **N. T. Wright’s** eschatological reading of Paul and **Richard Hays’s** figural hermeneutics to secure a New Testament that neither erases Israel nor marginalizes **Torah**. The leitmotif remains constant: only when the **Gentile Church** honors a visible **Jewish ecclesial life** can the apostolic vision of a reconciled **one new humanity** Ephesians 2 be realized without subsuming Israel into the nations.

#### 3. Post-supersessionist catholicity and the mystery of Israel
With **Searching Her Own Mystery: Nostra Aetate, the Jewish People, and the Identity of the Church** 2015, Kinzer turns to the theological potential of **Roman Catholic** teaching for **post-supersessionist** ecclesiology. Reading **Nostra Aetate 4**, **Lumen Gentium**, and subsequent magisterial documents, he argues that the Church must interpret herself as a community that lives within, not over against, **Israel’s covenant**. The Church discovers her identity by contemplating the **mystery of Israel**, the people to whom belong the adoption, the covenants, and the promises Romans 9.4 to 5. Kinzer highlights Pope **John Paul II’s** language about the Jewish people as the Church’s elder brothers and explores **Benedict XVI’s** insistence on the irrevocability of God’s gifts to Israel. He interprets the 2015 document of the **Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews**, The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable, as tacitly affirming a **non-proselytizing** stance toward Jews in light of God’s covenantal faithfulness.

The fruit of this engagement is Kinzer’s ecclesial proposal of a **communion of communions**. The **Jewish ecclesia** and the **Gentile ecclesia** stand in sacramental relation within the one body of the Messiah, mirroring the **twofold call** given in Scripture. He invokes **Michael Wyschogrod’s** account of divine **electing love** for Israel to undergird the concrete particularity of this ecclesial design. He also appropriates **John Howard Yoder’s** thesis in The Jewish-Christian Schism Revisited that the early rupture between synagogue and church was a deviation from the apostolic pattern. Kinzer’s post-supersessionist catholicity thereby offers an account of **Christian identity** that neither dissolves Israel into typological shadows nor embraces a **dual-covenant** pluralism. Rather, Christians confess the one **mediator**, Jesus the Messiah, while recognizing that this one mediation orders a differentiated yet united **people of God**.

#### 4. Jerusalem, the land, and the risen Messiah
In **Jerusalem Crucified, Jerusalem Risen: The Resurrected Messiah, the Jewish People, and the Land of Promise** 2018, Kinzer addresses a crux of Christian theology: the status of **Jerusalem and the land** in light of **resurrection** and **Pentecost**. Against a long tradition of spiritualizing exegesis, he argues that the New Testament, especially **Luke-Acts** and **Matthew**, narrates the crucifixion and resurrection of **Jerusalem** in and through the death and rising of **Jesus**, thereby transfiguring but not erasing the **land promise**. Jerusalem remains the symbolic and eschatological center from which **Torah and gospel** go forth to the nations, and the **temple** finds a complex continuation in both the Messiah’s body and Israel’s ongoing sacred geography. He reads **Acts 1 to 3** as sustaining hope for Israel’s corporate restoration and **Acts 15** as legal-rhetorical provision for Gentiles without abolishing Jewish covenantal discipline. This yields a theology of **place** in which the **people of Israel**, the **land**, and the **Messiah** are mutually implicating realities within God’s enduring purpose.

Kinzer’s land theology is ecclesially consequential. The **Gentile Church** should not contest the ongoing theological significance of **Jerusalem** to Jewish life in Messiah, nor should it construe the Church’s catholicity as a negation of **particular place**. Instead, catholicity is richer when the **Jewish ecclesia** lives its vocation in solidarity with Jerusalem while the **Gentile ecclesia** receives that witness as a gift. Kinzer resists political reductionism and confines his claims to **biblical-theological** affirmation of the land’s continued role in the drama of **salvation history**. The **resurrection** thus confirms rather than cancels the spatial dimension of Israel’s calling, integrating **eschatology** and **geography** within a single **covenantal** horizon.

#### 5. Exegetical architecture: Romans 11, Acts 15, Galatians, Ephesians
The exegetical architecture of Kinzer’s project rests on three pillars. First, **Romans 11 olive tree** supplies the ontology of the people of God. Israel as root and natural branches endures, the **Gentiles** are grafted in among them, and the mystery of the **fullness of Israel** remains future-oriented and God-governed. Second, **Acts 15 Apostolic Decree** provides the legal framework for unity-in-difference: Gentiles are not to be circumcised or bound to **Torah**, but they are to adhere to minimal constraints drawn from **Leviticus 17 to 18**, a kind of *Noachide* code, thereby enabling table fellowship with **Jews** who keep **kashrut**. Third, **Galatians** and **Ephesians 2** are read as polemics against imposing **Jewish identity markers** on Gentiles or using **Torah** to exclude the nations, not as denials of continued **Torah observance** for Jews in Christ. In this frame **Romans 10.4**, Christ as the telos of the law, signifies goal and consummation rather than termination, consistent with **Matthew 5** where not one iota passes away.

Kinzer’s reading also draws from **Richard Hays** on figural coherence, deploying **typology** that preserves rather than evacuates **Israel’s literal sense**. He disputes **supersessionist** hermeneutics that universalize Israel into abstract churchliness and challenges apocalyptic readings that sever **continuity** between covenants. The upshot is a textured **canonical theology** where the **Church** learns her self-understanding by contemplating Israel’s story as ongoing, not closed, and where **Messianic Judaism** emerges as the ecclesial space in which that contemplative learning bears communal fruit.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and internal differentiations
Kinzer’s constructive trajectory intersects multiple debates. He draws heavily on **Michael Wyschogrod’s** thesis in The Body of Faith that God’s election adheres to the **seed of Abraham** in their bodily life, but he binds that election indissolubly to **Jesus the Messiah**. He welcomes **R. Kendall Soulen’s** critique of **structural supersessionism** and advances it by supplying an ecclesial design. He appropriates **John Howard Yoder’s** claim that the early **Jewish-Christian schism** was not apostolically necessary, proposing a new **reconciliation** in our time. He engages **N. T. Wright**, **E. P. Sanders**, and **James D. G. Dunn** on the **New Perspective**, affirming covenantal nomism while insisting on the Jewish particularity of **Torah** within the body of Christ. In dialogue with **Roman Catholic** theologians such as **Matthew Levering** and with official documents from the **Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews**, Kinzer explores the possibility of a post-supersessionist **catholicity** open to a visible **Jewish ecclesia**.

Critique and counter-critique have been sharp. Some evangelical critics charge that **postmissionary** proposals blunt the urgency of gospel **proclamation** to Jews or drift toward **dual-covenant** theology, an accusation Kinzer rejects by maintaining the **uniqueness of Christ**. Others within **Messianic Judaism** fear that embracing **catholic** categories compromises **evangelical** commitments, while some **Hebrew Roots** movements resist Kinzer’s insistence that Gentiles are not bound to **Torah**. From the Jewish side, many see **Messianic Judaism** as a Christian mission in disguise, and resist any ecclesial recognition. Kinzer navigates these cross-pressures by locating authority in the **Apostolic Scriptures**, articulating a **halakhic** program for Jews in Messiah, and developing a patient **ecumenical** strategy aimed at slow rebuilding of trust between **synagogue and church**.

#### 7. Doctrinal synthesis and pastoral horizon
The doctrinal synthesis that emerges across **Postmissionary Messianic Judaism**, **Israel’s Messiah and the People of God**, **Searching Her Own Mystery**, and **Jerusalem Crucified, Jerusalem Risen** is coherent and pastorally charged. The **Trinitarian** center remains implicit yet firm, with **Christology** configured as the story of **Israel’s Messiah** whose saving work incorporates the **nations** without obliterating Israel’s calling. **Ecclesiology** is the leading edge, structured bilaterally under the rubric of **communion**, while **soteriology** is narrated in covenantal terms of **fidelity**, **grace**, and **eschatological** fulfillment. **Sacramental** life, prayer, and **liturgy** are envisaged in Jewish and Gentile idioms that remain in communion, with **baptism** and the **Eucharist** finding expression within a **Messianic synagogue** as well as within Gentile churches. **Ethics** is ordered by **Torah** for Jews and by **apostolic** instruction for Gentiles, with mutual recognition and hospitality as the praxis of unity. Pastoral aims include the protection of Jewish Yeshua-believers from **assimilation**, the purging of **anti-Judaism** from Christian imagination, and the re-centering of **Jerusalem** and **Israel** in Christian prayer and hope.

In all of this Kinzer presents a theologically energized account of **mission** that favors **witness** over pressure, **dialogue** over polemic, and **ecclesial recognition** over replacement. He thinks with the Church but also with **Israel**, recovering a patristic memory of the **two apostolic tables** while addressing the realities of contemporary Jewish-Christian relations after the Shoah. The durability of his contribution lies less in novel exegesis than in the systemic staging of **post-supersessionist** insights within a practicable **ecclesial** design.

#### 8. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Kinzer’s project offers salutary corrections and difficult tensions. Positively, his critique of **supersessionism** clarifies the **covenantal** logic of **Romans 11**, his stress on the **irrevocable election** of Israel honors **divine faithfulness**, and his refusal to homogenize **Israel and the Church** challenges a-historical ecclesiologies. His canonical focus on **Acts 15** and the **olive tree** rightly restrains triumphalist narratives and invites fresh **missional humility**. Yet tensions emerge at key loci. First, **bilateral ecclesiology** tends toward a dual-structure people of God that strains the **one covenant of grace** articulated in the **Westminster Confession** 7, where diversities of administration do not produce parallel communions. The **Reformed** alternative reads Jew and Gentile as one visible **church**, with legitimate cultural and prudential differences, but without distinct normative **Torah** obligations for Jewish Christians. Second, Kinzer’s **Torah-normativity** for Jews in Christ rubs against **Galatians** and the **law-gospel** distinction, where **Christ as telos nomou** Romans 10.4 signals both goal and cessation of the law as covenantal administration for all in Christ, even if Jewish believers may retain customs as **adiaphora** under charity. Third, his **postmissionary** posture risks obscuring the apostolic necessity of explicit **faith in Christ** for salvation, since **Reformed** theology insists that the **Abrahamic** promise finds saving realization only in union with the risen **Messiah**. Finally, his affirmation of the **land’s** ongoing theological significance invites a typological recalibration: classic **Reformed** exegesis treats land and temple as shadows fulfilled in **Christ and the new creation**, not as enduring markers of ecclesial geography, even while affirming God’s providential care for the **Jewish people**. A constructive **Reformed** reception would thus embrace Kinzer’s anti-supersessionist resolve, retain the **Romans 11** hope for a future ingrafting of Israel, and commend robust **evangelism** marked by humility toward Jews, while locating Jewish distinctives under the freedom of **Christian liberty** and the unity of **one visible church** gathered by the **Word and Sacraments**.
