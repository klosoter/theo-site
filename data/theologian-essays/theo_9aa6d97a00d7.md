### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
David A. S. Fergusson, born 1956, is a **Scottish Reformed** theologian whose career has been formed within the **Church of Scotland** and the ancient Scottish universities. Teaching at **Aberdeen** in the 1990s, then **Edinburgh** from 2000, and since 2021 serving as **Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge**, he inhabits a nexus shaped by the **Scottish Enlightenment**, the **Kirk’s public vocation**, and the international renaissance of **systematic theology** after 1990. His ecclesial identity anchors his constructive work: ordained ministry in a national church gives his theology a **public orientation** that is neither ecclesially insular nor secularly privatized. This situates him between **Barth’s revelational theocentrism** and a renewed **Augustinian-Thomist realism**, learning from both while resisting the extremes of **fideism** and **rationalism**.

Fergusson’s methodological hallmark is a **polyphonic approach**. He describes theology as a disciplined conversation among **Scripture**, **creedal-traditional voices**, **philosophical reason**, and **scientific and civic knowledge**. The term polyphonic signals a refusal to isolate any single authority while preserving the primacy of **Trinitarian revelation** interpreted within **ecclesial tradition**. The result is a methodology of **retrieval and correction**: he retrieves **patristic and medieval insights** on **creation** and **providence**, corrects modern distortions with **Barthian** cautions about **revelation and grace**, and rearticulates doctrine in conversation with **ethics**, **politics**, and the **natural sciences**. This blend yields an epistemic stance of **modest realism**: Christian doctrine offers a truthful, though analogical, description of reality grounded in God’s **self-disclosure** and attested by the **church’s worship**.

#### 2. Early work: ethics, community, and liberalism
In **Community, Liberalism and Christian Ethics** (1998), Fergusson confronts the fault line between **modern liberal individualism** and **ecclesial conceptions of the common good**. Drawing on **Alasdair MacIntyre’s** critique of emotivism and **Charles Taylor’s** account of the modern self, he argues that Christian ethics requires **narrated participation** in practices that shape **virtue**, not merely the aggregation of preferences under **procedural justice**. Yet he does not jettison liberalism. Instead, he commends a chastened **political liberalism** that protects **civil society**, resists totalizing state power, and leaves space for **mediating institutions** such as the church. Here the constructive move is clarified by a doctrinal anchor: communities are ordered to **communio** because they reflect a **created teleology** under **providence**, not simply contract. Christian ethics therefore presupposes **creation’s intelligible order** and the **eschatological reserve** that prevents any earthly polity from becoming an idol.

This early phase sets his programmatic rhythm: classical doctrinal claims paired with practical public implications. The concern for **virtue**, **narrative identity**, and **civil society** shows how Fergusson joins **moral theology** to **dogmatics**, using **creation and providence** as the metaphysical frame within which ethical evaluation proceeds. The resulting ethic avoids both **theonomy** and **procedural neutrality**, arguing for **publicly accessible reasons** informed by **natural law** yet finally disciplined by **revelation**.

#### 3. Church, state, and civil society
In **Church, State and Civil Society** (2004), Fergusson addresses the **political theology** of an established but theologically reformed national church. He rejects both a sectarian **Radical Orthodoxy** and a naive **Erastianism**, contending that the church’s freedom is best secured when **civil society** is robust and the **state** is constitutionally limited. He invokes **Augustine’s two cities** and a prudential **two-kingdoms** grammar to resist sacralizing the nation while defending a **public role** for religious voices. Theologically, he grounds this in **providence and vocation**: God’s **common grace** orders the *saeculum* such that diverse institutions contribute to the **bonum commune**, while the church witnesses to the **kingdom of God** through word, sacrament, and service.

This account of **establishment** is neither strictly confessional nor merely cultural. Fergusson argues that national churches can serve **public theology** by sustaining moral discourse, rites of passage, and pastoral care beyond their membership. He therefore envisages a penultimate harmony of **church and polity** under **providence**, maintained by **eschatological reserve** and the church’s primary allegiance to **Christ’s lordship**. By retrieving **Reformed political thought** while engaging **liberal democratic theory** and **Rawlsian public reason**, he articulates a model of **principled pluralism** compatible with **creational order** and **religious liberty**.

#### 4. Natural theology, skepticism, and public reason
With **Faith and Its Critics** (2009), Fergusson turns to philosophical **apologetics**. He confronts **skepticism** from **Humean empiricism** to **New Atheism**. Rather than championing a deductive **natural theology** or retreating into **Barthian** rejection, he argues for **praeambula fidei** that furnish **cumulative-case** considerations consonant with **revelation**. These include the **intelligibility of the world**, the **moral order**, the **fittingness of theism** for explaining contingency, and the **phenomenology of religious experience**. The cumulative case is neither coercive nor neutral; it is a **publicly accessible invitation** that becomes persuasive within the **ecclesial form of life**.

Crucially, Fergusson differentiates a **theology of nature** from a speculative **natural theology**. The former interprets **creational signs** in light of **Christology** and the **Spirit’s illumination**, avoiding the autonomy that **Barth** feared. Yet he also contends that **common grace** permits genuine though fragmentary knowledge of **God’s eternal power and deity**. The dialectic with **Hume** is central: Hume’s critique of miracles and causation is met not by interventionist **voluntarism** but by a doctrine of **double agency**, where God’s **primary causality** operates through created **secondary causes**. This yields a noncompetitive account of **divine action** capable of sustaining prayer, providence, and sacramental life without collapsing into **deism** or **occasionalism**.

#### 5. Creation: ex nihilo, goodness, and contingency
Fergusson’s **Creation** (2014) consolidates his dogmatic commitments. He retrieves **creatio ex nihilo** as a metaphysical and doxological claim that God alone is **absolute being**, while creatures exist by **gratuitous donation**. He appropriates **Aquinas** on **participation** and **Calvin** on **piety** to argue that the world is intelligible, good, and ordered to **Sabbath rest**. Against reductive **scientism**, he affirms that modern cosmology and evolutionary biology can be received under a doctrine of **providence**, stressing **contingency** and **law-like regularity** as theological gifts. Here **T. F. Torrance’s** attention to the rational integrity of the sciences informs his approach, though Fergusson avoids collapsing theology into a science-friendly apologetic.

On **evil and suffering**, Fergusson resists speculative **theodicies**. He advocates an **eschatological theodicy** grounded in the **cross and resurrection**, liturgical **lament**, and pastoral patience. The **book of Job** instructs theology to privilege confession and protest over system-building. Evil is neither a metaphysical necessity nor a product of divine caprice; it is a parasitic distortion within a good creation, answered ultimately by **divine redemption**. This refusal of closure coheres with his overall **modest realism**: the meaning of creation is manifest in **Christ** yet remains partially veiled until the **consummation**.

#### 6. Providence: concurrence, guidance, and hope
The programmatic articulation appears in **The Providence of God: A Polyphonic Approach** (2018). Fergusson reassembles historical voices on **providence** from **Augustine** and **Aquinas** through **Calvin** to **Barth**, proposing a **concurrentist** model of **double agency**. God’s **primary causality** upholds and directs all that exists, while creaturely **secondary causes** operate with real integrity. He rejects both meticulous **determinism** that compromises responsibility and deistic **non-interventionism** that banishes **divine governance**. Providence is narrated across four registers: the **cosmic** stability of nature, the **moral** guidance of persons, the **ecclesial** mission of the church, and the **eschatological** promise that all things will be gathered in **Christ**.

Fergusson’s **polyphonic** method is on display in his treatment of guidance, chance, and petitionary prayer. He deploys **Aquinas’s prudence** to interpret vocational discernment, accepts genuine **contingency** as compatible with **divine wisdom**, and construes miracles not as violations but as **sign-events** located within the **economy of salvation**. He retrieves **Calvin’s comfort** in the doctrine of **providence** while tempering speculative curiosity with **Barth’s christological concentration**. The upshot is a pastoral dogmatics: **providence** is taught to sustain faith, engender gratitude, and promote responsible action rather than to map causal micro-detail.

#### 7. Ecclesial vocation, culture, and eschatological reserve
Across essays and addresses, including contributions to **The Cambridge Companion to Reformed Theology** (2016), Fergusson advances a vision of the **public church** sustained by **Word and sacrament** and oriented toward **civic peace**. He commends **common grace** and **natural law** as theological warrants for cooperation across religious and secular lines. At the same time, he advocates **eschatological reserve**, a phrase that signals both hope and restraint: the church should resist **eschatological overreach** in politics, avoiding triumphalist claims that identify any social order with the **kingdom of God**. This reserve leans on **Augustine’s two cities** and **Calvin’s doctrine of the two governments**, providing an anti-utopian brake that preserves the church’s **prophetic freedom**.

Fergusson’s ecclesiology is marked by **humility and service**. He sees **established churches** as capable of public witness without compulsion, providing catechesis, diaconal service, and reflective **public theology**. His use of **creation and providence** underwrites a cultural stance of patience, neighbor-love, and institutional responsibility. The church’s mission is not to conquer but to offer a truthful **eschatological sign**, a community of reconciliation that anticipates the **new creation** while honoring the goods of the present *saeculum*.

#### 8. Interlocutors and constructive tensions
Theologically, Fergusson’s conversation partners are deliberately wide: **Augustine** and **Aquinas** for metaphysical depth, **Calvin** for doxological confidence in **providence**, **Barth** for the primacy of **revelation**, and **T. F. Torrance** for the rationality of faith amid the natural sciences. Philosophically he contends with **Hume** on causality and miracles, **Wittgenstein** on language and practice, and **MacIntyre** and **Taylor** on the moral shape of modernity. He also contends with **New Atheism**, arguing that **Dawkins** and **Dennett** caricature theological claims about **creation** and **divine action**. This network explains his **polyphonic** method: it is not eclecticism but a principled retrieval across confessional and disciplinary lines.

Constructively, certain tensions are embraced rather than resolved. Fergusson balances **divine sovereignty** with **creaturely integrity** through **concurrence**, steers between **Barth’s Nein** and **Thomist** confidence on **natural knowledge of God**, and holds **civil society** and **church** close while resisting both **Erastianism** and **sectarianism**. He argues that theology must habitually sustain such tensions as a function of **analogia fidei** and the **mystery of providence**, preferring faithful articulation to premature synthesis. The leitmotif is **theological modesty** without retreat: Christian doctrine can speak publicly and truthfully about the world because it confesses the **creator and governor of all**, yet it does so with humility born of the **cross**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and especially **Westminster** perspective, Fergusson’s project invites both gratitude and scrutiny. Positively, his retrieval of **creatio ex nihilo**, **providence and concurrence**, **double agency**, and **eschatological reserve** aligns with the **Westminster Standards** on **providence**, **secondary causes**, and **Christian liberty**. His insistence that **Scripture** governs **public theology** while permitting **common grace** cooperation chimes with a robust **two kingdoms** prudence. His resistance to speculative **theodicy** and his pastoral orientation reflect **Calvin’s piety** and the confessional aim of **comfort**.

Yet cautions emerge. First, his qualified embrace of **natural theology** and **cumulative-case** reasoning, though chastened, risks softening the **principium of Scripture** as self-authenticating, especially as articulated by **Van Tilian** accounts of **covenant epistemology** and the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief. A Westminster charge would ask whether his **praeambula fidei** are sufficiently subordinated to **revelation**, not only in method but in epistemic authority. Second, his concurrentist **providence** avoids **meticulous determinism**, which may read as under-specifying the **divine decree** and **compatibilist freedom** that ground a strong doctrine of providence, prayer, and assurance in classic **Reformed orthodoxy**. Third, his advocacy of **establishment** and robust **civil society** can be welcomed for prudence, but a stricter **two kingdoms** or **sphere sovereignty** approach would warn against the symbolic co-option of the church by national projects, urging a clearer delineation of **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** and the **spirituality of the church**. Finally, his norm of **polyphony** is salutary as a posture, yet Westminster theology would insist the **analogia fidei** decisively adjudicates competing voices by the **covenantal canon**, not by public plausibility. In sum, Fergusson offers a compelling contemporary **Reformed** dogmatics of **creation** and **providence** for a plural society, but Westminster instincts will press for sharper confessional edges on **revelation**, **decree**, and **church-state** differentiation.
