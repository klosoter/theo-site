### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and apprenticeship
Gregory K. Beale, born in 1949, matured within the crucible of late twentieth-century **evangelicalism**, absorbing the gains of **Second Temple Jewish** studies while moving decisively into **Reformed biblical theology**. Trained at **Dallas Theological Seminary** and then supervised by **C. F. D. Moule** at **Cambridge** where his 1981 doctoral work became **The Use of Daniel in Jewish Apocalyptic Literature and in the Revelation of St. John** in 1984, he fused a high **doctrine of Scripture** with rigorous **historical exegesis** of apocalyptic sources. Appointments at **Gordon-Conwell**, **Wheaton College Graduate School** from the early 1990s to 2010, **Westminster Theological Seminary** from 2010, and later **Reformed Theological Seminary** provided institutional homes where he honed a **redemptive-historical** method indebted to **Geerhardus Vos**, **Herman Ridderbos**, and **Meredith Kline**. His milieu included the rise of **canonical criticism** associated with **Brevard Childs**, the emergence of **intertextuality** in biblical studies, and mounting debates over **inerrancy** and the **use of the Old Testament in the New**, to which he would respond with methodic precision.

Beale’s early work situated him among scholars of **apocalyptic** and **Revelation** like **Richard Bauckham**, while his constructive orientation kept him in close dialogue with **Reformed exegesis** and **systematic theology**. This intersection of academic guild and confessional commitment yields his characteristic approach: an exegetical argument anchored in **textual data** and **intertextual echoes**, normed by **canonical unity** and **divine authorial intent**, and framed by **inaugurated eschatology**.

#### 2. Method: authorial intent, typology, and allusion
Beale’s method rests on several axioms: the **unity of Scripture** under a single **divine author**, the compatibility of **human authorial intent** with a deeper **divine authorial intention**, and the regulative role of the **canon** in identifying legitimate **typology**. He resists a free-floating **sensus plenior**, arguing instead for **single meaning with multiple implications**, where meaning expands along the grain of the **covenantal storyline** and the *analogia fidei*. His **Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament** in 2012 delineates criteria for **quotations**, **allusions**, and **echoes**, refining tools pioneered by **Richard Hays** while tightening controls through lexical overlap, thematic coherence, compositional trajectories, and the pervasive influence of the **Septuagint**.

Beale’s hermeneutic is self-consciously **redemptive-historical**. He practices **typological-canonical exegesis** in which earlier events, institutions, and persons are God-ordained patterns recapitulated and elevated in **Christ** and the **church**. This is not allegory but an exegetically warranted reading keyed to the Bible’s eschatological structure, drawing on **Vos** and **Ridderbos** for the already-not-yet schema and on **Kline** for **temple** as **cosmic mountain**. Such a stance also grounds his defense of **inerrancy**, since the unified **divine discourse** constrains intertextual claims and maintains historical and theological coherence within the canon.

#### 3. Revelation and inaugurated idealism
Beale’s **The Book of Revelation** in the **New International Greek Testament Commentary** series, published in 1999, stands as a landmark in **Revelation** studies. He advances a **modified idealist** or **eclectic** reading shaped by **inaugurated eschatology**: the visions symbolize recurrent church-age realities under the lordship of the risen **Lamb**, while consummation texts point to the final **parousia** and **new creation**. The commentary catalogs hundreds of **Old Testament allusions** rather than direct quotes, foregrounding **Daniel**, **Ezekiel**, and **Isaiah** as the matrix of Johannine apocalypse. In **John's Use of the Old Testament in Revelation** in 1998, he argued that the author rereads Israel’s Scriptures through the lens of the **crucified and exalted Christ**, producing a sustained **typological recapitulation** rather than a newspaper eschatology.

Central to this reading is the claim that **Revelation 21–22** depicts the consummated **cosmic temple**, the telos of **Genesis 1–2**. The heavenly throne room, the priestly witness of the churches, and the pervasive **worship–idolatry** conflict disclose an apocalyptic anthropology: humans become like what they worship, either conformed to the **image of the Son** or to mute **idols**. Beale’s **shorter commentary** on Revelation in 2015 and subsequent teaching have carried this synthesis into pastoral and academic arenas, consolidating a Reformed **amillennial** reading with robust **ecclesiology** and **mission**.

#### 4. Temple as the architecture of biblical theology
In **The Temple and the Church's Mission** in 2004, Beale developed a signature thesis: Eden was an incipient **temple-garden**, Adam a priest-king commissioned to extend sacred space to the ends of the earth, and the **tabernacle** and **Solomonic temple** were symbolic microcosms of **creation**. The failure of Adam and Israel yields to the achievement of **Christ**, who is the **true temple** in whom God dwells bodily, and whose **Spirit** constitutes the church as an expanding **eschatological temple** until the whole creation becomes **God’s dwelling** in the **new heavens and new earth**. This account synthesizes **Genesis**, **Exodus**, **Ezekiel**, **John**, **Paul**, and **Revelation**, integrating **covenant**, **image**, **Sabbath**, and **mission** under the horizon of **new creation**.

The pastoral distillation, **God Dwells Among Us** with **Mitchell Kim** in 2014, extends the thesis to ecclesial practice, arguing that congregational holiness, sacrificial love, and worldwide witness are temple-expanding ministries. Beale’s **temple** construct functions as a hermeneutical key linking **creation** to **consummation**, anchoring **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** in a coherent teleology of **divine presence**.

#### 5. Idolatry and the deformation of the image
Beale’s **We Become What We Worship** in 2008 articulates a biblical theology of **idolatry** grounded in **image**. He argues from **Isaiah 6**, **Psalm 115**, and **Romans 1** that idolaters take on the spiritual and moral qualities of the idols they adore: they become blind, deaf, and senseless because their gods are lifeless. This **anthropology** reframes sin as **imaging** a false deity and salvation as **re-imaging** by participation in the **risen Christ**, integrating **sanctification** and **mission** within the **worship** paradigm. The thesis binds together **Exodus** golden-calf narratives, **prophetic polemic**, **Pauline** transformation language, and **Revelation’s** beastly dehumanization, offering a unitive account that is psychologically penetrating and theologically Reformed.

By weaving **creation**, **image**, **worship**, and **mission**, Beale positions idolatry as the negative of **temple** theology, with **Spirit-wrought** conformity to Christ as the remedy. The logic is covenantal and eschatological: humans either bear the **mark** of the beast or the **name** of the Lamb, a binary that fuels both ethical seriousness and evangelistic urgency.

#### 6. The Old Testament in the New: tools and debates
As co-editor with **D. A. Carson** of the **Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament** in 2007, and author of the **Handbook** in 2012, Beale helped standardize an academic yet confessional field of study. He balances **intertextuality** with **historical-grammatical exegesis**, insisting on controls for identifying **allusions** such as verbal parallels, syntagmatic clusters, and conceptual fit within a **biblical-theological trajectory**. His earlier edited volume, **The Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts?** in 1994, asked whether the New Testament sometimes exegetes the Old Testament in ways that would be illegitimate for modern readers. Beale’s reply is paradigmatically Reformed: apostolic exegesis is normed by **Christological fulfillment**, **canonical context**, and **divine authorship**, so Christian reading must imitate its logic under the discipline of the **canon**.

With **Benjamin Gladd**, he advanced **Hidden But Now Revealed** in 2014, tracing the Pauline and Johannine theme of **mystery** as a once-veiled plan now unveiled in **Messiah**. This volume mediates between **apocalyptic revelation** and **covenant continuity**, linking **Danielic** expectation to **Paul’s** mission to the Gentiles and to **John’s** unveiling of the Lamb’s victory. Throughout, Beale debates **Richard Hays** and **Brevard Childs** with charity, sharpening criteria and resisting subjectivist **reader-response** while appropriating the gains of **canonical** and **intertextual** insights.

#### 7. The center of the New Testament: new creation in Christ
Beale’s magnum opus, **A New Testament Biblical Theology** in 2011, proposes that the generative center of the New Testament is **new creation** inaugurated by the **death and resurrection** of **Christ** and effected by the **Spirit**. In this telling, themes such as **kingdom**, **covenant**, **justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **mission** are facets of the one jewel: participation in the **eschatological life** of the new Adam. The center is not an abstract idea but a narrative-structural claim that the **old age** has been invaded by the **age to come**. The **church** as **temple** is the social form of this new creation, and **Scripture** itself is the covenant charter that discloses this reality.

Beale’s **Union with the Resurrected Christ** in 2023 sharpens the soteriological axis. He argues that believers’ participation in Christ’s resurrection-life is the controlling soteriological reality from which flow **definitive sanctification**, **progressive transformation**, and the forensic benefits of **justification**. The book tethers **ordo salutis** to **historia salutis** by insisting that the benefits are not separable parcels but modes of sharing in the **risen Lord**. While affirming classic **Reformed** doctrines, the accent falls on the **eschatological new-creation** ontology of union, extending insights from **Ridderbos** and **Vos** into constructive proposals for **Pauline theology**.

#### 8. Commentaries as laboratories of biblical theology
Beale’s commentaries are not mere repositories of philology; they are laboratories where **biblical theology** and **exegesis** cross-pollinate. His **1–2 Thessalonians** in the IVP New Testament Commentary series in 2003 reads **eschatology**, **perseverance**, and **sanctification** through an already-not-yet lens, resisting both sensationalist timetables and reductionist preterism. His **Colossians and Philemon** in the **Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament** in 2019 refracts **Christ’s supremacy**, **new creation**, and **union** into the textures of household ethics and ecclesial life, showing how **cosmic reconciliation** shapes mundane obedience. Across these works his sensitivity to **Septuagintal diction**, **Jewish apocalyptic idiom**, and **Pauline** conceptual frames models a confessional yet critical engagement with the text.

This cross-genre competence also appears in his shorter writings and lectures on **Ephesians**, **Romans 5–8**, and **Johannine** themes, where **temple**, **image**, and **new creation** recur as architectonic categories. The unity of doctrine and exegesis remains Beale’s mark: he refuses to split **dogmatics** from **philology**, insisting that **canonical coherence** is an exegetical datum rather than an external imposition.

#### 9. Scripture’s authority and the inerrancy debates
In **The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism** in 2008, Beale confronted arguments by **Peter Enns**, **Kenton Sparks**, and others who proposed accommodationist or critical-realist accounts that relativized **inerrancy**. Beale’s rejoinder is twofold: historically, he contends that the phenomena of **ancient Near Eastern** parallels and flexible **citation practices** do not threaten the **truthfulness** of Scripture when read within its own literary conventions; theologically, he argues that **divine authorial unity** controls meaning and warrants **typological** rereadings without positing error at the level of **assertion**. Here again his commitment to **redemptive-historical** reading serves a doctrinal function: Scripture’s complex polyphony is harmonized by the **divine discourse** culminating in **Christ**.

The same concerns animate his editorial work in **The Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts?** in 1994 and his subsequent handbooks, where he clarifies how the **apostolic hermeneutic** can be both historically grounded and theologically norming. The upshot is a robustly **confessional** approach that is conversant with **critical scholarship** but not beholden to its skeptical axioms.

#### 10. Contribution and Reformed evaluation
Gregory Beale’s enduring contribution is the articulation of a **temple-centered, new-creation biblical theology** driven by careful **intertextual exegesis** and disciplined by **canonical unity**. He has shown that **Revelation**, far from being a hermeneutical outlier, crystallizes the Bible’s **apocalyptic** structure, that **Eden** and **Zion** provide the architectural blueprint for **ecclesiology** and **mission**, and that **idolatry** deforms the **image** while **union with the resurrected Christ** restores and glorifies it. His synthesis is both **philological** and **dogmatic**, standing in a Reformed line from **Vos** and **Ridderbos** and enriched by **Kline’s** temple cosmology, yet forged through the modern guild’s debates with **Childs**, **Hays**, and inerrancy critics.

From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, the strengths are formidable: an unwavering **high view of Scripture**, rigorous **allusion criteria**, a persuasive **inaugurated eschatology**, and a unitive center in **new creation** that honors **covenant** and **Christocentrism**. Potential tensions include an occasional over-reliance on **intertextual parallels** where lexical or thematic resonance may be necessary but not sufficient to ground **authorial intent**, a tilt toward **idealism** in **Revelation** that some classical **amillennial** readers might wish to tether more explicitly to particular historical referents, and a soteriological accent on **union** that can overshadow the analytic clarity of **forensic justification** unless constantly rearticulated. A constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy would press for a tighter **grammatico-historical** baseline in establishing **allusions**, a more explicit integration of **dogmatic loci** such as **divine simplicity** and **immutability** into the biblical-theological frame, and a reiterated dialectic of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** where **federal headship** and **imputation** receive full dogmatic weight alongside **participatory union**. Even so, in the economy of contemporary Reformed theology, Beale’s work remains a model of **Scripture interprets Scripture**, a textured witness to the **unity of the canon**, and a durable resource for preaching, scholarship, and mission under the sign of the **new creation**.
