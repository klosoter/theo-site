### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Stewart M. Hoover emerges in the late twentieth century as a leading architect of the study of **media, religion, and culture**, a field crystallizing as **mass media**, **digital networks**, and **pluralist publics** reconfigured the visibility and practice of religion in the West. Trained in **communication studies** and shaped by **James W. Carey’s communication-as-culture**, Hoover situates religion not primarily as a set of doctrines but as a matrix of **symbols, practices, and publics** that are mediated. His career at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he founded the **Center for Media, Religion and Culture** in 2003, institutionalized this agenda and linked it to the **International Conference on Media, Religion, and Culture** convened intermittently since 1994. The intellectual context is crowded with the debates over **secularization**, the recalibration of **Habermas’s public sphere** under conditions of mass mediation, and **anthropological turns** toward **lived religion** beyond elite theologies. Hoover’s distinctive contribution is to insist that media are not merely channels through which religion passes but **constitutive environments** within which religious meanings, identities, and authorities are **constructed, negotiated, and ritualized**.

This methodological stance is explicitly interpretive and empirical. Following **Clifford Geertz’s thick description** and the **Birmingham School’s cultural studies**, Hoover privileges **ethnography**, **audience reception**, and **textual-discursive analysis** to map what people actually do with media in relation to the sacred. His analytical vocabulary borrows **Bourdieu’s habitus and field** to understand how religious and media institutions contend for authority, and it deploys **Luckmann and Berger’s social construction** of religion alongside **Talal Asad’s critique** of essentialist definitions of religion. Hoover’s work assumes a **methodological agnosticism** regarding theological truth-claims; he consistently brackets **doctrinal normativity** to describe **lived religion** as practice under **media logics**. That epistemic decision, typical of late modern interpretive social science, allows comparative analysis across traditions but also raises questions for theological accounts of **revelation and authority**.

#### 2. Field building: from problem space to research program
Hoover’s editorial leadership is itself a major intellectual act. In **Rethinking Media, Religion, and Culture** (1997), co-edited with **Knut Lundby**, he convened historians, sociologists, and media scholars to dismantle the inherited binaries of **sacred vs. secular** and **religion vs. mass culture**. The volume codified the now-familiar analytic triad: **religion in the media** focuses on representation and content; **religion and media** investigates institutional relations and strategies; **media as religion** explores the religious or quasi-ritual functions of media themselves. This threefold map shifted the field away from moral panic over **popular culture** toward an empirically grounded, theoretically plural conversation about **mediation** as a constitutive process. The result is an approach suspicious of simplistic **instrumental** views of media and instead attuned to the **ritualization of public life**, the **symbolic power** of media institutions, and the **vernacular creativity** of practitioners.

This programmatic turn positioned Hoover at the crossroads of debates over **secularization vs. visibility**, **commodification vs. sacralization**, and **globalization vs. localization**. He enlisted **Habermasian** concerns about the **public sphere** to analyze how media organize publics around religious controversies and how **journalistic objectivity** imposes recognizable frames on religion. He also adopted insights from **Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding** model to argue that audiences are not passive recipients of religious content but participate in **interpretive communities** that domesticate and reframe religious messages. In other words, Hoover made **mediation** a theological field problem, even while deploying the **hermeneutics of cultural studies** rather than constructive doctrine.

#### 3. Religion in the News: journalism and the public sacred
In **Religion in the News: Faith and Journalism in American Public Discourse** (1998), Hoover subjected American journalism to a genealogical and sociological analysis. He argued that news organizations are **cultural institutions** that help define the **public sacred** by deciding what counts as legitimate religion, which conflicts warrant headline status, and how **national identity** is narrated in religious terms. The book identifies a persistent **Protestant-inflected normativity** in mainstream reporting, where religion is framed as voluntary belief, congregational participation, and moral stance, thus marginalizing noncongregational forms, **ethno-religious** identities, and **lived religion** outside institutional walls. By tracing coverage of controversies around **evangelical politics**, **Catholic scandals**, and **Islam’s public presence**, Hoover shows how **objective news routines** produce a **civil religion** that is neither secular nor confessional, but a negotiated symbolic order in which the sacred is made publicly intelligible.

The theoretical payoff is twofold. First, Hoover reframes **Habermas’s public sphere** by insisting that media are not simply fora for rational-critical debate, but **ritual stages** that dramatize and domesticate the sacred for mass publics. Second, he surfaces the **power-knowledge** dynamics that privilege some religious actors and silence others, inviting critiques inspired by **Asad** and **postcolonial** scholarship. For theology, this analysis also hints at the ways **magisterial voices** and **ecclesial authorities** are refracted through **media logics**, with implications for how **authority** is recognized or eroded in a media-saturated public square.

#### 4. Practicing religion and the domestication of media
The edited volume **Practicing Religion in the Age of the Media** (2002), with **Lynn Schofield Clark**, advances a practice-centered turn. Here Hoover foregrounds **lived religion** as a set of patterned, embodied, ordinary practices that are **mediated** in homes, subcultures, and fan communities. Through case studies ranging from **Christian television** to **youth music cultures**, the book argues that religious subjects adopt a **bricolage** approach, assembling identities and devotional routines from a repertoire of media artifacts, ritual gestures, and communal scripts. A key concept here is **domestication**, drawn from media sociology, describing how media technologies are appropriated into household rhythms and moral orders, thereby becoming part of **sacral time** and **sacral space**.

Hoover’s analysis registers the displacement and rearticulation of **religious authority**. Authority is no longer monopolized by clerical or textual elites but is **distributed** across networks of producers, influencers, and audiences who together negotiate what counts as faithful practice. The result is not necessarily the flattening of doctrine but the **pluralization of authorization**, where traditional **magisteria** coexist with charismatic media authorities, peer validation, and experiential plausibility structures. This descriptive claim challenges theologians to rethink **catechesis**, **tradition**, and **ecclesial mediation** under conditions where the **means of symbolic production** have migrated into commercial and domestic spaces.

#### 5. Religion in the Media Age: synthesis and mediatization
Hoover’s monograph **Religion in the Media Age** (2006) consolidates these themes under the rubric of **mediatization**. While he resists strong technological determinism, Hoover adopts the thesis that modern media constitute an independent **institutional logic** reshaping other social fields, including religion. He traces how **broadcasting regimes**, **cable proliferation**, and the early **digital web** recast religious visibility and rewire the terms of membership, community, and public representation. Media do not merely transmit religious content; they impose **genres**, **temporalities**, and **aesthetics** that reformat belief and belonging. In this sense, media become **environments of meaning** within which religion is practiced, understood, and contested.

Within this synthesis Hoover articulates a now-canonical distinction: **religion in media** concerns how religious actors appear in media content; **religion and media** explores the strategic engagement of religious institutions with media industries; and **media as religion** investigates how media practices function as **rituals**, **mythic narratives**, and sites of **transcendence**. He draws here on **Nick Couldry’s media rituals** and **Dayan and Katz’s media events** to describe mass-mediated ceremonies that gather dispersed publics into temporary **imagined communities** with a sense of gravity and moral order. The funerals of public figures, national tragedies, and sporting spectacles function as **civic liturgies**, disclosing a **civil sacred** that is neither private piety nor secular neutrality.

#### 6. Comparative engagements and conceptual refinements
Hoover’s work lives in conversation with parallel theorists of **mediatization** and **religious sensation**. With **Stig Hjarvard**, he shares the claim that media increasingly serve as primary sources of religious information and frameworks, but Hoover resists teleological narratives that assume the **subordination** of religion to media. Instead he emphasizes **mutual shaping**, institutional negotiation, and the persistence of **vernacular religion** in mediated spaces. With **Birgit Meyer’s sensational forms**, he converges on the idea that media affordances structure the **sensory** and **affective** registers of the sacred, though Hoover tends to remain at the level of publics and practices rather than the ontology of **sacramentality**. With **Talal Asad**, Hoover agrees that definitions of religion are historically contingent and often tied to **state and media power**, yet he deploys this insight to map public discourse rather than to historicize doctrine.

His empirical horizon extends beyond American Protestantism. Hoover analyzes how **Islam** is refracted through western media frames, how **Catholic** and **Orthodox** traditions negotiate visibility, and how **new religious movements** exploit digital networks. Across cases, he notes the intensification of **branding**, the strategic use of **celebrity** and **testimony**, and the emergence of **networked authority** distributed across platforms. The missionary dream of mass distribution gives way to the analytics of engagement and the ritualization of **sharing**, **liking**, and **following** as markers of belonging. These features situate Hoover’s program within the broader story of **late modernity**, where **institutional differentiation** and **individualization** intersect with the **commodification of culture**.

#### 7. Authority, revelation, and the problem of mediation
While Hoover brackets **doctrinal judgments**, his analyses raise theological questions about **revelation**, **authority**, and **ecclesia**. If media are constitutive of religious practice, then the church’s traditional **media of grace**, the **verbum Dei** in Scripture and preaching, and the **sacramenta** as visible words, must be considered alongside the saturated **symbolic economies** of contemporary media. Hoover’s observation that authority is **negotiated** and **distributed** invites reflection on the status of **canon**, **creed**, and **office** when mediated recognitions displace older forms of legitimation. His notion of **media as religion** challenges theologians to discern how media rituals traffic in **transcendence**, **awe**, and **belonging**, potentially forming **rival liturgies** that catechize bodies and affections.

Hoover’s posture toward **secularization** is diagnostic rather than doctrinaire. He notes the **resacralization** of public space through **media events**, complicating linear declension narratives. At the same time, he shows how **market logics** colonize religious representation, turning faith into **content** and spiritual identity into **brand**. The upshot is a picture of religion as a **practice of mediation** which shapes and is shaped by **technics**, **institutions**, and **affects**. Theological interlocutors can receive this as a descriptive account of providential **common culture**, while noting the absence of a **normative hermeneutic** for adjudicating between true and false mediations of the divine.

#### 8. Domestic piety, youth cultures, and vernacular creativity
Hoover’s most textured ethnographic insights come in the study of **home**, **youth**, and **popular culture**. He shows that the **domestic sphere** has become a crucial site of **religious socialization**, where media routines structure **family time**, **moral teaching**, and **devotional practice**. His attention to **youth cultures** complicates adult anxieties about media corruption by demonstrating **vernacular creativity**, where young believers remix **music**, **film**, and **digital artifacts** to craft **authentic** expressions of faith within peer networks. These practices produce forms of **belonging** and **authority** that are intensely affective and experiential, often decentered from traditional institutional oversight but not necessarily opposed to it.

Such findings crosscut tidy narratives of decline or revival. Hoover argues that we inhabit a **mixed economy** of religious mediation, where **institutional religion** and **popular media** co-produce religious lifeworlds. The research unsettles romantic appeals to **pure tradition** while also chastening celebratory accounts of **digital liberation**. Instead, Hoover places before theologians a granular map of how the sacred is **domesticated**, **performed**, and **shared** in the everyday, under the **constraints and affordances** of media technologies that are now environmental.

#### 9. Public scholarship, institutional legacy, and the digital turn
As a public intellectual and institution builder, Hoover’s legacy includes the establishment of **CMRC** in 2003, which has hosted projects and conferences on topics like **Islam and the media**, **evangelical popular culture**, and **religion in social media**. Through this platform, he fostered comparative and global perspectives, ensuring that the study of media and religion did not collapse into American Protestant debates. The **International Conference on Media, Religion, and Culture** has functioned as a crucible for methodological innovation, linking **journalism studies**, **anthropology of religion**, and **media sociology** in an interdisciplinary commons.

In the 2010s, Hoover’s framework proved adaptable to the **digital turn**. Questions of **algorithmic curation**, **platform governance**, and **datafied publics** only intensified his core claims about **networked authority** and **media ritual**. The rise of **influencer clergy**, **livestreamed worship**, and **hashtag activism** around religious causes shows that the **mediatization thesis** is not exhausted by broadcast-era assumptions. Hoover’s descriptive precision equips scholars and theologians to discern how **platform capitalism** and **attention economies** now mediate the sacred, producing **accelerated publics**, **fragmented counterpublics**, and new forms of **visibility and vulnerability** for religious actors.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: revelation, mediation, and ecclesial authority
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Hoover’s oeuvre is invaluable as a thick description of **common culture** under **providence**, yet it requires principled supplementation by **special revelation**. Positively, his accounts of **media ritual**, **civil sacred**, and **networked authority** sharpen **antithetical** discernment of **idolatrous liturgies** that rival **Word and sacrament**, and they aid pastoral prudence concerning **catechesis** amid **media logics**. His attention to **lived religion** exemplifies respect for **creational ordinances** and the **sensus divinitatis** as they are patterned, distorted, and redirected in cultural practices. However, his methodological agnosticism and reduction of religion to **practice and symbol** risk evacuating **revelation** of its **covenantal** and **redemptive-historical** content, blurring the distinction between **means of grace** and other forms of mediation. A Reformed alternative receives Hoover’s **mediatization** as a description of providential **instrumentality**, while norming it by **Scripture** as principium externum and the **Spirit** as principium internum, locating authority in **canon, creed, and office** even as it recognizes that such authority must now address **networked publics**. The task is to resist the sacralization of **media logics** by reasserting **Christ’s lordship over culture**, practicing **ecclesial disciplines** that recalibrate time and attention, and deploying **common-grace** cultural analysis to expose the **liturgical power** of platforms, all the while refusing to concede that **mediation** in general erases the uniqueness of the **incarnate Word** and the instituted **means of grace**.
