### TITLE
Peter Lombard is the quiet architect of Western scholastic systematics, whose **Sentences** both stabilized Catholic doctrine and hardened sacramental and merit structures that the Reformed later had to dismantle from Scripture.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Peter Lombard** works in the mid twelfth century Parisian schools, just as **scholastic theology** crystallizes around 1150–1160.
- He stands between **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, absorbing **Patristic** tradition while shaping the university curriculum that fueled **High Medieval** synthesis.

- Lombard represents the early scholastic **quaestio** and **sententiae** method, gathering conflicting authorities into a reasoned whole that still privileges **Scripture** and **Fathers**.
- His epistemic posture is one of confidence in **reason** as a ministerial tool under **revelation**, but without Reformed suspicion of autonomous philosophy.
- He treats the **church’s tradition**, especially **Augustine’s** corpus, as a normative lens for reading the Bible and as a quasi-canonical authority set.

- The **Libri Quattuor Sententiarum** or **Four Books of Sentences** c. 1155 is his masterwork, organizing all doctrine under **Trinity**, **creation**, **Christ and grace**, and **sacraments and last things**.
- In **Sentences** I–II he systematizes **Trinity** and **creation** from Patristic sources, often reproducing **Augustine** with scholastic distinctions.
- In **Sentences** III he treats **Christology** and **soteriology**, including influential views on **charity** as the form of the virtues and on Christ’s **satisfaction**.
- In **Sentences** IV he offers a decisive medieval account of the **sacraments**, especially **baptism**, **penance**, and **Eucharist**, that shapes later medieval and Tridentine practice.

- Lombard is decisive for **Trinitarian** formulation in the schools, including the psychological analogy and discussion of **relations** and **processions**.
- He shapes later debates on **grace**, **merit**, and **charity**, informing both the **sacramental system** and medieval moral theology.
- His ordering of loci sets the template for **systematic theology** as a discipline, influencing discussions of **Scripture**, **church**, and **sacraments** for centuries.
- His sacramental doctrine, especially on **Eucharist** and **penance**, stands behind later conflicts over **justification** and **assurance** at the Reformation.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to respect **Lombard’s Sentences** as the crucial textbook behind **Aquinas**, **Bonaventure**, and later **Reformed scholastics**, while clearly rejecting his sacramental framework.
- They will expect you to show how **Lombard** differs from **Augustine** on grace in practice and how confessional Reformed theology reconfigures his **merit** and **sacrament** structures.

- For comparison you should pair **Lombard and Augustine** on grace, church, and authority, highlighting both continuity and distortion.
- You should also compare **Lombard and Aquinas**, especially on **sacraments** and the structure of **Summa** versus **Sentences**, to show later developments.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Peter Lombard, often called the **Magister Sententiarum**, taught in **Paris** and died in 1160, serving as bishop of Paris in his final years; he stands at the cusp of the **twelfth century renaissance** when the cathedral schools were becoming universities and **scholastic** method was beginning to dominate theology. Probably born near **Novara** in northern Italy around 1100, he studied in **Bologna** and then moved to Paris, where he absorbed earlier collections of **sentences** by **Anselm of Laon** and others. The driving problem of Lombard’s career is how to bring the expanding mass of **authorities** Scripture, Latin **Fathers**, early canon law, and philosophical insights into a coherent whole that could be taught, disputed, and handed on within the schools. In a context marked by the rediscovery of **Aristotle** and by controversies over the **Trinity** and the sacraments, Lombard sought to provide a stable, authoritative compendium of doctrine that would discipline speculative excess and unify theological teaching across Christendom.

The deeper theological problem Lombard is trying to solve is the perceived fragmentation of **Christian doctrine** in the face of new intellectual pressures and heresies, such as those associated with **Peter Abelard** and various tritheistic or adoptionist errors, and he answers by canonical consolidation. Rather than pioneering a new speculative system like Abelard, Lombard compiles, orders, and judges: he desires to safeguard **orthodoxy** by anchoring debate in a curated set of authoritative **sententiae** from Augustine and other recognized teachers. His **Four Books of Sentences** become a kind of quasi-confessional baseline for medieval theology, though lacking the explicit ecclesial status of a formal creed or council. From a Reformed vantage point, this is both stabilizing and dangerous, because the drive for a pedagogically neat synthesis of **Augustine** and emerging ecclesial practice allows nonbiblical accretions, especially in **sacramental** and **mariological** theology, to be normalized and then hardened for centuries.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Peter Lombard’s method is the classic early **scholastic** *lectio–quaestio–disputatio* sequence, but crystallized into a single literary form, the **Sentences**, that becomes the standard textbook for centuries. He reads **Scripture** in light of the Latin **Fathers**, especially **Augustine**, but rather than offering continuous commentary he extracts key propositions and groups them by topic, then poses questions about their apparent contradictions. His theological epistemology is thus fundamentally authoritative: **revelation** given in Scripture, as interpreted by the fathers, provides the content, while **reason** is deployed to harmonize and clarify. The Four Books of Sentences are not a Summa in the later **Thomist** sense, but a curated archive of authoritative voices subjected to analytic ordering. This strongly influences later medieval writers, including **Aquinas** and **Bonaventure**, who all wrote commentaries on Lombard’s work as a rite of passage.

In Lombard, **Scripture** functions as the supreme norm in principle, but in practice the Bible comes to the student through a thick filter of **Glossa Ordinaria**, patristic florilegia, and previous sentence collections. Lombard rarely engages in fresh **exegesis**; instead, he organizes inherited interpretations into questions like whether the **Trinitarian** persons are distinguished by relations alone or whether God’s foreknowledge causes events. **Reason** operates within this web of texts as a harmonizing tool, seeking to show that no true authority contradicts another, because **truth** is one. There is little explicit reflection on **experience**, though pastoral and liturgical practice, especially regarding **sacraments**, exerts a strong background pressure on his doctrinal choices. The **church** is not discussed as a modern doctrine of ecclesiology, but rather presupposed as the community that has handed down these texts and practices; the implicit epistemology is that the Spirit guides the **church’s tradition**, especially through Augustine, so that the convergence of patristic authorities has a de facto normative status. From a Reformed perspective, this gives too much weight to postcanonical consensus and allows **tradition** to quietly compete with the *sola Scriptura* principle later recovered by the Reformation.

Lombard’s use of **philosophy** is modest compared to later scholastics but still significant; he inherits some **Boethian** logic and early **Aristotelian** categories and deploys them especially in Trinitarian and sacramental discussions. He distinguishes **substance** and **accidents**, uses notions of **relation**, and introduces key distinctions such as between the *res* and the *sacramentum* in his treatment of sacraments. Yet he is more a compiler than an original metaphysician, and many of the deep philosophical syntheses associated with **Aquinas** are absent. The tension with classical Reformed method lies not in the use of reason or philosophy as such, which Reformed scholastics also embrace, but in the way Lombard allows **nonbiblical practices** like penance tariffs or developing Marian devotion to be integrated and justified more by cumulative authority than by patient grammatical–historical reading of Scripture. His theological method thereby tends toward a mediated, ecclesio-centric **revelation** where the line between inspired text and traditional interpretation is blurred.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, on the **Trinity**, the catholic baseline is the Niceno-Constantinopolitan confession that God is one **essence** in three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, *homoousios* and distinguished by eternal processions and relations. In **Sentences** I, Lombard offers a careful digest of **Augustine’s De Trinitate**, integrating the psychological analogy and the doctrine of relations of origin as the distinguishing marks of the persons. He insists, against **Arian** and tritheist distortions, that the divine essence is numerically one and that the three persons are not three substances; he sides with orthodox **Latin tradition** in defending the **filioque**, presenting the Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son. His interlocutors are mostly earlier authorities, but he also positions himself against contemporary deviations like those associated with **Gilbert of Poitiers**. Lombard advances the discussion by sharpening the language of **relations** and properties, clarifying that terms like omnipotence or wisdom signify the divine essence and so are common, while paternity or filiation signify relations and are proper. From a Reformed vantage point, this Trinitarian teaching stands largely within Nicene and Augustinian boundaries, and later Reformed theologians like **Calvin** and **Bavinck** echo many of these themes, though without the same psychological speculations.

Second, in **Christology** and **soteriology**, the catholic baseline is the **Chalcedonian** confession of one person in two natures, fully God and fully man, and the classic Augustinian affirmation that salvation is by grace through the once for all work of **Christ**. In **Sentences** III, Lombard draws on **Leo the Great**, **Augustine**, and others to reaffirm the unity of Christ’s person and the completeness of his two natures, opposing **Nestorian** division and **Eutychian** confusion. He is important for articulating a developed understanding of **satisfaction**, taking up hints from **Anselm of Canterbury** and emphasizing that Christ’s passion is of infinite worth and thus more than sufficient to atone for sin. At the same time, Lombard develops a doctrine of **charity** as the form of all the virtues and speaks of grace in terms of infused love that enables meritorious acts; he is wrestling against emerging heresies like **Peter Abelard’s** moral example view. The tension arises because, although he affirms the objective sufficiency of Christ’s work, he embeds it within an economy of **merit** in which human cooperation through love and sacramentally mediated penance plays a constitutive role in the application of redemption, a pattern later attacked by **Luther** and the Reformers.

Third, in the **sacraments**, the catholic baseline is that Christ ordained visible signs which confer or signify grace, with patristic diversity about their number and precise mode of operation. In **Sentences** IV, Lombard decisively standardizes Western sacramental theology by listing **seven sacraments** and by introducing technical distinctions like *sacramentum tantum*, *res et sacramentum*, and *res tantum* that structure later medieval and Tridentine doctrine. He treats **baptism** as necessary for salvation and ex opere operato in its effect, though allowing for desire in some cases; he expounds **Eucharist** in terms that lead toward full **transubstantiation**, affirming that the substance of bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ while the accidents remain. In **penance** he gives dogmatic weight to confession to a priest and to ecclesially imposed satisfactions, thus integrating juridical practice into the sacramental order. His interlocutors include earlier writers like **Hugh of St Victor** and **Gratian**, and his synthesis becomes the launchpad for later elaboration by **Aquinas** and codification by **Trent**. From a Reformed perspective, Lombard’s sacramental system is precisely where confessional distance is greatest, since **Calvin** and **Turretin** reject both the sevenfold classification and the underlying ex opere operato and merit schemas.

Fourth, with respect to **grace and merit**, the catholic baseline from **Augustine** is that salvation is by God’s predestining grace alone, not by human works, though good works necessarily follow and are crowned. Lombard, in scattered discussions across **Sentences** II and III, affirms predestination and insists that even the first movement of the will toward God is due to grace, echoing **Augustinian** anti-Pelagian teaching. Yet he also gives definitive medieval form to the notion that **charity** infused by grace becomes the form of all virtues and the principle of **meritorious** acts. He treats eternal life as both gift and reward, supported by authorities like **Gregory the Great**, and he grounds an emerging distinction between merit *de condigno* and *de congruo*. These formulations, though not fully systematized as in later scholastics, open the door to a post-Augustinian pattern in which grace is indeed primary but the believer’s Spirit-enabled cooperation is construed as proportionately rewardable. This is precisely the nexus where **Luther** and **Calvin** will later protest and where the **Reformed confessions** insist that even our best works are defiled and cannot endure God’s judgment apart from Christ’s righteousness imputed by faith alone.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians know **Lombard** primarily through his influence on **Aquinas**, **Bonaventure**, and the late medieval scholastics whom they often oppose, yet there are places of genuine continuity. On the **Trinity**, Reformed orthodox figures like **Calvin**, **Polanus**, and **Turretin** stand broadly within the Augustinian and Lombardian framework of one essence and three relations of origin, though they trim back some of the more speculative psychological analogies. On **Christology**, the Reformed maintain the Chalcedonian pattern that Lombard reproduces, while rejecting later medieval developments concerning the mass and the extension of Christ’s atoning work through human satisfactions. **Bavinck** and **Vos** can appreciate the architectural role of the **Sentences** in stabilizing doctrinal discourse and in bequeathing a locus structure that Reformed systematics largely adopt and refine.

However, there are firm points where a Westminster examiner must press objection. First, on **sacraments**, Reformed orthodoxy rejects Lombard’s sevenfold enumeration, his movement toward **transubstantiation**, and especially his understanding of **penance** as sacrament with human satisfactions that contribute to the remission of temporal punishment; this collides directly with the doctrine of **justification by faith alone** codified in the **Westminster Confession**. Second, on **grace and merit**, Reformed theologians deny the underlying schema that makes infused **charity** the formal cause of justification and treats good works as truly meritorious in view of grace, insisting instead on alien righteousness and the non-meritorious character of the believer’s obedience. At the same time, there are lessons to be learned: Lombard models a careful respect for **tradition**, a disciplined use of **authorities**, and a commitment to theological order that Reformed scholastics emulate in a more rigorously biblical spirit. His insistence that all true authorities harmonize also resonates with the Reformed conviction that **Scripture** is self-consistent, though the Reformed will subordinate all other voices to Scripture’s clear teaching.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, a safe opening sentence is to call **Peter Lombard** the architect of medieval systematics whose **Four Books of Sentences** provided the framework within which both medieval Catholics and later Reformed scholastics worked out doctrine. You can safely say that Lombard stands in substantial continuity with **Augustine** on **Trinity** and predestination, but that his sacramental and merit systems help prepare the very abuses that the **Reformation** confronts. A helpful phrase is that Lombard is more a compiler and organizer than an original speculative genius like **Aquinas**, and that his strength lies in consolidating **authorities** into a teachable scheme.

You must avoid unqualified praise of his **sacramental** doctrine; never speak as if the seven sacraments or ex opere operato causality are simply catholic orthodoxy. If you mention his Eucharistic teaching, qualify it as a significant step toward **transubstantiation** that the **Reformed** later reject. Likewise, do not describe his view of **merit** as fully Augustinian; better to say that Lombard preserves Augustine’s anti-Pelagian insistence on the priority of grace but integrates it with a growing medieval concept of **merit** that dilutes monergistic emphasis. A landmine phrase would be implying any sympathy with a Roman Catholic **analogia entis** program; Lombard does not articulate that formal doctrine, and bringing it in would confuse categories that belong more to later **Thomistic** and **Barthian** debates.

Examiners often exploit the misunderstanding that Lombard is simply a neutral editor of patristic voices. You should be ready to say that his choices and groupings in the **Sentences** are themselves interpretive, and that by pairing certain texts on **penance**, **indulgences**, and **charity**, he practically shapes later doctrine even if he quotes earlier authorities. Another common misunderstanding is to treat him as a minor preface to **Aquinas**, whereas in fact Aquinas must first write a detailed commentary on Lombard’s **Sentences**, and the very structure of the medieval theological curriculum is Lombardian. Be prepared to connect Lombard’s schema of **four books** to later Reformed **loci** ordering, but emphasize that Westminster theology re-centers everything on **Scripture** and on the forensic doctrine of justification. Avoid speaking as if Reformed orthodoxy simply discards scholastic method; instead, frame the issue as **Reformed scholastics** critically reappropriating Lombard’s formal tools while repudiating his material errors.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Peter Lombard should be honored as a providentially significant **scholastic** who stabilized Trinitarian and Christological teaching and provided a formal template for later **systematic theology**, yet his legacy must be sharply distinguished from Reformed orthodoxy at the material points of **sacraments**, **grace**, and **merit**; we affirm his Augustinian instincts regarding the **Trinity**, predestination, and the primacy of divine grace, but we deny as non-negotiable any scheme in which sacramental operations and infused **charity** become the formal cause of justification or in which human satisfactions cooperate with Christ’s once for all satisfaction, and if asked where we land we should say that the Reformed receive Lombard’s careful ordering of doctrine and his respect for tradition as methodological gifts, yet we decisively return to *sola Scriptura* and *sola fide* against the sacramental-meritorious edifice that his **Sentences** helped entrench.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Peter Lombard** is the twelfth century scholastic whose **Four Books of Sentences** became the standard framework for Western theology and a key background to both medieval Catholic and later Reformed dogmatics.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Peter Lombard was born near **Novara** around 1100, studied in **Bologna** and **Paris**, and died as bishop of Paris in 1160.
- His major work is the **Libri Quattuor Sententiarum** c. 1155, organizing doctrine into four books on **Trinity**, **creation**, **Christ and grace**, and **sacraments and last things**.
- Later giants like **Aquinas** and **Bonaventure** wrote extensive commentaries on the **Sentences**, embedding Lombard into the medieval curriculum.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Lombard’s method is early **scholastic**, using the *lectio–quaestio–disputatio* pattern to harmonize **authorities** through reasoned distinctions.
- He treats **Scripture** as the ultimate norm but accesses it through the **Fathers** and the **Glossa Ordinaria**, giving de facto canonical weight to tradition.
- He uses **reason** and early **Aristotelian** categories ministerially, especially in **Trinitarian** and sacramental distinctions, without modern reflection on religious experience.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In **Trinity**, Lombard synthesizes **Augustine’s De Trinitate**, emphasizing one essence and three relations of origin and defending the Latin **filioque**.
- In **Christology and soteriology**, he affirms Chalcedon and develops a satisfaction account of the atonement, yet embeds it in a framework of **charity** and **merit**.
- In **sacraments**, he standardizes the list of **seven sacraments** and shapes later teaching on **baptism**, **penance**, and **Eucharist**, tending toward **transubstantiation** and ex opere operato causality.
- On **grace and merit**, he preserves **Augustinian** priority of grace but articulates a role for infused **charity** and meritorious works that prepares late medieval synergism.
- As an organizer of **loci**, he bequeaths the basic architecture for systematic theology that both **Thomist** and **Reformed scholastics** will adapt.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press Lombard’s sevenfold **sacrament** schema and ex opere operato logic against the Reformed view of two sacraments and the primacy of the Word.
- They will challenge his integration of **penance** and satisfactions into the application of redemption as undermining **justification by faith alone**.
- They will question his notion of **merit** and infused **charity** as the form of the virtues, in contrast to imputed righteousness and the non-meritorious character of good works.
- They will ask whether his reliance on **tradition** and patristic authority compromises *sola Scriptura* as articulated in the **Reformed confessions**.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Lombard vs Augustine** on grace and merit contrasts patristic monergism with early medieval sacramental-legal developments.
- **Lombard vs Aquinas** on **sacraments** shows the move from early scholastic compilation to a more fully worked out **Thomist** metaphysics of transubstantiation and merit.
- **Lombard vs Calvin** on **justification** highlights the shift from infused charity and merit to imputed righteousness and faith alone.
- **Lombard vs Turretin** on method contrasts early **scholastic** use of authorities with later Reformed scholasticism’s tighter subordination of tradition to **Scripture**.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Peter Lombard is the indispensable medieval systematizer whose **Sentences** gave the West its doctrinal scaffolding, yet from a Reformed standpoint his sacramental and merit structures must be fundamentally rejected even as his formal ordering of theology is gratefully retooled under *sola Scriptura* and *sola fide*.
