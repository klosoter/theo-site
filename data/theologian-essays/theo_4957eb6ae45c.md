### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Born in 1483 at Eisleben and trained at Erfurt, **Martin Luther** entered the Augustinian cloister in 1505 under **Johann Staupitz**, bearing the weight of medieval **via moderna** piety and *Anfechtung*. The intellectual setting was marked by **nominalist moral theology**, exemplified by **William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel**, where the pactum of God meets human doing. Through lecturing on the **Psalms 1513 to 1515** and **Romans 1515 to 1516** at **Wittenberg**, Luther moved from a performative iustitia to **alien righteousness** and **passive righteousness**, *iustitia aliena* and *iustitia passiva*, received in **sola fide**. Humanist **ad fontes** methods sharpened his **sola Scriptura** commitment, yet his epistemic stance was not rationalist but sacramental, a confidence in the **external Word** and the **Spirit** who binds Christ to the hearer. The shape of his **theology of the cross** repudiated a **theology of glory**, claiming that God is known in the humility of the crucified **Christ**. This method cohered with a dialectical **law and gospel** hermeneutic, a way to expose sin and deliver promise, and with distrust of **Aristotelian causality** in theology that might compromise **grace**.

#### 2. Break with Rome and the Scripture principle
The **95 Theses 1517** challenged the **indulgence** economy and **papal treasury of merits**, catalyzing debates with **Johann Tetzel**, **Cajetan at Augsburg 1518**, and **Johann Eck at Leipzig 1519**. In the **Heidelberg Disputation 1518**, Luther defined **theology of the cross** against **theology of glory**, claiming human works are mortally dangerous when commended as righteousness. The **Three Reformation Treatises of 1520** advanced the **Scripture principle** and reshaped the church. The **Address to the Christian Nobility** denied a clerical monopoly, erecting the **priesthood of all believers** under the **Word**. The **Babylonian Captivity of the Church** reduced the sacraments to **Baptism**, **Eucharist**, and **Absolution**, stripping away **sacrificial Mass** and asserting **sacramental union** over **transubstantiation**. The **Freedom of a Christian** articulated the paradox of the Christian, lord of all through **faith** and servant of all through **love**, grounding ethics in **justification by faith alone**. At the **Diet of Worms 1521**, Luther confessed conscience captive to **Scripture** and the **Word of God**, inaugurating exile and his **Wartburg** translation of the **New Testament 1522**, a public claim that the **vernacular Bible** reforms church and polity.

#### 3. Hermeneutic, proclamation, and the external Word
Luther’s method centered on **verbum externum**, the outward Word preached and sacramentally given. Against enthusiasts such as **Thomas Müntzer** and spiritualists, he insisted that the **Spirit** binds himself to **Scripture** and **preaching**, not to private revelations. The **law and gospel** distinction is a hermeneutical instrument rather than a canon within the canon, where **law** exposes sin and **gospel** delivers Christ’s promise. In the **Lectures on Galatians 1531 and 1535**, he sharpened **imputation** and **forensic justification**, defending **simul iustus et peccator**, at once righteous in Christ and a sinner in oneself. His sermon on **Two Kinds of Righteousness 1518** clarified that the Christian’s **passive righteousness** is received from **Christ**, while **active righteousness** flows toward neighbor in vocation. The **catechetical project of 1529**, the **Small Catechism** and **Large Catechism**, codified **doctrine of the Word**, **Commandments**, **Creed**, **Lord’s Prayer**, **Baptism**, **Confession**, and **Eucharist**, shaping households and parishes by the **means of grace**. This pedagogy became the engine of the **Lutheran** reformation, a sustained practice of preaching Christ and forming conscience.

#### 4. Justification, bondage, and the hidden God
At the heart of Luther’s soteriology stands **sola fide** in **sola gratia**, grounded in **solus Christus**. Justification is **forensic declaration**, an **alien righteousness** imputed to the ungodly, not a habit infused. In **The Bondage of the Will 1525**, written against **Erasmus** and his **Diatribe on Free Will**, Luther presented his most rigorous account of **monergistic grace**. The will after the fall is incurvatus in se, curved inward, incapable of turning to God without **grace**. He spoke of *Deus absconditus*, the hidden God whose inscrutable majesty terrifies speculation, and *Deus revelatus*, the revealed God in **Christ** who meets the sinner in promise. The distinction protects **assurance** by locating God’s favor in the **gospel** and not in the abyss of providence. This dialectic of **wrath and mercy**, **law and gospel**, **hidden and revealed**, gave Luther’s theology its dramatic cadence, yet always tethered to **Scripture** and the **Word** as sacramentally active.

#### 5. Church, ministry, and the two kingdoms
Ecclesiology for Luther is a theology of the **Word**. The church is creatura verbi, a creature of **preaching** and **sacrament**. In **On the Councils and the Church 1539**, he listed the **seven marks of the church**: **Word**, **Baptism**, **Eucharist**, **Keys**, **Ministry**, **Prayer**, and the **Holy Cross** of suffering. The **priesthood of all believers** does not dissolve the **office of ministry**, which is instituted for public **Word and sacrament**. In civil life, Luther articulated the **two kingdoms** doctrine, distinguishing the **spiritual rule through Word** from the **temporal rule through law and sword**. This distinction framed his responses to the **Peasants War 1524 to 1525**, where he condemned both oppressive princes and violent rebels, and his insistence on order tested his pastoral rhetoric in **Against the Murderous, Robbing Hordes**. His **Wittenberg** reforms included liturgical revision in the **German Mass 1526**, robust congregational **hymnody**, and continued **catechesis**, insistent that **faith comes by hearing** through divinely instituted means.

#### 6. Sacraments, Christology, and presence
In sacramental theology, Luther rejected **transubstantiation** and **sacrifice of the Mass**, but he defended the **real presence** by **sacramental union**. The bread remains bread and is truly the body of Christ by the Word’s promise. At **Marburg 1529**, he famously controverted **Huldrych Zwingli**, chalking hoc est corpus meum on the table to defend **is** against symbolic reductions. Luther’s Christology is Chalcedonian with emphases that feed the **communicatio idiomatum**, the communication of properties, in a robust genus maiestaticum where Christ’s human nature shares in divine majesty. This supports the ubiquity of Christ’s body for the **Eucharist**, an axis later formalized in **Lutheran Orthodoxy**. He retained **Baptismal regeneration**, infant baptism grounded in the **promise**, and a strong practice of **Confession and Absolution** as a personal application of **the Keys**. These commitments secure salvation as gift through **means of grace**, tied to **the external Word** rather than to human ascent or interior zeal.

#### 7. Confessional consolidation and polemics
After the initial breakthroughs, Luther moved to consolidate doctrine and discipline. The **Augsburg Confession 1530**, drafted by **Melanchthon**, set a moderate **Lutheran** statement over against **Rome** and the **Radicals**, while Luther counseled from **Coburg**. In the **Smalcald Articles 1537**, he gave a harder edge to **justification**, **Mass**, and **papal** claims. The **Galatians Commentary 1535** served as an anchor for **imputation**, **law and gospel**, and **Christian freedom**. His late **On the Jews and Their Lies 1543** is a grievous blemish, a polemical excess that has rightly drawn severe condemnation and complicates Lutheran reception. Conflicts with **Andreas Karlstadt** sharpened his sacramental and pastoral instincts, as did the **Antinomian Controversy** with **Johannes Agricola**, where Luther insisted on the **third use of the law** without surrendering the primacy of **gospel**. Preaching, disputations, and **Table Talk** together reveal a pastor-professor constantly pressing **Christ** into the conscience by the **Word**.

#### 8. Scripture, translation, and education
Luther’s **vernacular Bible 1534** reshaped the German language and democratized **Scripture**. His prefaces to biblical books functioned as hermeneutical guides, commending **Christocentric reading** and highlighting **Romans**, **Galatians**, and **John** without denying the **canon’s unity**. He extolled the **clarity of Scripture**, perspicuitas, as functional for **preaching** and **conscience**, though he acknowledged the necessity of **grammatical-historical work** and **Spirit-given understanding**. The **catechisms 1529** institutionalized **household religion**, urging fathers and mothers to teach, linking **creed**, **commandments**, and **prayer** to **Baptism** and **Eucharist**. Educational reform, universities, and schools were embraced as **temporal kingdom** tasks in service of the **spiritual kingdom**, with music and hymnody advanced as instruments of **catechesis**. The whole reform was a culture of the **Word**, making **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **song** the architecture of ecclesial life under the **gospel**.

#### 9. Doctrine in development and enduring contribution
Across three decades, Luther’s doctrinal development stabilized around **justification by faith alone**, the **law and gospel** hermeneutic, **means of grace**, and the **two kingdoms**. His early **theology of the cross** hardened into a hermeneutical habit that resisted **speculation** and pursued **promise**. The **Bondage of the Will** supplied a metaphysical restraint that guarded **monergism**, while his **Christology** precluded a distant deity by insisting that the **incarnate Word** is the place of salvation and assurance. Sacramentally, **sacramental union** sustained congregational life in **Baptism**, **Absolution**, and **Eucharist**, while **catechesis** ensured that households lived from **Word and prayer**. Institutional realities, from the **Schmalkaldic League** to university structures, served the reform yet also tied it to **German princely** power, a feature Luther accepted under **two kingdoms** logic. The enduring thesis is that God justifies the ungodly through the **external Word**, creating faith that clings to **Christ alone** and then gladly serves neighbor.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, much in Luther is foundational and much is contested. The **Scripture principle**, **forensic justification**, **imputation**, and **monergistic grace** in **Bondage of the Will** are warmly received, as is the **theology of the cross** that subverts **theology of glory** and enshrines the **external Word**. Yet contrasts are decisive. On the **Lord’s Supper**, **sacramental union** and the ubiquity implied by the **genus maiestaticum** are resisted in favor of the **extra Calvinisticum** and a **spiritual real presence** by the **Spirit** through **faith**. On the **law and gospel** relation, Reformed theology affirms the distinction but insists on a robust **third use of the law** within **covenant theology**, integrating moral normativity for sanctification without eclipsing **grace**. On **two kingdoms**, Westminster trajectories prefer **covenantal kingship of Christ** over all of life, a redemptive-historical frame that assigns **Scripture** principled authority in culture without collapsing church and state. Luther’s dialectic of *Deus absconditus* and *Deus revelatus* is valued for protecting **assurance**, yet Reformed sources tend to locate decree and covenant together in **Christ**, minimizing unresolved tension. Finally, Luther’s openness to images and liturgical forms contrasts with **Reformed regulative worship**, and his severe late polemics are admonitory for a catholic charity. The agenda for a Reformed appropriation is to keep Luther’s **Christ-alone justification and preaching of promise**, while correcting sacramental **presence**, strengthening **covenant and law’s third use**, and expanding **kingdom** horizons beyond the strict **two kingdoms** partition.
