### TITLE
Meredith Kline retools classic Reformed covenant theology through ancient Near Eastern treaty forms, offering powerful insight into Scripture’s structure while introducing a republication paradigm that presses hard on Westminster’s law–gospel formulations.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Meredith G. Kline** (1922–2007) worked in the mid to late twentieth century, teaching at **Westminster**, **Gordon-Conwell**, and **Westminster California** amid the rise of neo-evangelicalism and critical **biblical theology**.
- His context is the Vosian **redemptive-historical** movement post-1940s, interacting with higher criticism, **ancient Near Eastern** studies, and debates over theonomy and two-kingdoms **Reformed ethics**.

- Methodologically he is a rigorously text-driven **biblical theologian**, connecting exegesis with canonical and typological structures rather than with philosophical systems.
- Kline’s epistemic stance is **Van Tilian** in presuppositional tone yet strongly historical, treating **revelation** as covenantal word-event embedded in real ANE history.
- He emphasizes *historia revelationis* over timeless abstractions, using **ANE suzerainty treaties** to frame how God speaks, while remaining confessional about **Scripture’s authority**.

- In **Treaty of the Great King** (1963) Kline argues that Deuteronomy is structured as an ANE **suzerainty treaty**, grounding a covenantal view of **canon** and authority.
- In **By Oath Consigned** (1968) he develops a sacramental theology of **baptism** as covenantal oath-sign, stressing judgment as well as blessing.
- In **Kingdom Prologue** (unpublished typescript widely circulated, finalized around 2000) he elaborates his overall **covenant theology**, especially the prelapsarian **works principle** and typological kingdoms.
- In **God, Heaven and Har Magedon** (2006) he gives a symbolic, covenantal reading of **eschatology** and **prophetic** imagery in light of heavenly archetype and earthly copy.

- His decisive doctrinal impact is in **covenant theology** and the structure of law and gospel, especially the republication of the **covenant of works** at Sinai.
- He also deeply shapes Reformed **hermeneutics** and **biblical theology**, especially typology, temple and kingdom motifs, and canonical structure.
- He matters significantly for Reformed **sacramentology**, **church–state** relations, and critiques of theonomy in debates over common grace and the cultural mandate.

- A Westminster committee will want you to affirm Kline’s high view of **Scripture**, strong **covenant theology**, and robust redemptive-historical exegesis in continuity with **Vos**.
- They will also expect you to qualify or resist some formulations of **republication**, law–gospel, and his more radical **intrusion ethics** and two-kingdom implications.

- In discussion you should be ready to compare Kline with **Geerhardus Vos** on biblical theology and typology, stressing continuity and differences.
- You should also be ready to contrast Kline with **theonomy** advocates like **Greg Bahnsen** and with more traditional covenant theologians like **John Murray**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Meredith **G. Kline** was born in 1922 and trained within the mid twentieth century American Reformed world, studying at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in the orbit of **Cornelius Van Til** and **Geerhardus Vos** and later teaching at Westminster, Gordon-Conwell, and Westminster California. His intellectual formation combined classic confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** with a deep immersion in **ancient Near Eastern** languages and treaty forms at a time when biblical studies were dominated by higher criticism and liberal **biblical theology** movements. He sought to answer the problem of how to maintain a fully orthodox, inerrantist view of **Scripture** while engaging modern historical and literary scholarship at a high level. For Kline the driving question was how the covenantal God of **redemptive history** orders his relationship with humanity and structures the canon through historically and theologically meaningful covenants.

The key to Klines project is his conviction that the Bible is a unified, covenantally ordered **treaty document** in which God the great king binds himself to a vassal people through formal **oath** and historical sanctions. Influenced by ANE studies on **Hittite suzerainty treaties**, especially in **Treaty of the Great King**, he saw Deuteronomy and other covenantal texts as intentionally adopting a treaty pattern that grounds the authority of the written word as covenant charter. This allows him to respond to critical claims about the late composition or purely human shape of the Pentateuch by arguing that Israel’s **covenant form** itself is divinely intended and historically realistic. The theological problem he presses is therefore twofold. First, how to articulate covenant theology with exegetical precision rather than broad dogmatic generalities. Second, how to relate the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** to the Mosaic economy in a way that does justice to the sharp Pauline contrast between law and gospel in **Galatians** while preserving the unity of the one way of salvation by grace through faith.

These concerns emerge in Kline’s interactions with both liberal **biblical scholars** and conservative **Reformed theologians** like **John Murray**. Against the former he insists on divine authorship, covenant sanction, and a real prelapsarian **probation**. Against the latter he worries that some views of the Mosaic covenant and of **biblical law** tend to flatten the redemptive-historical distinctions and fail to reckon with what he calls the republication of the works principle at Sinai. Throughout his career, from **By Oath Consigned** through **Kingdom Prologue**, Kline is trying to solve the problem of how to read the whole Bible as a covenantal constitution that moves from creation kingdom, through Israel as typological kingdom under probation, to the consummated kingdom in Christ, without erasing the confessional **law–gospel** antithesis.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Kline’s method is rigorously **Scripture-first**, but Scripture read in light of its redemptive-historical progression and its ancient Near Eastern environment. In continuity with **Vosian biblical theology** he stresses that God’s **revelation** unfolds in history by divine initiative and is then inscripturated in covenant documents. For Kline, theology must be exegetical, covenantal, and eschatological. His reliance on ANE treaty research is not a capitulation to historical criticism but an application of **general revelation** in history that illumines special revelation’s form. When he shows in **Treaty of the Great King** that Deuteronomy fits the structure of second millennium Hittite treaties, he intends to show that God speaks in real historical forms without surrendering any aspect of **inspiration** or canonical authority.

On **reason** Kline is broadly Van Tilian. He does not seek a neutral natural theology but assumes the antithesis between belief and unbelief, affirming **presuppositional** commitments while engaging scholarly data as God’s common grace gift. Rationality is covenantal. Human reason is always within an oath-bound relationship to God. He thus rejects Enlightenment autonomy but also resists a fideistic retreat. His embrace of careful lexical and form-critical work is governed by a conviction that **Scripture** is self-interpreting within its covenant structures. In **Kingdom Prologue** and **Images of the Spirit** he models tightly argued biblical-theological reasoning, where doctrines like the **covenant of works**, common grace, and the Spirit’s work are inferred from intertextual and typological patterns more than from isolated proof texts.

Kline treats **experience** and **church tradition** as subordinate and derivative. He respects the Reformed confessions, especially the **Westminster Standards**, and sees himself as operating within their covenantal framework, yet he is willing to revise traditional formulations in light of what he views as clearer redemptive-historical exegesis. For example, in his debates over the Mosaic covenant and **republication** he engages both the **Marrow tradition** and figures like **Murray**, arguing that confessional language about the moral law as a rule of life must be read alongside the national covenant’s typological and legal functions. The **church’s** role is to confess and administer the covenant documents through word and sacrament. In **By Oath Consigned** he interprets baptism and the Lord’s Supper as covenant ratification oaths that bind the visible community to Christ, highlighting the seriousness of sacramental participation as a two-edged blessing or curse.

For **history**, Kline is intensely interested in the movement from creation to consummation as the backbone of theology. In line with **Vos**, he insists that doctrines such as **justification**, **sanctification**, and the **kingdom of God** must be located within the epochs of covenant history. His method leans heavily on typology: the **Adamic covenant**, Noahic common grace, Abrahamic promise, Mosaic republication, Davidic kingship, and the new covenant in Christ as antitype. Yet he labors to avoid loose allegorizing by rooting these types in explicit textual links. This method can generate tension with more systematic Reformed approaches that begin with **ordo salutis** or attributes of God, but Kline would argue that proper systematics is the careful summarizing of the **history of special revelation**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **covenant theology and law–gospel**, the classic Reformed baseline distinguishes a prelapsarian **covenant of works** with Adam, a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** administered in various dispensations, and a clear forensic law–gospel contrast in **justification**. Kline reaffirms this confessional structure but gives it sharp redemptive-historical refinement through his doctrine of **republication**. In works like **Kingdom Prologue** and essays such as **Law Covenant** he argues that at Sinai God re-enacts the works principle with Israel as a corporate Adam. The Mosaic covenant, at the typological level of the national theocracy, is conditioned on Israels obedience as the ground of their tenure in the land. This is not a return to works for individual salvation but an intrusion of the eschatological judgment principle into history. His chief interlocutors include more continuity-leaning Reformed theologians like **Murray** and the **Marrow** tradition, as well as critics like **Richard Gaffin** who fear a confusion of law and gospel. Kline insists that Paul’s contrast of law and promise in **Galatians 3** is best explained if the Mosaic covenant, in its typological kingdom aspect, operates on a works footing, thereby magnifying Christ as the one true obedient Israel in the **new covenant**.

Second, in the locus of **hermeneutics, Scripture, and canon**, the confessional baseline holds that the Bible is the inspired and infallible word of God, self-attesting and sufficient for faith and life, with a covenantal unity centered on **Christ**. Kline advances this baseline by showing how the very form of biblical books reflects covenant structure. In **Treaty of the Great King** he argues that Deuteronomy functions as Israels covenant document patterned on ANE **suzerainty treaties**, with preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, sanctions, and deposition clauses. This supports a high doctrine of **canon**: the written word is the charter of the covenant community, a legal witness in the heavenly court. In **Structure of Biblical Authority** he further articulates how prophets, priests, and kings serve as covenant emissaries whose writings carry treaty-level authority. He opposes liberal scholars who treat these forms as merely human borrowing, arguing instead that God sovereignly appropriates common cultural forms to inscripturate his covenant revelation. His interlocutors here include critical biblical theologians like **Gerhard von Rad**, whom he appreciates for salvation-historical concerns but critiques for weakening the forensic, covenantal dimension of Scripture.

Third, in the locus of **church, sacraments, and covenant community**, the baseline Reformed view sees the visible church as the covenant community in which **word and sacrament** mark people off from the world, with infant baptism as the sign and seal of the covenant of grace. Kline shares this covenantal ecclesiology but radicalizes the seriousness of sacramental participation by stressing sacrament as **oath-sign**. In **By Oath Consigned** he argues that baptism and the Lord’s Supper are covenant ratification rites that place participants under the sanctions of the covenant, for blessing or curse. This allows him to interpret warning passages like **Hebrews 6** and **1 Corinthians 10** in terms of visible covenant members who are sanctified in an external sense yet may fall under judgment. He thereby supports paedobaptism on the basis of covenant inclusion while challenging any presumption that the sign automatically conveys saving grace. His main interlocutors here include **Baptist** theologians who deny infant baptism and some within Reformed circles who resist the sharpness of his sanction language. He wants to preserve both the objectivity of covenant privilege and the reality that covenant breakers, though truly in the external administration, are liable to greater judgment.

Fourth, in the locus of **culture, common grace, and eschatology**, the classic Reformed baseline affirms a distinction between the holy church and common civil order, with **common grace** restraining sin and enabling culture, while the kingdom of God climaxes in the new heavens and new earth. Kline develops this in his doctrine of **intrusion ethics** and his symbolic reading of prophetic and apocalyptic imagery. In **The Structure of Biblical Authority** and later in **God, Heaven and Har Magedon** he argues that the holy war and theocratic judgments in the Old Testament are intrusions of final judgment into history. They are not paradigms for ongoing statecraft or ethics but typological eruptions of the eschaton. This undercuts theonomic readings like those of **Greg Bahnsen**, who see Mosaic civil law as a binding blueprint for modern states. Kline contends instead for a sharp distinction between the common order under the **Noahic covenant** and the redemptive kingdom order of the church. Eschatologically, he emphasizes the heavenly archetype of the temple and city, with earthly copies pointing forward to the consummated **New Jerusalem**. His symbolic, covenantal reading of **Revelation** resists both dispensational literalism and liberal demythologizing, maintaining a robust future bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
In relation to classic **Reformed orthodoxy**, Kline stands self-consciously in the line of **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** on the doctrines of God, Scripture, and salvation by grace alone, while drawing particularly on **Vos** for his biblical-theological method and on **Van Til** for a covenantal epistemology. His insistence on a real **covenant of works** with Adam recovers strands evident in **Turretin** and the Westminster **Confession**, in contrast to Murray’s more cautious language about the Adamic administration. His emphasis on law–gospel antithesis in **justification** aligns with classic Protestantism and provides a strong antidote to moralistic or neonomian tendencies. At the same time, his formulation of **republication** of the works principle at Sinai has provoked significant debate among Reformed theologians, including within the Westminster orbit, because some fear it suggests a works principle within the one covenant of grace or undermines the third use of the law as a rule of gratitude.

From a Westminster standpoint, at least two points require careful objection or qualification. First, some of Kline’s language about the Mosaic covenant as a works covenant for national Israel, even with his typological caveats, can appear to conflict with the **confessional** assertion that the covenant of grace is one in substance across administrations and that the Mosaic law is a rule of life for believers. Second, his strong two-kingdoms and **intrusion** emphasis, though congenial in opposing theonomy, can be read as discouraging Christian cultural engagement in ways that go beyond **Calvin’s** doctrine of civil vocation. Yet there are rich areas where Reformed theology can and should learn from him. His covenantal structuring of **canon**, his detailed typological reading of **temple**, kingdom, and Sabbath in **Kingdom Prologue**, and his treatment of sacraments as serious covenant oaths can all deepen confessional preaching and sacramental practice. His engagement with ANE treaty forms gives Reformed theologians confidence to handle historical-critical data while maintaining a strong doctrine of **inerrancy** and divine authorship.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, some sentences are safe to use almost verbatim. You can say that **Meredith Kline** is a twentieth century Reformed biblical theologian who developed covenant theology by reading Scripture’s form and content through ancient Near Eastern treaty patterns while seeking to uphold classic Protestant law–gospel distinctives. You can also safely affirm that Kline stands in continuity with **Vos** and **Van Til** by insisting that revelation is covenantal and historical and that the Bible is the covenant charter of the kingdom of God. It is also safe to summarize his main contribution as clarifying the structure of the **covenant of works**, emphasizing the typological nature of the Mosaic economy, and articulating a robust doctrine of **common grace** and intrusion ethics against theonomy.

There are phrases you must avoid or at least qualify. You should not say that Kline teaches the Mosaic covenant is simply a **covenant of works** for salvation, since he is careful to limit the works principle to the typological national layer and to affirm one way of salvation by grace in Christ. Instead say that he teaches a **republication of the works principle** at the level of Israels tenure in the land. Avoid implying that Kline denies the ongoing **third use of the law** or that he is antinomian, since he views the moral law as abiding for believers while sharply distinguishing it from the covenant of works principle. Also avoid speaking of his approach as a **radical two-kingdoms** theology without nuance. Better to say that he distinguishes the **Noahic common grace order** from the redemptive kingdom and that this has been developed in different ways by later two kingdoms advocates.

Examiners may exploit common misunderstandings. Some students assume Kline is simply an ANE scholar who lets extra-biblical data govern exegesis, so be ready to insist that for him ANE material is subordinate to **Scripture’s self-witness** and used to illuminate not control the text. Others think republication means Israel could earn salvation by works, so be prepared to explain his corporate and typological categories and to appeal to **Galatians 3–4** as his exegetical ground. Another misunderstanding is to treat Kline as the father of an ethically quietist two-kingdoms, so you should note that he affirms Christian engagement in the common kingdom while rejecting attempts to repristinate the Israelite theocracy or to impose Mosaic civil law as binding today. Finally, some caricature his sacramental view as making baptism merely external. Answer by stressing his covenantal objectivity in **By Oath Consigned**, where he insists that sacraments truly place people in the sphere of Christ’s lordship, for blessing or judgment, which intensifies rather than diminishes their seriousness.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Meredith **Kline** is a deeply valuable yet sometimes controversial ally who powerfully reinforces covenantal, redemptive-historical reading of **Scripture**, a robust **covenant of works**, and the law–gospel antithesis in justification, while innovating in ways that require careful confessional calibration. We should affirm his high doctrine of biblical authority, his covenantal structuring of canon and history, his serious view of sacraments as oath-signs, and his critique of theonomy through **intrusion ethics** and a renewed doctrine of common grace. We should resist any formulations of **republication** that seem to blur the one substance of the covenant of grace or that obscure the abiding third use of the law and the unity of Mosaic and new covenant believers in Christ. If asked where to land, a Westminster candidate can say that Kline’s basic instincts about the **Adamic probation**, the typological function of Israel, and the covenantal form of Scripture are sound and helpful, yet his specific Mosaic covenant proposals should be received as stimulating biblical theology to be tested and qualified by the **Westminster Standards** rather than as a controlling dogmatic grid.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Meredith **Kline** is a twentieth century Reformed biblical theologian who used ancient Near Eastern treaty forms to sharpen covenant theology, especially on the covenant of works, republication, and the structure of Scripture.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Meredith **G. Kline** lived from 1922 to 2007 and taught at **Westminster**, **Gordon-Conwell**, and Westminster California in the context of Vosian biblical theology and Van Tilian apologetics.
- In **Treaty of the Great King** (1963) Kline argued that Deuteronomy is structured as an ANE **suzerainty treaty**, grounding Scripture’s authority as covenant charter.
- In **By Oath Consigned** (1968) and **Kingdom Prologue** (final form around 2000) he developed his sacramental and overall **covenant theology**, focusing on oath, works principle, and typological kingdoms.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Kline knows God through **special revelation** in Scripture read redemptive-historically, with ANE treaty studies serving as subordinate illumination of biblical covenant forms.
- His epistemology is broadly **Van Tilian**, rejecting neutral reason while using historical and literary scholarship within a presuppositional, covenantal framework.
- He treats **church tradition** and confessions as important but revisable in light of careful biblical-theological exegesis of the history of **revelation**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Kline strongly reasserts the **covenant of works** with Adam and argues for a **republication** of the works principle in the Mosaic covenant at the level of Israel’s tenure in the land.
- He interprets **Scripture** as a collection of covenant-treaty documents, with Deuteronomy and similar texts functioning as written charters that establish **canon** and authority.
- In **By Oath Consigned** he presents **baptism** and the Lord’s Supper as covenant oath-signs that objectively place participants under blessing-or-curse sanctions within the visible church.
- His **intrusion ethics** and **Noahic common grace** doctrine distinguish the typological Israelite theocracy from the common civil order, undercutting **theonomy** and defending two-kingdom style distinctions.
- He offers a symbolic and typological **eschatology** in works like **God, Heaven and Har Magedon**, seeing temple and city imagery as earthly copies of a heavenly archetype leading to consummation.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press whether **republication** language about Sinai as a works covenant is compatible with the confessional unity of the **covenant of grace**.
- They will question whether Kline’s sharp law–gospel and typological readings of Moses sufficiently safeguard the ongoing **third use of the law** for believers.
- They may challenge whether his strong two-kingdom and **intrusion** emphases risk minimizing Christian cultural engagement beyond what **Calvin** and **Bavinck** affirm.
- They will probe whether his creative biblical-theological constructions remain normed by the **Westminster Standards** or sometimes let ANE and literary models overdetermine doctrine.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- Compare **Kline vs Murray** on the **covenant of works** and the structure of the Mosaic covenant.
- Compare **Kline vs Bahnsen** on **theonomy**, Mosaic civil law, and the ongoing role of Israel’s theocracy.
- Compare **Kline vs Vos** on **biblical theology**, typology, and redemptive-historical method.
- Compare **Kline vs classic Reformed orthodoxy** like **Turretin** and **Bavinck** on covenant unity, law–gospel, and the doctrine of **common grace**.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Meredith **Kline** is a gifted Reformed biblical theologian whose covenantal and redemptive-historical insights are immensely fruitful when carefully subordinated to, and sometimes corrected by, the doctrinal boundaries of the **Westminster Confession**.
