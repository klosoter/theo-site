### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
J. **Ligon Duncan III** emerges from the late twentieth-century Southern Presbyterian milieu that birthed the **Presbyterian Church in America** in 1973, a conservative realignment against mainline erosion of **biblical inerrancy** and **confessional fidelity**. Born in the 1960s and educated in the Carolinas, he studied at **Furman University** before undertaking ministerial formation at **Covenant Theological Seminary** in the mid-1980s, where the influence of **John Murray** on **covenant theology** and **Geerhardus Vos** on the **history of redemption** were mediated through a confessional curriculum. He completed doctoral work at the **University of Edinburgh, New College** in the mid-1990s, researching **Scottish Presbyterianism** and the development of **covenant doctrine**, supervised within a context shaped by scholars like **David F. Wright**. This Anglo-American formation placed **Duncan** within the resurgence of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**, simultaneously reading the **Westminster Standards** historically and pastorally while engaging contemporary **evangelical** debates over **Scripture**, **gospel**, and **church**.

At the level of method, **Duncan** self-consciously inhabits the role of the **pastor-theologian**, ordering doctrinal work to the life of the **church** under the **ordinary means of grace**. His epistemic stance is confessional and grammatical-historical. He privileges **Sola Scriptura** and insists on *tota Scriptura*, reading the canon by the architectonic of **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and a pretemporal **covenant of redemption**. This covenantal architecture underwrites his hermeneutic of redemptive unity, articulating the **ordo salutis** within the **historia salutis** and anchoring **forensic justification** by the **imputation** of Christ's righteousness. His approach to **dogmatics** and **exegesis** is ecclesially located and vows-bound, aligning interpretation with the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and Catechisms as the church's subordinate standard.

#### 2. Pastorate, professorship, and institutional leadership
The center of **Duncan's** public ministry is twofold: the pastorate and the theological school. From 1996 to 2013 he served as Senior Minister of **First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi**, a flagship **PCA** congregation marked by morning-and-evening **Lord's Day** worship, catechesis, and **psalm-hymn** singing under the **regulative principle of worship**. This pulpit ministry demonstrated an ethic of **expository preaching**, **Sabbatarian** piety, and the centrality of **Word and sacrament**, modeling the ordinary means vision in a large, multi-generational context. In 2013 he became Chancellor and CEO of **Reformed Theological Seminary**, consolidating a multi-campus network and continuing as Professor of **Systematic and Historical Theology**. These institutional roles signal his sustained investment in the transmission of **Westminster** confessionalism through pastoral formation, curriculum design, and faculty mentoring.

Ecclesially, **Duncan** served as Moderator of the **PCA General Assembly** in 2004, chaired or supported denominational committees, and participated in drafting or commending **ad interim** reports. In the evangelical coalition space, he was an early and continuing partner in **Together for the Gospel** with **Mark Dever**, **Albert Mohler**, and **John Piper**, crafting statements of **evangelical** consensus on **atonement**, **justification**, and **Scripture** while keeping a Presbyterian accent on **covenant** and **church**. His leadership thus triangulates between confessional Presbyterian identity, interdenominational evangelical partnership, and institutional stewardship for **Reformed** theological education.

#### 3. Works, themes, and doctrinal development
Though primarily a preacher and editor, **Duncan's** publications structure his doctrinal profile. In **Does Grace Grow Best in Winter?** published in 2001, he advances a pastoral theodicy grounded in **divine providence**, **immutability**, and **goodness**, exhorting believers to receive trials as instruments of **sanctification** and **assurance** under the **Father's** wise sovereignty. The argument exemplifies his commitment to **ordinary piety**, drawing heavily on **Puritan** and **Scottish** devotion to frame suffering within the **covenant of grace** and the Spirit's **mortificatio et vivificatio**.

As editor of the three-volume **The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century** between 2003 and 2009, **Duncan** assembled essays by contemporary **Reformed** scholars to expound and apply the **Confession's** loci, including **Scripture**, **God and the Holy Trinity**, **decrees and providence**, **Christ the Mediator**, **justification**, **sanctification**, **worship**, and **church government**. The project is methodologically programmatic: modern challenges are met not by abandoning but by retrieving and deploying **seventeenth-century orthodoxy** in conversation with present exegesis and pastoral need. The set functions as both a commentary and a handbook for confessional ministry.

In **Women’s Ministry in the Local Church** with **Susan Hunt** published in 2006, **Duncan** articulates a **complementarian** ecclesiology that affirms male eldership and **headship** while positively structuring women's discipleship, diaconal service, and teaching within biblically ordered channels. He argues from **creation order** in Genesis 2, from **Pauline** directives in **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 11 and 14**, and from the **household** architecture of **Titus 2**, insisting that complementarity arises from creational and redemptive design rather than cultural accommodation. The volume exemplifies an approach that pairs principled **exegesis** with practical ministry formation and church polity.

A further vein of **Duncan's** work lies in sustained teaching and essays on **covenant theology**, frequently in RTS venues and collections culminating in contributions to a 2020 **Crossway** volume devoted to **biblical, theological, and historical perspectives**. Here **Duncan** defends the classic tripartite **foedera** frame, distinguishing the prelapsarian **covenant of works** from the postlapsarian **covenant of grace**, and locating the pactum salutis, or **covenant of redemption**, in the eternal counsel of the **Trinity** *ad intra* as it grounds the **Mediatorial** mission *ad extra*. He deploys this structure as a hermeneutical key that safeguards the unity of **law and gospel**, the continuity of the **one covenant of grace** administered diversely, and the integrity of **infant baptism** as sign and seal of **covenantal inclusion**.

#### 4. Dogmatic emphases: Scripture, gospel, church, and worship
Across his output, **Duncan** returns to four dogmatic centers. First, **Scripture**: he adheres to **inerrancy** and the **Chicago Statement**, but always couples it with the **sufficiency** and **perspicuity** of Scripture for the ordering of the **church**. His hermeneutical default is canonical, redemptive-historical, and attends to the analogy of faith within the **Westminster** frame. Second, the **gospel**: he defends **penal substitutionary atonement**, **active and passive obedience** of Christ, and **forensic justification** by grace through faith, with the **imputation** of Christ's righteousness as non-negotiable. Against reductionist or transformative-only accounts, he maintains that **union with Christ** yields a **duplex gratia** of **justification** and **sanctification**, irreducibly distinct though inseparable.

Third, **church**: as a **Presbyterian**, **Duncan** advances a jure divino **eldership**, parity of presbyters, graded courts, and **church discipline** as marks alongside **Word and sacrament**. He favors ordinary, weekly celebration of the **Lord's Supper**, robust **catechesis**, and the **spirituality of the church** that centers the church's mission on making disciples rather than on political activism, even while commending principled **public theology** from **natural law** and Scripture. Fourth, **worship**: his advocacy of the **regulative principle of worship** yields services structured by **Scripture reading**, **preaching**, **prayer**, **psalm and hymnody**, and the **sacraments**. He resists market-driven, seeker-targeted liturgies, arguing that *lex orandi, lex credendi* operates under Scripture's positive warrant, not under aesthetic or pragmatic preference.

#### 5. Polemics and pastoral apologetic in contemporary debates
In the 2000s **Duncan** engaged controversies that cut to the core of **Reformed** soteriology and ecclesiology. He opposed **open theism** for its denial of exhaustive divine **foreknowledge** and for its construal of **providence** inconsistent with **immutability** and **simplicity**. He participated in denominational and coalition responses to the **New Perspective on Paul**, warning that reconstruals of **justification** as ecclesial boundary-marking or covenant membership risked evacuating **imputation** and **forensic righteousness**. Most decisively, he supported the **PCA**'s 2007 **ad interim** report critical of the **Federal Vision**, arguing that the movement's formulations on **baptism**, **election**, and **union with Christ** blurred or denied the **covenant of works**, confused **decree** and **administration**, and undercut assurance by collapsing **justification** into **faithfulness**.

These polemics were conducted not only in essays and committee rooms but through preaching and pastoral instruction. **Duncan's** rhetoric is characteristically irenic yet firm, privileging congregational clarity over academic novelty. He stresses catechetical depth, urging churches to teach **confessional standards** so that lay believers can discern the stakes of controversies over **atonement**, **imputation**, and **sacramental efficacy**. His public apologetic frames disputes with an eye to the **communion of the saints**, retrieving **Puritan** and **Scottish** voices to stabilize and guide present judgment.

#### 6. Gender, creation order, and discipleship
Beyond polemics, **Duncan's** constructive work on **complementarianism** is a hallmark. As a longtime council member of **CBMW** and signatory of the **Danvers Statement**, he argues that **male and female** are created by God with ontological equality and vocational differentiation ordered to mutual edification. He reads **kephalé** in **1 Corinthians 11** as headship entailing responsibility and sacrificial leadership, not domination, and he interprets **1 Timothy 2.12** as a normative restriction of authoritative teaching and governance to qualified men in the church. Yet he insists that **women’s ministry** is essential, biblically rich, and strategically resourced through **Titus 2** discipleship, diaconal labors, and robust theological education. The resulting ecclesial ecosystem pairs fidelity to **creation order** with a positive summons to deploy women's gifts under **eldership**, avoiding both clericalism and the neglect of half the church.

He also addresses contemporary questions of **sexual ethics** and **anthropology**, affirming the **Nashville Statement** and classical Christian teaching on marriage, chastity, and identity. Here, as elsewhere, **Duncan** engages culture with pastoral gravity, directing consciences back to **Scripture**, **creational norms**, and the goodness of divine design, while discipling congregations to combine conviction with compassion.

#### 7. Suffering, providence, and the ordinary means
In pastoral theology **Duncan** emphasizes the church's ordinary life under **providence**. **Does Grace Grow Best in Winter?** anchors sanctification in trials that God ordains for growth in **faith**, **hope**, and **love**. He draws on **Thomas Boston**, **Samuel Rutherford**, and the **Westminster divines** to commend a piety of contentment and perseverance, where the **means of grace** are sufficient instruments of divine consolation. The themes extend to counseling, where **Duncan** resists therapeutic reductions and calls for the recovery of **catechesis**, **prayer**, and **sacramental** practice as the church's distinctive resources for care.

This ordinary means emphasis dovetails with his critique of programmatic or pragmatic ecclesiologies. He urges ministers to recover the **pastorate** as a theological office ordered to **Word and sacrament**, not managerial success, and to train elders in **shepherding** rather than board governance. The **regulative principle of worship** functions here as pastoral wisdom: worship ordered by God's command shapes the church in truth and stability, insulating it from fads while freeing it for mission.

#### 8. Ecclesial catholicity and evangelical coalition
While unabashedly **Presbyterian**, **Duncan** pursues a principled catholicity across the **Reformed** and **evangelical** landscape. In **T4G** and related networks he framed consensus statements around **gospel essentials**, welcoming **Baptists**, **Anglicans**, and **Free Church** partners without diluting **Presbyterian** commitments. He speaks of a two-tiered doctrinal map: catholic **evangel** at the center, confessional **Reformed** boundaries for church life, and prudential cooperation for mission. This posture lets him defend **penal substitution**, **inerrancy**, and **justification** in coalition spaces while reserving **covenant theology**, **sacraments**, and **polity** for ecclesial confession.

His institutional work at **Reformed Theological Seminary** extends this catholicity by fostering faculty and students across Calvinistic communions, yet always within the **Westminster** frame. He models an ecumenism of conviction, not compromise, leveraging shared commitments to **Scripture** and the **gospel** for public witness while deepening confessional identity at home.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** perspective, **Ligon Duncan** exemplifies the virtues of confessional fidelity under pastoral vocation: a covenantally structured **Sola Scriptura**, unwavering defense of **forensic justification**, and a thick account of **church** and **worship** ordered by the **regulative principle**. His retrieval of **Westminster orthodoxy** against **Federal Vision** and **NPP** is salutary, as is his catechetical insistence on **ordinary means** and his robust complementarian **creation order** case. Tensions remain. First, the evangelical coalition model, while strategic, can blur the principled priority of the visible **church** over **parachurch** in the Reformed doctrine of ministerial authority and **means of grace**. A WTS-leaning corrective would press the primacy of confessional ecclesiology and guard against allowing coalition consensus to set the terms of theological debate. Second, complementarian argumentation sometimes risks collapsing exegesis into culture-war framing; Reformed alternatives should sustain full-orbed **biblical theology** with careful attention to redemptive-historical development and to the breadth of **patristic** and **Reformed** exegesis, maintaining principled restriction of eldership while enriching accounts of **prophecy**, **prayer**, and **diaconal** leadership among women. Third, on public theology, his appeal to **natural law** alongside Scripture is prudent, yet a WTS emphasis would foreground **special revelation** and **covenant** more determinatively in defining the church's speech in the public square, wary of overconfidence in shared rationality after the fall. These are tensions of accent rather than direction. Overall, **Duncan's** synthesis of **Westminster** doctrine, covenantal hermeneutics, and pastoral practice offers a compelling contemporary instance of classical **Reformed** catholicity anchored in the **ordinary means of grace**.
