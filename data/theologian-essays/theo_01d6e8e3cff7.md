### ESSAY
Richard B. Gaffin Jr. stands as a principal architect of late modern **Reformed biblical theology**, forming a bridge from **Geerhardus Vos** and **John Murray** to contemporary disputes over **Pauline soteriology** and **pneumatology**. Teaching for decades at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia and ministering in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, he honed an exegetical craft that made the once-for-all events of **Christ’s resurrection and Pentecost** determinative for the ongoing application of salvation. His scholarly milieu included the ascendant **Pentecostal-charismatic** movement and the swelling tide of the **New Perspective on Paul**, which made the grammar of **justification**, **union with Christ**, and **the gifts of the Spirit** urgent matters of exegetical and dogmatic clarity. Across this terrain, his constant axioms were **Scripture’s self-attesting authority**, a Van Tillian posture of epistemic dependence, and the Vosian conviction that **inaugurated eschatology** sets the horizon for every locus of dogmatics.

#### 1. Method
Gaffin’s method is crisply stated in his consistent appeal to the relation of *historia salutis* and *ordo salutis*, the history of redemption and the order of salvation, with **history norming order**. In his classroom and publications he pressed students to let **Acts and Paul** interpret one another, to read the *ἐν Χριστῷ* motif as ontological participation rather than mere metaphor, and to see the **Spirit of the risen Christ** as the agent of new creation. His hermeneutic affirmed the coherence of **biblical theology and systematic theology**, yet insisted that the grammar of systematic construction must be keyed to the climactic once-for-all acts of **resurrection, ascension, and Pentecost**. He rejected any bifurcation of **forensic** and **transformative** soteriology, locating both in *unio cum Christo*. He also maintained a self-consciously ecclesial posture, writing for the **church’s catechesis**, pastoral formation, and confessional integrity.

#### 2. Main Thesis
The early monograph **Resurrection and Redemption** from 1978 set the enduring thesis of Gaffin’s work, that the **resurrection of Christ** is not a discrete apologetic datum but the soteriological center of **Pauline theology**. Reading **Romans 4.25** and **1 Corinthians 15**, he argues that justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification are bound to the believer’s participation in the **resurrection-status of Christ**. The ordo salutis is thus an ordered explication of what it means to be united by the **Spirit** to the **eschatological Christ**. Faith is instrumental, yet the Spirit’s uniting work is the ontological hinge on which the benefits swing. The dominical passage, He was raised for our justification, signals that **δικαίωσις** is not a pre-union legal fiction but a verdict delivered in and with **union with the risen Lord**. This argument reframes justification’s priority as a matter of logical order within the comprehensive enclosure of **union with Christ**, while refusing any erosion of its forensic character.

#### 3. Soteriology
In developing this soteriology, Gaffin retrieves **Calvin’s duplex gratia**, the double grace of **justification and sanctification**, as twin aspects of the one **unio cum Christo**. The believer’s new existence is anchored in the **eschatological Spirit** who applies what **Christ has accomplished** in history. The ascension and session are not epilogue but the form of the church’s present salvation, since the exalted Christ pours out the **πνεῦμα** as the firstfruits of the new creation. Adoption, assurance, and perseverance in this frame are fruits of being seated with **Christ in the heavenly places**, not mere psychological states. Here Gaffin’s debt to **Vos’s inaugurated eschatology** is explicit, yet he presses the Vosian insight into the marrow of **systematic loci**, showing how **resurrection union** recalibrates the interpretation of **law and gospel**, **faith and works**, and the telos of **sanctification** as conformation to the **Second Adam**.

#### 4. Pneumatology
The programmatic treatment of **pneumatology** and ecclesial gifts in **Perspectives on Pentecost** from 1979 complements the soteriological center. Gaffin reads **Acts 2**, **Joel 2**, and **Ephesians 2.20** to argue that **Pentecost** is a redemptive-historical event that founds the church on the once-for-all ministry of **Christ and his apostles**, rendering **revelatory gifts** like prophecy and tongues epochally bounded. The **apostolic signs** confirmed a canonical foundation, Hebrews 2 underscores God bearing witness by various miracles, and thus the ordinary pattern for the church’s life becomes the ministry of **Word and sacrament** under the completed canon. He refuses a rationalistic **cessationism** and instead argues a **redemptive-historical cessation** that ties the ending of revelatory gifts to the closure of foundational revelation, preserving expectation for the **Spirit’s sanctifying power** and his ordinary operations in prayer, witness, and holiness. This position exhibits Gaffin’s union of careful **exegesis** and ecclesial sobriety.

#### 5. Engagement with New Perspective on Paul
Against the backdrop of the **New Perspective on Paul**, **By Faith, Not by Sight** first in 2006 and then expanded in 2013, offers a concentrated restatement of **justification by faith alone** while keeping **union with Christ** central. Gaffin engages **E. P. Sanders**, **James D. G. Dunn**, and **N. T. Wright** by disputing their construal of first-century Judaism as covenantal nomism that leaves no room for the classic Reformation diagnosis of sin and law. He defends **imputation** and the eschatological finality of the **cross and resurrection**, and he resists the notion of a two-stage justification that would make future vindication dependent on works as a second instrument. At the same time, he integrates **final judgment according to works** with **sola fide** by treating good works as Spirit-wrought evidences inseparable from faith within **unio cum Christo**. The titular contrast, by faith not by sight, is an eschatological axiom drawn from **2 Corinthians 5**, locating Christian existence between Christ’s resurrection and his parousia, living from the Spirit’s down payment rather than from sight.

#### 6. Biblical-Theological Approach
The editorial volume **Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation** in 1980 signaled Gaffin’s role as a premier steward of **Vos’s legacy**. By collecting the shorter writings of **Geerhardus Vos**, he kept before a new generation the grammar of **eschatological exegesis** that reads the whole canon as the unfolding of the **covenant of grace** toward its consummation in **Christ**. This editorial service is not ancillary to his own theology but integral, because his argument for the priority of *historia salutis* over *ordo salutis* requires a concrete view of the Bible’s **organic unity** and **epochal structure**. Through essays and theses he modeled a scholarly habit in which **Romans** is read in the light of **Acts**, in which **Pentecost** is as dogmatically pivotal as **Calvary**, and in which **the ascension and session** are the church’s living environment.

#### 7. *In the Fullness of Time* (2022)
All of this comes to mature synthesis in **In the Fullness of Time** from 2022, a capstone that distills decades of Gaffin’s lectures on **Acts and Paul**. He maps the **already and not yet** with a steady focus on the **ascended Christ**, the **Spirit’s down payment**, and the church as an **eschatological community** whose worship and mission flow from the heavenly session. The book insists that **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** cannot be pried apart, since the **Spirit of Pentecost** is the Spirit who gathers, equips, and sanctifies the body as the earthly theater of the age to come. The volume reiterates the pastoral payoff of viewing **union with Christ** as the believer’s existential anchor, the source of **assurance**, and the ground of perseverance amid suffering in a world that groans for **resurrection glory**.

#### 7. OPC
Gaffin’s ecclesial labors match his academic rigor. As a minister in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, he helped frame denominational responses to the **Federal Vision** and the **New Perspective**, contributing to the **OPC Report on Justification** in 2006 with a steady insistence on **sola fide**, **imputation**, and **covenant theology** attuned to **redemptive history**. He mentored generations of pastors shaped by **WTS’s redemptive-historical preaching**, for whom **Word and sacrament** are proclaiming and sealing participation in the **risen Christ**. His essays on the **Sabbath**, the **Lord’s Day**, and **assurance** exhibit the same pattern, relocating ethics and piety inside the frame of **eschatological life** shared with the **Second Adam**. The public witness is thus that of a scholar-pastor whose theology serves the **church’s confession** and the **mission of the gospel**.

#### 8. Interlocutors
Interlocutors across the twentieth century shadow his work. He inherits **B. B. Warfield’s** concern to demarcate **apostolic revelation** from subsequent church life, yet he reframes the question through **Vos’s inaugurated eschatology** rather than through a bare theory of miracle. He appropriates **Herman Bavinck’s** richly synthetic **Reformed dogmatics**, especially on **union with Christ** and **grace restoring nature**, while adopting **Calvin’s** robust **autothean** Christology and **duplex gratia** as active coordinates. Against **Rudolf Bultmann’s** existential demythologizing and modern anti-supernaturalism, he insists on the historicity and efficacy of **resurrection**. Against **Pentecostal** claims that Acts is a prescriptive template for a second blessing, he answers that Acts is a **salvation-history narrative** of irreversible transition to the **last days**. Against **N. T. Wright’s** redescription of justification as mere declaration of covenant membership, he replies with classic **forensic justification** in union and with **imputation** as a Pauline category, while welcoming renewed attention to **ecclesiology** and the corporate scope of salvation.


#### 9. Distinctive Contribution
The distinctive contribution of Gaffin’s corpus lies in the systematic payoff of **resurrection union**. He does not merely say that the resurrection matters; he shows that **resurrection and ascension** explain why **justification** is definitive, why **sanctification** is irreversible and progressive, why **adoption** seals filial confidence, and why **glorification** is certain with the **Spirit as arrabon**, that is, the pledge. His thesis that *historia salutis* norms *ordo salutis* is not a slogan but a method, correcting any temptation to treat **ordo** as an abstract ordo of timeless or metaphysical processes. Salvation is not an assembly line of benefits; it is the church’s participation by the **Spirit** in the life of the **risen and enthroned Christ**. This yields a theology of preaching in which the **gospel** is the heralding of what has happened once for all and what is now present by the **Spirit**, and a sacramental theology in which **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are union signs and seals that presuppose the **exalted Lord’s** real presence by the **Spirit**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
Gaffin’s insistence that **union with the risen Christ** frames the whole **ordo salutis** has chastened both purely **forensic reductions** and **transformative collapses**, preserving **sola fide** while recovering **eschatological pneumatology**. His **redemptive-historical cessationism** guards the church from revelatory anarchy while leaving abundant room for the **Spirit’s ordinary power**. His critique of the **New Perspective** and **Federal Vision** preserved confessional **imputation** and **justification** without sacrificing the corporate and eschatological breadth of **Pauline theology**. Questions remain. Some fear that the insistence on union as the comprehensive category can blur the **logical priority of justification** within union, a priority affirmed in **Reformed orthodoxy** from **Calvin** through **Turretin**. Others question whether the hermeneutic that reads **Acts** primarily as non-prescriptive overly restricts expectations for extraordinary providences, even while acknowledging the unique **apostolic foundation**. A classical alternative would grant that *ordo salutis* is normed by *historia salutis* yet would emphasize clearer dogmatic sequencing, for example the **immediate imputation of Christ’s righteousness** as logically prior to the believer’s renewal, and would ground cessation not only in **redemptive history** but also in a doctrine of **sufficiency of Scripture**. Even with these cautions, within the family of **Westminster confessional** theology, Gaffin’s work stands as a durable pattern for integrating **exegesis, redemptive history, and dogmatics**, a pattern that will continue to instruct preachers and theologians who want the **risen Christ** at the center of all Christian doctrine and practice.
