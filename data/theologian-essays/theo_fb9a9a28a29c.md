### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the Roman craft of doctrine
The figure known as **Leo the Great** emerged within the late **Patristic** world where the Roman Empire’s structures were fragile and the church’s conciliar settlements decisive. Born in Tuscany around 400 and elected bishop of Rome on 29 September 440, **Pope Leo I** brought to the **apostolic see** a distinctive Roman habitus that combined civil administration, forensic rhetoric, and disciplined pastoral care. As deacon under **Celestine I** and **Sixtus III**, he handled doctrinal correspondence that sharpened his sense of **ecclesial order** and **doctrinal boundaries**. His episcopate unfolded amid the theological aftershocks of **Ephesus 431** and the political upheavals of **Attila’s invasion** in 452 and **Geiseric’s sack** in 455, which lent urgency to his conviction that doctrine stabilizes the church in turbulent history. The context for his work was the fight to articulate **Christ’s identity** against **Nestorian separation** and **Eutychian confusion**, and to consolidate **Roman primacy** among competing patriarchates, especially **Alexandria** and **Constantinople**.

Leo’s method was not speculative but juridical and pastoral, shaped by the Roman instinct for ratio and order. He deployed **biblical exegesis** that was typological and christocentric, riveted to the rule of faith from **Nicaea** and **Ephesus**, yet attentive to the distinct force of **Latin categories** such as **natura**, **persona**, and **officium**. The bishop of Rome assumed a magisterial voice grounded in **Petrine primacy**, claiming that the **apostolic see** preserves and judges **orthodox doctrine** for the universal church. The hallmark of this method is the capacity to state complex truths plainly, as in the balance of **two natures** and **one person**, and to bind dogma to salvation, so that christology bears soteriological weight through the **admirabile commercium**, the wondrous exchange of divinity and humanity for human redemption.

#### 2. Works and the rhetoric of doctrinal governance
The corpus of **Sermones** and **Epistulae** forms the laboratory of Leo’s theology. The **Sermones** are liturgical preaching adjusted to the Roman calendar, with concentrations on **Nativity**, **Epiphany**, **Lent**, and **Pentecost**, where Leo develops a catechesis of the **Incarnation** and **Passion** as **sacramentum et exemplum**, sacrament and example, that both confer grace and pattern Christian virtue. The **Epistulae** reveal the administrative genius of the papacy: letters to **Flavian of Constantinople** and **Pulcheria** address christological disputes; letters to **Ravenna**, **Arles**, and **Spain** address jurisdiction, discipline, and heresy. The pivotal **Tome to Flavian** in 449 articulates the **two-natures, one-person** doctrine in lucid Latin that proved decisive at **Chalcedon 451**. Additionally, the rescript of **Valentinian III** in 445, secured through Leo’s influence, codified the **primacy of Rome** against **Hilary of Arles**, and thus fused doctrinal and canonical claims in a single vision of **Petrine service** to the universal church.

This literary strategy is deliberate. **Leo the Great** pairs doctrinal clarity with imperial-recognized jurisdiction, so that the **apostolic see** teaches authoritatively and adjudicates disputes for the sake of unity. The rhetoric is alternately doxological and forensic. In the sermons, the paradoxes of the **Incarnation** take the form of antiphonal praise that is also dogmatic precision: the same Christ is **impassible as God** yet **passible as man**, **equal to the Father** according to divinity yet **less than the Father** according to humanity. In the letters, the tone sharpens into decrees that establish lines of accountability among metropolitans, invoking **Peter’s authority** as a living norm. This rhetorical doubleness embeds **christological doctrine** into the church’s habits of preaching and governance.

#### 3. The Tome to Flavian and the grammar of Christ
The **Tome to Flavian** is Leo’s enduring contribution to **Christology**. Written in June 449 to **Flavian of Constantinople**, it answered the one-nature christology of **Eutyches**, who claimed the human nature of Christ was absorbed into the divine after the Incarnation. Leo’s text is a tour de force of **two-natures orthodoxy**, expressed in the formula that the one and same Son is perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, truly God and truly man, consubstantial with the Father according to the Godhead and consubstantial with us according to the manhood. The Tome insists that **each nature performs what is proper to it** in communion with the other, the classic **communicatio idiomatum**, the communication of properties, without confusion or division. Thus the one Christ can be said to be born, suffer, die, and rise, since the **subject of the actions** is the single **person** of the Son, while the **modes** of acting are truly those of the **divine** or **human nature**.

Leo’s strategy leans on **Cyril of Alexandria** while correcting Alexandrian excess. He affirms Cyril’s **hypostatic union** and the unity of the acting subject, yet refuses **monophysite** tendencies by emphasizing intact **natures** in the one **person**. He criticizes **Nestorianism** by refusing any split of the subject of the Incarnation and criticizes **Eutychianism** by refusing a fusion of essences. He uses a hermeneutic of **prosopological exegesis** in which scriptural statements predicated of Christ are assigned to the appropriate nature while maintained as predications of the one person. The Tome’s balance of precision and soteriology is in service of salvation: only if Christ is truly divine does he heal, and only if he is truly human does he heal us. This echoes the classic patristic axiom, what is not assumed is not healed, and grounds the **admirabile commercium** whereby the riches of his divinity become ours through the poverty of his humanity.

#### 4. Chalcedon 451 and the cry that Peter has spoken through Leo
At the **Council of Chalcedon** in 451, called by **Emperor Marcian** and **Empress Pulcheria**, the reading of **Leo’s Tome** evoked acclamation that **Peter has spoken through Leo**, a sign that the council judged the Tome to express the faith of the apostles. The council’s **Definition of Faith** enshrined the **one person in two natures** formula, without confusion, change, division, or separation, and thus reconciled **Cyrillian** and **Antiochene** parties in a stable synthesis. Leo’s insistence that the **subject of predication** is always the one Son safeguards the liturgical and soteriological center of Christian confession, so that the one who hung on the cross is the **Lord of glory** according to his **person**, while the **impassible Godhead** remains impassible according to **nature**.

Nevertheless, Leo navigated the aftermath with political caution. He resisted concessions to **Alexandria** that might weaken **Roman primacy**, especially the controversial Canon 28 of Chalcedon which elevated **Constantinople** to second rank with privileges in the East. Leo’s letters accept the **dogmatic** clauses of the council but reject the **canonical** aggrandizement of New Rome over the older patriarchates, appealing to **Petrine authority** and **Roman primacy** as rooted not in imperial favor but in the conferral of keys by Christ. Chalcedon thus reveals Leo’s dual legacy: architect of a catholic **christological settlement** and guardian of a **Roman ecclesiology** that would structure Western self-understanding for centuries.

#### 5. Soteriology, sacrament, and moral formation in the Sermones
Leo’s **Sermones** cultivate a soteriological vision where **Incarnation** and **Passion** are both **sacramentum**, conferring grace, and **exemplum**, shaping Christian life. In his **Nativity** sermons, the paradox is joyous: the **virgin’s womb** is the workshop where the one who made all things adopts our substance, so that **divine condescension** becomes human elevation. He frames salvation as **participation**, for Christ’s humility becomes our exaltation, the classic **admirabile commercium**. In **Lenten** preaching, fasting and almsgiving are not vehicles of merit unmoored from grace but responses to the **gratia** that flows from the cross, practices that conform believers to the **form of the Servant**. The sacraments are described as **sacramenta** that effect what they signify, so that in **baptism** the old man dies and in the **Eucharist** the faithful are nourished by the body and blood of the same Christ whose two natures remain united in the one person.

The sermons display a **prosopological** reading of Scripture that interprets the Psalms and prophets as alternating voices of Christ according to **divinity** and **humanity**. When Christ prays in weakness, Leo assigns this to the **assumed nature**. When Christ commands with authority, he assigns this to the **divine nature**. Yet the actor is always the single **person** of the **Son**. This exegetical habit trains the church to confess **Christ crucified** as the heart of the **economy of salvation**, and binds doctrinal confession to liturgical celebration and moral transformation. Leo’s pastoral aim is unity in truth, holiness in charity, and the formation of a people whose virtues mirror the **humility** and **majesty** joined in the **one Lord**.

#### 6. Ecclesiology and the Petrine office
For **Leo the Great**, **Petrine primacy** is not a mere honor but an **officium** that guarantees catholic unity and the integrity of the **sacramental economy**. He repeatedly calls himself **Vicarius beati Petri**, the vicar of blessed Peter, and locates the Roman office within **apostolic succession** that bears a unique responsibility to confirm the brethren. The 445 **rescript of Valentinian III** effectively aligned imperial power with the **Roman see**, curbing the initiative of **Hilary of Arles** and reinforcing the metropolitan hierarchy under Rome. In letters to **Gaul**, **Spain**, and **Africa**, Leo insists that appeals in doctrinal and disciplinary matters lie with Rome, which exercises **sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum**, care for all the churches, as the head exercises care for the body.

This ecclesiology is mystical and legal. It draws on the metaphor of **Peter speaking through Leo** as a sacramental sign of Christ’s care for the church, and on the canonical network that orders bishops to their metropolitans and metropolitans to Rome. It is also dogmatically grounded: the **unity of Christ’s person** mirrors and founds the unity of the **church’s body** under a visible head, just as the **two natures** remain without confusion or division, so the **charisms and orders** of the church maintain diversity without schism. Leo’s Roman ecclesiology thus ties **christology**, **sacrament**, and **jurisdiction** into a single fabric of truth and order.

#### 7. Controversies, politics, and the defense of the West
Leo’s episcopate was marked by decisive interventions not only in doctrine but also in social crisis. He confronted **Eutychianism** in the East and in the West moved against **Manichaeans** in Rome, organizing catechesis, penance, and expulsion where necessary to safeguard **orthodoxy**. He addressed remaining **Pelagian** tendencies by affirming **original sin** and **grace**, urging bishops in **Italy** and **Spain** to maintain Augustinian teaching on human inability without **gratia Christi**. He wrote to **Turibius of Astorga** to combat **Priscillianism**, and he defended orthopraxy regarding the date of **Easter** and the integrity of **marriage**. His moral theology tied these disciplines to the **order of creation** healed and elevated by **redeeming grace**.

In politics, Leo became a symbol of pastoral courage. In 452 he met **Attila the Hun** near the river Mincio and secured a withdrawal from Rome, combining diplomacy with spiritual authority. In 455 he confronted **Geiseric** the Vandal and negotiated moderation in the sack of Rome. These acts cemented his image as defender of the **civitas Dei** within the faltering **civitas terrena**. For Leo, imperial power and ecclesial office were distinct yet cooperative under divine providence. The **apostolic see** speaks the truth of the **Gospel** to emperors and kings, calling them to justice and clemency, while the church’s **sacramental life** offers a polis beyond decline, anchored in the **one Lord** who rules in humility and glory.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and the Roman style of theology
Leo’s doctrinal synthesis is crisp. The **Incarnation** is the person of the **Son** assuming a complete **human nature** while remaining truly **divine**. The **communicatio idiomatum** is carefully defined as communication of properties to the **person**, not an interchange of **essential attributes** between natures. The soteriological logic is the **admirabile commercium**, by which Christ’s divine riches are transferred to the faithful through his human poverty, so that believers become sons in the Son. The unity of **person** ensures the efficacy of the **Passion**, since the subject who suffers in the flesh is the eternal **Lord of glory**, and the distinction of **natures** preserves the integrity of **divine impassibility** and the reality of **human suffering**. This logic enabled **Chalcedon** to balance the gains of **Cyril of Alexandria** with the precision of the **Antiochene** tradition and thus set a norm for all later **Christology**.

Ecclesiologically, the same Roman style yields a theology of **Petrine primacy** as the visible principle of unity that protects the confession of the **one person** of Christ in the **two natures**. The **sacraments** are administered in the church’s ordered body so that the **grace of Christ** reaches the faithful through instituted means, especially **baptism** and the **Eucharist**. Moral exhortation flows from this sacramental realism, as the virtues of humility and charity imitate the **kenosis** of the Lord and manifest his **majesty** in the life of the saints. The whole is a seamless garment of **doctrine**, **discipline**, and **devotion**, articulated in the measured cadences of a Roman lawyer turned pastor who believed that the **apostolic see** must both teach and shepherd with authority and compassion.

#### 9. Reception and Reformed evaluation
The patristic and medieval West received **Leo the Great** as a doctor of **Christology** and a founder of **papal ideology**. His **Tome to Flavian** became a standard text for the **Chalcedonian** settlement, informing the **Lateran** and **Tridentine** doctrinal articulations and shaping the language of the **Roman Missal** at Christmastide that still sings the **admirabile commercium**. The sermons influenced Western preaching on the **Nativity**, **Lent**, and **Pascha**, and the letters shaped canonical consciousness regarding **Roman primacy** and **episcopal jurisdiction**. Modern scholarship recognizes his capacity to integrate the gains of **Cyril** and **Theodoret** without reduction, and to hold together doctrinal acumen with pastoral governance under the strain of imperial collapse.

From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Leo’s **Christology** ranks as a decisive gain that the Reformed fully receive. The **Westminster Confession of Faith 8** affirms the **one person in two natures** with claims that almost paraphrase Leo’s logic that each nature acts according to its properties in the unity of the person. His **anti-Pelagian** stress on **grace** and human need resonates with the **doctrines of total inability** and **sovereign grace**. The tension appears in **ecclesiology** and aspects of **sacramental realism**. The Reformed reject the **magisterial supremacy** of the **apostolic see**, insisting on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **ministerial** nature of church authority under Christ the only head. They also qualify Leo’s idiom of **sacramentum et exemplum** by subordinating the exemplar to the **covenant of grace**, and by guarding against any conferral of **merit** to fasting or almsgiving apart from faith. Where Leo’s **nature-grace** ordering tends to ground ecclesial hierarchy in a visible principle of unity, the Reformed locate unity in the **Word and Spirit**, the pure preaching of the **Gospel** and right administration of the **sacraments**, with **presbyterial** rather than **papal** polity. Yet on the central **christological dogma** that secures the Gospel of God with us and for us, Leo remains a shared teacher whose Roman clarity continues to serve catholic truth.
