### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Gavin Ortlund emerges within the broader **evangelical** world shaped by late-modern fragmentation and digital discourse, seeking to heal doctrinal and ecclesial fissures through **retrieval** and **irenic polemics**. The son of pastors within the **Ortlund** family network, he trained in historical theology and later combined pastoral ministry with a public theological presence through the **Truth Unites** platform. His ethos is distinctly **Scripture-first** yet hospitable to the **Great Tradition**, convinced that evangelical integrity depends on **Pro-Nicene** and **Augustinian** anchors. Methodologically he blends **evangelical ressourcement** with **theological triage** and a modest **natural theology**, aiming for persuasion by cumulative case rather than polemical victory. The result is a posture of **Reformational catholicity** that prizes **classical theism**, **creatio ex nihilo**, and **sola scriptura**, while engaging charitably with **Roman Catholic** and **Eastern Orthodox** critiques of Protestantism.

This formation yields an emphasis on **doctrinal rank** and **ecclesial humility**, both pastoral and academic in tone. Ortlund reads **Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas** alongside **Calvin** and **Turretin**, arguing that evangelical health requires recovering **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, **immutability**, and **eternal generation**. Against flattening biblicism he advocates a canon-rule hermeneutic grounded in **Scripture’s sufficiency**, yet he insists that the church must listen to consensual **patristic and medieval** voices. In this, he aligns with recent **ressourcement** energies in Protestant theology, mediated by figures like **John Webster** and **Kevin Vanhoozer**, though he articulates the program for a wide evangelical audience.

#### 2. The program of retrieval and its guardrails
Ortlund’s **Theological Retrieval for Evangelicals** (2019) makes a principled case that evangelical renewal depends on recovering **doctrinal grammar** from the **Great Tradition**. He argues that the Reformers did not sever ties with catholic orthodoxy but re-centered it under **sola scriptura**; therefore evangelicals should study **Nicaea**, **Chalcedon**, and **scholastic** distinctions without embarrassment. His case studies commend doctrines like **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**, the **beatific vision**, and classically framed **atonement** motifs, contending that such metaphysical and teleological commitments stabilize exegesis and worship. The book’s key contrast is between **chronological snobbery** and **ressourcement**, with Ortlund insisting that the ancient and medieval materials serve biblical faithfulnes rather than threaten it.

At the same time, Ortlund frames retrieval with evangelical guardrails: **Scripture’s magisterial authority** over tradition; chastened use of **natural theology**; and pastoral criteria of **edification** and **mission**. He challenges both **anti-intellectual biblicism** and an uncritical **Rome-ward nostalgia**, stressing that the Reformers themselves relied on **Augustine** and **Aquinas** while resisting institutionalized accretions. The governing burden is ecclesial: retrieval is not antiquarianism but a medicine for **doctrinal amnesia**, ordered to the church’s proclamation of the **Triune God** and **gospel of grace**.

#### 3. Triage, unity, and Protestant identity
In **Finding the Right Hills to Die On** (2020), Ortlund operationalizes unity through **theological triage**. Building on **Al Mohler’s** heuristic, he proposes prioritizing first-rank doctrines like the **Trinity**, **two-natures Christology**, **the gospel of justification by faith**, and **Scripture’s authority** as essential to Christian identity. Second-rank matters such as **baptism**, **church polity**, and **gendered offices** may require separate congregational fellowship while respecting mutual recognition. Third-rank and lower questions like **millennial views** or certain **spiritual gifts** should ordinarily not divide local churches. The aim is to resist a culture of hair-trigger separation while preserving the theological integrity of the **creedal and Reformational** core.

Triage functions not as indifferentism but as pastoral wisdom for a polarized **evangelical** field. Ortlund’s argument hinges on identifying dogmatic loci that are architectonic for the **gospel** and **Trinitarian** confession. He appeals to a **mere Protestantism** that is thicker than lowest-common-denominator Evangelicalism yet thinner than any one confession’s totality, gesturing to **Reformational catholicity** as a posture that can honor **Augustinian** orthodoxy, cherish **Reformed soteriology**, and still listen to **Lutheran** and **Baptist** distinctives. This strategic balance allows his work to inform churches across the spectrum while clarifying the gravity of **heresy** versus ordinary **disagreement**.

#### 4. Doctrine of God and classical theism
A defining axis of Ortlund’s theology is allegiance to **classical theism**. Across essays, debates, and podcasts, he defends **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, **immutability**, and **aseity** as the metaphysical entailments of **creatio ex nihilo** and **Pro-Nicene** trinitarianism. He retrieves **Augustine’s** and **Aquinas’s** grammar and shows continuity with **Reformed scholastics** like **Turretin**, arguing that Scripture’s portrayal of God’s perfections requires affirming that God is not composed of parts and that all divine attributes are identical to the divine essence. Against **neo-classical** proposals associated with figures like **William Lane Craig**, he contends that **simplicity** safeguards the unity of God, secures **divine freedom** in creation, and underwrites **inseparable operations**.

Trinitarianly, Ortlund defends **eternal generation** and **processions** as the conceptual heart of Nicene theology. He seeks to correct evangelical confusions fostered by **eternal functional subordination** by re-centering **homoousios**, **relations of origin**, and **inseparable operations** in the missions of the Son and Spirit. In emphasizing **ad intra** processions as the ground of **ad extra** missions he reasserts classical trinitarian order without collapsing persons into functions. This doctrinal labor is not mere boundary-policing; he frames it as worshipful clarification, a needed repair for an **evangelical** culture that too often marginalizes metaphysics.

#### 5. Creation, Augustine, and science
In **Retrieving Augustine’s Doctrine of Creation** (2020), Ortlund revisits **Augustine’s** exegesis of **Genesis** to calibrate contemporary evangelical debates over **creation and science**. He highlights Augustine’s commitments to **creatio ex nihilo**, **providence**, and **goodness of creation** while exploring Augustine’s distinctive views of **seminal reasons** and the possibility of an instantaneous creation unpacked over time. Ortlund argues that Augustine’s hermeneutic resists premature literalism about the **six days**, thereby undercutting the notion that a **young-earth** chronology is the only faithful reading. While he does not collapse doctrinal boundaries around **Adam**, **sin**, and **providence**, he urges humility and patience, commending a retrieval that can host informed discussion of **old-earth** models within an Augustinian frame.

The constructive point is more hermeneutical than scientific: by retrieving **Augustine**, evangelicals can integrate exegetical caution, **doctrinal realism**, and openness to empirical findings without yielding on **creation’s dependence** or the **Creator-creature distinction**. This resists both a conflict model with science and an accommodationist erosion of **doctrinal non-negotiables**. The payoff is a more durable evangelical theology of creation that can converse with **natural philosophy** and **cosmology** while remaining anchored in **Genesis** and **Nicaea**.

#### 6. Anselm and the grammar of desire
Ortlund’s academic work on **Anselm** in **Anselm’s Pursuit of Joy** (2020) advances a theological anthropology in which desire and reason converge in the ascent to God. Attending to the **Proslogion**, he presents **faith seeking understanding** as a liturgical rationality where argument and prayer coinhere. Anselm’s famous argument becomes, in Ortlund’s reading, a school of **beatitudo**, orienting desires to the **summum bonum**. This anchors evangelical spirituality within **classical theism**, showing that metaphysical precision need not extinguish devotion but can feed **contemplation** and **joy**.

The Anselmian theme complements Ortlund’s wider retrieval: **desire** becomes a theological lens through which one can see the attractive power of **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. He contends that a church catechized by **Anselm** will pray better, think more clearly, and resist reducing doctrine to utility. For evangelicals anxious about scholasticism, the Anselmian witness is a proof-of-concept that **metaphysics** can be pastorally nutritive.

#### 7. Aesthetic apologetics and the cumulative case
In **Why God Makes Sense in a World That Doesn’t** (2021) Ortlund offers a cumulative case for **Christian theism** that foregrounds **beauty**, **moral realism**, and the intelligibility of the world. He compares **naturalism** and Christian theism across explanatory domains like rational inference, objective morality, consciousness, and the experience of beauty, contending that theism possesses superior **explanatory scope** and **depth**. This is not a rigid deductive **natural theology** but an abductive trajectory, leaning into **aesthetic apologetics** influenced by **C. S. Lewis** and compatible with classical arguments. He argues that beauty is not an ornament but a clue to **transcendent order**, and that the Christian story uniquely unites the world’s rational and affective dimensions.

The apologetic is evangelistic and catechetical: it seeks the **nones** and the deconstructing, proposing that **classical theism** is not a technical cul-de-sac but the best account of lived experience. Ortlund’s defense of **creatio ex nihilo**, **divine simplicity**, and the **incarnation** in this frame ties metaphysics to narrative and destiny, moving from explanatory patterns to the **gospel**. Even where he employs probabilistic language, the thrust is existential invitation under the summons of **Scripture**.

#### 8. Protestant-Catholic-Orthodox dialogue and ecclesial posture
Through the **Truth Unites** project and in **What It Means to Be Protestant** (2024), Ortlund articulates **mere Protestantism** as a chastened, historically rooted identity. He argues that Protestantism is a legitimate heir to the **Great Tradition**, not a schismatic novelty, because **sola scriptura** judges tradition without discarding it. Engaging Catholic apologists on **papal primacy**, **justification**, and **Marian dogmas**, and interacting with Orthodox concerns about **filioque** and liturgical continuity, he projects a posture that is both firm on **Reformation** essentials and open to **catholic** enrichment. The governing contrast is between confessional integrity and sectarian isolation.

This ecclesial posture accompanies a call to rediscover **creeds**, **catechesis**, and **sacramental seriousness** within evangelicalism, even as Ortlund remains Baptist on **baptism** and **polity**. He appeals to **Calvin** and **Turretin** to rebut the charge that Protestantism is metaphysically thin, showing how **Reformed scholasticism** preserves **divine attributes** and **trinitarian** grammar. The net effect is to normalize theological depth within the evangelical mainstream, while maintaining clarity on disputes that still divide communions.

#### 9. Pastoral theology, tone, and pedagogy
Across his corpus, a pastoral concern governs Ortlund’s **tone** and **method**. He frames doctrinal controversy through **humility**, calls for repentance where **tribalism** reigns, and models charity toward opponents. His pedagogy integrates **historical theology** with popular apologetics and churchly catechesis, aiming to make **divine simplicity** and **eternal generation** as preachable as they are defensible. He repeatedly warns that impatience with **metaphysics** impoverishes worship, while overreaction against modern errors can breed new ones. The recurring refrain is that health in doctrine serves health in mission, and that retrieval is an engine for renewal in **evangelical** preaching and discipleship.

In this pastoral register, Ortlund weds **unity** to **orthodoxy**, seeking a church that refuses both minimalism and maximalist factionalism. His practical counsel on **theological triage** equips leaders to adjudicate disagreements wisely, protecting the **gospel** while welcoming variety on secondary matters. This is retrieval aimed at congregational life, not merely at the seminar room.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage point, Ortlund’s strengths are considerable: a robust defense of **classical theism**, careful retrieval of **Augustine** and **Aquinas** in service to **Reformed orthodoxy**, and a clear affirmation of **sola scriptura**, **Pro-Nicene** trinitarianism, and **justification by faith**. His correction of **EFS** by way of **eternal generation** and **inseparable operations** is salutary, and his pastoral deployment of **theological triage** has stabilized many ministries. Nevertheless, certain tensions merit clarification. First, his modest **natural theology** and **aesthetic apologetics** risk, at points, a common-ground posture that Westminster’s **covenantal apologetics** would reframe under **revelation’s** principial role and the antithesis of **covenant obedience** and **unbelief**. A Van Tillian approach would insist that the intelligibility and beauty he highlights can only be accounted for on the basis of the self-attesting **Triune God**, rather than through comparative probability, even if abductive rhetoric may serve evangelistic prudence. Second, the appeal to **Augustine** on creation could be sharpened to protect explicit commitments to a **historical Adam**, **federal headship**, and **original sin** in ways that foreclose evolutionary anthropologies incompatible with **covenant theology** and **Romans 5**. Third, while **theological triage** is useful, Reformed churches may prefer confessional boundaries grounded in **covenant doctrine** and **means of grace**, lest triage acculturate evangelicals to a free-church minimalism that weakens **ecclesiology** and the **sacraments**. Finally, Ortlund’s **Baptist** ecclesiology keeps him at some distance from a **Reformed** view of covenant children and the visible-invisible church distinction; yet his Reformational catholicity and classical metaphysics make him a valued ally whose work can be received gratefully while supplemented by **presuppositional method**, confessional **covenant theology**, and a thicker doctrine of the church.
