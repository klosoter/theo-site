### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Bryan Chapell emerges in the closing decades of the twentieth century as a pastor-scholar within the **Presbyterian Church in America** whose vocational center is **expository preaching** reformed by a **redemptive-historical hermeneutic**. Educated in both theology and rhetorical theory, with doctoral training in communication that sharpened his homiletical pedagogy, Chapell joined the faculty of **Covenant Theological Seminary** in St. Louis and then served as president from 1994 to 2012. Those years spanned the consolidation of **biblical theology** in conservative seminaries, debates over **narrative preaching** and seeker-sensitive pragmatics, and renewed attention to **Reformed confessionalism**. In this setting, Chapell crafted a method that holds together *sensus literalis* and *analogia fidei*: the text’s authorial intent is honored within the canon’s **promise-fulfillment** unity in Christ, while sermonic communication is shaped by classical rhetoric’s concerns for unity, clarity, and movement.

Chapell’s pastoral appointments before and after his presidency, notably his return by 2013 as Senior Pastor of **Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria**, tethered his method to ecclesial realities. His election as **Stated Clerk of the PCA** in 2020 situated his voice within denominational discourse through 2024. Theologically he stands within the **Westminster Standards**, advocating **covenant theology**, **justification by faith**, and **union with Christ**, yet his signal contribution is methodological: the insistence that the church’s imperatives arise from gospel indicatives, and that sermons must trace how Scripture’s **redemptive-historical** plot culminates in **Christ’s person and work** for sinners.

#### 2. Christ-Centered Preaching and the Fallen Condition Focus
The cornerstone of Chapell’s oeuvre is **Christ-Centered Preaching: Redeeming the Expository Sermon** first published in 1994 with subsequent editions in 2005 and 2018. Here he crystallizes the **Fallen Condition Focus** as the unifying homiletical lens: every biblical text addresses some aspect of our fallen condition, and faithful preaching must uncover that need and trace the grace of God that answers it in **Christ**. The FCF guards against moralism by ensuring that biblical imperatives are not severed from **redemptive provision**, and it guards against antinomianism by showing how **grace** energizes new obedience. Chapell integrates the FCF with a classical homiletical architecture: a clear proposition tethered to the **Central Idea of the Text**, logical progression, and movement through **explanation, illustration, and application**.

Chapell’s method is indebted to **Edmund Clowney’s** insistence on **redemptive-historical** trajectories and to **Haddon Robinson’s** concern for sermonic unity, while engaging the cautions of **Walter Kaiser** about preserving authorial intent. He argues that faithful **Christ-centered preaching** neither allegorizes nor evacuates the text’s historical particularity; rather, it reads texts within *historia salutis*, locating typology, covenantal structures, and doctrinal substructures that naturally point to **Christ**. The FCF functions as homiletical conscience: application must emerge from the text’s burden for fallen people and must be resolved only by **grace grounded in the cross and resurrection**.

#### 3. From moralism to grace: indicative-imperative order
In **Holiness by Grace** 2001 and **Unlimited Grace** 2016, Chapell articulates the soteriological engine beneath his homiletic: **grace-driven sanctification**. Drawing from **Titus 2.11-14**, he contends that the gospel’s indicatives create the motivational and moral context for Christian obedience. Theologically this rests on **union with Christ** and what Calvin termed the **duplex gratia**, the double grace of justification and sanctification. Chapell presses the Reformed order that assurance in **justification** frees believers from both **legalism** and **antinomianism**, producing what he calls the heart chemistry of obedience. The sermonic correlate is an application that is doxological rather than utilitarian: obedience is offered not to gain favor but because favor has been freely given in **Christ**.

Chapell’s pastoral writing calibrates this gracious order across Christian practices. In **Praying Backwards** 2005 he teaches petitioners to begin with Jesus’ name conceptually, aligning desires with the **kingdom priorities** of the Mediator. In **Each for the Other** 1998 he applies covenantal grace to marriage, locating mutual service within the **self-giving pattern of Christ**. These works extend the **indicative-imperative** axis into the habits of daily faith, insisting that all Christian ethics is downstream from **redemption accomplished and applied**.

#### 4. Hermeneutics for Christ-centered exposition
Chapell adopts a controlled **typology and promise-fulfillment** approach to the Old Testament, in conversation with **Sidney Greidanus** and **Graeme Goldsworthy**, and under the broader Vosian canopy shaped by **Geerhardus Vos**. He enumerates pathways for moving from text to Christ: the **redemptive context** of the book, the **doctrinal substructure** implicit in the passage, the **typological patterns** embedded in Israel’s offices and institutions, and the **ethical focus** that needs the gospel’s enablement. Crucially, he differentiates **exposition** from **imposition**. The preacher must avoid arbitrary allegory and respect the *sensus literalis*, yet he must also honor the *analogia fidei* that sees Scripture’s unity in the **covenant of grace**.

His **Ephesians** volume in the **Reformed Expository Commentary** 2009 demonstrates the method at work. There Chapell traces **union with Christ**, **reconciliation of Jew and Gentile**, and the church’s **new humanity** as gospel indicatives that ground the ethical household code. The preaching model deploys textual structure, theological synthesis, and pastoral application in proportion, so that the listener is brought from the text’s meaning through the **FCF** to Christ’s provision and then to Spirit-enabled response. Critics who fear the erasure of the Old Testament’s moral exemplarity are met with Chapell’s mediation: examples are preached within the **redemptive-historical** frame, with admiration transposed into grateful imitation directed by **grace**.

#### 5. Sermon craft: unity, movement, and illustration
On the craft side, **Using Illustrations to Preach with Power** 2001 distills Chapell’s communication theory. Illustrations are subordinated to the **proposition** and the **FCF** so that they carry doctrinal freight rather than serve as entertainment. He advocates strategic illustration placement to foster **unity and movement**, always protecting the text’s authority. The sermon’s architecture in **Christ-Centered Preaching** emphasizes **purpose**, **structure**, and **application** that is specific, text-warranted, and grace-saturated. Underlying is a pastoral anthropology: fallen hearers require both cognitive clarity and affective engagement, and the preacher must shepherd the listener from the diagnosis of sin to the balm of **the gospel**.

Chapell’s pedagogy rehabilitates classic **expository preaching** categories for a generation tempted either by purely narrative approaches or therapeutic moralism. The sermon, he insists, is not a lecture nor a motivational talk; it is the proclamation of **God’s Word** that, by the **Spirit**, unites hearers to **Christ**. Thus he situates **application** not as an appendage but as the telos of exposition, since the divine speech act includes illocutions that summon faith and obedience.

#### 6. Christ-centered worship and the gospel-shaped liturgy
In **Christ-Centered Worship: Letting the Gospel Shape Our Practice** 2009, Chapell turns from pulpit to pew. Surveying historic Protestant liturgies from **Calvin**, the **Westminster Directory**, and beyond, he contends that the church’s weekly order should rehearse the gospel’s logic. The sequence of **adoration**, **confession**, **assurance**, **thanksgiving**, **instruction**, **communion**, **charge**, and **blessing** mirrors the *ordo salutis* in doxological form. This **gospel-shaped liturgy** resists both traditional formalism and free-form pragmatism by binding worship to **covenant-renewal** under the **Word and sacraments**.

Chapell’s contribution here is not antiquarian but pastoral. The same **indicative-imperative** cadence that guides sermons should govern the service. Confession must be paired with a robust declaration of **absolution in Christ**. The Table must be preached as **means of grace**, not a human performance. Music and prayer are selected to echo the **redemptive-historical** storyline rather than thematic miscellany. By wedding **Christ-centered preaching** to **Christ-centered worship**, Chapell offers a holistic account of ministerial practice.

#### 7. Institutional leadership and ecclesial placement
As president and later chancellor at **Covenant Theological Seminary** and as **PCA Stated Clerk** from 2020 to 2024, Chapell inhabited roles that required doctrinal clarity and pastoral diplomacy. He championed curriculum that foregrounded **biblical theology**, **homiletics**, and **pastoral practice**, consolidating a seminary identity rooted in **Westminster confessionalism** while engaging global evangelicalism. His denominational leadership advanced unity around the **gospel of grace** amid cultural and intramural tensions. This institutional backdrop reinforces the intention of his homiletical program: not an idiosyncratic method, but a serviceable model for pastors in Reformed churches wrestling with the pressures of late modern ministry.

The public uptake of Chapell’s work across Reformed and evangelical networks is evident in its adoption in seminaries, preaching cohorts, and pastoral conferences. The method’s portability stems from its triad of **textual fidelity**, **theological coherence**, and **communicative clarity**. By linking the **FCF** to robust **covenant theology** and accessible sermon craft, Chapell equips preachers to proclaim **Christ** without abstraction and to apply **grace** without sentimentality.

#### 8. Interlocutors, clarifications, and critiques
Chapell explicitly converses with **Clowney** and **Greidanus** on **preaching Christ from the Old Testament**, borrowing their typological and redemptive trajectories while sharpening the homiletical mechanics. He nods to **Goldsworthy’s** gospel-centered hermeneutic and to **Robinson’s** big-idea sermon. He answers **Kaiser’s** authorial-intent concerns by tethering **Christological** moves to textual and canonical cues, not preachers’ ingenuity. In broader evangelical debates, his **grace-driven sanctification** stands beside **John Murray’s** union-with-Christ soteriology and against both legalistic transformation schemes and antinomian quietism. He avoids a strict **law-gospel dichotomy** that would mute imperatives, yet he contends for a **law-gospel order** where law’s third use is enlivened by justification’s assurance.

Clarifications recur. Chapell warns that **FCF** is not a license for psychological projection; it is a textual burden discovered through exegesis. He stresses that examples retain value as instances of grace’s work, not as bare moral templates. He urges that **illustrations** must advance doctrine, not decorate it. And he underscores that **worship** is not a neutral container: sequences and elements catechize, either into the **gospel** or into its rivals.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Chapell’s program is a salutary consolidation of **redemptive-historical preaching**, **union-with-Christ** soteriology, and **gospel-shaped liturgy**. Strengths abound: the **indicative-imperative order** protects sola gratia; the **FCF** disciplines application into covenantal patterns; the commitment to **sensus literalis** under **analogia fidei** honors both exegesis and canon. Yet several tensions invite refinement. First, the **FCF** can tilt anthropocentric if the sermon’s gravitational center becomes human lack rather than **divine initiative** in revelation and redemption; a WTS corrective would foreground God’s **covenantal self-disclosure** and the objective milestones of **historia salutis** before articulating subjective need. Second, the breadth of **typology and promise-fulfillment** requires vigilant control by the text’s structures and the church’s **confessional standards** lest Christocentric moves flatten the diverse literary forms of Scripture; the Vosian and Van Tillian accent on redemptive epoch and covenantal authority provides ballast here. Third, in sanctification, the rhetoric of **grace-driven** must be explicitly tethered to the instituted **means of grace** and to the **third use of the law** as rule of life to avoid functional antinomian impressions; the alternative is not moralism but the Reformed pattern where **Word and sacrament**, by the **Spirit**, conform the church to Christ within **covenant obedience**. Finally, in worship, the commendable **gospel logic** should be coupled with the regulative principle’s stricter criteria so that liturgical shape is not merely pedagogically helpful but normed by **Scripture’s positive warrant**. With these clarifications, Chapell’s project aligns robustly with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, offering pastors a practicable path to preach and pray the **grace of God in Christ** from all of Scripture for the life of the church.
