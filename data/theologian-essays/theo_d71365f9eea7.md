### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the canonical turn
Robert W. Wall emerges as a contemporary **Methodist/Wesleyan** theologian and New Testament scholar whose enduring contribution is a canonical, ecclesial, and pneumatic construal of the **authority of Scripture**. Working for decades at **Seattle Pacific University**, he helped shape a generation of Wesleyan pastors and scholars at the intersection of critical exegesis and **theological interpretation of Scripture**. His scholarship matures within the late twentieth-century **canonical turn** associated with **Brevard Childs**, yet Wall’s voice is distinctly Wesleyan, grounded in **John Wesley’s scriptural holiness** and disciplined by the practical wisdom of pastoral ministry. The broader intellectual context is the post-critical retrieval of **Rule of Faith** reading, the recovery of **canon** as theological category, and the communitarian practices of interpretation that resist the atomization of modern historicism. Wall’s formation attends to how Scripture functions within the church’s life as a means of grace under the **Holy Spirit**, not merely as an archive of religious origins but as the living instrument by which God conforms a people to **holiness** and **catholicity**.

From the outset Wall joins debates about **canon formation** and **canonical coherence** by arguing that the final form of the New Testament possesses its own theological logic, its own *oikonomia*, ordered by the **Spirit** for the church’s guidance. While receptive to historical criticism, his method subordinates speculative source reconstructions to the ecclesial task of reading **Scripture as Scripture**. He frequently invokes the **Wesleyan quadrilateral** but recasts it with **Scripture** as normative principle, with **tradition**, **reason**, and **experience** functioning as ministerial helps subordinated to the Spirit’s work in the canon. Wall’s methodological temperament is thus canonical and rule-governed, emphasizing the *regula fidei* as the hermeneutical proximate norm that guides responsible theological exegesis.

#### 2. Method: the canon, the Spirit, and the marks of Scripture
Wall’s most programmatic statement of method appears with **Daniel Castelo** in **The Marks of Scripture** 2019, where Scripture’s ontology and practice are articulated analogously to the Nicene marks of the church: **one**, **holy**, **catholic**, **apostolic**. Here Wall’s signature claim is that the Bible’s authority is canonically located in the Spirit’s sanctifying governance of a people rather than in a freestanding theory of **inerrancy** or a purely historical account of origin. The mark of **oneness** bespeaks a Spirit-wrought unity of the diverse witnesses of the canon; **holiness** signals Scripture’s consecration to God’s saving work, calling its readers into transformation; **catholicity** registers the canon’s capacious, translocal and transtemporal reach; **apostolicity** names the normative shape of witness regulated by the **apostolic Rule of Faith**. These claims gather threads running through Wall’s earlier work: a concern for **canonical sequencing** and for the ecclesial reception that establishes how texts function theologically within the church.

The theological act of reading, for Wall, is both **pneumatological** and **ecclesial**. The Spirit who inspired the prophets and apostles also superintends the final **canonical economy**, giving Scripture its internal coherence and its mission-shaping telos. The church, for its part, is not an extrinsic authority added to the Bible, but the Spirit’s living community in which the **canon** is recognized, proclaimed, and obeyed. The result is a hermeneutic that is critical yet confessional, exegetically attentive yet governed by the **Rule of Faith**. In this key Wall participates with **Francis Watson**, **Stephen Fowl**, and **Kevin Vanhoozer** in articulating theological interpretation, though with a distinctly **Wesleyan** accent that highlights **means of grace**, **scriptural holiness**, and communal **conferencing** for discerning the text’s sapiential force.

#### 3. Catholic Epistles and canonical sequencing
Wall’s sustained attention to the **Catholic Epistles** defines much of his early and mid-career work, most notably in **The Catholic Epistles and the Apostolic Tradition** 1992 and in his co-authored study with **David R. Nienhuis**, **Reading the Epistles of James, Peter, John & Jude as Scripture** 2013. These studies argue that the so-called Catholic collection was intentionally shaped as a cohesive canonical voice, a sapiential counterpoint to the **Pauline** letters, and a pedagogical guide to the faithful. Wall contends that the final **canonical sequencing** of the Catholic Epistles is not arbitrary but catechetically ordered so that, for example, **James** can function as a gatekeeper to the interpretation of **Paul**, curbing antinomian misreadings by anchoring justification in **wisdom-formed works of love**. **1 Peter** and **1 John** then consolidate the community’s identity as a holy priesthood and a fellowship of truth, while **2 Peter** and **Jude** safeguard the apostolic tradition against deviant teaching.

This canonical proposal does not deny the historicity of individual letters, but it insists that their theological function is discovered in the shape of the **collection**. Wall treats the Catholic Epistles as an ecclesial school in **holiness**, training a scattered yet **catholic** diaspora to suffer faithfully, to love truthfully, and to persevere in hope. The outcome is a constructive alternative to a Pauline-centric canon, balancing the dynamic of **justification by faith** with the canonical insistence on **obedience**, **virtue**, and **endurance**. Wall’s claim is that the Spirit ordered this counterpoint to secure the unity of **faith and holiness**, a hallmark of **Wesleyan** soteriology.

#### 4. Acts, ecclesial mission, and the Spirit’s economy
Wall’s commentary on **Acts** in the **New Interpreter’s Bible** 1995 and his pastoral-theological synthesis with **Anthony B. Robinson**, **Called to Be Church: The Book of Acts for a New Day** 2006, showcase his canonical instincts at work in ecclesiology. For Wall the placement of **Acts** between the **Gospels** and the **Pauline** corpus creates a theological hinge: the risen Christ continues his ministry in the **Spirit** through an apostolic community sent to the ends of the earth. Acts functions canonically as narrative prolegomenon to reading Paul rightly, framing the epistolary exhortations within a story of **mission**, **martyrdom**, **shared goods**, and Spirit-led **discernment**. The Spirit’s outpouring in **Acts 2** establishes a pattern of scriptural interpretation where prophecy, prayer, and communal deliberation converge under the **Rule of Faith**, an interpretive scene that Wall sees replicated in the practices of **Wesleyan conferencing**.

In pastoral register Wall and Robinson press Acts into service for congregational renewal, urging contemporary churches toward **missional holiness**, robust **leadership discernment** rooted in prayer and Scripture, and a generous **catholicity** that crosses ethnic and social lines. The book’s reception is thus not a historical curiosity but a canonical catalyst for ecclesial practice. The missional and pneumatic themes of **Acts** also reinforce Wall’s broader view that the **canon** is not a static collection but a living instrument for the Spirit’s ongoing formation of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic** church.

#### 5. Pastoral Epistles, authorship debates, and ecclesial formation
Wall’s **Two Horizons New Testament Commentary** on **1 and 2 Timothy and Titus** 2012, co-authored with **Richard B. Steele**, exemplifies his refusal to let historical skepticism about **authorship** control theological interpretation. Without insisting on a particular solution to debates about **pseudonymity**, Wall argues that the Pastorals must be read in their final canonical placement as a normative resource for **pastoral leadership**, **household order**, and **doctrinal stability**. The commentary advances the claim that the Pastorals articulate a pattern of **teaching office**, **scriptural catechesis**, and **virtue formation** that fits a Wesleyan vision of **scriptural holiness** and **social ethics**. Even notoriously disputed passages such as **1 Timothy 2** are reframed within the broader canonical witness to the ministries of **women** in **Acts** and **Romans**, and within the ecclesial mandate to order teaching in ways that promote the **gospel** and guard the church from **false doctrine**.

The theological horizon sections of the commentary press beyond technical exegesis to consider the Pastorals’ role in shaping a **holy** people through ordinary means: public reading of **Scripture**, disciplined **catechesis**, care for the **poor**, and the cultivation of **temperance**, **hospitality**, and **sound speech**. Wall’s canonical approach here resists both reduction to ancient social codes and evasion of contemporary application. The texts function to map the household of God as a school of **virtue**, not as a museum of archaic norms, an ecclesial grammar consonant with **Wesley’s sermons** on Christian perfection and love.

#### 6. Apocalypse as pastoral revelation
In **Revelation** NIBC 1991, Wall offers a canonical reading of the **Apocalypse** that makes pastoral sense of its intense symbolism. Revelation is Scripture’s capstone that gathers the **prophetic**, **apostolic**, and **sapiential** strands of the canon into doxology and witness. Wall emphasizes that John’s vision is given to shape the church’s **worship** and **resistance** under imperial pressure, stabilizing Christian hope through a liturgical pedagogy of the **Lamb**. Against dispensational speculation, Wall reads the book’s visions as canonical theater that trains the church to discern the **powers**, to endure suffering, and to confess **Jesus’ Lordship** over all nations. The canonical ending in Revelation 21-22 is not an escape from history but the unveiling of God’s **new creation**, a horizon that relativizes empire and sanctifies the church’s **mission**.

This pastoral hermeneutic integrates seamlessly with Wall’s larger project. Revelation’s canonical position completes the Scripture’s **economy** by giving the church a future-charged imagination shaped by **worship** and animated by the **Spirit**. The Apocalypse thus functions as the culmination of the **marks of Scripture**: it binds the canon’s many voices into **oneness** in the worship of the Lamb, calls the saints to **holiness** against idolatry, displays the **catholic** scope of the nations stream, and seals the **apostolic** witness in eschatological promise.

#### 7. Study Bibles, catechesis, and Wesleyan practice
Wall’s ecclesial instincts surface in his role as contributor and theological editor for **Wesleyan study Bible** projects, including the **Wesley Study Bible** 2009 and the **CEB Wesley Study Bible** 2012, where canonical notes, **Wesleyan** themes, and practical application converge. These projects embody his conviction that Scripture is given to the whole people of God, not merely to guilds of specialists, and that the **canon** must be read in concert with **Wesley’s sermons**, hymns, and **discipleship** practices. Here Wall advances a pedagogy of **means of grace** that aligns liturgical reading of Scripture with works of mercy and piety, forming the habits necessary for faithful interpretation in the local church.

By integrating **doctrine**, **exegesis**, and **practice**, Wall positions the **Rule of Faith** as a public guide to reading rather than as a closed scholastic code. Scripture’s **authority** is enacted when congregations learn to read together, to pray the text, to weigh teaching by the **apostolic gospel**, and to inhabit the **holiness** the canon prescribes. This pedagogical vision coheres with his emphasis on **canonical sequencing**, since the order of the books frames the church’s yearly proclamation, its catechumenal disciplines, and its pastoral exhortations.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and constructive tensions
Wall’s work stands in critical solidarity with **Brevard Childs** on the **final form** of the text and the theological importance of **canon**, yet he presses further into ecclesial practice in dialogue with **Francis Watson** and **Stephen Fowl** on the communal dynamics of interpretation. His proposals draw appreciative interaction from evangelical theologians such as **Kevin Vanhoozer** on **theodramatic** performance of Scripture, though Wall is less invested in analytic accounts of **inerrancy** and more in pneumatic accounts of **marks of Scripture**. In **Reading the Epistles of James, Peter, John & Jude as Scripture** 2013 with **Nienhuis**, Wall enters the debate over the formation and role of the **Catholic Epistles** with a robust claim that the collection’s shape, sequence, and rhetorical intent were canonically decisive. This invites rejoinders from scholars more skeptical of editorial intentionality, yet Wall maintains that canonical reception itself evidences the Spirit’s providential ordering.

On **authorship** and **pseudonymity**, Wall exhibits a pastoral patience. He acknowledges the critical contestations yet resists the claim that modern authorship judgments control canonical function. Scripture is **autopistos** as God’s Word self-attesting by the **Spirit**, and therefore the church reads the Pastorals or the Catholic collection for their ecclesial wisdom regardless of tidy authorship solutions. While this stance garners critiques from historical purists, it protects the primacy of **canon** over **methodological naturalism**, a priority shared by many theological interpreters across confessional lines. The ecclesial payoff is a Scripture that can be preached with confidence as the Spirit’s instrument for **doctrine**, **reproof**, **correction**, and **training in righteousness**.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis: holiness, catholicity, and the economy of Scripture
Across commentaries and essays Wall weaves a doctrinal synthesis in which the **Spirit** unites the canon’s polyphony for the church’s **holiness** and **mission**. The **Catholic Epistles** provide a grammar of **wisdom** and **virtue** that complements **Pauline** soteriology, **Acts** supplies the pattern of **missionary discernment** and communal **order**, and **Revelation** sets the church’s **eschatological** compass. The **marks of Scripture** sum this synthesis: Scripture is holy because it consecrates and corrects; one because it harmonizes prophets, Jesus, apostles; catholic because it addresses Jew and Gentile, slave and free; apostolic because it binds the church to the **Rule of Faith** and the **gospel of the crucified and risen Lord**. The method is not an afterthought to doctrine but its generator, since the canon’s form discloses God’s *oikonomia* and trains a Wesleyan people devoted to **scriptural holiness** for the life of the world.

This canonical vision intentionally re-centers the life of the local church. Wall regularly ties exegesis to practices such as **public reading of Scripture**, **catechesis**, **table fellowship**, **mutual admonition**, and **diaconal care**, insisting that the true test of interpretation is ecclesial **faithfulness**. The hermeneutical virtues prized by **Wesley** and recovered by Wall are patience, humility, charity, and courage, all animated by the **Spirit** who leads the church into all truth. The result is a theologian of Scripture whose scholarship reads like a manual for pastors as well as a contribution to academic debates about **canon**, **authority**, and **ecclesial identity**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** perspective, Wall’s canonical and **Word-Spirit** emphases are welcome correctives to both historicist fragmentation and biblicist prooftexting. His alignment with a **Rule of Faith** and his insistence on **canon** as theological guide resonate with classical Reformed commitments to **sola Scriptura** properly understood as Scripture read within the **catholic** church. Reformed readers can affirm his deployment of **Acts** for ecclesial **mission**, his sapiential retrieval of the **Catholic Epistles**, and his doxological reading of **Revelation**. Tensions arise, however, where Wall’s ecclesial location of authority risks overshadowing Scripture’s unique normativity as principium cognoscendi, and where his tolerance of **pseudonymity** can seem to decouple **truthfulness** from authorial claims that the Reformed tradition typically integrates under **veracity** and the Spirit’s inspiration. His James-forward canonical balancing of **Paul** enriches moral theology yet invites careful calibration of **justification by faith** to guard the material principle of the gospel. A Westminster-inflected alternative would retain Wall’s **canonical sequencing** and **ecclesial reading** while more explicitly grounding authority in the self-attesting **autopistia** of Scripture, reinforcing confessional controls for doctrine and worship, and integrating his virtue hermeneutic within a **covenantal** frame that secures both the objective reliability of Scripture and the church’s dependent role as its ministerial witness.
