# Christianity and Liberalism – J\. Gresham Machen

The introductory chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the conflict between traditional Christianity and modern liberalism, which Machen sees as fundamentally opposed to the core values of the Christian faith\. He notes that liberalism, while using Christian terminology, advocates for naturalism, a viewpoint that dismisses the supernatural elements of Christianity to recast its essence through a naturalistic perspective\. Machen outlines the context of this divergence, noting the rapid advancements in industrial, scientific, and intellectual fields that have shaped modern attitudes toward religion and led to skepticism about traditional Christian doctrines and the authority of Scripture\. He argues that reducing Christianity to fit modern scientific and historical critiques diminishes its foundational truths, turning it into a form of vague natural religion\. Machen criticizes liberalism for being unscientific and failing to address modern unbelief’s challenges effectively\. He believes that only a return to traditional, orthodox Christianity can address the issues raised by modernism\. Additionally, Machen touches on the societal effects of liberalism’s rise, such as the threat to individual freedom, the spread of utilitarianism, and the possible decline of art and education in a materialistic ethos\. This introduction serves as a platform for further discussion on the clash between liberalism and traditional Christianity, presenting it as both a theological debate and a critical issue with significant implications for society’s spiritual and moral direction\.

Chapter 2, “Doctrine,” discusses the contrast between modern liberalism and traditional Christianity regarding the importance of doctrine\. Machen criticizes liberalism for minimizing the value of doctrines and creeds, treating them as mere expressions of experience rather than foundational truths\. This approach leads to skepticism and overlooks the fact that liberalism itself harbors specific doctrines like the universal fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man\. Highlighting Christianity’s doctrinal basis, Machen uses Paul’s teachings to underscore the early church’s commitment to doctrinal integrity and the essential role of faith for salvation\. He disputes the notion that Paul altered Jesus’s original message, demonstrating continuity in their teachings, especially regarding Jesus’s messianic role and redemptive work\. Machen challenges the liberal trend of detaching Jesus’s person from his doctrinal teachings, asserting that such a separation results in a distorted view of Christianity\. He criticizes modern preaching for neglecting doctrinal content in favor of promoting a vague concept of “life\.” The chapter emphasizes the necessity of doctrine in guiding Christian life and concludes that Christianity’s distinctiveness lies in its historical and doctrinal foundation, urging a return to a doctrinally grounded faith that accurately reflects Jesus’s teachings\.

In Chapter 3, “God & Man,” Machen critiques modern liberalism’s conception of God and human nature, contrasting it with traditional Christian doctrine\. *God\. *Modern liberalism minimizes the need for a clear theological conception of God, relying instead on subjective feelings of God’s presence \(cf\. Schleiermacher\)\. Machen argues that knowing God requires doctrine, as feelings alone cannot define God’s moral character\. He criticizes the liberal emphasis on the “universal fatherhood of God” as a central dogma, which he views as unfounded in Scripture and reflective of a vague natural religion rather than Christian teaching\. Machen warns against the liberal tendency toward pantheism, which blurs the Creator\-creation distinction\. *Man\. *Machen points out the denial of human sinfulness and its unwarranted confidence in human goodness\. He identifies collectivism and the replacement of Christian morality with pagan ideals of self\-realization as the highest goal of humanity as factors contributing to the loss of consciousness of sin\. According to Machen, acknowledging human sinfulness is essential, which modern liberalism fails to do by dismissing the work of the Holy Spirit\.

In Chapter 4, “The Bible,” Machen critiques modern liberalism for diverging from traditional Christianity, especially regarding the Bible\. He notes liberalism has forsaken key beliefs in a living God and the reality of sin, which significantly alters its perception of the Bible\. Unlike liberalism, which emphasizes the Christian experience, traditional Christianity sees the Bible as divine revelation, citing crucial events like Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection\. Machen emphasizes Christianity’s reliance on the historical accuracy of these scriptural records\. He also defends the doctrine of inspiration, asserting the Bible as error\-free and the ultimate faith guide\. In contrast, liberalism questions the Bible’s authority, leans on subjective experiences, and selectively embraces Jesus’s words, highlighting the divide between liberalism’s subjective approach to faith and the objective, historical foundation of traditional Christianity\.

In Chapter 5, “Christ,” Machen examines the disparate perspectives of modern liberalism and traditional Christianity on Jesus Christ’s persona and significance\. He critiques liberalism for relegating the Gospels to a secondary role behind Paul’s writings and reducing Jesus to merely Christianity’s founder and a moral exemplar rather than faith’s centerpiece\. Contrarily, Machen highlights that for Paul and the early Church, the crux of Christianity was Jesus’s redemptive sacrifice, not merely His ethical teachings or personal faith\. Machen confronts liberalism’s treatment of two pivotal Christian doctrines: Jesus’s messianic consciousness and sinlessness\. He argues that liberalism’s portrayal of these as late developments or psychological constructs strips away the foundational truths of Christianity, namely, the divine redemption embodied in Jesus’s sinless sacrifice\. Furthermore, Machen disputes the liberal argument that emphasizing Jesus’s divinity and sinlessness alienates Him from believers\. Instead, he asserts that Jesus’s perfect life and sacrifice not only draw believers closer but also underscore His role as Savior, offering not guidance alone but salvation\. Central to Machen’s argument is the significance of miracles, especially the resurrection, which he posits as critical affirmations of Jesus’s divine claims and sources of solace amid human suffering\. He notes that traditional Christianity and liberalism, despite sometimes sharing terminology, fundamentally diverge in their understanding of Jesus’s nature and role\. Traditional Christianity upholds Jesus’s dual nature as divine and human, integral to the faith, in opposition to liberalism’s tendency to dilute or misinterpret these doctrines\.

Chapter 6, “Salvation,” highlights the divergent views of modern liberalism and traditional Christianity on the concept of salvation, particularly on the atonement\. Modern liberalism sees Jesus’s death primarily as a moral example that influences humanity by demonstrating God’s love and hatred for sin, neglecting the traditional Christian teaching of vicarious atonement, where Jesus dies as a substitute for sinners\. Machen disputes criticisms against the traditional view, emphasizing the necessity of acknowledging Christ’s deity to fully grasp the notion of vicarious suffering and the importance of God’s justice in understanding His love\. Machen refutes the liberal dismissal of the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit in salvation, stressing the insufficiency of human efforts\. He asserts that faith is not undogmatic but rooted in the objective truth of Christ’s work\. Machen critiques the social gospel and liberalism’s tendency to prioritize social and political ends over individual spiritual transformation\. Against the liberal critique of Christianity’s emphasis on the communion of God as selfish, he argues that it is the foundation for true service to others, contrasting the liberal optimism about human institutions with a Christian acknowledgment of their limitations in addressing spiritual and moral issues\.

In Chapter 7, “The Church,” Machen contrasts the views of modern liberalism and traditional Christianity concerning the church’s nature\. He distinguishes between the liberal notion of a universal brotherhood and the Christian concept of a more intimate fellowship among the redeemed members of the Church\. Machen addresses the issue of non\-Christian teachings within the church, and the challenge liberalism poses to Christian doctrine, emphasizing that evangelical churches are founded on creeds that members and ministers are expected to uphold\. Machen argues that those who disagree with the church’s foundational beliefs should leave and find a congregation that aligns with their views, maintaining that this stance is not about intolerance but about integrity and adherence to the church’s creedal basis\. He asserts that since traditional churches are creedal, and conservatives align with these creeds, it is the liberals who should withdraw\. The chapter also discusses the broader impact of liberalism as a fundamentally different system from traditional Christianity\. It outlines the duties of Christian officers in the church and emphasizes the importance of supporting the faithful, ensuring doctrinal alignment, renewing Christian education, and relying on prayer and God’s guidance\. Machen concludes with an affirmation of the church’s future in God’s hands, advocating for the necessity of a fellowship among the redeemed that remains faithful to Christian doctrine and the Gospel’s propagation\.

*Christianity and Liberalism *critically examines the ideological differences between traditional Christianity and modern liberalism\. It contributes a systematic, thorough rebuttal of liberal Christianity and argues for a return to orthodox Christianity’s doctrinal integrity and historical foundations\. Drawing from scripture, theology, and history, his approach includes the examination of the beliefs themselves, the implications of these beliefs for both individual faith and the collective life of the Church, and the broader societal consequences of adopting a liberal stance on Christianity\.
