__Breviloquium by St\. Bonaventure\.__

__Prologue\. __

__Invocation and Application\. __The prologue begins with an invocation inspired by Ephesians 3:14\-19, followed by an exploration of the origin, development, and purpose of Scriptures\. Scriptures originate from the "Father of Lights" through divine revelation, evolving through a fourfold pattern, aiming for the fullness of eternal happiness\.

__Analysis of Scriptures\. __

__1\. The Breadth of Scriptures\.__

- Law: Compels through the commands of Majesty\.
- Historical: Offers examples of Goodness\.
- Wisdom: Teaches through all\-provident Truth\.
- Prophetical: Combines all three elements\.

__2\. The Length of Scriptures __encompasses all time periods through three phases corresponding to seven historical periods paralleling the days of creation: 

- the law of nature, 
- written law
- law of grace, 

__3\. The Height of Scriptures __describes a hierarchy: 

- subcelestial \(ecclesiastical\),
- celestial \(angelical\), 
- supercelestial \(divine\)\.

__4\. The Depth of Scriptures__ engages four interpretive modes: 

- literal
- allegorical
- moral \(action\-oriented\)
- __anagogical \(hope\-oriented\)\.__

__5\. The Methods of Scriptures__ are founded on the authority and aim of virtue and salvation, combining divine revelation with God as the ultimate authority\.

__6\. Interpretation of Scriptures: __Historical texts are interpreted primarily literally, with allegory as secondary, and guided by common sense where applicable\.

__Part II \- On Creation\.__

__Creation of the Universe\. __Bonaventure explores the creation of the universe, emphasizing that it was created in time, out of nothing, by a single supreme principle, refuting Manichean dualism\. Creation is seen as an effect of the Trinity through a triple causality: a\) efficient \(focusing on unity and measure\), b\) exemplary \(highlighting truth and species\), and c\) final \(emphasizing goodness and order\)\. __Production and Essence of Physical Nature\. __The creation unfolded over six days, chosen methodically by God to manifest power, wisdom, and goodness distinctly\. These days correspond to various operations and prefigure future ages\. Bonaventure presents an elaborate cosmology, addressing the essence and influence of nature\. He asserts that humans are the ultimate purpose of material things, meant to inspire love and praise for the Creator\. The heavens act as a clock or calendar but do not predict the future, and the soul, connected to free will, is superior to physical powers\. __Description in Scripture\. __Bonaventure describes the order of nature in Scriptural terms\. The Father is associated with the luminous heavens, the Son with the opaque earth, and the Spirit with the translucent waters, reflecting the orders of Wisdom and Goodness\. __Production of Heavenly Spirits and Demons\. __Heavenly spirits possess four perfections, including rationality and freedom of choice, resembling God in their spiritual nature\. Bonaventure explains that angels could fall because they are not the supreme good—only God is\. After the fall, good angels were confirmed in their choice and perfected in glory\. __Production of Human Soul and Body\. __Humans are composites of material and spiritual natures, endowed with being, life, intelligence, and freedom\. The rational soul is key to achieving beatitude, and it is immortal, self\-determining, and free from compulsion\. Bonaventure discusses the body's initial obedience to the soul, emphasizing proportion, wisdom, and freedom from sin\. __Completion of Creation\. __The human composite is twofold in perception and motion, reflecting divine commands and nature\. The universe itself mirrors the Trinity, showing traces of all creation, rational images, and likeness in faith, hope, and love\.

__Part III: On the Corruption of Sin\.__

__Origin of Evil\. __Sin is understood as a *defect* rather than a positive essence\. It arises from human imperfection and is associated with a *deficient cause* rather than an efficient one\. Sin represents a corruption of good and is intrinsically linked to the will, described as a forsaking of good rather than a desire for evil\. __Temptation and Sin of the First Parents\. __The Devil, motivated by hatred, skillfully tempted humanity's first parents\. Eve, deceived, broke divine command and led Adam to do the same\. Bonaventure highlights a twofold perception, where humanity prioritized external goods over internal commands, with woman deceived and man acting willingly\. __Punishment and Corruption\. __The first parents experienced shame as a result of their transgressions\. God's corrective justice does not tolerate disorder, resulting in the removal of the body's gifts and the imposition of opposites, with *female punishment being harsher*\. Original sin deprived humanity of original righteousness and justice, leading to penalties of weakness, ignorance, malice, and *concupiscence*\. While God's governance allows misery as punishment for sin, original sin without personal will—such as in infants—does not merit hell\. __Transmission and Cure of Original Sin\. __Original sin is transmitted through sexual lust on the father's part\. Baptism cleanses original sin but not its consequences, which continue to be transmitted\. The Blessed Virgin is noted as an exception\. __Origin of Actual Sin\. __Actual sin arises from free will, beginning with suggestion and culminating in action\. Sin represents a willful disorder, with omission and commission forming its basis\. Sins are classified as either mortal, disrupting justice, or venial, merely disturbing it\. __Origin and Division of Capital Sins\. __The root of actual sin is pride, with two foundations in 1\) fear and 2\) love that skew behavior, and three incentives: lust of the a\) flesh, b\) eyes, and c\) pride of life\. These lead to seven capital sins: pride, envy, anger, sloth, covetousness, gluttony, and lust\. __Nature of Penal Sin\. __Penal sins incorporate two penalty types: those rightfully from God and those contracted or committed by humans\. __Origin of Final Sin Against the Holy Spirit\. __Final sin, or sin against the Holy Spirit, encompasses six types, such as envy of spiritual welfare and rejection of known truth\. Sin is considered an offense against the triune God, with its culmination in pride and maturity in final impenitence, involving impotence against the Father, defection of reason against the Son, and malice against the Spirit\.

__Part IV: On the Incarnation of the Word\.__

__Reason for the Incarnation\. __The Incarnation was necessary for the salvation and restoration of humanity\. Since creation was accomplished by God through the Word, it was fitting for restoration to occur through the Word as well\. Christ came in human form to allow us to *know*, *love*, and *imitate* God once more, facilitating our rise from sin through the Word Made Flesh\. __Union of Natures\. __In the Incarnation, the divine and human natures were united\. This union was *material* and *rational*, incorporating *vegetative*, *sensitive*, and *intellective* aspects\. It was a oneness of person, not nature, where the Son of God became the Son of Man\. God is portrayed as both Healer and Atoner, with the ability and obligation for atonement being God's alone\. __Process of the Incarnation\. __The Incarnation involved the Virgin Mary, who was instructed by an angel, counteracting Eve’s deception by Satan\. It signifies the restoration of humanity and the involvement of divine, angelic, and human elements in Christ’s birth\. __Fulness of Time and Grace\. __Christ’s coming marked the fulfillment of the ages, as God awaited the conclusion of the ages of nature and prophecy\. Christ’s grace encompassed his conception, offering immunity to sin, headship meriting glory, worship, and union, guiding all who turn to him through faith and sacraments\. __Wisdom and Merit of Christ\. __Christ, in his Incarnation, possessed comprehensive knowledge from divinity to sensory experience, encompassing all things related to salvation and the universe\. His merit is perfect for it was achieved by being both God and Man, encompassing charity, virtue, and benefits extending beyond glory, including grace and pardon\. __State of Suffering and Its Meaning\. __Christ assumed the defects of human nature, including its bodily penalties\. He suffered fully in his human nature for redemption’s sake\. His crucifixion, for a brief period, separated his human aspects from divinity, yet death was ultimately conquered\. __Purpose and Issue of the Passion\. __Through his Passion, Christ's redemption was utterly sufficient and effective\. It aimed to nurture faith, hope, and love in humanity, following the apostolic confession\. His suffering and sacrifice opened the gates of heaven and secured our path to grace\. 

__Part V: On the Grace of the Holy Spirit\.__

__Grace as a Gift of God\. __Bonaventure explores grace through four aspects: a\) its divine origin, its relation to b\) free will and c\) virtuous habits, and d\) its role in merit\. Grace is divinely given, aligns with free will to enable meritorious acts, and serves as a remedy for sin\. The Holy Spirit is integral to this process, joining believers to God and sanctifying them in His sight\. __Grace and Meritorious Acts\. __Grace is both a general and special assistance, freely granted to sustain existence and prepare the soul for the Holy Spirit, making it worthy of salvation\. It is also proper assistance for acquiring merit and sanctifying grace, without which no good or eternal salvation is possible\. __Grace as a Remedy for Sin\. __Grace justifies sinners through a combination of infusing grace, expelling sin, contrition, and free will\. While God's grace initiates the turn from evil, free will must consent and cooperate to achieve salvation, leading to the recreation and restoration to divine sonship\. __Grace and Virtuous Habits\. __Grace branches into the habits of virtues, instilling *seven virtues*: faith, hope, charity, prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice\. The soul is set aright and urged toward gifts, achieving perfection in beatitudes\. __Grace and the Habits of the Gifts\. __Grace corrects vice through virtues and alleviates their effects through gifts\. It provides seven gifts, each countering specific vices and leading to virtues such as temperance, justice, prudence, and charity\. __Grace, Beatitudes, and Spiritual Senses\. __The seven beatitudes bring forth the twelve fruits of the Spirit and five spiritual senses, advancing integrity, progress, and repose in what is perfect\. __Grace and the Objects of Faith\. __The objects of faith, including the truths of Holy Scripture and the articles of the apostles' creed, transcend human reason and are accessed through grace\. __Grace and the Objects of Love\. __The four objects of love are God, ourselves, our neighbors, and our body, derived from the commandments to love God and our neighbor as ourselves\. __Grace and Fulfillment of Commandments\. __Grace applies to fulfilling commandments and counsels, transforming the law from a burden to a source of instruction through the Gospel, achieving obedience through fear of punishment and love of justice\. __Grace and Petition\. __The Lord's Prayer illustrates grace in petition, highlighting God's readiness to provide\. It encompasses four types of prayer: mental, oral, personal, and intercessory through saints, underscoring the complexity and depth of divine petition\. 

__Part VI: On the Sacramental Remedy\.__

__Origin of the Sacraments\. __Bonaventure describes sacraments as divine remedies through which God's power operates in a hidden way\. They act as likenesses, representing spiritual truths and sanctifying believers\. The sacraments' causes include divine institution, representation via sensible signs, sanctification through grace, and the ultimate goal of healing humanity\. __Diversity and Number of Sacraments\. __Sacraments were instituted from the beginning to parallel human spiritual needs across different ages—the law of nature, Scripture, and grace\. There are seven sacraments corresponding to sevenfold grace and the seven ages of time, leading believers toward God and eternal life: baptism, confirmation, Holy Eucharist, penance, extreme unction, orders, and matrimony\. __Institution and Administration\. __The sacraments were instituted by Christ, each serving distinct purposes\. Some were perfected or approved, such as matrimony and penance, while others, like baptism and the Holy Eucharist, were fully established by Christ Himself\. The power of sacraments belongs to God, requiring the proper intention of ministers and varying levels of priestly and pontifical ordination\. __Repetition and Integration\. __Sacraments are generally not repeated, with baptism being fundamental and irreplaceable\. Each sacrament has specific requirements for integrity, such as the spoken formula in baptism and corporeal anointing in extreme unction, ensuring the fullness of its spiritual effect\. __Essence and Integrity of Sacraments\. __The sacraments serve as essential elements in the Christian life:

1. __Baptism__ involves immersion or ablution with the Trinitarian formula\.
2. __Confirmation__ requires the anointing with olive oil and balm\.
3. __Holy Eucharist__ is the true presence of Christ, uniting believers to Him\.
4. __Penance__ is a post\-baptismal recovery through contrition, confession, and satisfaction\.
5. __Extreme Unction__ aids the dying, involving anointing specific body parts\.
6. __Orders__ confer spiritual authority through distinct clerical stages\.
7. __Matrimony__ unites man and woman in an indissoluble bond, symbolizing the divine union of Christ with the Church\.

Each sacrament involves specific elements and requirements, reflecting their spiritual significance and the sanctifying grace conferred upon the faithful\.

__Part VII: On the Last Stage, the Final Judgment\.__

__Judgment in General\. __Bonaventure describes the universal judgment where the Father, through Christ, will judge the living and the dead based on their merits\. The just will be glorified, and sinners will be punished accordingly\. __Antecedents to the Judgment: Pains of Purgatory\. __Purgatory is portrayed as a place of real fire that afflicts the spirits of the just who have not fully atoned for their sins\. This fire is punitive, reparative, and cleansing, purifying souls before they enter paradise\. __Antecedents to the Judgment: Suffrages of the Church\. __The Church's offerings—such as Masses, fasting, and alms—benefit only the souls in purgatory, aiding the imperfectly good in their journey toward purification\. __Concomitants to the Judgment: Consuming Fire\. __A consuming fire will precede Christ's judgment, purging the world like the Flood\. Animals and plants will be consumed, and the elements, especially air and earth, will be cleansed and renewed\. The just will be further purified, while the wicked will suffer\. __Concomitants to the Judgment: Resurrection of Bodies\. __All individuals will be resurrected simultaneously\. The wicked will endure distortions reflecting their earthly misdeeds, whereas the good will rise in a perfect, complete state, reflecting the maturity of Christ\. __Consequents to the Judgment: Pains of Hell\. __Hell is a material place for the wicked, where they endure eternal fire proportional to their guilt\. They will suffer the loss of the beatific vision, endure material fire, and experience internal conflict symbolized by the torment of worms\. __Glory of Paradise\. __Paradise offers substantial rewards, including the vision, fruition, and possession of God\. Consubstantial rewards enhance bodily glory through gifts of luminosity, subtility, agility, and impassibility\. Accidental honors recognize specific deeds, such as martyrdom and preaching, that led others to salvation\.
