__The Christians as the Romans Saw Them \- Robert Louis Wilken__

__I\. Pliny: A Roman Gentleman\.__

__The Making of a Roman Official\. __Pliny the Younger, a prominent Roman official, was the nephew of Pliny the Elder\. His uncle's death made him wealthy, enabling him to study in Rome under the renowned rhetorician Quintilian\. Pliny's career included roles as an advocate, military administrator, quaestor under Domitian, tribune, praetor, several prefect positions, consul, and governor of Bithynia\-Pontus\. __Travels of a Provincial Governor\. __As governor, Pliny traveled to aid cities struggling with financial difficulties, factionalism, and political unrest\. Notably, he sought permission from Emperor Trajan to establish firefighting clubs, fearing they might evolve into political clubs \(__*haeteria*__\), a term later applied to Christians\. Trajan denied the request, advising Pliny to let individuals manage their affairs independently\. __A Christian Association\. __Between letters to Amisus and Amastris, Pliny wrote a significant letter concerning Christians, likely from northern Pontus, in the fall of 112\. Citizens complained about Christians, perhaps due to economic impacts on merchants or butchers\. In correspondence with Trajan, Pliny sought clarity: Should Christians be punished solely for their name or for crimes associated with it? Compared to Bacchic orgies, Christians were accused of promiscuity, cannibalism, and debauchery\. However, Pliny noted in his letter that Christians consumed ordinary, harmless food\. __Action Against Christians\. __Pliny chose to confront Christianity head\-on, conducting trials\. He questioned individuals thrice about their faith, threatening execution for persistent affirmation\. Those who admitted were executed for obstinacy, while Roman citizens were imprisoned\. Christians were largely unpopular with locals, and the alleged boundaries between Christians and non\-Christians were ambiguous\. __Offerings of Wine and Incense\. __Pliny devised a test to identify Christians: reciting a formula invoking gods, offering wine and incense to Trajan, and reviling Christ's name\. These supplications, typically linked to national emergencies or celebrations, tested religious and political loyalty\. Trajan approved the test but instructed Pliny not to actively hunt Christians, emphasizing fair treatment\.

__II\. Christianity as a Burial Society__

__Relatively Unknown Movement\. __In the early 2nd century, Christianity was a relatively obscure movement with around 50,000 adherents scattered across small communities, each typically consisting of dozens to hundreds of members\. This was a minor presence compared to the 4\-5 million Jews and a total Roman population of about 60 million\. Due to its small size and the clandestine nature of its gatherings, Christianity was largely an unknown entity to the broader Roman society\. Much of the information about Christians came from hearsay and records such as those by Pliny, who categorized Christianity as a "*superstitio*," a term for superstition used by few writers, and "*hetaeria*," meaning a political club, a term used more frequently\. __Church or Political Club? __In Roman society, Christians were often associated with the term *ecclesia*\. While Christians used *ecclesia* to denote their religious assemblies, Romans interpreted this term from their context, where it referred to a popular *political assembly*, distinct from the city council\. Roman parallels were drawn with guild\-like associations, known as *hetaeria*, which often had their own patron deities\. __A Sense of Belonging\. __Christianity appealed largely to the lower classes, such as craftsmen, artisans, merchants, shopkeepers, freedmen, and slaves, offering a sense of belonging akin to that provided by various guilds or funerary and religious societies like those dedicated to Bacchus or Isis\. These associations offered social networking and emotional support, forming fundamental social units for their members\. __A Bacchic Society\. __The cult of Dionysius, also known as Bacchus, had structured associations complete with statutes, voting, subscriptions, meetings, strict rules, and penalties for disorder\. They celebrated both life events and daily gatherings\. This structure draws parallels to fraternities and was somewhat similar to early Christian communities that held regular communal meals, ritual initiations, and adhered to established rules and standards\. Christians engaged in celebrations filled with speeches, prayers, hymns, wine, and communal contributions to a common chest, reflecting an organizational structure overseen by appointed leaders and administrators\. __An Obscure and Secret Association\. __Unlike other associations that participated in public religious rites of the cities, Christians were perceived as an "obscure and secret association\." However, their activities were not illegal and were likened to a burial association\. Tertullian framed Christianity as an association \(*collegium*\) that was not politically divisive\. It upheld unity through religious profession, a shared way of life, and a common hope\. Christians gathered as an assembly to __pray for emperors and read sacred texts, fostering their faith\.__ Terms such as *factio Christiania*, *corpus*, *secta Dei*, and *coitio Christanorum* were used to describe these gatherings, alongside familiar words like *arca* \(chest\), *honoraria* \(gifts\), and *stips* \(contribution\)\. The use of *ecclesia* was avoided in favor of a more social descriptor of the church, emphasizing its role as a societal, rather than purely theological, entity \(as noted in Apology 39\)\.

__III\. The Piety of the Persecutors\.__

__A Suspicious Antisocial Superstition\. __The term "*superstitio*" was used by Roman historians like Tacitus and Suetonius to describe early Christians as practitioners of a mischievous and antisocial superstition\. In Tacitus's "*Annales*," Christians were depicted as being persecuted not only due to Nero's cruelty but also because of their perceived antisocial tendencies\. Suetonius, in "Lives of the Caesars," also referred to Christianity as a mischievous superstition, reflecting a broader Roman suspicion of foreign and strange religious practices\. __Roman Religion and Christian Prejudice\. __"Superstition" in Roman terms often referred to foreign and unfamiliar beliefs, casting a judgmental eye on practices from cultures like those of the Jews and Egyptians\. Tacitus noted the distinctiveness of Jewish practices, highlighting their spiritual monotheism and social isolation\. In Roman society, religion was sometimes manipulated by the wealthy to gain social advantages, but it was also deeply ingrained in the fabric of civic life\. __The Practice of Religion\. __In Rome, *religious and civic occasions were closely intertwined*, with acts of piety involving the wider community in honoring the gods\. Initially, piety signified honor and loyalty to traditions, but it evolved to mean reverence and devotion to the gods\. Romans expressed piety publicly and privately, as seen in the use of terms like "*pia*" and "*pius*" on gravestones\. Romans prided themselves on being religious, *viewing their religious practices as superior* to those of other peoples\. Unlike belief in gods, Romans considered themselves to possess gods\. Cicero warned that losing piety towards the gods could lead to the collapse of societal values, lamenting that providence and religion maintained societal order while superstition was seen as the irrational fear of the gods\. __"We Too Are a Religious People\." __Religion was seen as an inheritance from the ancestors, sustaining the state's life, while new movements, like the Christian sect from Palestine, *appeared to threaten this order*\. Romans sincerely believed in providence, declaring, "we too are a religious people," implying religion was more than just political or state affairs\. __Public piety and civil religion were seen as part of a social contract\.__ Viewing Christians as an "enemy of mankind" meant they were perceived as being indifferent to civic duties and a threat to social cohesion\.

__IV\. Galen: The Curiosity of a Philosopher\.__

__Philosophy and Medicine\. __Galen hailed from Pergamum, a city renowned for its great library, which is the namesake of parchment \(pergamentum\)\. Born in 130 AD, Galen's philosophical interests spanned Stoicism, Platonism, Aristotelianism, and Epicureanism before he ventured into medicine\. He eventually became the personal physician to Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius, and was known as a prolific writer whose works spanned various disciplines\. __Christianity as a Philosophical School\. __Galen categorized Jews and Christians as a philosophical school, though he critiqued them for not meeting the rigorous standards of philosophy\. He observed that they appealed to faith, much like other traditions\. In Galen's view, philosophers had become akin to salesmen, often trading logic and reason for emotional and sensational appeals\. He remarked that people often aligned themselves with philosophical schools, such as Platonism or Stoicism, for reasons other than genuine understanding, viewing them as ways of life rather than purely intellectual pursuits\. __The Practice of Philosophy\. __Christians were criticized by figures like Celsus for relying on faith, yet early Christian thinkers such as Justin Martyr and Athenagoras began to counter these criticisms with rational arguments\. Unlike many, Galen did not label Christianity as superstition but *acknowledged it as a philosophical* school because it promoted and fostered a life of virtue\. As philosophy grew in popularity, especially among the elite—note, for instance, Marcus Aurelius's Stoicism—Christians were recognized as philosophers due to their lives characterized by self\-discipline, self\-control, the pursuit of justice, and fears transcended, not through intellectual teachings, but through lived experiences\. __The Arbitrary God of the Christians and the Doctrine of Creation\. __Galen was aware of the distinct teachings of Christians, though he was not overly impressed\. In his estimation, Moses's account of creation was preferable to the Epicurean view because it emphasized will over chance, yet Galen found it lacking efficiency or intrinsic goodness\. The concept of pre\-existent matter in Jewish thought seemed flawed to Galen when compared to Plato's Demiurge, which offered a more detailed and systematic creation narrative\. For Galen, Moses's God appeared capricious: he argued that creation should be good before being willed, criticizing the arbitrariness of divine will\. During the 2nd century, Christian doctrine of creation was still developing, influenced largely by Platonic notions of unformed matter, with the new idea of "creation ex nihilo" emerging to emphasize God’s transcendence and sovereignty—concepts that were foreign to Greek thought\. While Pliny's understanding of Christians was largely based on hearsay, Galen showed a genuine interest in their beliefs\. Despite being impressed by their virtue, he found Christians to be dogmatic and uncritical, perceiving their God as capricious\.

__V\. Celsus: A Conservative Intellectual\.__

In around 170 AD, Celsus authored "True Doctrine," a critique of Christianity for which only fragments remain\. His work prompted Origen to respond with eight books approximately seventy years later\. Though Celsus began as an Epicurean and later embraced Platonism, he did not align himself strictly with any major philosophical school\. __Begging Priests of Cybele and Soothsayers\. __Celsus, well\-informed about Christianity, utilized satire and humor in his critiques, mocking Christians by likening them to fringe movements, such as the priests of Cybele and soothsayers, as well as worshippers of Mithras and Sabazius\. He criticized Christianity's fideism and disdain for worldly knowledge and education, portraying Christians as uneducated followers merely echoing their leaders' teachings\. __Jesus as Sorcerer\.__ Given Roman laws against magic, Celsus also suggested that Jesus' miracles, despite being used by Christians like Justin Martyr and Athenagoras to validate their faith, were acts of sorcery, a criminal offense in Rome\. He was willing to concede that Jesus performed miracles but saw them as examples of sorcery, alleging that Jesus learned such practices during his childhood in Egypt\. __The Deficiencies of Christian Doctrine\. __Celsus was knowledgeable about Christianity's origins and relation to Judaism, possibly having read Justin Martyr's apologies\. He critiqued Christian thinkers' desire to be judged by the same standards as Greek philosophers, applying three major theological criticisms\. 

1. Celsus found the incarnation so irrational that it required no lengthy refutation, arguing that it implied change in a being claimed to be immutable and perfect\. 
2. He questioned the necessity of the incarnation, raising concerns about its implications for those who lived before Christ\. 
3. He argued that the resurrection contradicted God's rational nature\. Finally, he noted the inconsistency in worshiping Jesus within Christianity's monotheistic framework, questioning whether Jesus deserved such reverence\.

__Demythologizing the Story of Jesus\. __As the first critic to carefully examine Jesus as both a figure and an object of worship, Celsus scrutinized elements of Jesus's story, such as the virgin birth, which he dismissed as a fabrication\. He ridiculed the claimed divine voice at Jesus' baptism and compared the resurrection to other legends from ancient literature, highlighting a lack of reliable witnesses\. Origen later defended the reliability of the Gospel accounts as foundational to Christology\. __An Apostasy from Judaism\. __Celsus saw Christianity as a departure from Judaism, noting that Christians had abandoned Jewish Law while relying on Jewish tradition\. During the second century, Judaism was thriving in the Roman Empire, comprising a significant minority, while Christianity was a smaller, relatively unknown sect\. Celsus questioned why Jews, from whom Christianity originated, did not acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, leading him to dismiss Christianity as lacking tradition or validity\. __Religion and the Social Order\. __Celsus criticized Christians for refusing to engage in public duties such as military service, associating them with anti\-social behavior similar to Tacitus's claim of their hatred for humanity\. He argued that Christians could worship their God while participating in civic life\. By establishing a distinct social group with its own customs and governance, Christians were seen as a revolutionary, nation\-like sect without traditional legitimacy\. Celsus demanded evidence for Jesus' divinity, dismissing claims of divinity as merely magic and sorcery, while Christians sought to worship him exclusively\. __A Secretive and Perilous Society\. __In Celsus's view, Christianity was a secretive and perilous society, posing a threat to the social order by breaching Judaic law and potentially encroaching on Hellenistic traditions\. He saw this new religion, which challenged both Judaism and Greco\-Roman reverence for antiquity, as lacking cultural depth\. Although Celsus did not defend any particular set of beliefs, he valued traditional practices for their historical continuity, opposing the sectarian and privatizing tendencies of emerging religious movements like Christianity\.

__VI\. Porphyry: The Most Learned Critic of All\.__

Porphyry, a Platonist philosopher from the second half of the 3rd century, was one of the most sophisticated critics of Christianity, prompting responses from prominent figures such as Eusebius, Methodius, Apollinarius, Jerome, Augustine, Constantine, and Theodosius II\. Despite the fragmentary nature of his work today, Porphyry had a deep understanding of the Bible, recognizing the permanence of Christianity and attempting to integrate it into his own philosophical framework\. __In Defense of Plato\. __Hailing from Tyre and well\-educated, Porphyry briefly attended lectures by Origen but was unimpressed, finding the reconciliation of Greek intellectual traditions with the emerging Christian religion to be absurd\. From Origen, Porphyry gleaned techniques in biblical criticism, with his attacks on Christianity grounded in philology and literary critique\. As a student of Plotinus, Porphyry embraced an ascetic lifestyle, similar to Christians, and shared many moral and religious values with them, despite his philosophical opposition\. __The Jewish Scriptures\. __Porphyry focused his critique predominantly on the Old Testament, applying allegorical interpretations to address textual difficulties, such as the dating of Moses\. In particular, he scrutinized the Book of Daniel, arguing it was written in the 2nd century BC rather than by Daniel himself, thus challenging the traditional historical and prophetic Christian interpretations\. This stance positioned *Daniel not as a prophet but as a historian*, a perspective that undermined the Christians' use of Daniel's prophecies to validate Jesus' messianic claims\. __The Christian New Testament\. __Although much of Porphyry's critique of the New Testament is lost, it's known he applied literary and historical criticism to expose perceived contradictions and inconsistencies within the Gospels\. He acknowledged Christ as a wise man deserving respect, but not divine, disputing the Evangelists' accounts as fabrications\. __Philosophy from Oracles\. __Porphyry was also known for his work, "Philosophy from Oracles," which addressed the worship of gods and proposed a hierarchy with one supreme god and lesser beings\. This text was grounded in traditional religious texts and divided worship into three categories: gods, *daimones*, and heroes or divine figures, placing Jesus in the last category\. Porphyry argued that while Christians claimed to worship the supreme god, they effectively revered Jesus—a man of notable piety who advocated worship of the one true God yet was misunderstood by his disciples\. __The Religion of the Emperor\. __Porphyry's political theology critiqued Christians for not participating in pagan civil society, emphasizing their lack of civic piety and perceived transgression against established laws and traditions\. __Jesus not a Magician\. __Unlike some contemporaries who accused Jesus of being a magician, Porphyry rejected this notion, recognizing Jesus as a wise and virtuous man\. This distinction was later used by Eusebius to counter other pagan critics like Hierocles by showcasing internal disagreements among critics of Christianity just prior to the Arian controversy\. __An Unreasoning Faith\. __Porphyry, like Celsus and Galen, accused Christians of relying on unreasoning faith\. He challenged Christian claims of God's omnipotence, arguing that God cannot act against his nature\. Issues such as the resurrection highlighted these contradictions, questioning whether it was like that of Jesus or Lazarus\. Porphyry also critiqued the notion of historical revelation, asking what became of those who lived before Christ, especially if Christianity claimed the antiquity of Judaism as foundational, leaving Romans without access to Christ's grace until his arrival\.

__VII\. Julian the Apostate: Jewish Law and Christian Truth\.__

Emperor Julian, who ruled from 361 to 363 AD, launched a direct challenge against Christianity, which had not yet become the official religion of the Roman Empire\. During his brief reign, he attempted to restore traditional Roman religious practices and even sought to rebuild the Jewish temple in Jerusalem as part of his campaign against Christianity\. __The Emperor's Piety\. __Julian was deeply influenced by philosophy and literature, aligning himself with Neoplatonism and studying under Aedesius of the Porphyrian school\. He engaged in theurgical practices involving magic and trance, participating in the cults of Cybele and Mithras\. Though not openly rejecting Christianity at first—partly due to his cousin, Emperor Constantius, being a Christian—Julian's deployment to Gaul and subsequent military successes paved the way for his eventual sole emperorship and restoration of traditional pagan worship\. __Greek Education and Christian Values\. __Julian's conversion to paganism underscored his passionate and emotional commitment to traditional religion, extending beyond cultural and intellectual interests to emphasize private piety and sacrificial practices\. His intimate knowledge of Christianity informed his reforms, making Greek literature from antiquity compulsory both educationally and religiously\. *Apollinarius* responded to these changes by recasting Scripture in the form of classical Greek literary works, echoing Homeric epics and other genres\. __Against the Galilaeans\. __In his treatise *Against the Galilaeans*, Julian attacked Christianity from Antioch, a hub of Greek culture with a significant Christian presence\. This work, later refuted by Cyril, critiqued the Gospels, questioned their relationship with the Old Testament, and reduced Jesus to a non\-divine figure through Arian theological arguments, suggesting only the Gospel of John depicted Jesus's divinity and asserting Moses championed monotheism\. __The Tribal God of Jews and Christians\. __Julian sometimes identified the Jewish God with the supreme deity venerated across cultures, yet accused Christians of appropriating the Jewish God\. He described this God as a tribal, sectional deity limited by specific historical revelations, questioning why such a universal God should concern himself solely with Judaea\. By arguing that Jews and Christians mistook fables and myths, such as the creation of ignorant, helpless humans, for truth, Julian critiqued the God of the Bible as jealous\. He deemed Moses's cosmology inferior to Plato’s, lacking in spiritual depth, and labeled the Tower of Babel a purely fictional narrative\. __An Apostasy from Judaism\. __One of Julian's most compelling arguments was that Christianity represented an apostasy from Judaism, with Christians using the destruction of the Temple to claim superiority\. Julian countered that Judaism remained vibrant, following Celsus in exposing Christians' inconsistent appropriation of Jewish tradition\. He attempted to rebuild the Jewish temple to affirm Judaism's legitimacy and reinstate sacrificial practices, arguing that Christians had forsaken fundamental Jewish tenets like circumcision and sacrifice, necessitating a temple for Jews\.

__Epilogue\.__

Christianity’s uneasy relationship with Judaism was marked by its growing universal appeal within the Roman world, largely due to its adherents' lifestyles rather than solely their beliefs\. This widespread influence sparked significant scrutiny from pagan critics, who took Christianity seriously, engaging it on its own terms of reason and argumentation\. Despite lacking antiquity and their privatization of faith, Christians employed historical and literary arguments to defend core tenets, leading to a deeper dialectic engagement and doctrinal development, such as the concept of creation ex nihilo, as a constructive response to critical challenges\.
