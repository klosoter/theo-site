# De Trinitate – Augustine 

In Book I, Augustine lays out his view on the unity and equality of the Trinity’s Divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\. While drawing from Scripture, he underscores their consubstantial and co\-eternal relationship, rooted in an inseparable unity that defies simple human understanding\. Augustine leverages Scripture to argue against any notion of hierarchy within the Trinity, asserting that differences perceived in the roles or functions of the Divine Persons do not imply inequality in their divine essence\. He specifically addresses the dual nature of Christ, emphasizing that references to the Son’s “inferiority” pertain solely to His incarnation and role as a servant\. Augustine also distinguishes between the different roles of Christ’s different natures\. As God with the Father, he has humanity as subjects, while as a priest, he is subjected to the Father with us\. Augustine emphasizes the importance of *as\-language* here\. Yet, in a way reminiscent of the *communicatio idiomatum*, he shows how Jesus’ attributes of one nature can be applied to the other\. For example, “the Son of man will judge” and “the God of glory suffered\.”

In __Book II__, Augustine investigates divine missions in the Old Testament, examining how theophanies do not compromise the equality among the Trinity’s Persons\. He clarifies that the acts of being sent or glorifying one another within the Trinity signify their co\-eternal relationship and mutual equality rather than a hierarchical difference\.

Augustine distinguishes between the permanent incarnation of the Son and the Spirit’s transient appearances\. He raises three questions that he will address in books II\-IV: Were there missions in the Old Testament \(Book II\)? By which means, e\.g\., angels \(Book III\)? Were the Son and Spirit sent *properly* before the New Testament \(Book IV\)? Augustine critiques interpretations that misread the Son’s pre\-incarnation appearances as implying mortality, emphasizing the inseparability of the Trinity’s works in these manifestations\.

Through discussions on specific Old Testament theophanies, such as those to Adam, Abraham, and Moses, Augustine argues that it is often not clear which person of the Trinity is manifested, as their divine works are indivisible – yet, the Father is never *sent*\. He underscores that these appearances are accommodated to human senses, as no one can see God and live\. He sometimes seems to imply that these manifestations are not to be taken literally, but allegorically\.

__Book III__ analyzes the mission and work of angels\. God sometimes governs creation through angelic means\. Yet, and this applies to both evil and good angels, their powers are limited, God remains creator, and only by divine permission are they able to speed up *proximate causes* as secondary agents\.

__Book IV__ is the most difficult and most important book of *De Trinitate*\. Augustine focuses on Christ as the divine Mediator and contrasts His mission with notions of false mediation of the Devil\. He starts with the theological premise that Christ’s coming was aimed at rescuing humanity from both physical and spiritual death through His own death and resurrection, offering humanity a path to salvation and eternal life\. Augustine employs a wide range of complex, speculative numerological interpretations to explain the truth and fittingness of Christ’s mediating role\. He sharply contrasts the devil – the anti\-mediator who draws humanity towards death – and Christ, who, through His resurrection, offers redemption and eternal life\. 

Christ is depicted as the perfect mediator, being both fully human and fully divine, and sinless\. Arguing against inadequate Platonic and Plotinian ideas of self\-salvation through intellectual or mystical contemplation, Augustine emphasizes the necessity of Christ’s mediation for true purification and knowledge of eternal life, describing a four\-step spiritual journey: origination, death, resurrection, and ascension as facilitated by Christ\. Again, Augustine emphasizes that *being sent* does not imply inferiority but rather affirms the Son’s co\-eternity, consubstantiality, and equality with the Father\. Throughout the mission and incarnation of Christ, the essential unity of the Trinity is maintained continuously\.

__Chapters V\-VII__ discuss logical and linguistic aspects of speaking about the Trinity\. Augustine starts by emphasizing against the Arians that God has no accidents and that only substantive and relational predicates apply to God\. Substantive attributes \(e\.g\., goodness, justice\) are identical and apply essentially \(i\.e\., God is his attributes\) to the Godhead as well as to each of the individual persons\. Relational attributes \(e\.g\., Father, Son, and Gift\) are proper to each person individually but exist only in reference to the relations of the other persons\. Augustine spends considerable time discussing 1 Corinthians 1:24 \(Christ is the power and wisdom of God\) to maintain that this does not imply any causational hierarchy of attributes between the persons of the Trinity\.

In __Book VIII,__ Augustine argues that God can be known through his attributes\. For example, by participating in good things, we can perceive Goodness itself, which is God\. Yet, we are unable to do so because of our weakened intellect and twisted appetites\. He discovers a vicious cycle: \(1\) we must love God in order to see him; \(2\) we cannot love what we do not know; \(3\) we must see and know God first to love him\. This cycle can only be broken by faith\. Book VIII introduces the use of analogies we perceive around us to form ideas in our minds and describe and know God\. We can form ideas of justness, even though we may not be just ourselves\. He introduces the analogy of the Trinity as Lover, Loved One, and Love, which introduces the discussion of subsequent books\.

__Book IX__ further explores the psychological analogy for understanding the Trinity, using the human mind as a model to illuminate the relationships between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\. Building on the model introduced in Book VIII, he identifies a trio within the mind – the lover \(the mind itself\), the loved \(the knowledge the mind has\), and the love \(the act of loving\)\. This internal dialogue between knowing and being known reflects the dynamism within the Trinity – the Father knowing and loving the Son, and the love that proceeds from both\.

Augustine wrestles with the question of whether love, like knowledge, can be considered an image or word that is unbegotten\. He suggests that just as knowledge pre\-exists in the mind and becomes manifest through the act of knowing \(self\-reflection\), love too is begotten by the mind’s act of loving itself\. Hence, the mind \(representing the Father\), its knowledge \(the Son\), and its love \(the Holy Spirit\) together form a triune analogy for understanding the complex interactions within the Trinity\.

__Book X__ further develops the mental image of IX and discusses its limitations\. The mind ought to want to know itself \(“Know Thyself”\), but is unable to do so because of the fall\. Augustine discusses erroneous materialistic views of the mind, which are inapplicable to the analogy of the Trinity\. Focusing on the inward processes of knowing, he says – in a way foreshadowing Descartes:

Let it therefore avoid joining anything else to its knowing of itself when it hears the command to know itself\. It knows for certain the command is being given to itself, the self which is and lives and understands\. \.\.\. But all these minds have known that they understand, and are, and live \.\.\. The consequence is that whatever understands also is and lives\. \(298\)

Drawing from this focus on the mind, he introduces a new trio: memory, understanding, and will, which are three in one, in relation to each other, but also singular\. 

__Book XI__ explores the lesser analogy of sight: will, sight, memory/image\. In Book XII, Augustine explores the impact of the fall upon the image of God, which, according to him, refers to the mind rather than the body\. Book XIII discusses the redemption and reparation of the image of God through the life and redeeming death of Christ, which give us knowledge and wisdom, respectively\. Book XIV further picks up the analogy of Book X of the mind remembering, understanding, and loving itself\. This is the true image of God because it is coeternal with the mind itself and does not depend on something from outside\. Yet, the *perfect* image of God is the mind, remembering, understanding, and loving *God*, which is truly recalling God through the Spirit\. This is a lifelong process and is only completed when we see God face to face\.

Book XV concludes the work and briefly summarizes the previous ones\. From Romans 1:20, Augustine argues that God’s perfections are reflected in creation\. However, creation cannot teach us the Trinity as God is identical with his attributes and utterly transcendent\. We see through a mirror as an enigma\. The reflection of God’s perfection in creation is inadequate and unlike the original because God is perfect and eternal, and our knowledge, word, etc\., are temporal\. Yet, regardless of the inadequacy of the image Trinity of memory, thought, and love, Augustine commends it as a means of accessing communion with the divine\. 

*De Trinitate* is a masterwork that systematically develops an understanding of the Trinity while drawing from Scripture, philosophy, and analogies from nature\. Augustine’s exegesis of key – sometimes problematic – texts is helpful, although his esoteric numerology \(cf\. Book VI\) is questionable\.
