__22 “The Social Aims of Jesus” in Christianity and the Social Crisis – Walter Rauschenbusch__

__*The New Social Insight into the Gospel*\.__ Rauschenbusch delves into how evolving societal perspectives have influenced interpretations of the Gospel, highlighting three significant historical shifts\. The Renaissance era brought forth greater appreciation for the Bible's historical and literary dimensions\. The Reformation emphasized the Bible's living power\. In the current epoch, characterized by social and revolutionary changes, there's a movement towards reinterpreting the nature and history of the Gospel through a social lens\. This shift suggests that present societal developments are reshaping understanding of the past, including the social background of Jesus, as “the better we know Jesus, the more social do his thoughts and aims become” \(41\)\.

__*Jesus Not a Social Reformer*\.__  Rauschenbusch counters the notion that Jesus was a social reformer akin to a "first socialist" or "Tolstoian anarchist\." He argues that Jesus's primary focus was not on sociology or political economy\. Instead, Jesus approached societal evils from a moral standpoint, emphasizing that economic distribution issues should be understood in terms of moral relations within a religious community\. For Jesus, the essence of addressing societal problems lay in fostering a spiritual reality where God the Father is central, indicating that Jesus's true concern was spiritual and relational \(“the heart of his heart was religion”\) rather than socio\-political reform\.

__*His*__* *__*Relation to Contemporary Movements*\.__ He indicates that while the Christian movement can be traced back to John the Baptist, it essentially signifies the reincarnation of the ancient prophetic tradition, emphasizing ethical repentance\. This tradition called for a brotherly life, advocating for the redistribution of resources to equalize social inequities – exemplified by the directive that he who has two coats should share with him who has none – and urging tax collectors and soldiers to abandon their exploitative behaviors, marking a push towards a reign of social justice under the Kingdom of God\. Jesus continued John’s emphasis on repentance, the Kingdom of God, and baptism, echoing the prophets' opposition to purely ceremonial religious practices in favor of a stronger focus on ethical imperatives\. Through this, Jesus aligned with the fundamental religious purposes of the prophets, advocating for significant social and ethical reforms\.

__*The Purpose of Jesus: The Kingdom of God\.*__ The concept of the Kingdom of God is central to Jesus's preaching, understood not just spiritually but within a broad socio\-political and eschatological context that resonated with Jewish expectations\. These expectations encompassed revolutionary and political deliverance from national oppressors, social justice in accordance with the Law and prophets, and religious purity\. Jesus aligned with these collective and national hopes but introduced significant modifications, emphasizing a peaceful approach without bloodshed and violence – either human or divine – envisioning judgment as an eschatological rather than an opening event and rejecting catastrophic or apocalyptic instantiations of the Kingdom\. Jesus advocated for a Kingdom characterized by organic growth, using agricultural parables, and requiring faith, focusing on societal transformation through individual change – "the new society" as opposed to merely "the new soul\." His vision extended beyond Jewish nationalistic hopes to a more inclusive, human, and universal expectation that included Gentiles, exemplified by his engagements with Samaritans and others, aligning with Paul's teaching that in Christ, there is no division like Jew or Greek\. __The hermeneutical presupposition suggests that the historical transmission of Jesus's message underwent modifications, particularly toward a more catastrophic expectation of the Kingdom of God, which might not align with Jesus’s original teachings perceived as already organically initiating the Kingdom\. __This analysis aims to reclaim the purpose of Jesus: instituting a new society grounded in love, inclusivity, and organic development rather than expecting divine or violent intervention\. Rauschenbusch aptly summarizes this view:

This, then, is our interpretation of the situation\. Jesus, like all the prophets and like all his spiritually minded countrymen, lived in the hope of a great transformation of the national, social, and religious life about him\. He shared the substance of that hope with his people, but by his profounder insight and his loftier faith he elevated and transformed the common hope\. He rejected all violent means and thereby transferred the inevitable conflict from the field of battle to the antagonism of mind against mind, and of heart against lack of heart\. He postponed the divine catastrophe of judgment to the dim distance and put the emphasis on the growth of the new life that was now going on\. He thought less of changes made *en masse*, and more of the immediate transformation of single centers of influence and of social nuclei\. The Jewish hope became a human hope with universal scope\. The old intent gaze into the future was turned to faith in present realities and beginnings, and found its task here and now \(53\)\.

__*The Kingdom of God and the Ethics of Jesus\.*__* *According to Rauschenbusch, the Kingdom of God centers on establishing a society rooted in righteousness where moral goodness is defined as communal well\-being\. __Love, __underscored by acts of forgiveness and reconciliation,__ is fundamental to Jesus’ ethical instructions__\. Jesus demonstrated this through his interactions with marginalized individuals, advocating for a __community without hierarchy and emphasizing service and the collective good over individual status\.__

*Insistence on Conduct *__*and Indifference to Ritual*__\. Jesus emphasized the importance of conduct over adherence to rituals, illustrating this with teachings like "the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath\." He argued that rituals were supposed to serve God and man, shifting the understanding of the essence of the Kingdom of God from Jewish religious observance to right human righteousness\. 

*His Teaching on Wealth*\. Jesus emphasizes the impossibility of serving both God and Mammon, suggesting that riches act as a 'soul\-poison\.' He highlights how wealth could isolate individuals from a necessary sense of community and responsibility towards others\. This perspective is exemplified in the story of the rich young man, wherein Jesus acknowledges the complexities of having wealthy followers, such as potential favoritism, attracting followers with selfish motives, and diluting his influence among the poor\. Jesus's decision not to ask the rich young man to contribute to a communal purse but rather to encourage him to leverage his wealth for social good reflects a nuanced understanding of wealth's role in society\. Parables such as that of the unjust steward and the rich man and Lazarus further illustrate __the spiritual dangers and moral responsibilities tied to wealth\. __The gospels navigate between two extremes with regard to wealth: __John emphasizes religious and theological aspects, and Luke focuses on social concerns\. __

*The Social Affinities of Jesus\. *Rauschenbusch argues __that Jesus identifies with the poor and oppressed, echoing the Old Testament prophets' sympathies__, as evidenced by common themes in his parables – such as the lost sheep, the persistent widow, and the rich man and Lazarus – that reflect the life experiences of the marginalized\. Through this, combined with his humble background as a carpenter and living without possessions, __Jesus distinguished himself from the theologians of his time__ by prioritizing the needs and concerns of those often overlooked by society\. 

__*The Revolutionary Consciousness of Jesus*\.__ __Jesus's proposed revolution came not in violence and bloodshed but through a radical shift in societal values and structures\.__ He envisions a society where the hungry are fed, the rich face scarcity, the first become last, and all live as brethren, challenging existing hierarchies and advocating for equality\. Rauschenbusch explains Jesus’ puzzling statement, “__Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s,” as his questioning their allegiance and emphasizing its consequences: “If they filled their pockets with Caesar’s money, let them pay Caesar’s tax\.”__ Jesus fosters an ideal of communal life that seeks a revolutionary displacement of the current order, emphasizing a reversal of values\. __This contradicts the traditional Christian teaching that retreats from the world's evils to monasticism or complacency\.__ Instead, Rauschenbusch presents Jesus as the first real man, establishing a new humanity and social order, where __redemption covers all aspects of human life__, pointing towards comprehensive change\.

__Contribution and Discussion\. __Rauschenbusch's work significantly contributes to Liberation Theology by reasserting the social and communal aspects of Jesus's teachings while affirming the centrality of the spiritual aspect of his message\. He provides a compelling case for viewing Jesus not just as a religious figure but as an advocate for a revolutionary social order that challenges existing power structures and promotes a more equitable society\. This perspective, which is more nuanced than most Liberation Theologians \(e\.g\., Segundo\), encourages a reevaluation of Christian responsibility toward addressing societal injustices and underscores the importance of integrating faith with social activism\. __Yet, the transcendental dimension of the Gospels is often neglected\.__ Campolo rightly __raises three main concerns__ from an evangelical perspective\. First, Rauschenbusch’s __Christology is unclear__ about Jesus’ divinity\. Second, __his view of Scripture__ as tainted by the political motivations of its authors clashes with the evangelical doctrine of inspiration\. Third, __Rauschenbusch’s contradiction between the organic emergence of the Kingdom and its catastrophic consummation is unwarranted __and is reminiscent of Moltmann’s preference for *adventus* over *futurum\.*
