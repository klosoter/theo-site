__The Mind’s Road to God – Bonaventure__

The __prologue__ to *The Mind’s Road to God *outlines Bonaventure’s spiritual quest for enlightenment, inspired by St\. Francis of Assisi\. It describes the latter’s transformative vision on Mount Alverna, where he contemplates ascending to God and sees a seraph symbolizing crucifixion, its six wings denoting six stages of spiritual illumination, achievable through the love of the Crucified, and emphasizes the necessity of prayer and proper disposition for divine contemplation\. The text is structured into seven chapters, each exploring different stages of the spiritual journey toward God\.

__Chapter one__ discusses how to ascend to God by recognizing His traces in the universe \(stage one\)\. Bonaventure starts by stating that achieving beatitude, or the highest good, requires divine aid, emphasizing the importance of praying for enlightenment about the stages of ascension\. He describes the world as a ladder with traces and images that are both corporeal and spiritual, external and internal\. These traces lead us towards God in a structured order: from the corporeal traces in the *material* world, through our internal, *spiritual* understanding, towards a *divine* joyous knowledge and reverence of God\. This triple illumination aligns with the modes of the mind, heart, and soul\. Each of these modes is twofold, as God is the alpha and the omega, and we see *through* and *in *a mirror, resulting in six stages\. The necessity of grace, justice, knowledge, and wisdom for this journey is stressed, along with the importance of prayer, holy living, and striving for reflection\. Bonaventure describes the first stage as reflecting on God’s traces in the universe; the *contemplation* of created things through their weight \(substance\), number \(power\), and measure \(operation\) for contemplation; origin \(nature\), course \(Scripture\), and terminus \(grace\) for *belief*; and the *reasoning* about being \(earthly\), living \(celestial\), and understanding \(supercelestial\) leading to the contemplation of God's power, wisdom, and goodness\.

__Chapter two__ focuses on the second stage, how God reflects Himself in the sensible world, suggesting that we can find God not just through \(stage one\) but also in sensible things\. He explains that the macrocosm of the world is mirrored within the microcosm of the soul through our five senses\. This process begins with the *apprehension* of sensible objects through the senses, leading to a sequence of delight and judgment\. Bonaventure elaborates on how our senses connect us to the world in specific ways: sight with transparent bodies, touch with solid/terrestrial bodies, taste with aqueous substance, hearing with aerial, and odor with vaporous\. Through these senses, the soul apprehends similitudes of external objects, leading to an experience of *delight* in beauty, agreeableness, and wholesomeness\. This delight then prompts *judgment*, a process described as the action causing the sensible species, received sensibly through sense, to enter the intellective faculty by purification and abstraction\. It's in this process of judgment that one can see the reflection of God, where the beautiful, pleasant, and wholesome point towards God as the original and true source of delight\. The steps of contemplating, reasoning, and believing \(stage one\), alongside the sensible processes of apprehending, delighting, and judging \(stage two\), enable one to see God in His traces, as articulated in Romans 1:20\.

Transitioning from the sensible world to the spiritual, __chapter three__ describes stage three as “the reflection of God in his image stamped upon our natural powers\.” Dividing our mental faculties into the mind loving, knowing, and remembering itself \(cf\. Augustine\), Bonaventure distinguishes three powers or operations: \(1\) retention and representation, \(2\) intellect, and \(3\) power of choice\. *Retention and Representation*\. This power involves memory, perception, and foresight, akin to *eternity’s* encompassment of all time\. It transcends simple memory to embrace unchangeable truths, mirroring the eternal aspect of God\. *Intellect*\. Focused on seeking truth, the intellect moves from specific details to the abstract principle of being itself, recognizing the necessity of unity, truthfulness, and goodness for true understanding\. This pursuit reflects divine wisdom, emphasizing the mind's quest for immutable *truth*\. *Power of Choice*\. This power entails deliberation, judgment, and desire for the *highest good*\. True ethical choices are aligned with divine law, indicating that happiness and the highest good are ultimately linked to God\. These three powers reflect the Trinity as the mind's faculties of memory, understanding, and will are paralleled with the Father, Word \(Son\), and Love \(Holy Spirit\) within the Holy Trinity\. Each is presented as coeternal, coequal, and consubstantial\. 

__The next chapter__ explores the fourth stage, “The reflection of God in his image reformed by the gifts of grace\.” The restoration of God's image is guided by the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love, which repair the spiritual faculties marred by sin\. Together, these virtues restore our five senses\. *Faith*\. Restoring spiritual hearing and vision, faith enables us to absorb Christ's teachings and behold His divine splendor\. This virtue helps us regain a *pure* connection with God, overcoming the distractions that distance us from Him\. *Hope *kindles a deep yearning for divine connection, symbolized by the refreshing scent of the spirated Word\. It *illumines* and motivates us to reach out for the divine, anchoring our souls in the promise of eternal redemption and closeness to God\. *Charity *creates a profound union with God, allowing us to receive Him with joy and love Him ecstatically\. It restores divine taste and touch, elevating our spirits to a *perfect* state of blissful communion with God\. Faith, hope, and love serve as the staircase to spiritual elevation, guiding the soul from a state of disrepair due to sin to a hierarchical, sanctified state conformed to the heavenly Jerusalem\. 

Moving on from the sensual and spiritual \(stages one through four\), __chapter five__ introduces the fifth stage: “Reflection of the divine unity in its primary name, which is being\.” This chapter focuses on the divine essence of “Being” as the primary name in the Old Testament, contrasted with “Goodness” – which is discussed in the next chapter – in the New Testament\. Key distinctions of simplicity, actuality, and perfection underpin the discussion\. *Simplicity*\. The divine being is not derived from anything else; it is primal, eternal, and singular, indicating its undivided and uncompounded nature\. *Actuality*\. The divine being exists in a state of pure actuality, devoid of potentialities, signifying its completeness and the full realization of its existence\. *Perfection\.* As a perfect entity, the divine being embodies flawlessness and completeness, integrating all its attributes harmoniously\. Describing the attributes of Being, Bonaventure posits that being is both beginning and end, embodying eternal presence, supreme simplicity, omnipotence, immutability, and ultimate inclusiveness\. This being is pure and absolute, characterized by its omnipresence, role as the origin and final cause, and identification as the most actual, immutable, perfect, and all\-inclusive entity\. Despite the multiplicity of creation, the divine being solely is the most simple unity, clearest truth, the source of all power, causality, and goodness, from, by, and in which all things exist\.

__Chapter six__ explores the sixth stage, the “reflection of the Most Blessed Trinity in its name, which is Good,” demonstrating how “Being” \(stage five\) is the root of essential attributes, with “Good” as the principal foundation of divine emanations conceptualizing the Trinity\. Possibly drawing from Anselm’s ontological argument for the existence of God, he argues that the highest Good must exist, requires self\-diffusion \(cf\. Augustine\), and hence points to the trinity: producer, beloved, and co\-beloved\. Six cumulative attributes further define this relationship: communicability, consubstantiality, configurability, coequality, coeternity, and co\-intimacy\. Each explores different aspects of the Trinity's unity and distinction, from individuality to the internal relationships and missions within the Godhead\. The cherubim symbolize contemplation of God's essential properties and the union of God and man in Christ, which introduces an even greater cause for wonder\. In Jesus Christ, the eternal merges with the temporal, unifying attributes that seem oppositely extreme – such as eternal with temporal, simple with composite, and perfect and immense with the finite and individual\. This union not only exalts humanity but also offers a model for the ultimate elevation of the mind to the divine, encapsulating the perfect reflection of the invisible God and leading to a united, beatific vision\.

__Chapter seven__ introduces a seventh stage as the culmination of the previous six: “Of mental and mystical elevation, in which repose is given to the intellect when the affections pass entirely into God through elevation\.” This stage is the most mystical and most secret as it transcends reflection of the material, spiritual, and divine \(the first six stages\)\. In fact, it entails the complete absorption of the mind into God by abandoning all mental faculties\. This is only attainable through grace through the Holy Spirit\.

Bonaventure's *The Mind's Road to God *uses multiple disciplines – theology, philosophy, and mysticism – to describe the soul's ascent toward divine communion\. The work and the six stages are structured by the mind’s reflection *in and through* the material, spiritual, and divine, respectively focusing on creation, the image of God, and the divine being\. The seventh stage transcends the powers of the mind by a total absorption of the mind in God through mystical unity\. It is important to note that divine grace is essential to ascending the ladder, emphasizing men’s inability to do so\. His contribution stands as a cornerstone in spiritual literature – using vivid imagery – bridging scholasticism – using philosophical concepts – with Franciscan spirituality\.
