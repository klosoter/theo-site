__The Necessity of Reforming the Church – John Calvin__

In the prologue of John Calvin’s work *The Necessity of Reforming the Church*, titled “August Emperor,” addressed to Charles V and his princes, Calvin calls for urgent restoration of the church, which he claims is suffering from profound maladies\. He emphasizes three principal branches of Christian doctrine where reformation is required: worship, knowledge of the source of salvation, and government and the dispensation of the sacraments\. *Worship*\. Calvin emphasizes the importance of recognizing God as the sole source of all perfections, which should lead to genuine glorification, prayer, praise, thanksgiving, self\-abasement, and total obedience and devotion\. He criticizes the current religious practices, which include the veneration of saints and the use of images and statues, equating them to pagan idolatry\. Calvin strongly condemns these practices as they distract from the true worship of God and are not supported by scriptural teachings\. He also points out the emptiness of current ceremonies, filled with impious rites borrowed from heathen and obsolete Jewish practices, which do not contribute to genuine piety\. *Knowledge of the Source of Salvation*\. Calvin describes a correct understanding of salvation as starting from an acknowledgment of individual depravity, leading to a lively sense of the need for Christ’s redemption and justifying grace\. This path should bear the fruits of grace, assurance, and righteousness\. However, he identifies a perversion in the church's teachings, particularly concerning original sin and the doctrine of free will, which he argues leaves no room for the Holy Spirit’s transforming power and leads to a reliance on the merit of works\. This has led to uncertainty and confusion about salvation and assurance\. *Government and the Dispensation of the Sacraments*\. Calvin criticizes the church's administration of sacraments, pointing out that the number of recognized sacraments has been wrongly expanded to seven based on human authority\. He describes practices such as the Mass and related Eucharistic rituals as resembling magical incantations rather than Christ\-ordained sacraments\. The role of bishops and priests has diminished to mere ceremonial functions rather than the teaching of the Gospel, accompanied by a decline in the moral and spiritual integrity of the clergy\. Furthermore, Calvin laments the practices of elections and appointments, leading to tyrannical church governance that deviates significantly from biblical teachings and the early church model\.

__The next chapter,__ __"Divine Truth Lay Buried Under Darkness and Perversion,"__ addresses the corruption and misinterpretations clouding the Christian faith, emphasizing the need for a reformation built on scriptural truths and a return to genuine Christian practices\. Following the Reformation movements initiated by Luther and others, Calvin insists on the continued effort to purify religion from human additions that have obscured its core teachings\. The Bible must be openly preached as the central source of truth to encourage the examination and refutation of false doctrines\. The Reformers also encouraged a lifestyle of worship, repentance, and charity, focusing on adoring God directly, without intermediaries like images or relics, which Calvin decries as forms of idolatry\. This includes practices such as adorning idols with flowers, lighting candles for them, and attributing miraculous properties to statues and relics\. Calvin argues against the doctrine of the intercession of saints, advocating for prayers directed solely to Christ in a vernacular language rather than Latin\. He also criticizes the retention of Old Testament ceremonies \(masks, altars, partition walls, sacrifices\), which have been permanently abrogated, pointing out the need to focus on the new covenant through Christ\. Calvin discusses the controversial issue of salvation and free will\. He emphasizes salvation through Christ alone, rejecting the notion that humans can contribute to their salvation through good works, an idea that diminishes the profound impact of original sin and the total depravity of humanity\. Acknowledging one's complete reliance on God fosters gratitude rather than arrogance\. Yet, while not dismissing the value of good works, Calvin frames them within the context of divine grace: \(1\) they can only be done through faith and do not give us assurance, \(2\) there is no supererogation \(only Christ expiated for sins once and completely\), and \(3\) recompense of works depend on God’s benignity, not our merit\. Calvin only recognizes two sacraments instituted by Christ – baptism and the Lord's supper – arguing against additional ones like chrism, salt, and spittle used in baptism, which distract from the spiritual essence and true purpose of these sacraments\.

__Chapter three, “The Holy Supper,”__ outlines theological criticisms and proposes reforms, focusing on aspects of the Holy Supper, Church governance, and broader ecclesiastical practices\. It underscores Calvin’s intent to return to a more authentic, biblical Christianity, against the error of the Roman Catholic Church\. With regard to the Holy Supper, Calvin emphasizes three things: \(1\) He articulates the view that the Eucharist is not a sacrificial act for the expiation of sins or on behalf of the dead, nor is it an event to be spectated; \(2\) He denies transubstantiation: the bread and wine are not transformed into the literal body and blood of Christ and, therefore, should not be objects of worship; \(3\) He stresses the importance of teaching the doctrine of the Eucharist in the vernacular, making it understandable to the general populace\. With regard to the government of the church, Calvin stipulates that Church leaders must prioritize teaching and ensuring their doctrines are aligned with scriptural and early Christian teachings\. Moreover, church leaders need to be subjected to a strict examination of life and doctrine\. Because this is often not done properly, impious people are often appointed, leading Calvin to question the validity of ceremonies and practices surrounding ordination, including the doctrine of apostolic succession\. Calvin proposes three more concrete changes: He challenges restrictions on consuming meat as unbiblical, noting early Church practices; Criticizes mandatory celibacy for priests as contrary to biblical teachings and natural law; and refutes the necessity and practice of confession for remission of sins, labeling it a late development and a potential cloak for hypocrisy\.

__Chapter four, “Christ, Our Redeemer, Was in a Great Measure Defrauded,”__ asserts that the Church has significantly defrauded Christ in two critical ways\. Firstly, by usurping Christ's unique priesthood, the Church has advocated the free will of men and their contribution to their salvation\. Secondly, Calvin critiques the Church's endorsement of "meritorious works," which, anchored not in scripture but in human tradition, detract from the true expression of faith through good works stemming from gratitude\. Calvin employs a vivid analogy, comparing believers' devotion to God with a dog's instinct to protect its master\. He suggests that the insult offered to God through the mishandling of His sacraments should elicit a fervent defense from the faithful, much as a loyal dog would not hesitate to defend its master from harm\. Further delving into the root of the Church's issues, Calvin identifies three primary concerns with its governance\. He argues that the acquisition of clerical offices is fraught with an absence of piety\. Moreover, he criticizes the bland spirit of church leaders, who appear more as symbolic figures than as genuine shepherds of the faith\. This, coupled with the Church's reliance on impious laws over sincere pastoral care – highlighted by an absence of teaching – paints a picture of a religious institution in dire need of reform\. Calvin responds to objections raised against his proposed reforms\. Against the accusation that they would foster licentiousness, he posits that a true understanding of the Gospel inherently discourages such behavior\. He acknowledges the sometimes questionable nature of the confiscation of Church properties but justifies it by pointing to the Church’s previous mismanagement of its resources\. Instead, he argues for a more righteous redistribution of wealth\. Lastly, Calvin disputes the erosion of Church discipline under his reforms, advocating for a return to vigilance among the clergy and proper conduct among the laity\. Calvin firmly asserts that the essence of the true Church lies in its allegiance to Christ as its head, grounded firmly in the teachings of the apostles and prophets, and accordingly questions the role of the Pope, suggesting it strays far from the true nature of a bishop, especially in his avoiding his preaching and ministering duties\.

__The final chapter__ emphasizes the urgent need for purifying the church of corruption\. Despite Martin Luther's plea to the Pope for reform, the church resisted changes, accusing reformers of disrupting unity by independently determining faith matters\. Highlighting a clear discord between the Roman church and the reformers, Calvin argues against the necessity of a General Council for discussions on reform\. Instead, he suggests bishops should directly deliberate on church issues without waiting for Papal approval, even involving "heretics" in conversations, a practice echoed in the past council of Chalcedon\. Critiquing the hierarchical structure of church councils controlled by the Pope, he appeals to secular rulers to proactively support reform, stressing it as a divine cause that should not be delayed for other worldly matters, indicating a sense of immediate and divine urgency for church reformation\.

*The Necessity of Reforming the Church* is structured as described in the prologue\. It points out the false teachings of the church, proposes reforms, and stresses the urgency of reform\. Strikingly, Calvin addressed this detailed critique of the Catholic Church to Catholic rulers, indicating that he left the possibility of internal reform open\. His work shows similarities with Bucer’s *De Regno Christi* \(discussing responsibility of civil government and the issue of confiscation of church property\) and Luther’s *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church* \(the failure of clergy to perform their teaching duties and the critique of the sacraments\), placing it firmly in the early Reformed tradition\.
