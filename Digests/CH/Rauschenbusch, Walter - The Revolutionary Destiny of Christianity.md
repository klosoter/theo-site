__24\. “The Revolutionary Destiny of Christianity” – Walter Rauschenbusch__

In *Chapter I: Wanted: A Faith for a Task,* Walter Rauschenbusch argues that a religious revolution requires faith, as did Paul’s and Luther’s\. This faith must be relevant to contemporary moral and social challenges\. He contends that traditional creeds fall short in addressing modern issues, highlighting a void in social thought within religious doctrines\. Rauschenbusch points out that while Jesus’s teachings and those of the Old Testament prophets carried social significance, the theology of the established Church lacks the necessary tools for engaging effectively with modern societal structures, particularly those shaped by capitalism\. He critiques the “old tools” that emphasize "love" and "stewardship," arguing that these concepts, though biblical, fail to fully translate into action within the complex and expansive relationships characteristic of modern societies\. "Love" must be reimagined in a socialized context, and "stewardship" must be replaced with “trusteeship” against notions of private ownership and “landed proprietors” because a steward *owns *and a trustee *manages*\. The Golden Rule, Rauschenbusch posits, is insufficient for navigating super\-personal relations in a society dominated by economic self\-interest\. Rauschenbusch notes the exodus of many from the Church to Socialism, driven by the Church's inability to provide answers to social emergencies\. He remains optimistic that Christianity contains within it the potential to meet these challenges, but doing so requires a significant reevaluation and adaptation of its teachings to be truly effective in the modern era\.

*Chapter II: The Social Christianity of Jesus* contrasts the focus of traditional Christianity on personal aspects like sin and forgiveness with Jesus's emphasis on the social dimensions of faith, particularly his purpose, the Reign of God, and the Kingdom of God, which Rauschenbusch identifies as central to Christianity\. He explores the challenge of understanding Jesus's faith due to centuries of theological distortion, suggesting that a clearer picture is seen through the faith of Jesus's direct followers and the social action demanded by Old Testament prophets\. The chapter traces the evolution of prophetic hope through various historical periods – pre\-exilic, exilic, and post\-exilic – highlighting shifts from organic growth to catastrophic intervention and the emergence of apocalypticism, which emphasizes salvation through cataclysmic events\. Rauschenbusch argues that the Church must embrace organic development and outlines how Jesus reinterpreted the Kingdom of God, advocating for non\-violence, a brotherhood of nations over nationalism, democratic spirit, prophetic rather than ceremonial law, and social and economic equality\. Jesus's conception of the Kingdom of God rejected both the notion of violent revolt and a purely spiritual kingdom without concern for the social and political realities of the world\. Rauschenbusch emphasizes Jesus's view of the Kingdom as both present and future, inherently involving social transformation and economic justice, challenging the division between the spiritual and the material, and advocating for a comprehensive vision of redemption that includes societal change\.

*Chapter III: The Eclipse of the Social Ideal*, explores the consequences of Christianity's adaptation to new cultural contexts\. Initially, Christianity was deeply rooted in a strong social consciousness aligned with democratic principles\. However, as it assimilated into the Roman and Greek cultures, its social ideals became obscured\. The adaptation led by theology to fit into these new cultural contexts resulted in the allegorization and spiritualization of Old Testament prophecies, moving away from tangible societal aspirations to more abstract spiritual goals\. According to Rauschenbusch, this shift in focus had profound implications for Christianity's social mission, marking a significant departure from its early teachings and ideals\. The decline of millennial hopes and the shift towards an other\-worldly focus marked a significant transition\. Asceticism, influenced more by Greek thought than Jewish tradition, began to dominate Christian theology, emphasizing an ethereal longing for heaven and a distrust of bodily desires\. This shift was evident across various Protestant traditions, including Puritanism and movements like the Mennonites and Methodists, where the anticipation of eternal rest in heaven overshadowed the early Christian hope for the establishment of God's reign on Earth\. 

*Chapter IV: The Rebirth of Social Hope* traces the resurgence of social ideals within Christianity, highlighting movements like the Franciscans, Anabaptists, Lollards, and Waldenses as precursors to Christian democracy\. These groups, characterized by lay religion and working\-class ethics, protested the affluent Church's social injustices through voluntary poverty\. The Protestant Reformation, while primarily focused on doctrinal issues, inadvertently contributed to democratizing religion by shifting power to the laity despite the reformers themselves not championing democratic ideals\. This period marked the inception of modern democracy and human rights, influencing new interpretations of the Kingdom of God through ethical commonwealth concepts and historical biblical studies that emphasized Jesus's original vision of the Kingdom\. Advancements in evolutionary theory encouraged the belief in the organic, non\-catastrophic development of the Kingdom, aligning with modern democratic and emancipatory ideals\. Rauschenbusch clarifies that while God is the King in the Kingdom of God, it nevertheless entails the emancipation and democracy of the people\. Rauschenbusch describes recent social enthusiasm illustrated by a New York tax campaign in 1886, whose motto was “Thy kingdom come\! Thy will be done on earth\!” He underscores the centrality of the Kingdom of God in Christ's teachings and its applicability to broad religious, social, and political endeavors\. This reflects a holistic approach to Christianity that encompasses saving the lost, caring for the poor, intellectual stimulation, political reform, and international peace, all aimed at the Reign of God on earth\.

*Chapter V: A Religion for Social Redemption* posits Jesus's religion as essentially a social faith with the Kingdom of God at its heart, urging the Christianization of the social order\. Rauschenbusch outlines four key points\. *Christianity’s earthly concerns*\. Contrary to Old Theology, which often looked beyond this world, Jesus’s religion fully embraces earthly life without rejecting the hereafter\. He presents Christianity as deeply invested in the realities and redemption of the present world\. *Practical redemption over ceremonies*\. The Kingdom of God’s real task is redemption, focused on ensuring that natural relations are ruled by God’s will, characterized by justice and love within an organized fellowship\. It criticizes wasteful practices, from environmental damage to the misuse of religious energy on superficial acts \(“dress performances”\), arguing that such power could have significantly advanced human society towards righteousness if properly directed\. *Sacredness of Everyday Work*\. Jesus’s teachings ascribe religious significance to ordinary professions, emphasizing the importance of both spiritual and physical well\-being in God’s plan\. It challenges the notion that religious value is exclusive to directly spiritual occupations, extending sanctity to all forms of honest labor that contribute to societal welfare\. *Public Christian Ethic*\. Rauschenbusch advocates for a public Christian ethic, urging a reevaluation of sins based on their social impact rather than forcedly preserving the doctrinal status quo\. It pushes for an ethic that actively seeks to transform society according to a future social ideal rooted in the principles of the Kingdom of God\.

*Chapter VI: Social Christianity and Personal Religion* delves into the dynamic relationship between social Christianity and personal religion, questioning whether personal faith can foster a social spirit and vice versa and examining potential conflicts between pursuing social righteousness and maintaining communion with God\. Rauschenbusch posits that spiritual regeneration is crucial and warns against letting devotion to social work undermine one's personal spiritual life\. However, it challenges the conservative Christian fear that engaging deeply in God's work could lead to losing touch with God, suggesting that such fears only arise if the religious foundation is weak to begin with\. Rauschenbusch acknowledges that the transition towards a social Christianity might temporarily disrupt traditional religious practices but predicts an eventual equilibrium between old beliefs and new social imperatives\. He notes the ironic stance of socialism towards religion, highlighting its often hostile or antireligious nature despite aiming for communal good, paralleling the church's mission in saving souls through social engagement\. He further criticizes evangelical emphasis on sin and conversion for failing to recognize social evils as manifestations of sin, advocating for a conception of full salvation that encompasses both individual and social transformation and redemption\. Social Christianity, Rauschenbusch argues, not only reconciles religion with science because it requires little dogma and speculative theology\. He also repositions religion as a champion for the masses by advocating for collective, solidary freedom over individual liberty\.

*The Revolutionary Destiny of Christianity* represents a pivotal contribution to the dialogue between Christianity and social reform movements\. By arguing that the teachings of Jesus Christ inherently call for social and economic equality and justice, Rauschenbusch bridges the gap between personal faith and societal responsibility\. He utilizes a historical\-critical method, analyzing the evolution of Christian thought – prophets, Jesus, his direct followers – and its relationship with society throughout history, emphasizing the Kingdom of God as a present and future reality that involves social transformation, corresponding to the Social Gospel movement\.
