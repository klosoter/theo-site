# __25\. Liberation of Theology – Luis Segundo__

*Chapter 3: The Political Option\.* Section I delves into the inherent political nature of theology and the Church’s understanding of its social context, initiated by Rahner’s inquiry into the Church’s ability to comprehend the context of its actions when such knowledge cannot only be derived from revelation\. This question illuminates two potential pitfalls: the risk of theologians stating what is better addressed by sociology or making claims that sociology can refute\. Theology is inherently political and cannot remain indifferent or neutral to political matters without inadvertently supporting the status quo\. Liberation Theology is acutely aware of this relationship, incorporating ideological analysis as part of its methodology and addressing political issues without feigning impartiality common in academic theology\. Section II revises the traditional view that theology guides action, suggesting instead that actions and their contexts shape theological reflection, making it the second step\. Luis Segundo proposes that understanding real life and its challenges is foundational to theology, which contrasts with Karl Rahner’s assumption of theology as the starting point for action\. Segundo illustrates this with biblical examples of Jesus’ interactions with the Pharisees, where Jesus prioritizes practical human concerns over abstract theological laws\. Through these examples, Segundo asserts theology emerges from engaging with the realities of life, emphasizing the necessity of responding to the historical and human contexts before formulating theological principles\. Section III\. He emphasizes that a genuine theological understanding begins with a personal commitment to addressing the urgent needs of the oppressed, suggesting that theology without such commitment served as a barrier to truly knowing Jesus in biblical times\. This premise unfolds across three stages\. *Identifying the Christian’s Role in Liberation*\. Referencing Gutierrez and the Medellin conference, Segundo argues that authentic engagement with the Gospel requires active solidarity with the oppressed to discern God’s plan in contemporary struggles\. *Understanding through Commitment*\. He contends that the Christian contribution to liberation becomes clear only after they have committed to the cause, challenging traditional ecclesiastical practices and calling for a re\-evaluation of Jesus’ message within its historical context\. *Opting for the Oppressed*\. The process of universal inclusion emerges from a deliberate choice to side with the oppressed and challenges the prioritization of ideological or religious certainties over the practical pursuit of justice and liberation for all\. making true theology stem from a lived commitment to liberation, reshaping one’s understanding of the Gospel in light of real\-world participation in the struggle for justice\.

*Chapter 4: Ideologies and Faith\.* In this chapter, Segundo discusses the complex relationship between ideologies and faith\. Section I explores the necessity of self\-awareness for understanding God’s Word, suggesting existential authenticity is key\. It highlights Assmann’s view that engagement in revolutionary activities is a prerequisite for interpreting the Gospel, urging Christians to reassess the Gospel within the context of social struggle\. Mannheim differentiates between ideological and utopian approaches in Christianity, favoring utopias for their transformative potential despite their clash with reality, while ideologies often fail in practice\. Segundo questions whether ideologies like Marxism and Maoism, which may precede personal commitment, truly align with or distort the essence of faith\. Section II explores the overlap between faith and ideologies, framing them as systems of goals and actions chosen beyond empirical standards\. Assmann suggests that for Christians, faith operates similarly to ideology, informed by absolute standards rather than historical contexts\. The development of personal beliefs and ideologies is illustrated through the journey from childhood faith, influenced by parental beliefs, to adolescence, where individuals consciously adopt ideologies aligned with their faith\. The discussion highlights the critical choices made in adolescence regarding liberation, noting that many do not progress beyond this initial ideological commitment\. Mature Christian faith requires differentiating Christ’s message from its historical context, a process similarly necessary for ideologies to avoid absolutism\. Section III discusses the interplay between faith and ideologies, highlighting that while ideologies are built on subjective values, faith is anchored in absolute truths\. It underscores Jesus’s ability to connect us with universal truths \(OT\) through the lens of relative ideology \(NT\), suggesting faith transcends but also underpins ideological systems\. The text argues against the notion of completely separating faith from ideologies, emphasizing Christianity’s engagement with ideologies to remain relevant and impactful\. Segundo argues that Christianity’s eternal – objective and universal – values do not apply precisely to history, necessitating – subjective and relative – ideologies, which he supports by citing *Gaudium et Spes*\. Section IV examines Liberation Theology’s preference for the Old Testament and Exodus as symbols of God’s liberating actions, contrasting with the New Testament’s focus on interpersonal relations over political liberation\. It discusses the continuity and discontinuity between the God of the Old Testament and Jesus’s teachings in the New Testament, highlighting the complex relationship between faith, biblical interpretation, and ideology\. Liberation Theology attempts to navigate these complexities through two main approaches: prioritizing contextually relevant passages or constructing a contemporary Gospel \(“What would Jesus have said in this context?”\)\. Section V addresses whether the revelation continues beyond the last apostle, with classical theology typically denying such continuity\. However, Segundo references John 16:12\-14 to suggest the Holy Spirit continues to reveal aspects of Christ, possibly through ideologies\. He challenges the notion that faith can exist independently of ideologies, asserting that faith devoid of ideological context is dead\. Segundo posits that faith matures through engagement with ideologies, which are essential for understanding and participating in the liberation of humanity\. Faith is thus presented not as a static body of content but as a dynamic process that evolves through interactions with contemporary ideological movements\.

*Chapter 5: Ideologies – Church – Eschatology*\.  Section I reflects on the “anti\-ideological stance” in the Catholic Church\. It argues that the recent more diffuse sense of church membership and lower mass attendance in Latin America affirms the importance of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s affirmative stance on hoping for an ideological crisis as a means for faith to regain its importance\. Chile is discussed, where the relationship between the Gospel, politics, and socialism highlights the Church’s dilemma in choosing sides\. The Church justifies its refusal to pick a side by concerns of excluding others and diminishing unity, emphasizing the superiority of faith over ideology due to its focus on eternal matters\. However, Luis Segundo critiques this viewpoint as contradictory to Vatican II, arguing that the Church inadvertently supports the status quo by not picking a side\. The equating of socialism with atheism in Chile is noted, underscoring the complex interplay between ideology, faith, and the Church’s mission in contemporary society\. Section II discusses the “anti\-ideological stance” in Protestant Churches, as demonstrated by Peter Wagner’s six points of critique against Liberation Theology as leftists\. First, individual reconciliation with God is central to faith\. Second, the salvation of souls is prioritized over social or political causes\. Third, the work of Christ and the gospel message is inherently spiritual and church\-centered, and the Great Commission has no social mandate\. Fourth, membership and spiritual unity in the church outweigh socio\-economic or political affiliations\. Fifth, Liberation Theology overlooks temporal dualism – the real existence of evil – by seeking natural causes of evil\. Sixth, there is no universal promise or plan for social salvation, only for spiritual salvation\. Section III\. This section discusses differing eschatological views within Catholic and Protestant traditions and their interaction with ideologies\. The Catholic view highlights the role of human merits in achieving divine grace, suggesting that eternal values are more important than temporal actions\. Vatican II marks a shift, emphasizing that grace is available to all for their supernatural vocation, moving away from the dual\-plane theory of supernatural versus natural\. The Lutheran view focuses on the theology of two kingdoms, indicating a need for political support but cautioning against the compromise this may entail\. Luther asserts that only a divine act can usher in God’s kingdom, while human actions are insufficient to accelerate this process\. Section IV argues that Liberation Theology is ecumenical, transcending both legalism \(Catholicism\) and passivity \(Lutheranism\) that miss the point that freedom is not only *from* but also *to *something: the construction of the Kingdom: “Catholicism and Lutheranism need to be reconciled and supplemented with human creativity, work, and liberty for the present\.”

*Liberation of Theology* by Juan Luis Segundo offers a critical examination of Liberation Theology, exploring its interpretations, societal engagements, and theological implications\. Segundo navigates the complexities of LT, focusing on faith's role in social justice and the potential risks of ideological alignment\. His work stands out for advocating a balanced theology that prioritizes the Christian commitment to the oppressed while cautioning against losing the spiritual essence in political activism\. However, Segundo does not resolve the hermeneutical tension caused by his prioritizing commitment to the poor above theological reflection, as he put it in chapter 4: "Does it logically follow that the less we know beforehand about that divine word, the more authentic will be our commitment and hence our first reading of the word of God?"
