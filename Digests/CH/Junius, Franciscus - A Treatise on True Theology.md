__A Treatise on True Theology – Franciscus Junius __

Franciscus Junius was a significant figure in the Reformation, especially known for his debate with Arminius on predestination and his substantial contribution to Reformed theology through over 5000 pages of theological works, and was, according to Abraham Kuyper, a strong defender of Augustine's and Calvin's teachings\. Junius, who died in 1602 due to the Black Death, made notable contributions to Hebrew grammar, exegesis, dogmatics, ecclesiastical and natural law, and federal theology\. His efforts to avoid discord within the church caused by theological disputes, are evidenced by private correspondence with Arminius on predestination\. Junius lost his faith in adolescence and rediscovered it in Geneva, where he delved into the Bible and Calvin's Institutes, learned Hebrew, and eventually taught Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, even as he struggled with poor health\. As a minister in Antwerp, he faced persecution, narrowly escaping arrest due to his French identity amid religious tumult, including the *Beeldenstorm*\. Junius's life was marked by constant movement and danger, as he fled from place to place, with a price on his head, continuing to preach and teach\. His commitment to Reformed theology and scholarly work took him across Europe, from Paris to Heidelberg, and eventually to teaching roles in Otterberg, Neustadt, and the University of Leiden\. Junius's work includes an Old Testament translation in 1573, underscoring his lasting impact on Reformed theology and biblical scholarship\.

Junius introduces *A Treatise on True Theology* as follows: “A Handbook concerning True Theology: Its Origin, Nature, Forms, Parts, and Mode, by which All Christians Are Reminded of Their Own Worth, and Theologians of the Importance of Their Service to God\.” The treatise is addressed to the population and the University of Leiden and demonstrates thirty\-nine theses\. 

The first four theses discuss *whether* true theology exists \(*an sit?*\)\. 1\. Theology is defined as the discourse of God or reasoning about divine matters, drawing from Augustine's definition\. 2\. The existence of theology is confirmed both by the inherent truth that God exists and acts as the principle of all good and by its universal recognition across different cultures\. 3\. Although universally recognized, theology is divided into true theology and that which is considered false, the latter being subject to opinion\. 4\. False theology has two forms: a common form, based on incomplete natural principles and lacking in deeper reasoning, and a philosophical form, stemming from erroneous reasoning and leading to superstitious and speculative interpretations of the divine\. 

The fifth theses discusses what theology is \(*quid sit?*\)\. 5\. Theology is the intellection of first principles, knowledge of conclusions and ends, and beneficial skill striving toward God\. Therefore, theology is “wisdom \(*sapientia*\) concerning divine matters,” which are its object, method, and goal\. The remaining 6\. Theology is divided into two types: archetypal, the wisdom of God himself, and ectypal, the wisdom fashioned by God for others\. 7\. Archetypal theology is described as God's perfect and incomprehensible wisdom and summarizes theology proper: God is not composite; his essence is his existence, and therefore, he is his properties \(including wisdom\)\. Among other attributes, his uncreated wisdom is incommunicable\. Thesis eight to ten discuss ectypal theology\. 8\. Ectypal theology is divine wisdom given by God to His creation, with God as its efficient cause, his glory as its final cause, and divine matters as its material cause\. 9\. Ectypal theology is “the whole wisdom of divine matters, communicable with what has been created according to the capacity of the one communicating it\.” 10\. Typal theology is communicated to creation according to its varying capacities through three different means: union, vision, or revelation\. 11\. The theology of *union* is “the whole wisdom of divine matters communicated to Christ as God\-man, the Word made flesh, according to His humanity\.” Its material cause is divine matters limited by human form; its formal cause is the Spirit of God; its efficient cause is divine communication, and its final cause is the illumination of those created in God’s image\. 12\. The theology of *vision* refers to the wisdom of divine matters shared with angels \(*theologia angelorum*\) and the spirits of the saints \(*theologia beatorum*\) who have attained perfection in heaven\. 13\. he theology of revelation is wisdom concerning divine matter communicated here to the human race – our theology\. 

14\. Theology is communicated in two main ways: naturally, as an inherent part of human reason, and supernaturally, which goes beyond natural human understanding due to divine grace\. Theses fifteen to nineteen discuss natural theology\. 15\. Natural theology stems from human reason and understanding\. It is not wisdom; it only concerns principles of divine matters as they relate to themselves\. 16\. Natural theology is incomplete and imperfect, needing to be completed by supernatural revelation to reach its full potential\. 17\. Even Adam’s natural theology was already limited and required divine grace for its perfection\. 18\. After the fall of man, the principles of natural theology were corrupted and became even more imperfect, indicating a degradation of our natural ability to understand divine truths\. 19\.  Junius concludes that natural theology, on its own, cannot achieve perfection or a complete understanding of divine matters; it requires supernatural grace to be fulfilled\. 

Theses twenty to twenty\-two treat supernatural theology\. 20\. This thesis highlights the necessity of supernatural theology, which comes from divine inspiration and revelation through gracious communication\. 21\. Supernatural theology is defined as an understanding of divine matters rooted in principles illuminated by God’s superior archetypal knowledge, which transcends human reason and originates from divine grace rather than from human intellect alone\. 22\. Supernatural theology operates on two levels: one that is absolute, directly related to divine self\-revelation, and another that is relative, tailored to the capacity of human understanding to which this divine knowledge is communicated\. 

Theses twenty\-three to thirty\-three outline absolute theology and its causes 23\. Absolute theology is the wisdom on divine matters directly inspired by God and manifested through the sacred texts of the Old and New Testaments\. This form of theology serves the dual purposes of glorifying God and nurturing the spiritual well\-being of the elect\. 24\. The material cause of theology is centered on the divine, covering God’s nature, works, and law\. It contemplates these things through sacred theology, not as they are in themselves, which is science\. 25\. Divine truth is the formal cause of theology\. It examines how theological truths are either considered as a whole \(universals *in intellectu*\) or through the comparative study of its parts \(particulars *in re*\)\. 26\. This divine truth \(the formal cause\) is holy, just, and perfect\. This foundational truth of theology guides us “as perfectly as possible toward holiness in ourselves, justice toward everyone else, and perfection in all things\.” 27\. Theology is one, eternal, and immutable\. After all, that which is true is one; that which is just and holy cannot ever cease to be just and holy; and that which is perfect is completely and always immutable\. 28\. The efficient cause of theology is twofold: principal and instrumental\. 29\. Delineates the Holy Spirit acting in unity with God the Father and the Son as the principal efficient cause of theology\. God is the highest and most perfect creator of this wisdom and its sole author\. 30\. The instrumental cause is λόγος προφορικός, or the enunciative discourse of God has spiritual and corporeal aspects\. The former is without the instrumentality of the body directly to the spirit, and the latter is through the body through sensory experiences\. 31\. The final cause of theology is divided into a “distant or very exalted” one and a secondary one, following from and subordinate to the first\. 32\. The primary final cause of theology is the glory of God\. By appropriately understanding and applying theological wisdom, believers can showcase and affirm God’s glory to the world\. 33\. This thesis highlights the good of the elect, both in their present existence and in anticipation of eternal life, as the secondary final cause of theology\. The role of theological truth in guiding the elect toward righteousness and salvation is emphasized\. 

Theses thirty\-four to thirty\-eight consider relative theology, theology in the subject\. 34\. Theology, when considered relative to the individual \(subjective theology\), varies according to each person's understanding, making them theologians by their engagement with divine wisdom\. 35\. The method of this theology is not a one\-size\-fits\-all, as the subjects vary greatly within themselves and among themselves\. 36\. An individual's approach to theology is influenced by the dynamic balance between their innate nature and the grace they receive\. The measure of grace increases as one’s life develops through the power of the Holy Spirit\. 37\. Different degrees of grace and sanctification among men imply that there is a varying degree of wisdom among them as well\. 38\. Even prophets and apostles did not fully grasp the entirety of theological wisdom perfectly, which highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in progressively revealing divine truth\.

Junius’ *A Treatise on True Theology* from 1594 aims to integrate humanist scholarship with the Reformed tradition and clarify Reformed theology's confessional identity\. He presents theology as *sapientia * \(wisdom\), emphasizing its contemplative and practical aspects, and distinguishes between *archetypal* knowledge \(God's self\-knowledge\) and *ectypal* knowledge \(human knowledge of God\)\. Further distinctions are made between natural and supernatural, and absolute and subjective theology\. He extensively discusses the various categories of theology in terms of Aristotelian causality, thereby firmly connecting him to the scholastic tradition\.
