# Compendium Didacticae\-Elencticae Theologiae – Johannes Marckius 

Chapter 1 of Johannes Marckius’ “Compendium Didacticae Elencticae Theologiae” explores theology with its etymology and foundational reasons for its use, described in section I\. This section introduces theology, originating from the Greek words ‘θεος’ \(God\) and ‘λογος’ \(Word\), highlighting its suitability as a term for the study focused on God, revealed by God, aimed at glorifying God, and cultivating fellowship with Him\. This section underscores the discipline’s object\-focused naming convention, positioning God as its central subject\. The second section traces the term’s first use to pagan traditions, noting its absence in Scripture but recognizing its early Christian application, particularly referring to the Apostle John as “the theologian” due to the “due to the heavenly sublimity of the doctrine and the solid assertion of the true deity of Christ” explored in his works\. Section III points to scriptural terms like “the oracles of God” and “the Word of God,” emphasizing Christ’s role as both the subject and the object of divine revelation, using the concept of ‘the Word enhypostatized’ to show the indwelling Word of God in believers through the Holy Spirit\. The fourth section argues for ‘προφορικὸς’ \(uttered Word\) as an appropriate term that reflects theology’s essence based on its scriptural basis, historical ecclesiastical use, and aptness for capturing divine teaching\. Section V lists synonyms found in Scripture that convey the essence of theological teaching, echoing themes of divinity, sound doctrine, and godliness\. Section VI differentiates between true and false theology, identifying various four species of false theology: \(1\) pseudo\-Christian doctrines of the papists, Socinians, and heretics; \(2\) Islamic theology; \(3\) contemporary Jewish theology; and \(4\) pagan theology\. 

Section VII highlights that while true theology fundamentally is one, its manifestations are manifold\. The former is called archetypal theology, and the latter is called ectypal theology\. Archetypal theology is defined as God’s knowledge of Himself, especially as He chooses to reveal it to humanity\. Marckius defends this concept by scripturally affirming God’s self\-comprehension and the relevance of divine decrees, asserting the term’s appropriateness\. Section VIII delves into ectypal theology, which derives from archetypal theology and is categorized into three types: of union, of vision, and of the “race\-course” or *stadium*\. The theology of *union* is associated with Christ’s human nature, flowing from the personal union with the person of the ‘Λογος\.’ This is to be distinguished from the theology of the infinite wisdom of God \(the divine Word\) and the knowledge of other creatures\. Section IX describes the theology of *vision* ascribed to angels and the blessed saints who see the heavenly Father face\-to\-face\. This knowledge and joy are perfect and replace faith \(cf\. 2 Corinthians 5:7\)\. The theology of the stadium, or the theology of pilgrims, is described in section X and involves the theology of those on an earthly journey to acquire, augment, and keep divine knowledge\. This theology corresponds to revelation and is less perfect than the other two types\. Section XI aims to prove that theology does exist, reasoning from God’s communicative goodness \(cf\. Bonaventure's concept of necessary “self\-diffusion” of the Good\), providence, human conscience, fear, and universal sense of God\. Section XII distinguishes between natural and supernatural theology\. The former is characterized by implanted innate knowledge unaided by reason\. Section XIII discusses objective and acquired natural knowledge, which reasons from effects to the first cause and from perfections to, perfecting innate knowledge\. Section XV posits that “the idea of God” can only be attained through the *via causalitatis *and the *via eminentiae*, borrowing *triplex via* terminology from Pseudo\-Dionysius\. Section XVI argues that Adam’s knowledge was more perfect than ours and included knowledge of the Trinity\. The Socinian argument against natural theology is disputed in section XVII, arguing that true atheists do not exist, which implies that all men reason the existence of God\. Yet, natural theology is limited, say sections XVIII\-XXI, and can only lead to knowledge about God’s essence and ‘natural’ things, not to superior supernatural knowledge concerning faith, Trinity, Christ, and redemption\. Natural theology functions as a demonstration of God’s goodness, facilitating the elect to attain faith and rendering the reprobate inexcusable, but is insufficient and must be supplemented with revealed theology \(sections XXII\-XXIII\)\. Section XXIV distinguishes between ‘habitual’ theology \(intrapersonal\) and systematic theology\. This is similar to section XXV’s distinction of positive – denoting statements – and scholastic – collected and categorized statements – theology\. The consequence of using this definition, argues section XXVI, is that there is a fundamental difference between scholastic theology and the “theology of the scholastics\.” Section XXVII defines theology as \(1\) revealed by God, \(2\) delivered to man as sinner, and \(3\) for man’s salvation and God’s glory\. Theology is practical as it is aimed at worship and God’s glory but also intellectual in explaining scripture, further developing plain scriptural truths, and refuting errors \(sections XXVIII\-XXIX\)\. Section XXX discusses the limitations of human reasoning\. On the one hand, human reason is flawed, which is why Scripture must be supplemented by the illumination of the Spirit, but not completely invalid as even the unlearned can grasp “proximate logical truths\.” Section XXXI\-XXIII refutes the papal distinction between doctrinal conclusions derived from church authority and reasoned private faith, as both need to be deduced from Scripture, which is the only *principium* of theology\. Section XXXIV lists the various forms of revelation known from the prophets and apostles: physical appearance, voice, ecstatic vision, and internal illumination\. The final sections posit religion \(“knowledge and worship of God under a hope of reward”\) as the object of theology, fallen man as the subject, and the glory of God and the salvation of the elect as the goal\. 

Chapter 3 explores the object of theology – religion – and has a similar approach \(etymology, synonyms, homonyms, definition, and distinctions\)\. Section I dissects the term ‘religion’ through various Latin origins, such as *relinquendo* \(to leave behind\), suggesting a departure from worldly concerns for divine pursuit; *relegando* and *relegendo,* which imply a form of reconsideration or re\-reading, indicating a continuous revisitation and reflection upon divine matters; and *re\-eligendo* \(repeatedly choosing\), pointing to the recurring decision to choose God’s ways\. The term *religando* suggests a binding or reconnecting with the divine, portraying religion as a restoration of the bond between humanity and God\. Marckius does not disclose which definition he prefers\. Section II examines equivalent expressions from Scripture like “the way or path of God,” enriching our understanding of religion as a journey or guided course toward divine understanding and living within the will of God\. Section III extends the discussion to the complex nature of religion, including diligent observance, fear of God, external rites, and the dual aspects of religion as knowledge or worship, habit or doctrine, false or true, fallen or unfallen, and natural or supernatural\. This underscores the intricate relationship between internal conviction and external expression in religious practice\. Section IV offers A concise definition: “the correct method \(*recta ratio*\) of knowing and worshipping God for the salvation of man as a sinner, and the glory of God\.” This captures the dual purpose of religion\. Section V distinguishes religious actions into elicited \(coming from within\) or commanded \(dictated by divine directives\), with specific emphasis on the integration of internal love, external rites, and a mixed category that includes prayers and sermons\. According to section VI, the role of revelation and the commendation of knowledge in religion is essential, stressing the importance of divine revelation in the pursuit of true knowledge and faith\. Sections VII\-XI advocate for a systematic progression from simpler to more complex truths, mirroring the pedagogical methods of Christ and his apostles\. The burden of proof is returned to the Papists, emphasizing a return to scriptural proofs for doctrinal legitimacy\. A critical analysis in sections XII\-XIV distinguishes between false and true criteria in evaluating the necessity of religious articles for salvation\. False criteria include universal consent among Christians or specific determinations by the Church, while true criteria lean on explicit scriptural necessity and expressed urgency for salvation\. In the next three sections, Marckius contends that the number of fundamental articles should not be dogmatically fixed, advocating for flexibility and cautioning against reducing these to create a superficial unity with heretics\. The text further categorizes opposition to true religion into false religions, heresy \(distinguished from schism, which is only disputed unity\), and apostasy\. The final sections list general and specific marks of true religion, emphasizing a scriptural foundation, God\-centered worship, hope of reconciliation, divine glory, and the practice of godliness\. The chapter concludes with a nuanced discussion on the tolerance of heresies and syncretism, distinguishing acceptable personal beliefs from public ecclesiastical practice and the overarching role of the magistrate in maintaining doctrinal purity while navigating the complexities of heretical tolerance\.

Marckius’s work displays a careful linguistic, historical, and theological analysis of theology and religion using a scholastic framework\. The importance of Marckius’s work lies in its depth and specificity in treating theology and religion not just as academic or intellectual exercises but as lived experiences aimed at knowing and worshipping God, achieving salvation, and glorifying God by systematically outlining the basis, distinctions, and ends of true religion and theology\. Marckius stands firm in the Reformed tradition by his insistence on the authority of Scripture, the distinction between true and false theology, and his personalizing of religion and theology, closely tying it to worship\.
