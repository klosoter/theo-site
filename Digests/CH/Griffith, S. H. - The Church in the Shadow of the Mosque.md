__The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque – S\. H\. Griffith__

__Introduction\.__

__Arabic\-Speaking Christians\. __Arabic\-speaking Christians significantly influenced Islamic culture through writing and translation but have often been neglected in research\. While Jewish thinkers of the era are well\-documented, the contributions of Christians who spoke and wrote in Syriac and Arabic remain underexplored\. __Purpose of the Book\. __The aim of this book is to provide an overview of the cultural and intellectual achievements of these Christians, highlighting their theological stance in relation to Islam\. It covers the period from the time of the Prophet Muhammad up to the Crusades and even extends to the Mongol invasions in the mid\-thirteenth century\. __Understanding "Shadow\." __The term "shadow" is used to describe both a protective and an overshadowing presence, illustrating the dual influence of Islamic culture on these Christian communities\.

__I\. "People of the Gospel," "People of the Book": Christians and Christianity in the World of Islam\.__

__Jews and Christians in the Qur'an\. __The Qur'an acknowledges the Torah and the Gospel, directly addressing Christians although it never explicitly mentions "Christians," using terms like "people of the book" and "Nazarenes" instead\. The Christians referred to in the Qur'an include Nestorians, Jacobites, and Melkites\. While they spoke Arabic, their liturgies and confessions were likely in Greek, Armenian, Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopic, not Arabic\. The Qur'an critiques the divinity of Jesus and Christian misinterpretation of Scripture and missionary zeal, signaling a sense of estrangement and instructing followers to fight against or tax Christians\. __The Arab Occupation of the Levant\. __By 732, large regions outside Arabia were conquered, encompassing areas with significant Christian populations, especially in Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem\. While Muslims became the majority only centuries later, Christians were largely Arameans in Syria, speaking Aramaic and holding Western theological views, often in opposition to Roman imperial Orthodoxy\. Most Arameans, Copts, and Armenians did not accept Byzantine orthodoxy, except in major cities where they were known as Melkites\. This period highlighted the theological and cultural diversity among Christians\. __Christians under Muslim Rule\. __Under Muslim rule, Christians experienced a gradual diminishment of influence as Islam asserted its presence through programs displaying Islamic symbols and declarations, such as the Shahadah on coinage and anti\-Christian inscriptions on structures like the Dome of the Rock\. Initiatives by Umar ibn Abd al\-Aziz promoted equality among Muslims, making Islam socially and politically attractive\. Christians faced taxes known as adh\-dhimmah for "special protection," relegating them to second\-class status and leading to the gradual decline of bishoprics, churches, monasteries, and schools\. __Dhimmitude\. __The term "dhimmitude" describes the status of Jews and Christians as second\-rate citizens under Islamic rule\. While it brought hardships and demographic decline, it also provided cultural opportunities for Christians to articulate and defend their faith in Arabic\. Before the Crusades and the Mongol invasions, Christians held significant civic positions and some even taught renowned Muslim philosophers like Al\-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes\. The translation of works from Arabic into Latin, especially Aristotle's, later influenced thinkers like Aquinas\. __The Sectarian Milieu\. __During the early Islamic period, a "sectarian milieu" with Islamicizing, Judaizing, and Christianizing discourse prevailed\. Islam's interpretation of Christian traditions and thinkers involved grappling with similar conceptual issues\. Despite being under Islamic rule, Christians and Jews remained the demographic majority, leading to Christian and Jewish apologetics that adopted Arabic as both a *lingua franca* and an ecclesiastical language\. Christian writers in Arabic addressed two main audiences: 1\) Muslims and Jews, to persuade them of Christianity's reasonableness, and 2\) their fellow Christians, to defend the true religion\. __Christian Responses to Challenge\. __Christians traditionally translated their scriptures and traditions into the local languages of their new missions\. However, in the Islamic world, they faced the unique challenge of adapting to a new culture and language within their own homeland, leading to eventual resentment against the Arabic undertones in their traditional language; some communities never fully transitioned to Arabic\. While some doctrinal development occurred, much of it hasn't survived, making it an area of interest for scholars aiming to understand early Islamic development through non\-Islamic sources\. Such studies offer insights into engaging with Islam, a religion of growing importance in the 21st century\. 

__II\. Apocalypse and the Arabs: The First Christian Responses to the Challenge of Islam\.__

__First Notices\. __Christian writings from regions bordering the Roman and Persian empires described the rapid succession of Arab conquests in major cities like Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Seleucia between 635 and 645\. These authors recognized the religious motivations behind the invasions, referring to the leader of the Saracens as a "false prophet" because true prophets did not wield swords\. Criticism extended to the Muslim establishment of prayer on the Temple Mount\. Patriarch Sophronius viewed the Saracens as a divine punishment for Christian sins and labeled them blasphemers\. John Moschus similarly saw the mosque on the Temple Mount as a sanctioned consequence of Christian negligence\. However, some Christians appreciated the Islamic rule, as it often alleviated Byzantine tax burdens or religious persecution, with Muslims showing some respect for the Christian faith\. __First Responses\. __By the end of the 7th century, when the conquering Arab tribes settled rather than returned to the desert, Christians began to engage more deeply with their religious ideas\. This engagement often involved highlighting contrasts and correcting misunderstandings, such as the notion of Christians worshiping "Two Gods" or believing that God had physically begotten a son\. Despite not all Christians having adopted Arabic as their liturgical language, they were aware of the Qur'an’s teachings on Christ, Mary, and God\. __Apocalypse Now\. __In response to Islam's proclaimed dominance, symbolized by structures like the Dome of the Rock with inscriptions suggesting it had replaced Christianity, Christians turned to apologetics, often employing the apocalyptic genre\. These writings framed Arab conquests as divine punishment signaling the end times, as seen in works like the "Apocalypse of Pseudo\-Methodius\." Jerusalem featured prominently in these narratives, which often depicted a great apostasy preluding the final days of world history\. __First Apologies\. __The earliest Christian apologies were crafted as dialogues between a knowledgeable Muslim and a Christian\. These texts argued that military, social, and political power were the only barriers preventing Muslims from converting to Christianity\. They acknowledged Muhammad’s role in saving Arabs from demon worship\. The narratives were written with enough detail to seem historically plausible but lacked specifics to pin down factual accuracy\. Some apologies borrowed Islamic concepts to describe Christian doctrines, exemplified by the Christian Bahira Legend, which depicted a monk catechizing Muhammad\. While fictional, it served socioreligious purposes by addressing misunderstandings\. __The Sectarian Milieu\. __In the classical intellectual culture of early Abbasid times, figures like John of Damascus emerged\. His work, *Fount of Knowledge*, akin to a *summa theologiae*, was written in Arabic and divided into three parts: 1\) definitions of philosophical terms, 2\) a catalog of principal Christian heresies, and 3\) a systematic presentation of Christian dogma according to six councils\. This work profoundly influenced later Christian theology in Arabic\. John framed Islam as related to Hagar and the Antichrist, labeling it a Christian heresy\. His writings, aimed at Melkites, explored key topics such as Scriptures, Christ, Baptism, Eucharist, veneration of the Cross, Sacraments, the Trinity, and the Son of God\.
