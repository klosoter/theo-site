__The *Christian* Middle Ages as an Historiographical Problem – John van Engen__

__The Legend of the Ages of Faith\. __The Middle Ages have traditionally been characterized as an era of unwavering faith, often dubbed the Ages of Faith or The Age of Belief\. This perception was challenged by scholars like Delumeau in 1971, who argued that medieval Europeans were only superficially Christianized until the Reformation period\. The question arises whether there existed a dichotomy between an educated clerical elite and a populace steeped in Indo\-European folklore\. __Religious Movements and Popular Piety\. __Herbert Grundmann's research on Religious Movements in the Middle Ages highlighted the significance of non\-official movements and cautioned against dismissing them as mere heretical or social protests\. Meanwhile, Etienne Delaruelle focused on medieval religious expression manifesting in the piety of common people through practices like crusades, pilgrimages, and widespread cults\. Jean Leclerq concentrated on monastic theology, while Gabriel Le Bras, founding religious sociology, illustrated the array of overlapping and competing interests within medieval religious groups, including tensions between cardinals and popes, chapters and bishops, religious orders and seculars, and parishioners and vicars\. __Pagans and Christians: A Spiritual Blend\. __Powicke argued that paganism was pervasive in medieval Europe, integrating with Christian elements in a blend of spiritual and natural man expressions\. This synthesis highlighted a division between the clerical hierarchy and a "virtually uncontrollable religious movement" rooted in lay society's religious conscience, contrasting the structured institutional Church with truly religious expressions\. Some scholars interpreted the veneration of saints and relics as remnants of pagan traditions\. __Clerical vs\. Popular Practices\. __Le Goff and Schmitt raised an important distinction between the clerical, bookish tradition and the popular, oral, and customary practices, encouraging historians to appreciate folk practices on their own terms rather than viewing them as mere degraded forms of Christianity\. This approach extends beyond the narratives recorded and propagated by the clerical elite, with evidence primarily derived from exempla and inquisitorial records reflecting clerical instruction and suppression\. __Evidence of Christian Penetration\. __The examination of strange happenings in remote villages suggested Christianity's deep penetration into rural areas\. However, the available material was sparse, and reconstructing a separate religious culture often required historians to infer from selected narratives, which bore striking similarities to Indo\-European folklore\. This approach risks becoming dogmatic and ahistorical by suggesting a static, unchanged religious culture from prehistoric to late medieval times\. Historians must bear the burden of proof to argue for two radically different religious cultures\. __Localized and Sociological Interpretations\. __Historical studies have exhibited trends toward localized analysis and sociological interpretations, shifting focus to "popular religion" rather than institutionalized elite religion\. This has enhanced our understanding of the interaction between religious teachings and institutions and the lives of ordinary people\. There has been a more sympathetic examination of medieval religious life by Jews and Protestants and a more critical perspective by Catholics, highlighting reform as an ongoing process rather than a singular doctrinal development\. The Medieval Church was not solely papal but had a conciliar dimension, with intellectual achievements primarily rooted in biblical studies, pluralism, and jurisprudence rather than philosophy alone\. __Balancing Perspectives on Medieval Christianity\. __Ultimately, historians aim to represent medieval religious life truthfully without succumbing to the extremes of viewing it as a mythical golden age of Catholic Christianity or an equally mythical era of Indo\-European folk religion\. Christianization was an evolving process with periods of significant change and regression\. Evaluations of failure often stem from records documenting incompetent clerics, ignorant peasants, and superstitious practices, yet these records also reveal efforts at reform\. __Six Observations on Christian Culture:__

1. Examination of "Christendom" involves studying both the faith and practice of Christians\.
2. Christianization involves structuring Christendom through Christian profession, practices, and rituals\.
3. The study of religious culture must take religion seriously, avoiding functionalist or reductionist approaches\.
4. From the 11th century onward, faith became more personal and internal\.
5. Christendom was chiefly learned through practice, and although religious tenets were expounded in books, they were also conveyed through art and oral culture, addressing the mostly illiterate laypeople and some lower clergy\.
6. The resultant culture was a synthesis between the old and new, where non\-Christian attitudes often influenced Christian practices, such as the magical view of the Eucharist and the use of Germanic names for the days of the week\. University\-trained intellectuals took Christian practices as a point of departure for philosophical and theological exploration\.
