__De Regno Christi – Martin Bucer__

Martin Bucer’s *De Regno Christi*, written in 1550 for young King Edward VI of England, summarizes his vision for applying Christian principles to every aspect of life, not just within the Church\. It proposes Christ\-centered governance, which he termed “Christocracy,” detailing fourteen specific laws aimed at reforming both church and societal structures grounded in the Word of God and guiding rulers\. Though his direct influence faded after his death in 1551 and Edward’s in 1553 and the subsequent accession of Mary I, who viewed Bucer as a heretic, his ideas arguably influenced certain educational reforms under Edward VI\. This precis will mainly focus on Bucer’s fourteen laws but will also address the remaining portion of the work\. 

In __Book I__ of *De Regno Christi*, Martin Bucer presents a focused theological discourse alongside practical guidelines intended to establish Christ’s Kingdom on Earth\. The book was expressly written for the guidance of King Edward of England\. The book opens with a preface in which Bucer commends King Edward, portraying him as divinely chosen to accept and champion the establishment of Christ’s Kingdom\.

The initial chapters extensively define the Kingdom of Christ, setting it apart from earthly kingdoms\. Bucer describes it as inherently spiritual and eternal, where Christ rules directly, supported by ministers who function effectively despite the adversity posed by a hostile world\. He explores both similarities and differences between Christ’s spiritual kingdom and secular governments\. Similarities include the hierarchical structure featuring a supreme ruler and the responsibility for the moral guidance of the populace\. They share challenges in managing the coexistence of good and evil within society, and both seek to gather people under a unified cause\. However, Christ’s Kingdom is distinguished by Christ’s omnipresence, negating the need for earthly representations, and by its eternal nature, transcending the temporal limits of earthly rule\. Bucer uses prophetic texts, particularly from the book of Isaiah, to illustrate the divine attributes and expectations of Christ’s Kingdom\. These passages underscore themes such as divine justice, peace, and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit\. The scriptures paint a picture of a renewed society where the gospel facilitates righteousness and mercy\. In a historical context, Bucer reviews the Church’s evolution from the era of Constantine and Theodosius through the corruptions introduced by what he labels as the Roman Antichrist – referring to the medieval Roman Catholic Church\. He criticizes this era for its restrictive practices towards scripture and doctrinal errors, contrasting these with the revival seen in contemporary reformation efforts in, among other places, Germany and Hungary\. Bucer praises these movements as closer to fulfilling the biblical prophecies and embodying the true spirit of the gospel\. Overall, “De Regno Christi” Book I functions as a deeply instructive manual aimed at rulers and clergy\. Bucer envisions them guiding the societal and spiritual reform necessary to align more closely with what he perceives as the divine governance prescribed by Christ\. This reformation, while rooted in theoretical theological insight, is intended to have practical impacts on the structure and operation of society\.

The opening chapters of __Book II__ provide a detailed blueprint for the reformation of Christ’s Kingdom, concentrating on the roles of leaders and the need for preaching the Gospel\. He argues that effective reform is most plausible under devout kings, drawing on historical biblical rulers and emphasizing the selection of advisors who are deeply committed to Christ’s teachings without personal gain\. Bucer asserts that true reform extends beyond mere edicts; it requires devout persuasion and clear, convincing preaching of the gospel to instill genuine faith and adherence to Christian principles\. He stresses the importance of training evangelists in institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, focusing on theology to nurture knowledgeable and dedicated preachers\. Moreover, he suggests that these efforts should be supported by royal stipends and the advocacy for holy laws and proper religious education to ensure a sustainable reform of and return to a true Christian life\.

In the remaining part of the book, Bucer discusses fourteen laws\. The first six apply to the church, the seventh – which is discussed in tremendous detail – to both church and state, and the final seven chapters to the state\. The first law asserts the necessity of religious education for children, emphasizing the importance of catechism in nurturing faith from a young age\. Bucer specifies the sanctification of holy days in the second law, urging that these days be kept free from secular entertainments such as races, animal shows, spectacles, and all forms of obscene pleasures\. He also restricts social gatherings like feasts and weddings on these days to safeguard their sacredness\. Under the third law, churches are to be used solely for activities sanctioned by the Lord, ensuring that these spaces remain sacred and are not used for any non\-religious activities\. The fourth law focuses on rectifying the clergy’s perversity by restoring proper ecclesiastical practices and structures\. It includes annual church visitations by bishops, eliminating mandatory celibacy, and allowing the king to appoint bishops and summon and preside over councils\. The fifth law addresses the management of church properties and finances, advocating against taxes for the Roman Catholic church and the misuse of church funds\. It urges kings to ensure that ecclesiastical estates contribute to the church and public welfare without engaging in simony\. It also calls for the transparent and responsible management of church funds and properties, especially those acquired through questionable means\. The sixth law outlines a structured approach to poor relief, starting with a thorough investigation of who genuinely needs help and prioritizing support through relatives\. It calls for systematic record\-keeping of income and poor relief, discourages private almsgiving in favor of organized support, and advocates for penalties for those who fail to contribute their fair share to this cause\. 

In the large section \(comprising no less than thirty\-one chapters\) on the seventh law, Bucer outlines a comprehensive framework regarding the sanctification and regulation of marriage, advocating for marriage as a political and religious union requiring state jurisdiction, contrary to practices under the “Roman Antichrist empire\.” Chapters XVI to XVIII explore the contracting and regulations of marriage, and Bucer prescribes that marriages must not involve close relatives except cousins, nor should they bridge significant class differences\. These unions must only occur with consent from relevant authorities \(typically parents\) who oversee the suitability of the match\. Without this consent, marriages remain invalid\. Witnesses must be present to ensure the process is neither secretive nor hasty\. Chapters XIX to XXI argue that the validation of a marriage promise can be annulled before its fulfillment\. Bucer emphasizes that the wedding ceremonies need to be carried out with utmost dedication by devout ministers, maintaining the religious sanctity of marriage\. He supports legal divorce under conditions of failure to fulfill marital duties, prolonged unjust absence, or immoral behavior by the spouse\. Extensive discussions on divorce span chapters XXII to XLV, where Bucer argues that grounds for divorce extend beyond adultery, including impotence, severe disease, and perpetual abandonment\. He references both scriptural and civil laws, advocating that divorced individuals should be allowed to remarry\. Bucer criticizes any strict limitation on divorce that would extend beyond the intent of Christ’s teachings\. In the remaining two chapters on marriage, Bucer commends celibacy by referring to 1 Corinthians 7 but argues that imposing celibacy contradicts God’s intentions for individuals destined for marriage\. 

In the eighth law, Bucer emphasizes the need for education tailored to each child’s potential roles and capabilities, promoting active engagement in meaningful work to combat idleness\. He advocates for education and career training in essential societal functions like agriculture and craftsmanship, and manual labor is recommended for those lacking specific skills\. The ninth law targets the regulation of luxurious lifestyles and harmful expenses, advocating the adorning of the hidden person of the heart over the delight of the flesh and enforcing modesty and frugality\. The tenth law calls for a comprehensive renovation of civil laws to eliminate obscurities and promote understanding and adherence\. The laws should be simplified and possibly memorized to promote societal well\-being and justice\. The eleventh law provides strict guidelines for appointing virtuous, non\-corrupt magistrates, with a structured hierarchical oversight that ranges from local to national levels, ensuring that these laws are upheld with integrity and justice\. In the twelfth law, Bucer proposes judicial reforms to ensure fairness, impartiality, accessibility, and availability of justice and judges\. The thirteenth law specifies fair treatment of the accused, ensuring they are not held excessively or mistreated, particularly if their innocence could yet be proven\. In the fourteenth law, Bucer advocates for stringent penalties for severe moral offenses, including capital punishment for crimes such as blasphemy, violation of the Sabbath, disobedience to parents, murder, and adultery, adhering to a strict code of moral conduct in an effort\.

__Martin Bucer’s “De Regno Christi”__ is an important theological and political treatise that advocates for the application of Christian principles to ecclesiastical and societal structures\. Its contribution lies in its detailed exposition on how to reform society through Christ\-centered governance \(“Christocracy”\), covering aspects from education and public morality to legal and judicial frameworks\. This work contributes to Reformation thought, especially in promoting the idea that civil governance should serve both spiritual and temporal welfare according to Christian doctrines\.
