__Early Christian Doctrines \- J\. N\. D\. Kelly\.__

__Gnostics and Valentinus\. __Valentinus and others characterized Gnostic beliefs with three main features: dualism, attempts to explain the origin of matter \(considered evil\), and the notion that the spiritual element in humans yearns to be liberated from matter\.

__II\. Tradition and Scripture\. __The Old Testament is seen as 'Christian,' and apostolic witness is anchored in those who had direct contact with the apostles\. The formation of the canon was a response to challenges from figures like Marcion, emphasizing that both the New and Old Testaments are inspired by the same Spirit\. 

__IV\. The Divine Triad\.__

__Apostolic Fathers\. __Generally maintained that Christ was pre\-existent, with a significant role in creation and redemption\. __Apologists and Logos\. __They understood God the Father as the author of all existence, while the Logos \(the Son\) was dated to an "emission or putting forth" for creation purposes\. Though they lacked precise vocabulary for eternal distinctions, they considered the Logos eternal, ensuring monotheism\. __Apologists and the Trinity\. __Presented ideas that were sometimes incoherent regarding the Spirit of God\. They acknowledged that Word and Wisdom were eternally with God, yet distinct, ensuring God wasn't diminished upon their emission\. __Irenaeus\. __Irenaeus developed both internal and external \(economic\) views of the Trinity\. He recognized the Word as eternal and gave fuller acknowledgment to the Spirit\. The Word \(Logos\) was divine and rational, while the Spirit \(Wisdom\) was divine, though not explicitly termed so\. Both collaborated in creation, reflecting an economic Trinity as well as the three\-in\-oneness of the Godhead\.

__V\. Third\-Century Trinitarianism\.__

Third\-century Trinitarian thought focused on the external or economic Trinity\. Key figures like Hippolytus and Tertullian emphasized God as eternally transcendent yet immanent in a threefold manner\. They described God as alone but accompanied by Word and Wisdom\. Tertullian introduced the term "trinitas," describing God’s manifestations as distinct yet not separate, using "unum" rather than "unus\." He advanced Irenaeus’s ideas, illustrating one substance in three manifestations, with "personae" indicating individuals, not self\-conscious entities\. __Dynamic Monarchism and Adoptianism\. __This view posited that Christ was a mere man temporarily adopted by God\. Theodotus taught that Christ became divine only post\-baptism\. __Modalistic Monarchism\. __This perspective blurred distinctions by portraying God’s expressions as mere modes\. The Godhead was equated with the Father\. Figures like Noetus of Smyrna promoted Patripassianism, while Praxeas, refuted by Tertullian, and Sabellius described a monad with three operations, viewing the Son as having temporary, non\-simultaneous modes like warmth and light emanating from a single source\. __Roman Views\. __Leaders like Zephyrinus and Callistus showed sympathy for modalism but recognized its challenges\. __Eastern Thought: Clement and Origen\. __Clement, more a moralist than a systematic theologian, distinguished between the three in a Neo\-Platonic manner, suggesting subordination\. Origen, from a Middle Platonic background, spoke of eternal begetting, viewing the Son as secondary and the Spirit as originating from the Word\. He presented the three Persons as really distinct from eternity, not merely in economic terms\. Origen's concept of "logikoi" described spiritual beings co\-eternal with the Father\. __Paul of Samosata\. __Paul argued that Christ was an ordinary man inspired by divine Wisdom\.

__VI\. The Beginnings of Christology\.__

__One\-sided Solutions\. __Ebionism, a Jewish offshoot, denied Christ’s divinity\. Non\-Jewish monarchism, represented by figures like Theodotus, Artemas, and Paul of Samosata, viewed Christ as a human inspired by divine Wisdom\. Docetism and Gnostic beliefs introduced other complexities by distorting Christ’s nature\. __Spirit Christology\. __This perspective posited that the pre\-existent Son of God, conceived through the Spirit and Mary, was united with divine nature, resulting in Jesus\. __Apologists and Irenaeus\. __Early apologists and Irenaeus emphasized the dual natures of Christ rather than the unity of His person\. Irenaeus articulated that the eternal Word became truly God and truly man, with the Word as the divine manifestation\. __Western Contribution\. __Hippolytus asserted that the Logos became flesh, emphasizing the distinction between natures and Sonship initiated at incarnation\. Tertullian advanced the idea of two substances, viewing the Word as eternally pre\-existent and entering Mary\. He introduced the concept that would later be known as *communicatio idiomatum*, with the human possessing a rational soul—a view not universally followed, such as by Novatian\. __School of Alexandria\. __Clement’s teachings revealed a docetist tendency, suggesting the Logos entered flesh as a directive principle, maintaining *apatheia*\. Origen posited that the pre\-existent soul was united to the Logos, presenting the incarnation as an intersection of the infinite and finite\. He maintained a clear duality of nature, with the Logos substantially united to Christ’s human soul, predominating within Him\. Origen taught that Jesus shared the Word’s divinity, transitioning after exaltation from the human to complete identification with God/Logos\. __East after Origen\. __Figures like Malchion described Christ as a composite being of Flesh and Logos, akin to all humanity\. Pamphilus emphasized Christ’s possession of a human soul\. Eusebius controversially suggested the soul vanished during incarnation, with the Logos functioning as a soul\.

__VII\. Man and His Redemption\.__

__Sub\-Apostolic Age\. __In this period, there was a primary focus on what Christ imparted, such as knowledge, fresh life, and immortality\. Clement highlighted Christ's passion, death, and resurrection as a substitutionary sacrifice, bringing the grace of repentance to the world\. Barnabas added the aspect of remission of sins\. Generally, there was less focus on sin or atonement\. __Apologists\. __The__ __Apologists emphasized free will and viewed sin as an outcome of demons or the serpent\. Justin nearly approached the concept of original sin linked to the serpent\. Tatian and Theophilus spoke of the *capacity* for good leading to the fall into sin, yet none attributed Adam's sin to future generations\. The *purpose of incarnation* for Justin was didactic, breaking the devil's powers and purifying believers through suffering\. __Theory of Recapitulation\. __Irenaeus introduced the idea that Adam, spiritually and intellectually a child, disobeyed and created a mystical solidarity with his descendants\. This was recapitulated in Christ, sanctifying all aspects of humanity and perfecting the image\. Irenaeus leaned towards a physical theory of atonement\. __The West in the Third Century\. __Tertullian advocated for traducianism and free will, suggesting that human nature became inclined to sin and passed these inclinations to posterity\. Baptism was seen as a cleansing of sins, and a balance was struck between the merit of good works and the guilt of bad ones\. He also acknowledged Christ's sacrificial death\. __Doctrine of Man in the East\. __Eastern thought lacked a clear concept of original sin and its connection to Adam's sin, suggesting imitation or physical descent\. Origen characterized Genesis as a cosmic myth, proposing that pre\-existent souls experienced a *pre\-cosmic fall* due to free will, with varying degrees of sinfulness resulting in humans, devils, or angels\. __Eastern Views of the Works of Christ\. __Clement emphasized the defeat of the devil and the role of Christ as a teacher, bestowing knowledge, love, and righteousness, leading to the deification of humans and mysticism\. Origen portrayed Jesus as progressively becoming deified, vanquishing the devil, and serving as a ransom that the devil could not hold\. He proposed ideas of vicarious substitution and propitiatory sacrifice, emphasizing deification and exemplification\.

__VIII\. The Christian Community\.__

__Beginnings of Ecclesiology\. __Early ecclesiology highlighted the Church as universal, one, and spiritual, with some considering it pre\-existent\. __Early Views of the Sacraments\. __The term "mysterion" \(Greek\) was used for sacraments\. Baptism was foundational, leading to the Eucharist viewed as a sacrifice, possibly prophesied by Malachi\. Figures like Ignatius, Justin, and Irenaeus later emphasized a realist perspective\. Penance for post\-baptismal sins varied without consensus\. __Development in the Doctrine of the Church\. __Tertullian and Irenaeus described the Church as a body characterized by piety, discipline, and hope, serving as the home of the Spirit\. Rigorists believed authority belonged to those possessing the Spirit, not just clergy\. In Alexandria, thinkers like Clement saw the Church as visible and invisible, influenced by Platonic ideas, whereas Origen differentiated between the empirical and ideal Church, envisioning universalism across creation\. Cyprian emphasized the Church as a spiritual, legalistic, and practical entity, asserting its unity\. He likened bishops to apostles, with dioceses as microcosms of the Church, foreshadowing the primacy of Peter and Rome\. Membership required bishop submission, aligned with the idea of “*salus extra ecclesiam non est\.*” __Baptism in the Third Century\. __In the East, Clement emphasized baptism as regeneration, enlightenment, sonship, and remission of sins, while Origen highlighted its inward and spiritual significance\. In the West, Hippolytus focused on remission of sins and receiving the Spirit, and Tertullian deemed it necessary for salvation\. Cyprian viewed the Spirit as an active force in regeneration\. __Progress in Eucharistic Doctrine\. __Belief in the real presence prevailed\. In the West, interpretations were sometimes sacramental or symbolic, while Alexandrian thought embraced a Platonizing real presence\. Cyprian further developed the understanding of Eucharistic sacrifice as encompassing prayer, worship, and thanksgiving\. __Penitential Discipline\. __Penance was a public practice involving confession, a period of penance and exclusion, and concluded with formal absolution and restoration\.

__X\. The Doctrine of the Trinity\.__

__Return to the Homoousion\. __Key theologians like Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine of Hippo advanced Trinitarian thought\. The transition from *homoiousion* to *homoousion* was notably driven by Athanasius and Hilary of Poitiers\. Hilary noted that the *Homoiousions* recognized the Son as originating from the Father's *ousia*, not another *hypostasis*, aligning them closely with *homoousion*\. Athanasius clarified the concept of "three hypostases," emphasizing one *ousia* to prevent Sabellian misinterpretations, and focused on generic unity rather than numerical identity of substance\. __Homoousion of the Spirit: Athanasius\. __While Arius viewed the Spirit as having an essence utterly unlike the Son and Father, Athanasius asserted the Spirit's full divinity and consubstantiality with the Father and Son\. He emphasized that if the Spirit makes humanity divine, its nature must be divine\. Thus, one essence and one energy united the three distinct persons\. __Homoousion of the Spirit: The Cappadocians\. __The Cappadocians finalized Athanasius's work by fostering interest in the Holy Spirit\. They addressed two main groups: *Pneumatomachians* and those aligned with Athanasius\. Basil described the Spirit as inseparable from the Father and Son, avoiding the term "God\." Gregory of Nyssa spoke of one nature, three persons, while Gregory of Nazianzus declared the Spirit as God and consubstantial, coming from the Father through the Son\. __The Cappadocians and the Trinity\. __At Constantinople in 381, the consubstantiality of the Spirit with the Son was affirmed, beginning from three hypostases\. The Father was viewed as the source, though subordinationism was rejected\. *Nyssa* explained that the Son is begotten and the Spirit proceeds from the Father\. *Basil* described roles as paternity, sonship, and sanctification, while others tied these to generational missions\. *Nazianzus* admitted uncertainty regarding how procession differs from generation, emphasizing that the *ousia* of the Godhead is a concrete, not abstract reality\. __The Trinity in the West\. __Figures like Ambrose and Tertullian emphasized one God with one will but three persons\. Victorinus described *circuminsession* as mutual indwelling, where the Father, Son, and Spirit play distinct roles in unity\. __Contribution of Augustine\. __Augustine's understanding of the Trinity highlighted its *co\-essentially and numerical unity in substance*\. He avoided subordinationism, focusing on the Divine nature\. Each person shares identical substance and inseparable operations \(one will\), with eternal operations attributed collectively\. Persons are defined by relationships, and the Spirit as mutual love proceeds from both Father and Son\. Augustine used analogies—object, sight, intention; memory, understanding, will—to capture Trinitarian vestiges, though these have limitations and do not fully capture the essence of the Trinity's unified operation and three distinct persons\.

__XI\. Fourth\-Century Christology\.__

__Arians and Eustathius\. __Arians proposed that the Logos replaced the human soul, focusing on a God\-flesh theology\. Eustathius emphasized the deification of the human body and initially accepted the *communicatio idiomatum*, but later denied that the Word died on the cross or that God was led to slaughter\. His God\-man theology maintained a duality of natures, viewing God’s indwelling in humanity as continuous, unlike the transient inspiration of prophets\. __Christology of Athanasius\. __Athanasius taught that the Logos became man for redemption, serving as the governing principle\. He outlined two sets of actions for Christ: as God and as God\-made\-man, yet unified in one person\. While acknowledging a human soul, there's ambiguity, as at times the soul is equated with the Logos, suggesting a Word\-flesh scheme\. __Apollinarianism\. __Apollinarianism rejected the human mind, focusing deeply on unity\. It defined Christ as God incarnate, consubstantial, and of one nature, with a divine spirit replacing human psychology\. This view entailed several corollaries:

1. Christ's flesh is glorified\.
2. Christ's body is a proper object of worship\.
3. *Communicatio idiomatum* involves a real __exchange__ of attributes\.

__Orthodox Reaction\. __The Cappadocian fathers opposed Apollinarianism, raising several charges:

1. It was Docetic, divinizing Christ's flesh\.
2. It questioned why one individual cannot have two wills and why God would become sinful\.
3. It suggested Christ was not fully man\.
4. It failed to fulfill the essential conditions for redemption\.

This opposition strengthened Christology\. Gregory of Nazianzus emphasized two natures in one Son, asserting full communicatio idiomatum\. Gregory of Nyssa argued the Godhead controls manhood, with the flesh passive and Logos active in the incarnation, resulting in indistinguishable natures in Jesus, yet unified as one person\. __Antiochene Christology\. __Key figures in Antiochene Christology included Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who contributed to the evolving understanding of Christ’s dual natures\.

__XII\. The Christological Settlement\.__

__Nestorianism\. __Between 428 and 451, Nestorianism debated terms like *theotokos* and *anthroptokos*, preferring *christotokos*\. It opposed the idea that Mary bore God, which seemed Arian or Apollinarian\. Nestorius’s mature views, as expressed in the Book of Heracleides, maintained two unaltered natures but struggled to explain their substantial unity\. __Cyril of Alexandria\. __Cyril argued against the perceived illusion in Nestorian Christology\. He emphasized that Christ remained the same person pre\- and post\-incarnation, changing from *asarkos* to *sesarkomene* \(enfleshed\), uniting divine and human natures without confusion or change\. Though unclear on the exact nature unity, he celebrated full *communicatio idiomatum*, avoiding explicit duality implied by "two natures\." __Towards Unity from Ephesus\. __Debate between Cyril and Nestorius involved appeals to the Pope and Emperor\. Pope Celestine favored Theotokos, resulting in Cyril anathematizing Nestorius with 12 anathemas, affirming full unity of divine and human natures in Christ\. Despite rival councils, Ephesus 431 upheld the union of two natures, aligning with Cyril’s views\. __The Case of Eutyches\. __Dissatisfaction arose post\-Ephesus, especially concerning the two\-nature doctrine\. Eutyches advocated for one nature after union—with humanity absorbed, a view leading to controversy\. __The West and Leo\. __Western theologians like Hilary, Ambrose, and Augustine emphasized two natures in one person, with *communicatio idiomatum*\. Leo’s Tome detailed a union without mixture or confusion, coordinating separate operations in harmony\. __Chalcedonian Settlement\. __Under a new emperor favoring two natures, Chalcedon affirmed Nicene beliefs, canonized Cyril and Leo’s writings, and provided a formal confession: one Son, two perfect natures \(both divine and human\), __without confusion, change, division, or separation__, unified in one *prosopon*/*hypostasis*\.

__XIII\. Fallen Man and God's Grace\.__

__Soul's Origin\. __Origen suggested a pre\-existent soul, while the prevalent Greek theory of creationism found support in Pelagius\. Augustine, albeit with hesitation, and Tertullian leaned toward *traducianism*\. __Athanasius and the Fall\. __Athanasius viewed finite beings in the image of God as deprived of this divine image, yet still possessing free will and the ability not to sin \(posse non peccare\)\. __Greek Fathers\. __Some Greek Fathers entertained the idea of double creation\. They saw the Fall as a misuse of free will without necessary transmission of original sin, though in Adam our obedience was tested\. The Fall impacted our moral nature with some language hinting at sin transmission\. There were synergistic tendencies in their thinking\. __West before Augustine\. __Figures like Ambrose and Ambrosiaster depicted a primitive state of supernatural blessedness\. Sin was equated with idolatry, and solidarity with Adam led to the infection of guilt, corruption, and cooperation with free grace\. __Doctrine of Pelagius\. __Pelagius opposed pessimistic views of human nature, advocating for free will and the belief that grace should not pre\-determine actions\. He emphasized the power to act, will, and realization \(*posse*, *velle*, *esse*\), attributing initial power to God but subsequent actions to individuals\. He denied original sin, suggesting Adam would have died regardless\. __Augustine and Original Sin\. __Augustine expanded on original sin, explaining the Fall resulted from our actions\. He navigated between traducianist and creationist views, arguing for shared responsibility and corruption's consequences\. He emphasized a loss of free will \(from *posse non peccare* to *non posse non peccare*\), asserting humans still choose evil due to this fall\. __Grace and Predestination\. __Augustine embraced monergism, viewing grace as essential\. Grace was seen as *prevenient*, *cooperating*, and *efficient*, guiding free will toward good\. Despite free choice, Augustine emphasized God's irresistible will, integrating predestination with foreknowledge and stressing that true freedom is aligned with God\. __The Western Settlement\. __The Council of Carthage in 418 condemned Pelagianism, asserting original sin's inheritance and baptism's necessity\. Semi\-Pelagians, represented by John Cassian, believed grace assisted free will but did not entirely initiate it, suggesting a partially active human will\. __East in the Fifth Century\. __Cyril differentiated concupiscence from corruption, denying shared sin in Adam and emphasizing the intact yet threatened identity of free will requiring the Word\. Figures like Theodore and Theodoret echoed these thoughts, focusing on individualism and cooperative grace, rejecting original sin transmission\.

__XIV: Christ's Saving Work\.__

__The Clue to Soteriology\. __Soteriology in early Christianity revolves around three key theories:

1. Irenaeus emphasized a __physical__ and __mystical__ __view__, where Christ's incarnation was a recapitulation of humanity\.
2. Irenaeus and Origen proposed the __Ransom theory__, involving God's tactical deception of the devil\.
3. The __Realist approach__ viewed the cross as Christ substituting himself to pay the penalty for sin, acting as a sacrificial death\.

__Athanasius\. __Athanasius offered a physical view, restoring the divine image through incarnation and communicating divine force to mankind\. This divinization through union with the Holy Spirit and Christ removed humanity's pollution\. His death, a sacrifice, released us from sin’s curse, representing humans and removing the debt of death\. __Fourth\-Century Greek Fathers\. __Gregory of Nyssa saw the Fall as fragmenting human nature; Christ's incarnation, death, and resurrection reunited these fragments, akin to Platonic realism\. He supported the Ransom theory, involving the trickery of the devil, while denying the Father required Christ's blood for satisfaction\. Eusebius of Caesarea and Cyril of Jerusalem viewed Christ's sacrifices as substitutionary, identifying with human sin to appease divine wrath\. Greek Fathers generally embraced a realist interpretation\. __West in the Fourth Century\. __Western theologians like Hilary and Victorinus shared a Platonic view of human nature\. Ambrose highlighted ransom and deception of Satan, while others noted the devil overreached and lost authority\. Hilary advocated for Christ's recapitulation and sacrificial satisfaction\. Ambrose emphasized sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, combining recapitulation and substitution\. __Augustine\. __Augustine framed Christ as Mediator, offering a peace sacrifice to God\. Redemption was viewed as release from Satan’s hold, with realist undertones\. He detailed how, although the Devil had authority post\-Fall, no ransom was owed; God's favor changed everything\. Christ’s sacrifice was overwhelming for Satan, nullifying his claims\. Redemption’s essence lay in Christ's expiatory sacrifice\. __The East in the Fifth Century\. __Eastern thought primarily embraced realist and recapitulation theories\. Theories involving the devil acknowledged he had no rights and was punished for overplaying his hand\. Cyril highlighted the incarnation as the deification of human nature, where Christ's death eradicated corruption, sin, and divine wrath\.

__XV: Christ's Mystical Body\.__

__Ecclesiology in the East\. __In Eastern theology, ecclesiology was neither original nor a pressing issue\. The Church was viewed as a spiritual society—one and united in Christ through the Holy Spirit—requiring Christ to be truly human for its unity\. __East and the Roman See\. __Rome held a special privilege, even acknowledged in the East, but "Constantinople is the new Rome" marked it as secondary\. Appeals by figures like Nestorius and Cyril were made to Rome, though Rome's primacy was not considered a divine right\. __Western Doctrines: Hilary and Optatus\. __In regions where Donatism wasn't prevalent, ecclesiology aligned with Eastern views\. Ambrose described the Church as the city of God, Christ's body, while Hilary emphasized a fellowship realized through the Eucharist, embracing both sinners and saints\. In Africa, __Donatism__ introduced discord and violence, focusing on issues like *traditors* and the worthiness of ministers for sacrament validity\. Optatus countered by asserting the sacraments' validity came from God and the correct invocation of the Trinity, emphasizing the Church's holiness despite human sinfulness\. __Western Doctrines: Augustine\. __Augustine expanded on Optatus, asserting no salvation apart from the Church, seen as mother \(with God as father\), as the Holy Spirit is bestowed only within it\. The catholic church, embodying all truth and transcending time and place, comprises a mixed community of saints and sinners\. Augustine uniquely framed Christian society as Christ's body, with the Church as a fellowship of love and unity, distinguishing between the essential and empirical Church\. __West and Roman Primacy\. __Factors contributing to Rome's primacy included its status as the ancient capital, the popes' roles in conflicts with barbarians, and their liturgical, dogmatic, and theological influence\.

__XVI: The Later Doctrine of the Sacraments\.__

__General Theory\. __In the 4th and 5th centuries, there was no systematic sacramental theology\. Sacraments were generally understood as outward signs reflecting the presence of invisible grace, with the number of sacraments not yet fixed\. Initially, the term "*mysterion*" referred to events like the incarnation and crucifixion \(\!\)\. Later, it described efficacious signs of the Gospel, such as baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, and penance\. Augustine defined sacraments broadly as pertaining to divine things, but narrowly as those handed down by Jesus and the apostles\. Key ideas included God/Christ as the primary agent, the priest as an instrument, and the invocation of the Trinity as the efficient cause\. The concept of *ex opere operato*, though disputed, indicated the effectiveness of sacraments despite the minister's worthiness\. __Baptism\. __Baptism offered remission of sins, total restoration, sanctification, and illumination of the soul, sealing the presence of the Holy Spirit\. Infant baptism, regardless of original sin, was seen as initiation into the Kingdom\. Athanasius emphasized baptism as uniting man to the Godhead and renewing identity\. __Confirmation or Chrism\. __Involving oil and the laying on of hands, confirmation bestowed the Holy Spirit, corresponding to Christ's reception or blessing\. It was sometimes confused with baptism, as both involved joining Christ’s body and participating in His sufferings\. __Penance\. __Penance remitted post\-baptismal sins\. The Novatianists denied penitence after baptism, rejecting the Church's power to remit mortal sins and restore sinners\. Augustine identified three types of penance: pre\-baptismal, daily for venial sins, and formal discipline for serious sins, featuring public absolution with exclusion and prostration\. __Eucharistic Presence\. __The Eucharistic presence was typically realist, with two interpretations: 1\) a symbolic view held by Tertullian and Cyprian, where signs represented realities apprehended by faith, and 2\) the more popular view of actual substance change during prayer\. __Eucharistic Sacrifice\. __Participation in the Eucharist united believers with Christ, serving as a key means of divinization and commemoration\. Chrysostom viewed it as identical to Christ's offering at the Last Supper\. In the West, it evolved into a sacrifice of thanksgiving, paralleling Christ’s eternal self\-offering\. Augustine linked the Eucharist to sacrifice, emphasizing union with God and portraying Christ as both priest and oblation, with members offering themselves as living sacrifices\.
