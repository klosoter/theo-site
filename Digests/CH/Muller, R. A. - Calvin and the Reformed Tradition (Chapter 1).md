__1\. From Reformation to Orthodoxy: The Reformed Tradition in the Early Modern Era\.__

__Approaching Reformation and Orthodoxy\. __The rise of the institutional form of Protestantism marked the development of the Reformed Tradition, which is characterized by its complexity rather than reliance on a single theologian\. This tradition did not emerge *ex nihilo*, nor can it be fully understood by solely analyzing debates with Rome, Lutherans, or Arminians\. Its roots trace back to the late Middle Ages and draw from older church traditions\. Reformation theologians did not operate in isolation from their predecessors, and differences among reformers, such as Beza and Calvin, represent nuances rather than separate traditions\. __Understanding Reformation as Intellectual History\. __Viewing the Reformation through the lens of intellectual history rather than dogmatics reveals that the periodization of early, high, and late orthodoxy in the Reformed Tradition is gradual and nuanced\. Recent scholarship focuses more on scholasticism, humanism, and newly uncovered documents, showcasing both continuities and diversities within the tradition\. __Critiques of Older Approaches\. __Older interpretations often depicted a stark discontinuity between the Middle Ages and the Reformation, highlighting a shift from Aristotle to rationalism and humanism\. Several Calvin\-centered narratives emerged, including Schweizer’s focus on predestination, Heppe’s on the covenant, and the neo\-orthodox emphasis on Christology\. These approaches are seen as reductionistic, assuming a radical break that did not fully occur\. __Parallel Growth of Humanism and Scholasticism\. __Humanism rose alongside scholasticism within universities\. Reformers such as Luther, Vermigli, and Calvin had medieval educational backgrounds, with Luther influenced by nominalism, Vermigli by Thomist/Augustinianism, and Calvin by Clairvaux, Scotism, and Augustinianism\. They maintained a scholastic method, engaging in discussion and debate without deference to a single "Great thinker," downplaying Calvin's supremacy\. __Embracing Complexity in the Reformed Tradition\. __Calvinists regarded Calvin as one among many Reformers rather than a founder or normative figure\. The article argues for moving beyond master narratives to appreciate the Reformed Tradition’s diverse and interconnected development\. 

__Method and Content\.__

__Distinction Between Method and Conclusions\. __In the study of intellectual history, the distinction between scholasticism and humanism is often viewed as methodological rather than about content\. The "Calvin against the Calvinists" argument claims that the intrusion of scholasticism into Protestant theology led to deductive reasoning based on Aristotelian philosophy, emphasizing metaphysical speculation, particularly about God’s will\. This perspective contrasts scholasticism, which is seen as Aristotelian and *a priori*, with humanism, depicted as anti\-Aristotelian and *a posteriori*\. __Problems with the Scholasticism vs\. Humanism Approach\. __The binary separation between scholasticism and humanism is flawed, as they developed in parallel, demonstrated by Calvin and other reformed writers who engaged in both oratory and disputations\. Methods should not be isolated from content, and previous characterizations contain countless exceptions, such as humanist determinism and scholastic synergism\. __Content Matters\. __In scholasticism, emphasis is placed on references to Scripture and Church Fathers, medieval theologians, and philosophers, showcasing a broad range of sources and disputations\. It employed a thetical approach where distinctions explained opposing arguments\. Humanism, on the other hand, leaned toward discursive, rhetoric\-driven persuasion rather than strict logical demonstration\. 

__Toward a Contextualized Intellectual History of Reformed Protestantism\. __

__Muller's Thesis on Continuity\. __Muller's thesis that emphasizes continuity in Reformed thought is considered reductionistic and oversimplified, overlooking changes and developments\. Calvin should not be seen as the Great Thinker or leader of Reformed theology\. Reformed traditions must be understood contextually, considering ecclesial and confessional backgrounds, predecessors, contemporaries, and subsequent interpretations\. __Calvin Interpretations and Reformed Thought\. __Examples of isolated readings of Calvin include the notion of grace preceding the law, which was later interpreted as legalistic, and the idea of union with Christ as his central dogma\. In response to "Calvin against the Calvinists," it's argued that Calvin was not the sole founder of Reformed thought, and the tradition cannot be narrowly defined as Calvinistic\. __Complexities of Reformed Theology\. __Issues like infra\- and supralapsarianism emerged in the 17th century without much precedent, and hypothetical universalism saw little influence from Calvin\. The later tradition, rather than Calvin, clarified gracious predestination, avoiding determinism\. Muller's reassessment suggests that Reformed thought is a diverse and complex tradition\. __An Overview of the Study\. __"Calvinism" is approached as a methodological issue, and using terms like "TULIP" is seen as anachronistic\. Understanding the Reformed tradition requires a nuanced view of its methods and historical context\.
