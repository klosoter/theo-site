__Chapter 2 and 4 in *The Unaccomodated Calvin* – R\. A\. Muller__

__2\. Of Prefaces, "Arguments," and Letters to the Reader \(19\-38\)\.__

__Calvin's Autobiographical Insights\. __Unlike Luther, we have limited autobiographical details about Calvin\. This scarcity arises because, in the 16th century, people did not prioritize the individual's ego or psyche as the primary source of meaning\. To understand Calvin, we rely on his letters, prefaces, and *Arguments*\. __ From Paris and Basel to Geneva: Letters and Prefaces of 1532\-1536\. __In his commentary on Seneca's *De Clementia*, Calvin praises simplicity and criticizes excessive verbosity and lack of organization\. He prefers gathering topics before establishing a method\. In his *Letter to All Those Who Love Jesus Christ*, a preface to Olivetan’s New Testament, he follows the order of Romans\. His *Letter to Francis I* for the first edition of the *Institutes* serves both apologetic and instructional purposes, moving beyond a typical catechism to elaborate exposition\. In his *Preface to the Commentary upon the Psalms*, Calvin discusses his exile and aims to defend the truth, vindicate the Reformation, and ask for compassion—not for fame\.__ Prefaces and Argumenta, 1538\-41: Strasbourg and the Inception of a Program\. __Calvin pursued a continuous, straightforward exposition in his commentaries, avoiding complex logical devices, in contrast to Melanchthon\. Instead, he reserved such methods for the "Institutes," emphasizing the need for a clear path in theological instruction\. The "Argumentum" at the beginning of his homiletical exposition on Romans illustrates his integration of theological topics with meaningful contemporary discussions, forming a foundational theological guide\. While commentaries emphasized brevity and simplicity, sermons allowed for extended oratory, focusing on persuasion\. __In Geneva, 1541\-1559: The Implementation of Calvin's Design\. __In Geneva, Calvin’s commentaries strictly adhered to the order of the text, rather than developing isolated *loci*\. He recommended reading the Gospel of John first to understand the Incarnation's purpose, followed by Matthew and others\. The Psalms served for church edification, encompassing prayer, worship, and Christian life\. __Prefaces, Letters, and Argumenta, 1559\-1564: Refinements and Modification\. __Calvin enriched the "Institutes" with additions and revised the order from catechetical to dogmatic intent\. His absence from France allowed him to focus on study\. Works like *Harmony of the Evangelists* and *Harmony of the Four Last Books of Moses* illustrate his structured approach, balancing historical narrative and doctrinal teaching with a distinct method and order\. 

__4\. In the Light of Orthodoxy: The "Method and Disposition" of Calvin's *Institutio* from the Perspective of Calvin's Late\-Sixteenth\-Century Editors \(62\-78\)\.__

__Importance to Reformed Theology\. __Calvin's *Institutes* played a critical role in shaping later Reformed theology\. The 1590 version marked the culmination of a process that developed an extensive apparatus, comprising 11 items between the title and the first book\. These ranged from letters and lists of topics to comprehensive indices and summaries, most of which were discarded by editors after 1860\. Muller emphasizes that the "frame" created by this apparatus was nearly as important as the text itself, situating the "Institutes" clearly within the 16th and 17th\-century Reformed context\. __Development of an Apparatus for the *Institutes*, 1559\-1667\. __The evolution of the *Institutes* included contributions by key figures:

- __Nicholas Colladon \(1559\):__ Added titles, an alphabetical list of main topics, and a synopsis\.
- __Augustine Marlorat \(1562\):__ Developed exhaustive indices of Old and New Testament passages\.
- __Edmund Bunnie \(1576, Vautrollerius edition\):__ Provided arguments and summaries of books and chapters\.
- __1576 Lausanne Edition:__ Introduced subheadings and cross\-references reflecting scholastic disputation\.
- __1590 Geneva Edition:__ Enhanced apparatus with marginalia and prefatory admonitions, incorporating previous contributions\.

__Methodus et Dispositio: Understanding in the Early Orthodox Era\. __Developing an apparatus was a natural step since Calvin himself identified the *Institutes* as *loci* and endorsed Colladon's work\. Colladon’s summaries aligned with Calvin's arguments, using his language\. Olevianus contributed to the understanding of the method and disposition of the *Institutes*\. __Theological and Methodological Significance of the Older Apparatus\. __The idea of *duplex cognitio Dei* was not unique, as Dowey identified it as a theme\. Figures like Launeus also explored this concept\. Parker noted the creedal order of the *Institutes*, as did Olevianus and Bunnie\. However, Olevianus also recognized the *duplex cognitio*\. Modern scholarship, such as that by Weber, McNeil, and Ford Lewis Battles, has focused on the discursive nature of the text, inserting topical headings and often overlooking its scholastic form\. This emphasis on humanistic rhetorical form has led to subdivisions that obscure rather than highlight the disputative character of the chapters\.
