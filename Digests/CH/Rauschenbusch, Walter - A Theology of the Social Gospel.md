__23\. A Theology of the Social Gospel – Walter Rauschenbusch__

In* Chapter IV: The Consciousness of Sin,* Rauschenbusch focuses on understanding sin within the scope of societal issues\. Rauschenbusch discusses how a mature moral consciousness recognizes sin not only as personal but deeply intertwined with societal structures\. The social gospel has been criticized for attributing sin to external systems like government and society, downplaying individual responsibility\. However, Rauschenbusch points out that traditional theology also attributes sin and evil to extra\-individual factors \(original sin, the Devil, God, other humans\)\.  The Reformation led to a deeper sin consciousness, but it was blind to systemic sins caused by class struggle\. The social gospel advocates for recognizing broader categories of sin, focusing on public morality and the collective sins of classes and professions that oppress the lower classes\.

*Chapter V: The Fall of Man* critiques the traditional theological narrative of humanity's fall from grace, total depravity, and original sin, contrasting this “speculative” doctrine with the practical focus seen in Jesus's and the prophets' teachings on sin\. Rauschenbusch argues that scripture is more concerned with the current manifestations of sin and evil than their origins\. He suggests that the Social Gospel aligns more closely with this practical and ethical approach, highlighting the importance of addressing societal injustices and evils as the true sins that plague humanity\. He advocates for social action to mitigate sin, contrasting with the traditional view of sin as an invariable human trait that can only be addressed by divine grace\.

*Chapter VI: The Nature of Sin* emphasizes the largely social dimension of sin as a progression from selfishness to the neglect of societal justice and personal relationship with God\. Rauschenbusch critiques the traditional individualistic perspective, advocating for understanding sin in the context of social injustices like war, economic exploitation, and neglect of communal well\-being\. He advocates a more nuanced grasp of sin's nature by examining the ideals of social righteousness and love central to the Kingdom of God, challenging the church to recognize and act against both social and individual sins\.

*Chapter VII: The Transmission of Sin* discusses the universal nature of sin, critiquing the traditional concept of original sin by promoting a solidaristic view of sin where the transmission of sin occurs both biologically and socially\. Rauschenbusch values the doctrine of original sin, particularly regarding inherent selfish impulses, but criticizes its overemphasis on guilt and total depravity\. He argues that social transmission of sin, shaped by customs, institutions, and societal authority, plays a more significant role than hereditary factors alone\. Examples include the normalization of harmful behaviors like alcohol consumption and the glorification of war, which demonstrate how societal norms and values can perpetuate and justify evil, overshadowing the impact of genetic inheritance\. Rauschenbusch emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the social mechanisms that enable sin to spread\.

*Chapter VIII: The Super\-Personal Forces of Evil* challenges the traditional, individualistic view of sin in old theology by highlighting the influence of *super\-personal* forces like communities, institutions, and economic systems on moral behavior\. Drawing from Josiah Royce's idea that organized communities have their own consciousness, Rauschenbusch argues that they possess moral agency and can deviate from their moral obligations by suppressing political liberty and social justice\. Examples provided include Roman tax collectors, slave societies, landlords, and even the Church\. He critiques democracies that, despite their ideals, often operate as oligarchies, suggesting a truly free society would resist exploitation\.

*Chapter IX: The Kingdom of Evil* discusses how evil is perpetuated across generations through societal structures and the control over resources by privileged groups\. Rejecting the a demonic understanding of the Kingdom of Evil, Rauschenbusch emphasizes the social and historical roots of evil often caused by selfishness\. He emphasizes a collective understanding of sin, influenced by Schleiermacher and Ritschl, suggesting that societal evils are rooted in common and solidaristic consciousness\. He advocates for recognizing and combating the systemic injustices that form the modern 'Kingdom of Evil\.'

*Chapter X: The Social Gospel and Personal Salvation* explores the doctrine of salvation within the context of the Social Gospel, arguing that beyond personal salvation, there's a vital social dimension to being saved\. Rauschenbusch suggests that salvation involves turning from self\-centeredness to a focus on God and humanity, emphasizing loving others and contributing to the common good\. He underlines that true sanctification and moral development come through active service and engagement in productive work within the community, contrasting with views that prioritize solitary mysticism or individualistic religious experiences\. Salvation, according to Rauschenbusch, aligns with voluntary service to society, reinforcing the notion that a comprehensive understanding of salvation must include our responsibility to and for each other, ultimately serving the Kingdom of God\.

*Chapter XI: The Salvation of Super\-Personal Forces* emphasizes that just as individuals can be saved, so can composite entities, such as social communities, through conformity to the law of Christ\. Rauschenbusch critiques capitalism for its tendency towards exploitation and contrasts it to cooperative systems, advocating for a true economic democracy where decisions are driven by communal service rather than private profit\. He challenges the notion that states or systems operating on intimidation or self\-interest align with Christian values, pointing out the root of all evil as the love of money, evident in both individual and collective entities\. Through historical examples, including the Church's financial practices and the Reformation's secularization of Church wealth, Rauschenbusch illustrates how the pursuit of profit can corrupt, calling for a reorientation towards more democratic and Christ\-like economic and social structures\.

*Chapter XII: The Church as the Social Factor in Salvation* analyzes the role of the Church as a crucial social factor in salvation\. The Church initially challenged state authority, but over time, it was institutionalized, tying salvation to clerical hierarchy\. Yet, despite their criticism, the Social Gospel advocates are seen as potential key supporters of the Church due to their active engagement\. Rauschenbusch discusses Protestant theology’s evolving view of the Church, influenced by thinkers like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Royce, who emphasize the communal aspect of faith and salvation over individualism\. Salvation, they argue, comes through being part of a community embodying Christ's teachings\. He contrasts the Catholic Church's emphasis on institutional holiness with the Social Gospel Church's focus on the moral and spiritual virtues of the community\.

*Chapter XIII: The Kingdom of God* positions the Kingdom of God as the central dogma of the Social Gospel\. Rauschenbusch argues that Jesus prioritized the founding of the Kingdom, whereas the Church evolved as a necessary organizational structure\. This led to theological and ethical decline, such as distancing from Jesus's teachings and undermining the revolutionary potential of Christianity\. His renewed theological formulation of the Kingdom emphasizes its divine origin, teleological significance, and dual nature \(e\.g\., “already” and “not yet”\)\. He advocates for a vision of the Kingdom that transcends nationalistic constraints, integrates salvation, and demands a social order organized by love, selflessness, and the progressive unity of mankind, extending beyond the Church to encompass all human life\.

*Chapter XIV: The Initiator of the Kingdom of God* is Christ, realizing historical rather than future redemption\. The Social Gospel, supported across various Christian denominations, views Jesus through a modern, ethical lens, emphasizing His commitment to social justice throughout His life\. It suggests Christ's divinity is rooted in His character and actions, demonstrating a new model of humanity based on universal goodness and love\. Rejecting ceremonial practices for acts of love, Jesus embodies the Social Gospel's principles, advocating for an active, historical force against social evils and human weaknesses\. This shift calls for continued awareness and participation in the transformative process Jesus began\.

*Chapter XV: The Social Gospel and Conceptions of God* explores how societal structures influence perceptions of God, transitioning from autocratic to more democratized conceptions paralleling societal changes from despotism and imperialism to democracy\. The Social Gospel critiques traditional views that align God with oppressive systems, advocating instead for a vision of God rooted in liberty, love, and solidarity\. It addresses the problem of suffering, rejecting explanations that justify societal injustices, and presents suffering as a collective experience linked to social sin, highlighting the need for social healing\. Asserting that God opposes systems that perpetuate inequality like capitalism, he posits God as the foundation of social unity, emphasizing themes of freedom, justice, and solidarity in conceptions of God\.

In *A Theology of the Social Gospel, *Rauschenbusch blends theology with social sciences to explore the interplay between sin, salvation, and societal structures within the framework of the Social Gospel\. The work contributes to Christian theology by shifting the emphasis from individualistic interpretations of sin and salvation towards a broader consideration of social sins and collective redemption, sometimes neglecting the horizontal dimension\. By highlighting the social dimensions of Jesus's teachings on sin, redemption, justice, and the Kingdom, he critiques capitalism and institutional church practices that perpetuate social injustices, advocating for a more democratic and Christ\-centric social order\.
