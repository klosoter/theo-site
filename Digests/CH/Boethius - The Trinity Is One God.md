__The Trinity Is One God, Not Three Gods – Boethius__

In the introduction to his treatise on the Trinity, Boethius expresses no ambition for fame but instead aims for conciseness\. His goal is to explore profound philosophical questions regarding the nature of the Trinity, employing new terminology and heavily influenced by St\. Augustine’s “De Trinitate\.”

__*Section I\.*__* *Boethius begins by affirming that only Christianity is a universal and catholic religion, both in its widespread worship and its rules and doctrines, which support its authority\. He addresses the doctrine of the Trinity, asserting the unity and divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, emphasizing that they collectively constitute one God rather than three separate gods\. Boethius confronts the Arian heresy, which argued for a plurality within the Godhead, suggesting that the essence of divinity could include otherness or difference\. He categorically refutes this by introducing sameness and difference in the context of genus, species, and number, a topic he will pick up later to argue against the Arians and for the orthodox understanding of the Trinity as three persons in one essence\.

__*Section II*\.__ In the second section, Boethius categorizes speculative science into three distinct disciplines: Physics, Mathematics, and Theology, each with unique characteristics and objects of study\. Physics deals with the motion and change of forms that are inseparable from their matter\. It is concerned with the tangible and material aspects of the world, focusing on empirical and scientific investigation\. Mathematics explores forms that are immutable and exist apart from matter, such as numbers and geometric shapes\. This discipline assumes no motion and delves into the systematic and abstract relationships between these forms\. Theology, the highest form of speculative science, contemplates purely abstract and immaterial concepts, including the divine essence\. This field studies being itself as pure form, devoid of motion or material composition\.

Boethius then shifts to discuss the nature of the Divine Substance, emphasizing its unique status as Form without matter, thereby making it wholly singular and its own essence\. Unlike other entities that derive their existence from the composition of parts, the Divine Substance exists as purely non\-composite, embodying essence and existence as one\. This fundamental nature of divinity precludes the presence of accidents or plurality within the Godhead, asserting that divine forms are not like the forms found in bodies, which are merely shadows of true, immaterial forms\. Therefore, God, being pure form, is devoid of difference, plurality, number, and accidents\. 

__*Section III*\.__ In the continuation of his discourse on the Trinity, Boethius delves deeper into the philosophical nuances that distinguish the unity of God from human perceptions of plurality and numerical difference\. He explores the concepts of abstract and concrete numbers to elucidate how the oneness of God transcends human categorization\. Abstract numbers represent the repetition of countable single items \(e\.g\., one, two, three\) and imply plurality\. However, Boethius clarifies that such abstract enumeration doesn’t apply to the divine nature of the Trinity, where no substantial differences or accidents occur\. Concrete numbers involve the recognition of unity or duality without implying numerical difference in the way humans usually understand plurality\. Boethius uses practical examples like “one sword, one brand, one blade” to illustrate that different terms can refer to the same entity without suggesting a numerical increase\. This principle is crucial in understanding the Trinity \("the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, and this Trinity is one God"\) not as an enumeration of separate entities but as affirmations of the singular Divine Substance\. He compares this to repeating "sun, sun, sun" without implying there are multiple suns; it’s a reiteration of the same reality\. However, Boethius identifies a key point: while terms like "brand," "blade," and "sword" can be synonymous in referring to the same object without denoting plurality, the persons of the Trinity \(Father, Son, Holy Spirit\) are the same in substance but not identical in personhood\. This distinction is crucial in understanding the unity of the Trinity without falling into the trap of assuming complete indifference among the persons of the Trinity\.

__*Section IV\.*__* *Boethius explores how traditional philosophical categories shift in meaning when applied to the concept of God, underlining the divine nature's transcendence beyond human comprehension and linguistic frameworks\. *Substance\. *For God, substance is elevated to being ‘supersubstantial\.’ Unlike in created beings, where substance and qualities are distinct, in God, they are one and the same\. This implies that God’s essence encompasses His attributes completely\. *Quality*\. In God, to exist is identical to possessing qualities such as justice\. This indicates a lack of distinction between God's existence and His attributes, meaning that God’s very being is equal to His justice\. *Quantity\.* God, being pure Form and truly one, transcends conventional notions of quantity\. His unity is not numerical but essential, indicating a perfect oneness that is indivisible\. *Relation*\. Predications of relation do not apply to God in their conventional sense, as He transcends all relational comparisons within creation\. This theme is picked up in *Section V*\. *Place*\. God's omnipresence signifies He is everywhere, yet He cannot be confined to any place, reinforcing His transcendence over physical limitations\. *Time\. *God exists eternally in a perpetual Present, beyond the constraints of past, present, and future, embodying eternity itself\. *Condition and Situation\. *These categories, indicative of particular circumstances or states, do not find application in God, who possesses all without the limitation of conditions\. *Activity and Passivity\.* Since God operates outside the confines of time and is immutable, having no accidents, these categories do not capture the essence of divine action or experience\. Boethius emphasizes that attributes typically relating to substance or essence are all intrinsic to God’s nature – He is His attributes, such as justice and greatness, without separation between essence and quality\. This contradicts the human experience, where attributes might describe characteristics external to one’s essence\. In contrast, accidental categories, which in created beings suggest qualities beyond their essence, have no place in describing God because He has no accidents, only substance\.

__*Section V*\. __In this section, Boethius dives into the philosophical concept of relation, especially in the context of the Trinity\. He differentiates how relation operates when applied to substances versus accidents and its significance concerning the divine nature of the Father and the Son\. *Relation and Substances*\. Boethius illustrates how certain relationships mutually define the substances involved, such as a master and a slave\. The existence of one term inherently implies the existence of the other; removing one term logically eliminates the other\. However, he clarifies that being a slave is not an accidental quality of the master but an “adventitious augmentation arising from the possession of slaves\.” Therefore, the category of relation does not alter the essence of the involved substances\. *Relation and Accidents*\. Conversely, when relation is applied to accidents, such as the whiteness of a white object, the suppression of whiteness does not lead to the disappearance of the object\. This exemplifies how accidents relate differently to substances without impacting the core essence of the subject\. The existence or non\-existence of a relation, like having a father, does not change the essential nature or substance of the individual\. In applying these distinctions to the Trinity, Boethius argues that the terms Father and Son primarily signify relational distinctions without implying a difference in essence or substance\. Since relation does not constitute or alter the substance itself and relation within the Trinity is eternal \(the Father has always been the Father, and the Son has always been the Son\), it implies no real or substantial change upon the divine nature\. This unchanging, eternal relational distinction underpins the uniqueness of personhood within the Godhead without introducing division or plurality in essence\. Therefore, despite the relational distinctions within the Trinity, the unity of the divine substance remains intact and unblemished\. Boethius concludes that he has “suitably established” Unity of the Three\.

__*Section VI*\.__ Boethius continues to explore the relationship between unity and plurality within the Trinity, reiterating that while relations necessitate the existence of multiple subjects, they do not imply a multiplicity of substance\. If only one subject is present, all predicates refer to the substance itself, and no relative differentiation can be made\. However, since substance and attributes are identical in the divine Godhead, the relations apply to the distinction in persons\. The relations within the Trinity articulate the manifoldness, allowing for the distinction of persons who fully share in the divine essence \(and attributes\) without fragmenting the divine essence\. Boethius concludes, reflecting Augustine’s influence: “The divine substance preserves the Unity, the divine relations bring about the Trinity\.” 

Boethius serves as a pivotal figure in bridging classical philosophy with medieval theology, reflected in his treatise on the Trinity\. In *The Trinity Is One God, Not Three Gods* he aims to reconcile the concept of the Trinity with philosophical rigor, addressing and countering Arian heresy using Platonic and Aristotelian frameworks, setting the stage for future theological discourse by figures like Thomas Aquinas\. As he himself admits, he is highly influenced by and indebted to Augustine, which grounds him firmly in the patristic tradition\. His efforts highlight the coexistence and interplay of faith \(anchored in divine revelation\) and reason \(grounded in natural inquiry\), a duality that would shape scholasticism\. This distinction of science, mathematics, and theology marks him as both the last of the Roman philosophers and a forerunner to scholastic thinkers\.
