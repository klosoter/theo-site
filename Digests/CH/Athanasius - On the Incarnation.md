__On the Incarnation of the Word \- Athanasius__

The __prologue__ of Athanasius's sets the stage for a theological explanation of the incarnation of Jesus Christ, focusing on the nature and purpose of the incarnation from the Christian perspective\. It begins by portraying the Word, also known as the Savior, as inherently incorporeal, emphasizing that the Word's manifestation in a human body was an act motivated by the Father's goodness and loving\-kindness, aimed at human salvation\. This manifestation is presented within the broader context of creation, identifying God as the ultimate craftsman or artificer and the Word's significant role in this creative process\.

Athanasius then contrasts the Christian understanding of creation with other philosophical viewpoints\. He critiques the Epicureans for their belief in a universe where everything emanates in a similar fashion, without clear distinctions, and rebuts __Platonic__ thought, which posits the existence of pre\-existing matter\. Athanasius argues against these perspectives by underscoring the principle of aseity—the self\-existence and self\-sufficiency of God—suggesting that God is the sole cause of everything, thereby making the idea of pre\-existing matter impossible within Christian doctrine\.

Athanasius clarifies that the Christian understanding of __creation__ is fundamentally different: it did not occur spontaneously or from pre\-existing matter, but rather through an intentional act of divine will\. According to Christian doctrine, as articulated by Athanasius, the world was created *ex nihilo* through the Word, driven by God's goodness\. This creative act is intricately connected to Jesus Christ, our Lord, who is central to the narrative of salvation\. Athanasius notes that humanity was made in the image of the Word, implying a special relationship between humans and the divine\. This relationship entails a probationary period where humans, endowed with free will, were promised incorruption and eternal life in heaven if they obeyed God's commands\. However, the alternative was corruption and estrangement from God if they chose not to obey\. 

Athanasius points out that although man was created from nothing, he was meant to live in communion with God through the grace of the Word\. However, the fall resulted in corruption and the dissolution of man's divine image \(the Word\), and man returned to non\-existence\. Yet, God’s goodness demands that man is not left in this state of corruption\. Since his justice demands that the law and truth are upheld, repentance alone is insufficient for this\.

According to Athanasius, the solution lies in the __incarnation of the Word__, who was incorporeal, incorruptible, and immaterial and conjoined with all of humanity by a like nature, becoming capable of death\. He who once created man from nothing is able to do it again, thereby reinstating the divine image\. Without the Word, man suppressed the knowledge of God, which came to him through revelation, by keeping his eyes downwards\. This is why the God came downward himself through the condescension of the Word, so that man may know God again\. By taking on a pure and spotless human body from a virgin and sacrificing it in death, the Word confronted both the guilt under the law and the corruption leading to death, thereby offering salvation\. 

This act of divine goodness not only saved humanity from corruption and provided hope for resurrection but also glorified mankind, putting an end to the dominion of death established by Adam and replacing it with life and resurrection through Christ\. 

In his response to __Jewish objections__, Athanasius argues that the Scriptures themselves refute Jewish skepticism concerning the Messiah\. He cites various prophecies from Isaiah, Numbers, Genesis, Hosea, Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, and Psalms that predict the coming of Christ, His suffering, death, and the significance of the Cross\. He emphasizes that no historical Jewish king or prophet could fulfill these prophecies as Christ did, especially in terms of performing miracles or being sacrificed for the salvation of all\. Athanasius further notes that if some Jews believe the Word of God has not yet come, they should consider Daniel's prophecy, which aligns perfectly with Christ's coming\. He also points out the destruction of Jerusalem and the cessation of prophets as signs that the age of the Old Testament has concluded, marking the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets with Christ's coming\.

Regarding Greek objections, Athanasius defends the incarnation's rationality, confronting questions about the absurdity of God taking on a human body\. He argues that if the cosmos can be considered divine or gods can assume human forms in Greco\-Roman thought, it's not unreasonable for the Word of God to become incarnate\. He refutes the expectation for Christ to have appeared in a more majestic form, like celestial bodies, by explaining that the purpose of the incarnation was not to awe but to heal and teach\.

Athanasius asserts that salvation could not be achieved by mere fiat because it needed to address the corruption of being, which necessitated a bodily salvation fulfilled through the incarnation\. The tangible changes in the world following Christ's coming—such as the end of idol worship, the cessation of oracles, and transformations in society—serve as proof of the incarnation's divine nature and effectiveness\. He concludes by highlighting the remarkable achievements of the Savior, which are so profound and numerous that they are beyond full comprehension, like trying to count the waves of the sea\. In the epilogue, he reiterates the cessation of idolatry and the spread of Christian doctrine as evidence of Christ's divine sonship and the true Word of God, exhorting readers to live honorably in anticipation of Christ's return\.

Analysis of Athanasius’ Theology

__*Necessity of incarnation\.*__* *Athanasius argues the necessity of the incarnation and salvation because despite God revealing Himself through providence and special revelation, humanity persisted in ignorance, necessitating the incarnation for renewal in God's image\. Athanasius argues that God, desiring to be known and worshipped, chose to renew humanity so they might know Him anew through Christ, who is the perfect image of God\. The incarnation plays a central role in Athanasius’s theology, and he maintains both the human and the divine nature of Christ\. Because of man's continued orientation towards the sensual world, it was necessary that the Word condescend and reveal God by assuming a physical body\. Yes, this was no ordinary human body, as through his bodily works, Christ demonstrated His divinity, overcoming death and making Himself known to humanity\. Even as He performed human functions, Christ's actions were indicative of His divine nature\.

__*The Mediatory Character of the Incarnation\.*__* *A crucial aspect of the incarnation is reestablishing the relation between humanity and God to perceive the Godhead anew through the works of Christ's body, empowering them to recover the sight of divine knowledge lost through sin\. This theological exposition underscores the incarnation's pivotal role in reconciling humanity with God, renewing them in His image, and restoring the knowledge of God that was lost through the fall\. Through this process, humanity is once more elevated from a natural state of non\-existence \(made out of nothing\) into a state of existence by being remade through the image of God\.

__*The Purpose and Outcome of the Incarnation\.*__* *Athanasius closely examines the purpose and outcomes of the incarnation, particularly in relation to the crucifixion\. The incarnation aimed to make the mortal immortal, reveal the Father to humanity, and repay the debt owed due to sin by offering a sacrifice that would remove guilt and conquer death\. The Word's suffering and death were integral to this mission, achieved through His union with humanity\. 

__*The Importance of Death through Crucifixion\.*__* *Athanasius addresses the necessity of death through crucifixion, a public and ignominious death, over a private one\. A private death might suggest that Christ died out of weakness, like a normal man, which is contrary to His divine nature\. His body, being naturally incorruptible, required death inflicted by others\. Christ underwent death voluntarily, in perfect health, without fleeing from His fate, proving His death through the undeniable evidence of His crucifixion and avoiding any suspicion that He might have evaded death or feared certain death methods\. Moreover, by choosing death through crucifixion, bearing humanity’s curse, Christ fulfills the Old Testament\. His resurrection after three days was a duration long enough to provide proof of his death, and brief enough to remain fresh in the witness's memory\. Christ’s victory over death, denuding it of its terror, inspired voluntary martyrdom of his believers, who, with Paul, preferred death over life\. The transformative and enduring effects of Christ’s work –drawing people to religion, encouraging virtue, teaching immortality, leading desires to heavenly realms, revealing the Father, and empowering the faithful to face death– underscore that He cannot be considered dead, demonstrating the profound and lasting victory of the Cross over death and sin\.
