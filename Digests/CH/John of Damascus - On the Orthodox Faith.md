# __On the Orthodox Faith – John of Damascus__

Chapters one and two of __Book I__ of John of Damascus’s *On the Orthodox Faith* argue that certain aspects of God’s nature and actions can be known, even though he is incomprehensible and beyond human understanding\. This includes understanding God as one essence in three persons \(Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\) and the incarnation of Christ as both fully God and fully man\. Chapter three demonstrates the existence of God through natural law and logical argumentation, emphasizing that creation itself and the order within it point to an uncreated, immutable creator\. In chapter four, John further explicates that God’s essence is unknowable; humans can only understand God through His actions and attributes, such as His goodness, justice, and wisdom\. Chapter five argues for the oneness of God, using scripture and logic to contend that God’s perfection necessitates His uniqueness, as multiplicity among gods would imply limitations to their divinity\. Chapters six and seven offer logical proofs of the Word, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, showing how both are eternally consubstantial and coexistent with the Father\. Chapter eight explores the details of the Holy Trinity, emphasizing that while the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct in their relations of origin \(unbegottenness, begottenness, and procession\), they are absolutely equal in essence, power, and glory\. In chapter nine, John discusses the attributes and titles of God, reflecting on God’s self\-revelation to Moses and the significance of the various names given to God in Scripture\. These names and titles, such as Creator, Lord, and Shepherd, express aspects of God’s relationship to the world and his divine nature\. Chapter ten addresses the unity and diversity within the Godhead, explaining how the relations of the divine persons explain diversity while all names and attributes are common to the deity as a whole\. Chapter eleven clarifies that Scripture speaks symbolically when it attributes bodily descriptions to God\. The next chapter argues that God is the ultimate cause of all, so his names are only derived from His actions and effects in the world since essence is unnamable\. These names can be affirmative, based on what God does, or negative, pointing to God’s transcendence beyond human understanding\. Chapter thirteen contrasts God’s uncircumscribed omnipresence and immutability with the bounded existence of angels and human souls\. God is portrayed as unchangeable, sovereignly ordaining all events by His foreknowledge\. Finally, Chapter fourteen summarizes the divine attributes, painting a picture of God as the eternal, uncreated, and self\-sufficient source of all goodness, justice, and life\. These attributes underline God’s absolute dominion over creation, emphasizing that God possesses these qualities inherently, not derivatively\.

The first two chapters of __Book II__ discuss the various meanings of time and eternity \(*aeon*\) and affirm that God, out of His goodness, created all things to share in His blessings through the Word and Spirit\. Chapters three and four shift focus to angels – some of whom rebelled and became demons – describing their creation in the image of God and their changeable nature despite their incorporeality and immortality\. Chapters five to ten delve into the physical creation, starting with the creation of the four elements from nothing, which then are used for the creation of all that exists\. The next two chapters highlight the special creation of humanity, placed in Paradise to live in God’s image, tying humans to both the material and immaterial world through their composite nature\. Chapters thirteen to seventeen examine human experiences and faculties, differentiating between mental pleasures like contemplation and learning and bodily ones like food and procreation, discussing the nature of pain, fear, anger, and imagination as aspects of human life\. Chapters eighteen to twenty explore the sensory faculties endowed by the Creator, along with the mental faculties of thought and memory\. In contrast, chapters twenty\-one to twenty\-four discuss abstract human experiences, distinguishing between mental conception and vocal articulation, understanding passion as an affection of things without sensation, and exploring the notions of energy – which manifest the nature of essence – and involuntary actions which originate outside of one’s own impulses\. Chapters twenty\-five to thirty engage deeply with theodicy, arguing against deterministic views to affirm that humans have the agency to deliberate and choose, aligning free will with reason\. John claims that while not all events are within our control, those that are showcase the synergy between divine providence and human freedom, with divine foreknowledge extending to all events but not predetermining them\.

Chapter one of __Book III__ emphasizes God’s efforts to redeem humanity after the fall, culminating in the incarnation of the Divine Word, who was sinless and consubstantial with the Father and Spirit\. Chapters three to four explain the angelic announcement to Mary and the miraculous conception of Christ, emphasizing that divinity took on humanity in him, resulting in a person with two natures, divine and human, yet remaining one Christ\. The next three chapters articulate that while God has one nature, Christ, as the incarnate Word, has two natures without compromising his divine nature or his continuous presence with the Father\. Chapters eight and nine further explore the nature of the union of divinity and humanity in Christ, arguing against any spectrum or confusion of the two natures, asserting Christ’s unity as one subsistence\. Chapter ten confronts a heretical hymn \(Trisagium\) in proposing a fourth person and clarifies its orthodox interpretation\. In the next two chapters, the unity of Christ is addressed, and the title *Theotokos* is defended against Nestorian interpretations – although Mary also bore the *deified* human nature\. Chapters thirteen to fifteen discuss the attributes of Christ, arguing that Christ possesses all divine attributes save unbegottenness and all of Adam’s attributes except sinfulness\. Christ also possesses some “double” qualities that are proper to each nature individually and are united and yet unmixed: volition, energy, free will, and wisdom and knowledge\. This does not imply that Christ has three natures, argue chapters sixteen to eighteen, asserting His single, united personhood\. Nor does the deification of his human nature imply a mixing of natures\. The harmony and subordination of Christ’s human will to His divine will are also discussed\. Chapter nineteen explores the concept of theandric energy, the cooperative action of Christ’s divine and human natures, illustrating the unique interaction between the two, that foreshadows the doctrine of *communicatio idiomatum*\. Chapters twenty to twenty\-four discuss Christ’s assumption of natural and innocent human experiences, like growth, fear, and prayer, as integral to His mission to redeem every aspect of human existence\. Chapter twenty\-five explains the distinctions between the appropriation of natural and essential attributes and the appropriation of personal and relative attributes within Christ\. The next three chapters explore the paradox of Christ’s passion and death, asserting His divine impassibility alongside the real experience of death, maintaining the inseparability of His divinity and humanity even in death\. The final chapter concludes with Christ’s descent into Hades, proclaiming salvation and liberating the souls held there, emphasizing the victorious and transformative power of the incarnation and resurrection\.

Chapters one to eight of __Book IV__ delve into the profound mysteries and implications of Christ’s resurrection, His divine and human natures, and the Incarnation\. The resurrection signifies Christ’s triumph over human passions and death, highlighting the unchanged union of His divine and human natures\. The discussion underscores the significance of worshiping Christ’s human nature due to its union with the divine, affirms Mary’s role as Theotokos, and clarifies the eternal begottenness of the Son, distinguishing His divine origin from all creation\. Chapters nine to thirteen discuss the role of faith and baptism in the Christian life, grounding salvation, and the remission of sins in the sacramental life of the church\. He reflects on the power of the cross, the direction of worship \(towards the east\), and the cumulative effect of Christ’s work – incarnation, baptism, passion, resurrection – on human nature’s redemption from sin, death, and corruption\. Chapters fourteen to eighteen consider the veneration of saints, the genealogy of Christ, and the theological underpinnings of Christian worship practices, including the honoring of images\. John counters criticisms against the worship and honoring of holy images and salvatory power of relics by emphasizing the incarnation’s implications for material creation as a medium of divine grace\.

In chapters nineteen to twenty\-four, John addresses the problem of evil, a dualistic view of the universe, and the balance between divine sovereignty and human freedom\. He also critiques the Jewish understanding of the Sabbath and provides a robust theology of virginity, reflecting the highest ideals of Christian holiness in light of the incarnate life\. The final chapters touch upon the topics of circumcision as a precursor to baptism, marking a shift from the Old Covenant to the New, and end with a discussion on the Antichrist\. John of Damascus reinforces the church’s teaching against heresies that deny the incarnation and acknowledges the ongoing spiritual battle until the end of the ages\.

John Damascus’ *On the Orthodox Faith* is a robust work of systematic theology, covering a wide range of theological loci, including theology proper, Christology, creation, fall, sacraments, and eschatology\. His work is a culmination of the early Church’s theology, judging by the abundance of quotations from early Church Fathers\. He does not name his opponents but seems to be responding to Islam through his detailed exposition of distinctions between theology proper and Christology\. He also clearly addresses – or anticipates the beginning of – the Iconoclastic Controversy by defending the worship of saints in the eighth and ninth centuries throughout the Byzantine Empire\. Like Augustine, he foreshadows the doctrine of *communicatio idiomatum*, but unlike him, he prefers foreknowledge over determinism and predestination\.
