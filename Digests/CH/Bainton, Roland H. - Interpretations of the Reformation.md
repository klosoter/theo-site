__"Interpretations of the Reformation" by Roland H\. Bainton\.__

__Ranke and Objectivity\. R__anke advocated for pure objectivity in historical interpretation, yet the selection of sources inherently involves subjectivity, as seen in comparisons with Janssen and Döllinger\. Modern historians strive to declare biases upfront, although this is not always feasible\. __Lack of Great Interpretive Works\. __The Reformation lacks a seminal interpretive work, despite being shaped by great thinkers\. This void is partly due to its polemical and documentary nature, characterized by confessions and religious documents\. __Eighteenth and Nineteenth\-Century Perspectives\. __In the 18th century, Rationalists aimed for impartiality, while Pietists sought equal sympathy\. The 19th\-century idealists looked for motifs and laws, with Hegel viewing history as the emancipation of the *Weltgeist*\. However, this did not result in a comprehensive history of the Reformation\. Ranke’s focus on sources eschewed theorizing, yet he acknowledged divine providence in history\. __Liberal Interpretations and Karl Holl\. __Liberal historians saw the Reformation and Renaissance as moves away from Church authority, with Troeltsch emphasizing the connection between religion and culture\. Karl Holl argued that only religion could explain Luther’s significance, initiating a Luther renaissance\. __Debate on Luther’s Originality\. __Questions of Luther’s originality arise, with Erich Hassinger asserting that Luther rediscovered Christianity’s historical core, emphasizing Christ's continual presence in Scripture through the Spirit\. This challenged mysticism, moralism, and institutionalism, which emphasized God’s constant accessibility, salvation by works, and the Church’s custodianship, respectively\. __Motivations of Luther’s Disciples\. __Luther’s disciples are scrutinized for their motivations, whether religious or economic\. Arguments suggest that both populace and princes risked everything out of genuine belief, and that some laypeople grasped Luther’s theology\. __Italian Failure and Political Context\. __The Reformation's failure in Italy is attributed to economic stability, ingrained Catholicism, and political factors, such as German decentralization and mysticism’s affinity with grace\. The author suggests that the Reformation thrived where political interests aligned yet cautions against oversimplification\. __Contemporary and Neoorthodox Perspectives\. __Contemporary histories emphasize politics and sociology over religion\. Karl Holl and Erich Hassinger ponder the religious foundation of the Reformation, while Neoorthodox scholars attempt to revive Reformers' theology\. They find discrepancies, such as Calvin’s and Luther’s views diverging on natural theology\. __Newer Scholarship and Critical Editions\. __Recent scholarship by Catholics and Protestants is more balanced, contextualizing Luther within Medieval Catholicism\. However, a lack of critical editions hinders verification of documentary evidence, complicating efforts to draw clear conclusions\.
