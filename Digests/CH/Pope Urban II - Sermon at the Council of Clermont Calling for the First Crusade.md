__Sermon at the Council of Clermont Calling for the First Crusade – Pope Urban II__

This text contains five different accounts of Pope Urban II’s sermon, each of which are discussed below\.

*In Fulcher of Chartres’* account of Pope Urban II’s sermon, the Pope is introduced as the supreme ecclesiastical authority, describing him as the chief bishop and prelate of the entire world and an ambassador of divine admonishment\. Addressed to the “servants of God,” the Pope intends to encourage the faithful to service while aiming to correct their deviation from God’s laws\. He calls for a spiritual renewal to prevent the damnation awaiting those consumed by worldly pleasures, using vivid imagery to caution against the dangers of leading others astray due to personal moral failings\. Urban II emphasizes the urgency of ecclesiastical reforms, prohibiting simony and ensuring the clergy’s independence from secular powers\. He laments the widespread disorder in the world attributed to crimes committed by his audience\.  These crimes have led to a weakened justice system and widespread robberies, and he calls for peace and compliance to church decrees\. The Pope then addresses the struggles of Christians in the East, who are attacked by Turks and Arabs who have bested them several times in battle and desecrated sacred sites\. He frames the need for Western intervention as a divine mandate \(“Christ demands it\!”\), promising immediate remission of sins to those who perish in this holy endeavor\. The sermon characterizes the enemy in dehumanizing terms, urging the faithful to unite against this “vile race” of “demon worshippers” in defense of the Christian faith\.

Interestingly, Urban II addresses his audience as faithful stewards and servants of God, which contrasts starkly with the grave injustices they commit\.* *The irony of enlisting those previously engaged in violence against fellow Christians for a sacred cause reflects the multifaceted nature of Urban II’s appeal, contrasting the promise of spiritual redemption with the setting of holy war\.

*In Robert the Monk’s account* of Pope Urban II’s speech, written approximately 25 years after the actual event and potentially drawing from the Gesta version \(cf\. below\), the Pope praises the Franks as being a chosen, beloved, sanctified, faithful, and honorable people\. The speech vividly details the atrocities committed by Muslims against Christians, describing them as a “race utterly alienated from God” responsible for horrific acts of violence, including desecrating churches \(by turning them into mosques\) and engaging in unspeakable tortures such as circumcision of Christians, dragging out intestines, flogging, rape, stakes, and beheading__, __Urban II evokes the legacy of the Franks’ ancestors, such as Charlemagne, to inspire a similar conquest against the heathens, urging them not to be deterred by worldly attachments and highlighting the miserable state of their overpopulated and impoverished homeland as further motivation to undertake the holy mission\. He frames the liberation of the Holy Sepulchre and the Holy Land, described as a land of abundance and significant to Christian history, as an imperative duty of the Franks, causing the people to cry out “Deus Vult” \(“God wills it\!”\)\.__ __The Pope’s call to arms excludes the old, weak, and women unless they have male guardians, focusing on those capable of combat\. It prescribes the bearing of the sign of the cross, symbolizing their commitment to this “holy pilgrimage\.” This mission is portrayed not just as a sacrifice but as the fulfillment of Christ’s command to take up the cross and follow Him, suggesting that participation in the crusade is inherently an act of piety and devotion\. Robert’s narrative diverges from others by omitting calls for repentance or promises of remission of sins\. Instead, it emphasizes ancestry, the grievous actions of the Muslims, and the territorial and spiritual motivations behind the crusade\. This version reframes the crusade as a divinely sanctioned opportunity for the Franks to reclaim their valor, free the holy lands, and return them to Christian rule, essentially presenting the crusade as a pivotal moment of religious and military reform destined by God\.

*The Gesta Version*, created around 1100\-1101 by an anonymous writer associated with Bohemund of Antioch, provides a distinct narrative of the Crusades, focusing on spiritual motivation and the call to pilgrimage\. According to this account, Pope Urban II, alongside high\-ranking ecclesiastical figures, traveled beyond the Alps to fervently preach the importance of undertaking the journey to the Holy Sepulchre, framing it as a divine mission for the salvation of the soul\. The Pope’s message emphasized self\-denial and the symbolic act of taking up the cross, inspired by Jesus’ teachings in the Gospel, as essential for those wishing to follow Christ zealously\. This version describes a great spiritual excitement throughout Gaul, where the Franks, moved by the Pope’s sermons and eager to imitate Christ’s sacrifice for mankind’s redemption, promptly adorned their garments with crosses on their right shoulders\. This act signified their commitment to reclaim the Holy Land and their readiness to endure hardships for Christ’s sake, fulfilling His command to confess faith before men and trust in divine providence for their needs\. The Gesta narration underscores the crusade as a pilgrimage of faith and penance, marked by a collective willingness among the faithful to walk in Christ’s footsteps, thereby ensuring their redemption from damnation\. This perspective highlights the crusade’s spiritual dimensions over its military aspects, portraying it as a unifying religious endeavor driven by devotion and the promise of heavenly reward\.

*In Balderic of Dol’s account*, which draws upon the Gesta and is written in the early 12th century, the text describes the severe challenges faced by Christians in the East at the hands of “base and bastard Turks\.” These Christians, considered brethren by virtue of their shared faith, endure scourging, oppression, and grave mistreatment, including being killed or sold into slavery\. The Pope laments the desecration and profanation of holy places in Jerusalem, emphasizing the city’s significance as the site of Christ’s suffering and as a place once hallowed by the ministries of holy figures like the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist\. 

The account reprimands the current generation of knights for engaging in violence against their Christian brothers, urging them instead to direct their military skills against the heathens desecrating the Holy Land\. It emphasizes that true knighthood is defined not by internal conflict but by the defense of the faith and the faithful\. The Pope passionately argues that dying on this holy endeavor holds equal spiritual merit to any other form of martyrdom, as it aligns the Crusaders directly with Christ’s army\. The audience’s response to this call to arms is deeply emotional, with many moved to tears, trembling, or discussion\. The narrative highlights Bishop Adhemar of Puy’s immediate and enthusiastic commitment to lead the crusading army on behalf of the Pope, symbolizing the collective ecclesiastical and lay endorsement of the crusade as a divinely sanctioned mission\. Balderic’s portrayal intertwines lamentation with a clarion call for valiant action, framing the crusade as not merely a military campaign but also as a spiritual devotion to protect and reclaim sacred Christian heritage\. This version positions the crusade as a righteous response to both spiritual degradation and physical aggression, urging unity of purpose among Christians to defend their faith and brethren against external threats\.

*Guibert de Nogent’s account*, based upon eyewitnesses and the Gesta, emphasizes Jerusalem’s unparalleled sanctity among global churches due to its direct connection with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and its historical significance in hosting prophets and apostles\. Guibert invokes the valor of the Maccabees, who fought for their temple’s sanctity, as a parallel to urge Christian soldiers to defend their spiritual heritage and reclaim the Cross, Blood, and Tomb from pagan control\. In Guibert’s account, the Pope criticizes the senseless violence and wars waged out of greed and pride amongst Christians, contrasting these with the noble cause of the crusade that promises the glory of martyrdom and divine commendation\. He underscores Jerusalem’s importance, suggesting that successfully defending it against the Antichrist, as prophesied in Daniel, could renew Christian worship and anticipate the “times of the Gentiles” prophesied to precede the salvation of Israel\. Focusing on the substantial sufferings endured by pilgrims at the hands of the Gentiles, including extortion and brutal physical abuses, Guibert strengthens the case for the crusade\. He concludes with Pope Urban II’s solemn decree, offering absolution to those committing to the crusade and introducing the sign of the cross as a sacred emblem of their holy endeavor\. Those reluctant to honor their vow are threatened with eternal damnation, while the Pope curses anyone who would trouble the families and properties of the crusaders, thereby sanctifying the crusader’s mission with a profound spiritual mandate and promising redemption for their past transgressions\.

There are several similarities between these five accounts: Fulcher, Balderic, and Guibert reprimand Christians for warfare and crimes against each other and instead urge them to unify against the common enemy and be rewarded with remission of sins\. All accounts describe the atrocities committed by the Turks – who are dehumanized – against Christians in the Holy Land\. The most notable differences are Robert’s appeal to the holy and faithful ancestry of the Franks and encouragement to reclaim their valor – while omitting the promise of remission of sins; Gesta focuses on the spiritual aspect of pilgrimage, following in Christ’s footsteps; and Guibert provides a positive description of Jerusalem urging Christians to defend their spiritual heritage\. These different accounts of Urban II’s sermon shed light on historiographical challenges when studying secondary sources from the past\. Each account has a different emphasis, socio\-political background, bias, and motivation, which demonstrate that the complexity of the Crusades as a historical event is not a recent phenomenon but is already reflected in the diversity of these accounts\.
