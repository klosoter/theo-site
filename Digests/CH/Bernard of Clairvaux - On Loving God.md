__On Loving God – St\. Bernard of Clairvaux__

In the dedication of "On Loving God," Bernard, the abbot of Clairvaux, humbly responds to a request for spiritual counsel from Lord Haimeric, Cardinal Deacon and Chancellor of the Roman Church\. Bernard expresses feelings of inadequacy in addressing his requests but commits to addressing the theme of "”oving God,” emphasizing his humility throughout\.

__The first chapter,__ “Why We Should Love God and the Measure of That Love,” posits that the rationale for loving God is rooted in God Himself, as nothing is more logical or profitable\. God is portrayed as the cause of love, and the measure of our lovemaking, the measure of love for Him, is inherently boundless\. Bernard argues that the most profound God gifted to wretched humans was Himself, which is why he ought to be loved in return\. He highlights that God's love for humanity is initial, unconditional, and demonstrated through the sacrificial gift of His Son\. According to Bernard, this establishes God's undeniable claim to our love\.

In __chapter two,__ he elaborates on the reasons humans are obligated to love God, recognizing both His material and spiritual gifts\. He argues that it is not only the essential provisions such as food, light, and air that bind us to gratitude and love towards God but also the higher gifts that define our humanity: our dignity, manifest in our free will and dominion over animals; our wisdom, which allows us to recognize this distinctive human dignity; and our virtue, which encourages us to seek and glorify our Creator\. Bernard stresses that these attributes of dignity, wisdom, and virtue are interconnected and that one cannot exist without the others\. Moreover, Bernard contends that a proper understanding of our selves and our blessings underscores that our glories are not of our own making but are gifts from God\. He identifies three pitfalls in human behavior regarding the recognition of these gifts: ranking oneself too low, leading to ingratitude, overvaluing oneself, leading to misplaced glory, and claiming glory for oneself that rightfully belongs to God\. By contemplating God’s providential gifts combined with the innate sense of God’s justice by virtue of being created in the image of God, we are bound to love God for God’s sake\.

In the __next chapter,__ Bernard argues that Christians have the ultimate motive to love God, deeply rooted in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ\. The crucifixion, alongside Christ’s suffering and selfless act of dying for humankind, serves as the essential basis for this love\. Bernard evokes the imagery from Wisdom Literature – most notably, Song of Songs – as metaphors for deep spiritual renewal: “refreshing ourselves with the fruits of His Passion which we gather from the Tree of the Cross and with the flowers of His Resurrection” \(cf\. Song of Songs 4:13\)\. He outlines the key elements of Christ’s mission, his death, resurrection, ascension, and eventual return, as undeniable reasons to cherish and love God\.

The __fourth chapter__ considers the kind of people who genuinely find comfort in the contemplation of God, describing them as those dissatisfied with mere earthly pleasures and seeking eternal happiness in God\. This comfort is particularly found among those who yearn for righteousness, partake in the remembrance of His passion through the Eucharist, and who, despite the chaos of the current world, place their hope in eternal joy with God\. He explicitly states that this connection and comfort with God are not for the wicked or perverse but reserved for those with a sincere longing for Christ, demonstrated through the extensive use of the metaphor of the Bride longing for her Bridegroom from Song of Songs\.

In __chapter five,__ Bernard reflects on the Christian’s immense debt of love to God, borne out of recognition and gratitude for His boundless gifts\. While the infidel might acknowledge a Creator to whom he owes his existence, a Christian’s realization extends deeper, recognizing God not just as a creator or sustainer but also the Son as a deliverer, preserver, and the very essence of our inheritance and glory\. Bernard’s use of personal pronouns captures this profound acknowledgment, emphasizing a personal relationship with God\. He poses a rhetorical question from Psalm 116 on how to repay God’s benevolence, concluding that nothing can compare to God’s gift of Himself to us, thus highlighting the immeasurable depth of love owed to Him\. Bernard briefly summarizes the previous chapters by highlighting that God loves us first infinitely, greatly, and freely, while we are nothing but miserable sinners\. Therefore, our love can never be a gift; it is a debt\.

Chapter seven discusses the dual incentives for loving God: it's both a duty because of His divine right and beneficial for us due to the inherent reward\. He argues that true love needs no external reward; love for God is fulfilling because God Himself is the ultimate reward\. Bernard critiques loving anything for the sake of reward as fundamentally flawed and insatiable, emphasizing the vanity in expecting satisfaction from earthly desires\. He further explains that only God can provide true rest and peace, contrasting this with the never\-ending cycle of craving material wealth, as exemplified by the Biblical quote, “He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver\.” Bernard highlights the blessedness of those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, as God’s love is both the efficient and final cause of our love\. Bernard concludes this chapter with a thought\-provoking paradox – similar to the one we encountered in Augustine: “No one can seek the Lord who has not already found Him,” suggesting that the very desire to seek God is evidence of His presence in our lives\.

In the __next couple of chapters,__ Bernard outlines four stages – or degrees – in the progression of love toward God, each stage deepening one’s relationship with God, from self\-centered motives to a completely selfless communion with God\.

*First degree: Loving God for the Self’s Sake*\. Bernard describes how human beings, by their very nature, are inclined towards self\-love so that individuals begin to love God through the lens of their own needs and desires\. The greatest commandment shows this by positing that we are to love our neighbor “as ourselves\.” And yet, this commandment is only fulfilled through the first: loving God with our whole being\. In this stage, one comes to realize that one’s own well\-being is closely tied to God, as it is impossible to achieve true goodness without God\. As such, it is the first step to a deeper and more selfless love\. 

*Second degree: Loving God for the Benefits He Has Bestowed\. *According to the second degree of love, love for God evolves from mere self\-interest to a genuine appreciation for the blessings received from Him: “No longer do we love God because of our necessity, but because we have tasted and seen how gracious the Lord is” \(cf\. Psalm 34:8\)\. This more authentic degree of love transcends a love of mere self\-interest\.

*Third Degree of Love: Loving God on His Own Account, Solely Because He Is God*: Ascending to the third degree, love reaches a purity founded not on personal gain but on the recognition of God’s intrinsic worthiness of love\. This degree embodies selfless love, acknowledging God's supreme goodness and creation, fulfilling the commandment to love God and, by extension, to love all His creatures\.

*Fourth Degree: Wherein Man Does Not Even Love Self Save for God's Sake*\. Bernard articulates the pinnacle of spiritual love as the stage where individuals solely love themselves through their love for God\. Achieving this degree of love signifies a profound merging of one's identity with God's will, wherein personal desires and egocentric motives dissolve entirely into divine love\. Bernard poeticizes this ultimate form of love as an experience of being “emptied and lost and swallowed up in God,” where earthly concerns and the limitations of mortal life no longer inhibit the soul's communion with the divine\. However, Bernard concedes that such a state of perfect and complete selflessness is only temporary as it is limited by the trials of daily life, human frailty, and the “body of death\.” In a somewhat Platonic disregard of the body, he argues that this love is only attainable in a perfect, spiritual, and immortal body, undisturbed by the troubles of the flesh\. This theme is picked up in the next chapter, where Bernard describes the role of the body in three states of existence: life \(the body serves the soul but is a burden\), the intermediate state \(the body is neither a burden nor assistant\), and the eternal life \(the body serves the soul in glory\)\. The fourth degree of love can only be fully and permanently attained in the last state\. 

In a letter to the Carthusians, Bernard distinguishes between selfish and God\-centered love and reflects on the divine law that promotes the welfare of others above one’s own\. He also applies this law to the Trinity, demonstrating the self\-giving nature of God’s love\.

Using different metaphors, Bernard contrasts those who love God as slaves, driven by fear, hirelings, motivated by selfish desires rather than genuine love for God, setting the stage for understanding the filial relationship with God as one of love, transcending fear and desire, which is the theme of the next chapter\. For the righteous, Bernard argues that the law is not a burden but an expression of willingly obedient love\. To adopted sons, the law is given freely to the willingly obedient \(“*Take* my yoke upon you”\), and yet, love is never without godly fear and godly desire\. Finally, Bernard recapitulates the four degrees of love and argues that this is only perfectly completed in the blessed state of the heavenly Fatherland\.

*On Loving God* is a mix between a devotional and a systematic treatment of God’s love and responding to human love\. Bernard offers a peek into his devotional life, and his work abounds with pious reflections on Scripture, mainly on the Song of Songs\. The themes of love due to God and our selfishness frame the work, which is most clear in the progression of the four degrees of love from pure selfishness to pure selflessness\.
