__Was there a Reformation in the Sixteenth Century? – Hans J\. Hillerbrand__

__Flacius and Sleidanus\. __Flacius argued that Luther recovered Biblical religion, while Sleidanus viewed the Reformation as a movement for political freedom\. Catholics were less inclined to study the Reformation, while seventeeth\-century “impartial church history” showed partiality to the losers, heretics, dissenters, and radicals\. __Protestant Perspectives\. __For Protestants, the Reformation became a defining event in their self\-understanding, with scholarship focusing on ecclesiastical aspects\. National historiography often emphasized the Reformation either for the greater glory of God or the nation, as seen with Ranke coining terms like "age of the Reformation" and "Counter\-Reformation\." __Theological and Political Constructs\. __The author emphasizes that discussing Reformation studies acknowledges their theological and political construction\. Neo\-Orthodox approaches historically narrowed the scope of the Reformation\. __Changes in Scholarship in the 1960s\. __By the 1960s, Reformation scholarship was deeply theological, largely ignoring historical developments, a critique raised by Bernd Moeller\. However, the direction of scholarship began shifting to include historical questions, particularly examining the Reformation’s impact on cities\. __Societal Forces Shaping New Agendas\. __Several societal forces contributed to a broader and more inclusive Reformation scholarship:

1. The decline of Neo\-Orthodoxy, influenced by thinkers like Moltmann and Pannenberg, alongside new social issues like the Vietnam War and segregation, prompted interest in diplomatic history and liberation\.
2. Catholic interest in ecumenical concerns led to a re\-examination of the church’s theological life in the Late Middle Ages, revealing both failings and vitality that could have prefigured Protestantism\. Scholars like Heiko Oberman focused on rehabilitating the Medieval period\.
3. An interest in the Radical Reformation, especially among Anabaptists \(excluding figures like Müntzer and Münster\), emerged as part of church affirmation and renewal\. Revisionists highlighted the Anabaptists’ heterogeneity and their socio\-political impact\.
4. A broadened geographic perspective shifted focus from Germany to include England, France, Spain, and countries with linguistic hurdles like Poland and Finland\. Sweden experienced minimal turbulence, while France saw significant unrest\. English studies included Dickens’ focus on Lollardy and Duffy’s exploration of loyalty to the old church\.
5. Marxist interpretations viewed the Reformation as an early bourgeois revolution, suggesting that a protocapitalist economy emerged to challenge the feudal order, with figures like Luther providing ideological support\. This interpretation failed due to Reformers siding with feudal authority but spurred popular Reformation studies\.
6. The confessionalization thesis posited that the formation of the early modern state involved monopolizing religion, with monarchs using it to consolidate power\. This macrohistorical perspective devalued the Reformation, emphasizing less religious societal influence in the early century compared to later periods\.

__Thriving Reformation Studies\. __Reformation studies remain vibrant, with secular histories contributing equally alongside theological narratives\. Each offers different questions and answers, focusing more on sociological and political aspects\. Yet, this division highlights two main schools: theological and secular\. __Challenges of Periodization\. __The Reformation is no longer considered a discrete period, with "early modern" being equally vague and lacking consensus, though the Reformation is central within these parameters\. This raises questions about whether the 16th century was truly modern and whether "early modern" is an adequate term for the era\. Each generation perceives itself as modern, yet much of the 16th century retained medieval characteristics, addressing medieval problems within a church\-centered society, as noted by Troeltsch who found little "modern" about the Protestant Reformation\. __Rethinking Reformation Beginnings\. __October 31, 1517, is often overstated as a starting point when the entire 15th century already viewed itself as moving beyond the "dark Ages\." The author argues against viewing Reformations as plural, believing they held much in common\. __Developments in Reformation Studies\. __Two significant developments include studies on women and the exploration of periodization and continuity\. This perspective challenges the 16th century as pivotal, suggesting a more diffuse period\. Protestant scholarship grapples with the challenge of framing the Reformation as a continuation or a point of "newness\." __Author's Perspective and Final Thoughts\. __The author asserts that finding early\-16th\-century ideas in previous eras doesn't clarify the dynamics post\-1517\. Instead, attention to the perceived "newness" by contemporaries is crucial\. The question "Was there a Reformation of the Sixteenth Century?" affirms a perceived radical break and influence on society\. However, establishing it as an age or period requires each perspective to present its grand narrative, potentially revealing if "early modern" is an appropriate term\.
