__The Babylonian Captivity of the Church__

Martin Luther’s “The Babylonian Captivity of the Church” is a polemical work that reevaluates the sacramental life of the church by grounding it in the Word of God\. This significant text serves as Luther’s rebuttal to critical writings against him, specifically the *Revocatio Martini Lutheri Augustiani ad sanctam sedem* by Isidoro Isolani and criticisms from Augustinus Alveld regarding the communion in both kinds \(*utraque*\)\. Written in Latin, Luther intended the treatise for a learned audience who are familiar with Scholastic theology\. The publication had a polarizing effect, galvanizing both his opponents and supporters, marking it as a pivotal work in the Reformation\. The central theme of Luther’s argument is a Scriptural reevaluation of the sacraments\. He challenges the traditional enumeration of seven sacraments, initially proposing only three but later dropping penance as well, ending up with baptism and the Eucharist as truly meeting the criteria\. 

*Communion in Both Kinds*\. This chapter focuses on the debate surrounding how communion should be administered to the laity, specifically whether it should include both \(*utraque*\) bread and wine\. Luther defends *utraque*, although he does not outright condemn receiving communion in one kind but leaves it to the Church’s judgment\. His opponents argue that because Christ described Himself as the “living bread” but not the “living cup,” there is a theological basis for communion in one kind only\. Luther counters this by citing Scripture, particularly 1 Corinthians 11:23–26, to argue that Paul’s practice included permission for both kinds\. Luther’s language in responding to his critics is notably harsh, sarcastic, and outright *ad hominem*: “But we’ll have to give him \[Alveld\] credit: this Leipzig professor of the Bible can prove anything he pleases from any passage of Scripture he pleases\.” Luther evolves his views even within this work\. Whereas he first tolerated communion in one kind, he now takes a more assertive position, arguing that those who deny communion in both kinds to the laity are engaging in wickedness\. A central theme of Luther’s argument is a reevaluation of the sacraments within the Christian faith\. He challenges the traditional enumeration of seven sacraments, initially proposing that only three, but later dropping penance as well, ending up with baptism and the Eucharist \(interestingly referred to as “bread”\) as truly meeting the criteria\. 

*The Lord’s Supper*\. In discussing the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, Luther excludes John 6 \(does not address the sacrament\) from the discussion and focuses on the gospel narratives in Matthew 26, Mark 14, and Luke 22, alongside Paul’s account in 1 Corinthians 11\. These sources highlight the inclusion of “all” in the act of eating and drinking, suggesting that the sacrament was intended for the entire assembly, not just a select few \(i\.e\., the clergy\)\. The discussion posits that if communion in both kinds \(bread and wine\) were solely meant for priests and not for the laity, then logically, other sacraments like baptism and penance would also be exclusively for priests, which is not the case\. Luther argues that the church lacks the authority to alter Christ’s institution of the sacrament in any way and inappropriately denies the cup to the laity\. A critical examination of Paul’s teachings in 1 Corinthians reveals that his directives on communion are commands \(“I delivered to you”\), contrasting with the assertion by some that Paul merely “permitted” the practice to the Corinthians\. Such a contextually limited and particular understanding of Paul questions the universality of Paul’s theology, undermining his apostolic authority\. Luther also appeals to Cyprian and Donatus to strengthen his case for the *utraque*\. 

*The First Captivity: Withholding of the Cup\. *Luther contends that the sacrament rightfully belongs to all people, criticizing the clergy’s withholding of the wine as an act of tyranny\. He emphasizes that the practice goes against Christ’s institution, where Jesus commands all to drink from the cup, illustrating the inclusivity of His covenant\.* The Second Captivity: Transubstantiation *Luther views the doctrine of transubstantiation as less concerning for one’s conscience but critiques the concept for introducing unnecessary philosophical complexity into understanding the Eucharist, advocating instead for a straightforward reading of Christ’s words\. He maintains that while the nature of the bread and wine’s transformation into Christ’s body and blood is a mystery, it should be approached with faith rather than speculative theology\. *The Third Captivity: The Mass as Sacrifice*\. Luther identifies the conceptualization of the Mass as a sacrifice, one performed for both the living and the dead as merchandise, as the gravest distortion, arguing that this transforms the sacrament into a transactional good work rather than an act of faith\. Luther calls for a return to the scriptural essence of the Eucharist as a testament, an act of remembrance of Christ’s sacrifice, focusing on God’s promises rather than human acts\. 

*Baptism*\. Luther emphasizes that baptism is founded on divine *promise*, requiring faith for salvation\. He asserts that faith is necessary and should be reinforced by recalling one’s baptism, especially during moments of penance, much like the Israelites remembered their Exodus\. He explains that baptism operates as an effective *sign* of grace\. The sign of baptism communicates and *signifies* death to sin and rebirth to eternal life and is efficacious for justification only when coupled with faith\. This event is singular and enduring, not necessitating renewal through penance\. He openly criticizes religious vows \(i\.e\., monastic vows\), viewing them as undermining the comprehensive promises made in baptism\. Luther argues these vows are unnecessary and distract from the Christian liberty outlined in baptism\.

*Penance*\. Luther disproves the church’s practice of three tenets of penance: contrition, confession, and satisfaction\. Luther refutes the church’s stance that positions *contrition* as meritorious, surpassing faith\. He argues that genuine contrition stems from faith, not from the ecclesiastical manipulation of guilt \(attrition\) into contrition, thus preserving the essence of faith and deeds\. While recognizing the necessity of *confession* as divinely mandated, Luther condemns the practice of private confession to priests, arguing the sufficiency of confessing sins to fellow believers\. Luther contests the notion that *satisfaction* can be achieved through prescribed works, asserting that true satisfaction arises from a life renewed in faith in Christ\.* Confirmation* is not a sacrament because it is not instituted by Christ and does not have the essential elements of promise and faith\.

*Marriage\. *Luther challenges the Catholic Church’s view of marriage as a sacrament, asserting it has existed from the beginning and lacks a Scriptural basis\. He interprets “sacramentum” in Ephesians 5 as referring to the mystical union between Christ and the Church, not marriage itself\. He critiques the Church’s canonical impediments to marriage, which he sees as superstitions, arguing they contradict divine law\. He acknowledges only a few valid impediments, such as impotence, prior marriage, first degree of affinity, and second degree of consanguinity \(with the exceptions of cousins\)\. Luther also discusses impotence, suggesting that an impotent husband should allow his wife to remarry or bear children with another man, advocating for the wife’s freedom to leave in such cases\. On divorce, Luther states he detests it but acknowledges it’s permitted in the case of infidelity or abandonment, allowing for remarriage under these circumstances\.

*Ordination*\. Luther contends that ordination, as practiced by the Catholic Church, is a human invention without a biblical basis\. He asserts the Church cannot instate sacraments because it is founded on God’s promises, not its own\. He references the historical attribution of the seven sacraments to Peter Lombard and criticizes the reliance on authorities like Dionysius, who he views as more aligned with Platonic philosophy than Christian doctrine\. Moreover, ordination lacks a sign, effective promise, and the requirement of faith\.

*Extreme Unction\. *He criticizes the Catholic Church’s designation of extreme unction as a sacrament in his examination, arguing that the biblical reference in James 5:14\-15 does not support its sacramental status or its framing as the last rite for the dying\. The apostles lacked the authority to institute sacraments, undermining the church’s claim to extreme unction as such\. Additionally, Luther points out that the sacrament lacks an effective promise, noting that not all who receive it are healed\. He considers viewing prayer, the Word, and the cross as sacraments but notices that these lack signs\. He concludes: “Thus we may apportion these two sacraments as follows: baptism may be allotted to the beginning and the entire course of life, while the bread belongs to the end and to death\.”

In *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church*, Luther employs a critical and polemical method, rigorously analyzing sacramental practices through the lens of Scripture to challenge the Catholic Church’s teachings and authority\. He contributes a foundational reevaluation of the sacraments, focusing particularly on the Eucharist, baptism, and penance and proposing clear Biblical criteria for what constitutes a sacrament: institution by Christ, scriptural, involving a sign, something signified, a promise, and the requirement and efficacy of faith\. By questioning the Roman sacramental system and authority, this work set the stage for Luther’s later excommunication\. Lastly, Luther refers to the Eucharist as “bread,” which is interesting in light of the *utraque* discussion\.
