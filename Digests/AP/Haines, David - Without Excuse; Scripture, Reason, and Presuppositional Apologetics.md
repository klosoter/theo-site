__Without Excuse: Scripture, Reason, and Presuppositional Apologetics – Edited by David Haines__

__Preface – Joseph Minich\.__

Without Excuse: Scripture, Reason, and Presuppositional Apologetics critiques the philosophy of Cornelius Van Til and his followers, though it acknowledges his significant influence\.

__1\. The Bible, Verification, and First Principles of Reason – M\. Dan Kemp\.  __

__Van Til's Claim on Scripture\.__ Dan Kemp examines Van Til's assertion that Christian Scriptures are the foundation for all knowledge, arguing that attempts to verify the Christian Scriptures are not epistemologically productive because such efforts are inherently circular\. __Understanding First Principles\.__ Kemp explains that first principles, which cannot be explained by other principles, are self\-evident and that multiple first principles exist, such as reason and Scripture\. Consequently, an ultimate principle like Scripture cannot serve as a solitary basis because first principles cannot override one another\. Kemp suggests that reason must not rely on a single first principle of knowledge\. __Circularity in Presuppositionalism\.__ Van Tillians accept circularity, claiming that Scripture is the first principle of all knowledge, which precludes presenting arguments for the Bible as God's revelation\. Kemp argues that the Bible presupposes more than one basic principle of knowledge, namely revelation and reason\. __Verification Principles in Scripture\.__ He refers to verification principles found in Exodus 4 and Deuteronomy 18, suggesting that the Bible allows for arguments for divine revelation\. Kemp highlights biblical examples that challenge the notion of Scripture as the sole principle of knowledge: \(1\) miracles performed by Moses to demonstrate his divine authority to Pharaoh and \(2\) the verification principle of prophecy\. __Conclusion on Knowledge\.__ Kemp questions whether these authentication principles presume their conclusions and whether the Bible presupposes a single principle of knowledge or multiple ones\. He concludes that if all human knowledge were circular, true knowledge would be impossible\.

__2\. Faith and the Natural Light of Reason How Van Tillian Anthropology Fails – Kurt Jaros\.  __

__Differences in Doctrine of Man\.__ Kurt Jaros argues that there are fundamental differences between presuppositionalism and the traditional Reformed approach concerning the doctrine of man, focusing on the doctrine of inability\. According to Van Til, man's rebellion is an ethical issue rather than an intellectual one\. Common grace restrains this antithesis, and there is no epistemological common ground between believer and unbeliever\. Van Til aligns with Kuyper, who views natural reason as incapable, against Warfield, who suggests there is neutral territory\. __Contradictions in Van Til's Thought\.__ Jaros identifies a contradiction in Van Til's argument, as he claims that all men simultaneously know God and do not know God\. Jaros questions if the suppression of truth is incomplete, suggesting there might still be an epistemological common ground\. __Metaphysical vs\. Epistemological Claims\.__ Jaros explores whether Van Til’s assertion that the unregenerate are incapable of reasoning about the things of God is a metaphysical claim rather than an epistemological one\. He inquires if natural man's rejection of his status as an image\-bearer of God means he cannot use those God\-given functions to reason\. 

__3\. The Place of Autonomous Human Reason and Logic in Theology – John M DePoe\. __

__Understanding Human Reason\.__ John M DePoe discusses autonomous human reason, which classical apologists affirm and presuppositionalists reject, arguing that allowing human reason to evaluate evidence places man’s reason above God and his Word\. __Defense of Autonomy in Reason\.__ DePoe presents three points defending autonomous human reason in the evidentialist sense: \(1\) the Bible often invites human discernment in understanding God and his Word, referencing Exodus 4 and Deuteronomy 18, \(2\) rejecting autonomous human reason is self\-contradictory, as rejecting human autonomy itself is an act of human autonomy, and \(3\) autonomous human reason, although with practical limits, has played a significant role in apologetics and conversion\. 

__4\. The Structure of Knowledge in Classical Reformed Theology Turretin and Hodge – Nathan Greeley\.  __

__Aquinas and Reformed Theology\.__ Nathan Greeley addresses Oliphint's contention that Aquinas’ thought is incompatible with Reformed theology due to his view on the relationship between philosophy \(natural knowledge\) and theology \(revealed knowledge\)\. Greeley utilizes Turretin and Hodge to illustrate that Reformed theologians do not oppose Aquinas’ perspective\. __Turretin's Perspective\.__ Aquinas distinguishes between knowledge acquired through natural reason and through special revelation, with the former preceding the latter, including knowledge about God\. For Oliphint, this view neglects the noetic effects of total depravity, where all true knowledge depends on divine testimony\. Greeley shows that Turretin asserts that ‘faith knowledge’ presupposes ‘natural knowledge\.’ Natural theology is capable of demonstrating “that there is a God” and “that he must be worshipped\.” __Hodge's Agreement\.__ Hodge, in alignment with Scottish common\-sense realism, posits that some propositions are self\-evidently true to the natural man and emphasizes using these propositions inductively concerning facts communicated in Holy Scripture\. He believes special revelation cannot contradict these principles since both share a common source in God\. Hodge affirms natural knowledge and its precedence over revelational knowledge, limiting the effects of sin to knowledge inseparable from salvation\. __Concluding Observations\.__ Greeley concludes that both Hodge and Turretin agree with Aquinas that natural theology is possible for non\-Christians and that nature holds “a certain logical, metaphysical, and epistemological priority to grace\.”

__5\. Moderate Realism and the Presuppositionalist Confusion of Metaphysics and Epistemology – J T Bridges\.__

__Systematic Realist Theology\.__ Bridges defends 'systematic realist theology' based on 'existential Thomism,' although it is unclear how this connects to apologetics or presuppositional apologetics\. He seems to critique Oliphint’s analysis of Aquinas from Oliphint's book Aquinas but fails to directly cite him\. The purpose of this chapter in the book's broader theme remains unclear\.

__6\. Presuppositions in Presuppositionalism and Classical Theism – Winfried Corduan\.  __

__Logical Principles Shared by All\.__ Winfried Corduan argues that there are five logical principles everyone intuitively knows: identity, excluded middle, contradiction, modus ponens, and set transitivity\. These principles are common to both Christians and non\-Christians and facilitate rational conversations between them\. Although the logic is the same, the content may be understood differently\. __Methodological Approaches in Apologetics\.__ Van Til objects to the block\-house methodology that builds on a foundation layer by layer\. Corduan contends that the gospel is an all\-or\-none commitment, unlike classical apologetics, which may proceed in stages\. He references Quine's rejection of logical positivism's idea that sentences gain meaning solely through empirical verifiability, noting that meaning lies within the entire system\. For Van Til, this system is based on God’s revelation\. Corduan outlines three reactions to differing worldviews: dismissing, compromising, or being convinced\. __Framework for Understanding\.__ Corduan acknowledges that believers and non\-believers share nothing in common and that the latter require divine grace to understand Biblical truth\. Although he supports classical apologetics, Corduan sometimes approaches presuppositional reasoning, such as arguing that the cosmological argument is also a transcendental argument by stating, "Unless there is a God, there cannot be a world" \(p 151\)\.

__7\. Presuppositionalism and Philosophy in the Academy – Thomas Schultz\.__

__Van Til's Philosophical Connections\.__ Thomas Schultz aims to show that Van Til’s presuppositional apologetics is related to various philosophical systems despite some within presuppositionalism claiming its biblical and theological origins\. He identifies three types of influences: direct connection, *indirect connection*, and parallel thinking\. __Influences on Van Til and Frame\.__ Schultz suggests that Van Til was unaware of influences from modern philosophical thinkers such as Kant, Hume, Wittgenstein, James, and Kierkegaard, which similarly affected John Frame, a pupil of Van Til\. Schultz posits that Van Til should have openly acknowledged these philosophical influences instead of asserting his system is "primarily and solely biblical and Reformed in its origin" \(181\)\. Furthermore, Schultz argues that Van Til’s reliance on Kant could be used to challenge his apologetic stance\.

__8\. The Use of Aristotle in Early Protestant Theology – Manfred Svensson\.__

__Aristotle's Influence on Early Protestants\.__ Manfred Svensson seeks to demonstrate that early Protestant theology incorporated Aristotle's ideas, contrasting this with Van Til’s view of Aristotle\. Van Til portrays Aristotle as a philosopher who assumes human autonomy\. Svensson argues that Van Til engages with Aristotle primarily through the lens of Thomas Aquinas\. He notes that Luther was an exception in early Protestantism as an "anti\-Aristotelian," whereas his pupil Melanchthon taught Aristotle, an approach Luther seemingly tolerated\. Between 1550 and 1660, Aristotle's tradition was purportedly stronger among Protestants than Catholics, characterizing its reception as critical\. However, Svensson does not clearly connect his argument to Van Til or presuppositionalism\.

__9\. The Use of Aquinas in Early Protestant Theology – David Haines\.__

__Aquinas and Protestant Thought\.__ David Haines questions the origins of a "sudden" Protestant interest in Thomas Aquinas, countering the views of Oliphint and Schaeffer by asserting that Protestants share much in common with Aquinas\. Protestant scholars such as Arvin Vos, Sproul, Geisler, Gerstner, and Nash have interpreted Aquinas positively\. Haines argues that Luther rejected Thomas primarily due to his association with Aristotle, not because of Aquinas’s theology itself\. The reformers were generally realists who accepted the objectivity of the created universe as a source of knowledge, agreeing on natural theology and natural law\. Early Protestant theologians are described as "quite Thomistic" in their attitude toward Scripture and patristic writings and in their exposition of the divine attributes\. For both Aquinas and early Protestant theologians like Bullinger, Jewell, and Beza, Scripture and the Fathers inform theological truths, with Scripture holding priority\. Haines asserts that this opens the possibility for "Reformed Thomism\."

__10\. Classical Theism and Natural Theology in Early Reformed Doctrines of God – Andrew Payne\.  __

__Calvin and Classical Theism\.__ Andrew Payne aims to demonstrate that early Reformation theologians largely adhered to a classical theist paradigm\. He examines Calvin's relationship to Aquinas concerning the doctrines of God and providence\. For Aquinas, natural theology is integral to Christian theology—a case of 'faith seeking understanding,' where God's existence is self\-evident and revealed through nature\. Payne highlights similarities between Aquinas’s and Calvin’s doctrines, particularly their views on double predestination with God as the ultimate cause\. Influenced by humanism and scholasticism, Calvin’s technical vocabulary amalgamates Aristotelian and Augustinian categories\. According to Payne, Calvin believed knowledge of God and man could not be separated, often interpreted epistemologically but intended soteriologically\. Calvin’s soteriological perspective frames theological knowledge without encompassing philosophical or natural knowledge\. Payne concludes that there is harmony between classical theism and the Calvinist paradigm\.

__11\. Van Til’s Transcendental Argument and Its Antecedents – John R\. Gilhooly\.  __

__Exploring Transcendental Argument Origins\.__ John R\. Gilhooly examines how Van Til’s transcendental argument draws from traditional transcendental accounts, specifically those of Aristotle and Kant\. He concludes that Van Til’s argument for Christian theism shares structural similarities with these predecessors but stands out for its radical assertion: without presupposing God's existence, rational intelligibility is impossible\. Gilhooly notes that if Van Til’s argument is deductive, it begs the question, but if considered abductive, it is reduced to the realm of probability\. __Common Ground Controversy\.__ Gilhooly highlights a key difference between Kant and Van Til, noting that Van Til denies the existence of neutral common ground\. This is particularly striking since Van Til believes in a shared basis through concepts like sensus divinitatis and imago Dei but rejects autonomous reason as neutral ground\.

__12\. A Tale of Two Theories: Natural Law in Classical Theism and Presuppositionalism – Bernard James Mauser\.__

__Examining Natural Law in Theology\.__ Bernard James Mauser delves into the history of natural law within theology and responds to its critique by presuppositional apologist John Frame\. He asserts that both Roman Catholic and Reformed theologians from the 1500s to the 1800s embraced natural law, which intertwines moral theory with teleological and ontological elements, linking essence and obligation\. __Addressing Criticisms of Natural Law\.__ Mauser refutes three main arguments against natural law\. First, he asserts that despite cultural diversity, cardinal virtues remain universal\. Second, he argues against Hume’s critique of circular reasoning from 'is' to 'ought,' stating it doesn't invalidate natural law\. Third, he engages with John Frame’s criticisms, although the connection to presuppositional apologetics and Van Til is unclear\.

__13\. Van Til’s Trinitarianism: A Reformed Critique – Travis James Campbell\.__

__Critiquing Van Til’s Trinitarianism\.__ Campbell critiques Van Til’s approach to the Trinity, suggesting it diverges from the Reformed tradition exemplified by figures like Augustine, Aquinas, Hodge, and Bavinck, who emphasized divine simplicity, eternality, and impassibility\. Campbell points out that Van Til appears to distinguish the divine essence within the Trinity, potentially violating divine simplicity\. __Concerns Over Tritheism and Logic\.__ Campbell criticizes Van Til for "veering towards Tritheism" by describing God as “tri\-consciousness” or "three centers of self\-awareness\." He challenges Van Til’s and Oliphint's view that logic is created, arguing this undermines logic’s foundational role in explaining reality and understanding the Trinity's mystery\. Campbell asserts that Reformed theologians embraced the mystery of the Trinity without sacrificing reason\. __Conclusion on Reason and Theology\.__ Campbell charges Van Til’s trinitarian theology with formal contradiction and creating an antithesis between the noumenal and phenomenal, akin to Kantian agnosticism\. This critique highlights concerns about Van Til's approach to reason and logic in trinitarian theology\.
