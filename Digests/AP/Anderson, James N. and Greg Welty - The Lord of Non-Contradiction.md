__The Lord of Non\-Contradiction – James N\. Anderson and Greg Welty__

__1\. The Laws of Logic are Truths\.__

__Propositions as Truth\-Bearers\.__ The laws of logic are propositions that serve as bearers of truth\. They are independent of language and universally acknowledged as existing, though there is debate over which particular laws are included\.

__2\. The Laws of Logic are Truths about Truths\.__

__Meta\-propositional Nature\.__ These laws are propositions about other propositions, essentially making them truths about truths \(and falsehoods\)\.

__3\. The Laws of Logic are Necessary Truths\.__

__Self\-Evident Universality\.__ The laws hold true in every possible world, with necessity and non\-contradiction intertwined\. Their truth is considered self\-evident\.

__4\. The Laws of Logic Really Exist\.__

Four Supporting Arguments:

1. Ordinary Language: The claim 'there are laws of logic' implies their existence\.
2. Ontological Intuitions: Laws of logic affect our lives, suggesting their existence\.
3. Existential Presuppositions: Verbs referencing propositions \(e\.g\., 'You hope that\.\.\.'\) indicate propositions exist, especially those of logical laws\.
4. Ontological Preconditions: Propositions are entities bearing truth, thus existing\.

__5\. The Laws of Logic Necessarily Exist\.__

__Universal True Existence\.__ These necessary truths are valid across all possible worlds, meaning they exist universally\.

__6\. The Laws of Logic are Non\-Physical__

__Beyond Physical Limitation\.__ Necessary truths cannot be physical, as physical entities are contingent by nature\.

__7\. The Laws of Logic are Thoughts\.__

__Intentionality of Logic\.__ Logic laws possess intentionality, meaning they are about something or directed toward goals\. This aspect, intrinsic to propositions, marks them as mental, requiring a mind\. Thoughts are the primary example of intentional entities\.

__8\. The Laws of Logic are Divine Thoughts\.__

__Attributing to the Divine Mind\.__ Given their necessary, non\-physical nature, these laws cannot reside in a human mind\. They align with divine thoughts, which "everyone understands to be God," grounding logic in a divine foundation\.
