__A Survey of Christian Epistemology – Cornelius Van Til__

__Introduction\.__

Understanding the relationship between the facts of the space\-time world and its governing laws is only possible when beginning with the self\-identifying Christ of Reformation theology\. This foundational belief guides the exploration of Christian epistemology\. The book's structure serves both as a syllabus and a defense\. As readers progress through the survey, they simultaneously engage in the defense of Christian epistemological principles\. The epistemology discussed is distinctively Christian and exclusive in its claims\. Additionally, the text delves into metaphysics, presenting a comprehensive theory of reality centered on God\.

__Chapter 1: Epistemological Terminology\.__ The chapter explores key epistemological terms such as revelation, analysis and synthesis, correspondence, coherence, objectivity, method, knowledge, implication, deduction and induction, and the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge\. The concept of the transcendental argument is introduced, which combines both induction and deduction in a Christian sense\. This type of argument investigates the presuppositions underlying any fact of experience to understand its nature\.

__Chapter 2: Historical Survey: A\. Greek Epistemology: Its Starting Point\.__ Van Til highlights that neutrality is impossible from a theistic perspective and that evil is not merely associated with the finite in Greek thought\.

__Chapter 3: Historical Survey: B\. Greek Epistemology: Its Climax\.__ This chapter discusses the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, focusing on the materialistic and intellectualistic trends of Plato's predecessors\. A relativistic epistemology becomes abstract, contrasting with the concrete transcendental approach of Christian theism\. Plato's ideas that all things originate from oneness and the fact of change are explored\.

__Chapter 4: Historical Survey: C\. Mediaeval Epistemology: Its Starting Point\.__ Augustine's thoughts represent an antithesis to Plato, with the Trinity offering a solution to unity and diversity issues, enabling analogical knowledge\.

__Chapter 5: Historical Survey: D\. Mediaeval Epistemology: Its Climax\.__ Scholasticism, heavily influenced by Aristotle, still does not fully comprehend the Trinity\. It acknowledges the necessity of the grace of God for knowledge of higher things while also holding that men can know certain things without redemptive revelation\.

__Chapter 6: Historical Survey: E\. Modern Epistemology: Lutheranism\.__ Luther's theology is examined, advancing beyond Scholasticism but still suggesting that there are matters that pertain to the welfare of man without affecting the position of God\.

__Chapter 7: Historical Survey: F\. Modern Epistemology: Arminianism\.__ The Arminian view is characterized by a doctrine of freedom which tones down the doctrine of sin, suggesting acts independent of God's plan\.

__Chapter 8: Historical Survey: G\. Modern Epistemology: Calvinism\.__ Calvinism restores the biblical understanding of the sinner, the doctrine of man, the Trinity, and a complete self\-conscious God, providing the only solid foundation for thinking and knowledge\.

__Chapter 9: Historical Survey: H\. Modern Epistemology: Antitheistic\.__ The chapter examines thinkers like Descartes, Kant, Hume, and Spinoza, noting that Hume and Spinoza's reasoning is univocal, lacking the analogical reasoning found in Christian theism\.

__Chapter 10: The Starting Point of Christian Theistic Epistemology: A\. The Object of Knowledge\.__ The question of whether we can have true knowledge of any fact is addressed, emphasizing that facts are inseparable from God and cannot be established without reference to Him\. Without the light of Scripture, no fact can be truly known, and laws in nature and history are meaningless without presupposing God\.

__Chapter 11: The Starting Point of Christian Theistic Epistemology: B\. The Subject of Knowledge: Extreme Antitheism\.__ Bosanquet's views are critiqued, arguing that man is not an absolutely derived being and does not recognize God as the highest interpretative category, reducing God to merely an aspect of the universe\.

__Chapter 12: The Starting Point of Christian Theistic Epistemology: C\. The Subject of Knowledge: Milder Antitheism\.__ This perspective argues there is no reality higher than temporal reality, interpreting reality exclusively through temporal categories\.

__Chapter 13: The Starting Point of Christian Theistic Epistemology: D\. The Subject of Knowledge: Idealism and Christianity\.__ Bowne's philosophy is critiqued for allowing moral consciousness to function apart from God, which leads to a rejection of biblical authority, with the sinner becoming the judge of holy things\.

__Chapter 14: The Starting Point of Christian Theistic Epistemology: D\. The Subject of Knowledge: Subject\-Subject Relation\. __The existence of knowledge subjects depends on God, and without Scripture and spiritual regeneration, true interpretation is impossible\. For theism, God is the source of the probable, while antitheism views the probable as the source of God, highlighting man can never be metaphysically alienated from God\.

__Chapter 15: The Method of Christian Theistic Epistemology\.__ Criticisms of circular reasoning in Christian epistemology are accepted, asserting that all other reasoning forms end in ruin\. The *a priori* charge against Christian epistemology is countered as it also applies to methods excluding God\. The goal is to reduce opponents’ positions to absurdity\.

__Chapter 16: A Sample of Christian Theistic Argument\. __Apologetic methods must be contextually applied, focusing on exposing errors in autonomous reasoning\. The Christian theistic position is presented as the only system that maintains meaning and coherence in human experience\.
