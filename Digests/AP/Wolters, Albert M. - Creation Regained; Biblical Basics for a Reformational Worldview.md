__Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview – Albert M\. Wolters__

__1\. What Is a Worldview?__

A worldview is a comprehensive framework that encompasses one's basic, ultimate beliefs about anything\. It serves as an all\-encompassing system that shapes how we perceive and interact with the world\.

__2\. Creation\.__

__The Law of Creation\. __God's creation is governed by general and particular laws, reflecting the totality of His sovereign activity across the cosmos\. __The Word of God in Creation\. __Christ is central to the process of creation, embodying God's creative word\. __The Scope of Creation\. __God's ordinances influence all aspects of reality, including science and society, providing guidance and a sense of calling to creation\. __The Development of Creation\. __Creation is ongoing, guided by the creation mandate but affected by the Fall\. Human culture is to be transformed and liberated from the curse\. __The Goodness of Creation\. __Despite the Fall, creation remains inherently good\.

__3\. Fall\.__

__The Scope of the Fall\. __The Fall had catastrophic consequences for all of creation\. __The Relation of Sin and Creation\. __Sin and creation remain distinct; Calvin emphasized the distinction between the order of creation and the order of sin and redemption\. Sin distorts the good but does not erase its recognizability\. __Structure and Direction\. __Structure is rooted in creation, while direction pertains to living according to God's design\. Common grace acts as a restraint against the full consequences of sin\. __"World" as Perverted Creation\. __The world represents unredeemed life\. Caution is advised against adopting a sacred\-secular dualism that separates the divine from worldly existence\.

__4\. Redemption\.__

__Salvation as Restoration\. __Redemption is about restoring creation, not creating something entirely new\. It focuses on salvaging and renewing the world God originally intended\. __Jesus' Ministry and the Kingdom of God\. __Jesus preached and demonstrated the Kingdom of God, emphasizing restoration over repristination\. This approach does not aim to reset the world to a pre\-Fall state but acknowledges and incorporates the development that has occurred\. __Other Views of the Kingdom\.__

- Dispensationalism views the Kingdom as purely eschatological\.
- The social Gospel emphasizes humane and progressive change\.
- The two\-kingdom theory separates spiritual and temporal realms\.

__5\. Discerning Structure and Direction\.__

The practical implications of this worldview affect Christians' societal, personal, and cultural lives\. __Reformation\. __Reformation is about sanctification and internal renewal, promoting progressive renewal rather than revolution\. __Societal Renewal\. __God has established a structured order for society, where each sphere operates according to its kind, emphasizing sphere sovereignty, as explained by Dooyeweerd\. __Personal Renewal\. __Personal renewal involves the sanctification of qualities like aggression and the use of spiritual gifts\. In matters like sexuality, there are two incorrect approaches: treating it as a taboo or as a means for self\-fulfillment\. The solution is to affirm its proper meaning while opposing perversions\. In cultural practices like dance, which may be seen as worldly amusement, the focus should be on how best to reform and sanctify these areas within a Christian context\.
