__Frame’s Method and Approach to Van Til\.__ John Frame analyzes Cornelius Van Til's thought through a "piecemeal" method, assessing individual elements rather than tackling his entire system at once\. Frame finds this approach beneficial for students, although he acknowledges that Van Til's system is deeply interconnected, echoing the equal ultimacy of the one and many in his understanding of the Trinity\. Frame ultimately upholds that the most critical aspects of Van Til’s system are biblical and should remain foundational in future apologetics, though some formulations may confuse and lack direct biblical warrant\. __Critique of the Theonomic Movement and Personal Isolation\.__ Frame criticizes the theonomic movement and its writings, which he views as a "mixed blessing" that misapplies Reformation foundations to Christian life\. He also critiques Van Til's personal isolation, noting that Van Til often remained outside mainstream theological debates, which may reflect more about Frame's perspective than about Van Til’s intentions\. Frame suggests that Van Til's "isolation" could be seen as synonymous with his commitment to the "antithesis" concept\. __Role of the Antithesis and Theological Distinctions\.__ Frame discusses the concept of antithesis in Van Til's work, suggesting that it may align more with Machen than Kuyper, although this attribution may serve to depict Van Til as Machen’s "consolidator\." Frame also notes Van Til's incorporation of Kantian epistemological principles into apologetics, enriching his theological framework\. __Trinitarian Theology and the Problem of the One\-and\-Many\.__ Frame highlights Van Til's emphasis on the Trinity as the solution to the philosophical problem of the one\-and\-many, where unity and diversity coexist harmoniously\. He stresses that only a personal and sovereign God can be absolute, a perspective demanding acknowledgment that the divine essence is personal and not abstract\. __Analogy and Epistemology\.__ Frame explores Van Til’s rejection of the analogy of being in theological terms while maintaining its significance in epistemology\. He contends that Van Til views analogy as applying to the whole process of human thought rather than to individual terms\. __The Clark Controversy and Epistemological Concerns\.__ Frame delves into the Clark controversy, noting Clark's misapplication of divine simplicity to God's thought\. He raises concerns regarding Van Til's discussions about the "identity of content" between Divine and human minds, and discusses the nuances between natural theology and natural revelation\. __Sovereignty, Scripture, and Presuppositions\.__ Van Til's unique perspective suggests that distinguishing Scripture as the Word of God relies on divine sovereignty over history\. Frame critiques his portrayal of presuppositions as a form of a priori thinking, arguing that they transcend such principles\. __Role of Logic and Evidence\.__ Frame critiques Van Til for potentially prioritizing intellect in apologetic methodology and discusses the role of logic as defined by Scripture versus that of unbelievers and evangelicals\. He notes that Van Til believed evidence in apologetics must be theologically grounded rather than merely probable, emphasizing a need for an absolutely compelling Christian faith\. __Common Grace and Antithesis\.__ Finally, Frame discusses Van Til's perspective on common grace as a limiting concept relative to the antithesis, reflecting the complex interplay between divine assistance and human opposition in understanding and defending the Christian faith\.
