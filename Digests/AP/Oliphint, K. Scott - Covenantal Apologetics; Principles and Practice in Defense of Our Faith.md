__Covenantal Apologetics: Principles and Practice in Defense of Our Faith – K\. Scott Oliphint__

__Introduction\.__

Covenantal apologetics builds on Cornelius Van Til's thought, focusing on more theological and biblical explication since Van Til assumed familiarity with certain concepts\. The shift from presuppositional to covenantal terminology clarifies how the Holy Spirit operates in our lives and apologetics, demonstrating specific arguments and identifying problem areas\. The practice of covenantal apologetics involves ten principles\. Biblical and theological principles should precede practical application and demonstration, recognizing that every objection may necessitate a different approach\.

__1\. Always Ready\.__

__Christian Truth\.__ The Trinity, Creation, Fall, and Redemption form core tenets, with an emphasis on the covenant\. All individuals are partly defined by their relationship with a covenant head: Adam by nature and Christ by grace\. __Required to Respond__\. Based on 1 Peter 3, trials and suffering are evidence of Christ's Lordship, with His authority providing perspective\. Truth is not relative, and our defense must align with the reality expressed by God, not dictated by our opponents\. __What Is Covenantal Apologetics__? Apologetics is a biblical concept that must have a Christian and theological foundation\. The term "covenantal" clarifies misconceptions about presuppositionalism, highlighting the ontological distinction between God and creation\. Despite the Fall, humanity remains in a covenant relationship with God, characterized by inherent knowledge and responsibility, although often suppressed in unbelief\. __Ten Tenets__\.

1. The faith that we are defending must begin with, and necessarily include, the triune God \- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit \- who, as God, condescends to create and redeem\.
2. God's covenantal revelation is authoritative by virtue of what it is, and any covenantal, Christian apologetic will necessarily stand on and utilize that authority in order to defend Christianity\.
	1. Covenantal: initiation of a relationship\.
	2. Covenantal: obligations\.
3. It is the truth of God's revelation, together with the work of the Holy Spirit, that brings about a covenantal change from one who is in Adam to one who is in Christ\.
4. Man \(male and female\), as the image of God, is in covenant with the triune God for eternity\.
5. All people know the true God, and that knowledge entails covenantal obligations\.
6. Those who are and remain in Adam suppress the truth that they know\. Those who are in Christ see the truth for what it is\.
7. There is an absolute, covenantal antithesis between Christian theism and any other opposing position\. Thus, Christianity is true, and anything opposing it is false\.
8. Suppression of the truth, like the depravity of sin, is total but not absolute\. Thus, every unbelieving position will necessarily have within it ideas, concepts, notions, and the like that it has taken and wrenched from its true Christian context\.
9. The true, covenantal knowledge of God in man, together with God's universal mercy, allows for persuasion in apologetics\.
10. Every fact and experience is what it is by virtue of the covenantal, all\-controlling plan and purpose of God\.

__2\. Set Christ Apart as Lord\. __

Christ's lordship is confirmed by the Father as both a reward and outcome of his obedience\. 

__I Am\. “__I am” refers to Yahweh, who is entirely independent, as illustrated by the burning bush and self\-revelation to creation as the God of Moses's fathers and the covenant God\. This includes the role of the Lord or Angel of the Lord, identifying the second person of the Trinity\. God's condescension is twofold: cosmic, revealing God universally, and redemptive, focusing on the Son since Genesis 3\. Jesus is equated with God, the Word, and the Angel of the Lord, encompassing cosmic lordship as a sovereign ruler from the beginning and redemptive lordship through his completed work of deliverance, where he is highly exalted by God\. 

__Condescension and Apologetics\.__ Immanuel Kant's philosophy highlights the significance of covenant condescension within apologetics\. Kant argued that rationalism failed and empiricism led to skepticism, proposing critical philosophy as a remedy\. According to him, much of our knowledge transcends experience, requiring mental categories to comprehend experiences\. However, certain concepts like God, the soul, and "Dinge an Sich" elude these categories\. While reason generates these higher concepts, they are considered mere beliefs rather than knowledge, with no category for grasping the Christian reality of God's covenantal condescension\. Kant's separation of faith from knowledge implies that God is unknowable and merely conceptual, as, according to him, God did not reveal himself\.

__He Who Is Not with Me\.__ Richard Dawkins represents an example of how ad hominem arguments, often considered fallacious, can serve to highlight flaws in an opponent's system, as demonstrated in critiques of skeptics' worldviews lacking laws or facts, thereby revealing hypocrisy\. This is termed the "Quicksand Quotient," showing that positions opposed to Christianity cannot stand on their principles and that Christianity alone is capable of withstanding scrutiny\.

__Quicksand Quotient Turned Against Christianity\.__ This is also aimed at Christianity through philosopher Anthony Kenny's argument\. Kenny challenges the concept of a perfect being, suggesting that a being must be subject to change to know the time, leading to the conclusion that such a being cannot be perfect\. His argument is as follows: 

1. A perfect being is not subject to change, 
2. A perfect being knows everything, 
3. A being that knows everything always knows what time it is, 
4. A being that always knows what time it is is subject to change, 
5. A perfect being is therefore subject to change, 
6. A perfect being is therefore not a perfect being, 
7. Ergo, there is no perfect being\. 

Responses to this critique involve qualifications of the perfect being, highlighting that Kenny argues against Aquinas's God constructed through reason rather than revelation\. The revealed Trinity posits that the Son assumed human characteristics without compromising divine essence, enabling covenantal interaction\. Examples from Dawkins and Kenny serve to illustrate how covenantal apologetics can address other positions on their terms, revealing their fallacies\.

__3\. Proof to All Men\. __

__Paul at Athens\. __In Athens, Paul encountered idolatry which he interpreted as suppression of truth\. He tailored his message to Greek listeners, who were provoked by Jesus' resurrection\. Utilizing covenantal language, Paul spoke of God's creation, his appointing of boundaries for all men, and his independence coupled with exhaustive presence\. Paul asserted that Jesus was proved by being raised from the dead\. __Where Shall I Flee?__ Since Adam hid from God, humanity has sought to do the same\. Despite this, God is sovereign, deserving praise for his nature\. Humans deceive themselves in an attempt to hide, as stated in tenet 7\. __Truths to Men Without a Bible\.__ Humans possess an inescapable image of God, making them responsible creatures under him, represented by either Adam or Christ\. This image is like a mirror, dependent on its original for existence\. The lordship over creation is a reflection of God's lordship, characterized by providence, common grace, and promise, without equality or equal partnership\. Humans are lords under God, bound to both creation and Creator, made of dust with God's breath, but not as equals\. God's revelation is unhindered by barriers or opposition, manifesting through the sensus divinitatis\. This sensus, inherent in God's image, is the revelation implanted by God himself, providing universal and infallible knowledge of him\. __Proving the Proofs\.__ The use of syllogism involves two premises leading to one conclusion, where the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion\. Proofs can be empirical or non\-empirical in nature\. __What a Burden\.__ The burden of proof, or *onus probandi*, is often relative to common sense\. One should not fear having this burden thrust upon them but instead use it as an opportunity to explain the Triune God\. Some proofs function more as tools of persuasion than outright demonstration\. __How Do You Know?__ In the debate between humanists and Christians, particularly regarding the ontological argument, figures like W\. K\. Clifford assert that it is wrong to believe anything without sufficient evidence\. Aquinas encourages providing sufficient evidence, though challenges exist with the evidential approach described in tenets 5, 6, and 10, which point to humankind as the core issue\. There is no common ground, metaphorically described as quicksand, for these opposing perspectives\.

__4\. We Persuade Others\. __

__"Trivial" Matters\. __The Trivium, consisting of grammar, dialectic \(logic\), and rhetoric \(speaking, oratory\), forms the basis of persuasion in theology\. The theology of persuasion emphasizes that focus should not dwell solely on proofs due to tenet 2, which argues against infinite evidential propositions\. Instead, Scripture should serve as the foundation for all reasoning, as it was during the Reformation\. During the Middle Ages, insufficient attention was given to sin, whereas the Reformation highlighted the power and necessity of Scripture in light of sin and suppression\. Therefore, Scripture acts as the first theological foundation and *sensus divinitatis* as the second, creating a point of contact\. Common grace reflects God's dual response: wrath toward sin and mercy due to grace, as represented in Romans 2:4\. This explains the restraint of sin in individuals and society\. Unregenerate individuals can still participate in religious good, receiving Spirit's gifts externally and the Fruit of the Spirit internally\. __The "Trivium" of Persuasion\.__ Persuasion operates through reason emphasizing demonstrative proofs and empiricism highlighting evidences for Christianity and theism\. Persuasion involves three modes: ethos \(credibility\), pathos \(emotion\), and logos \(logical argument\)\. __Ethos\.__ Ethos revolves around credibility and character, measured against Scripture\. Peter reminds us to argue with gentleness and respect, recognizing Christ as Lord\. Paul's experience in Athens, where he was labeled a "babbler," illustrates the challenges of maintaining credibility while deflecting criticism of his teaching\. __Pathos\.__ Pathos involves understanding the opponent and audience to persuade them toward a particular stance\. Two aspects are central: *suppression*, where Paul used Greek poets to establish points of contact but did not endorse their errors while creating new meaning, and *sensus divinitatis*, where God has already framed the audience\. Paul noted their religiosity as common ground, which holds covenant connotations of obligation and "ought," demonstrating God's revealed and comprehensible nature\. __Logos\.__ Logos pertains to the message and actual arguments, where Scripture holds principle status and is beyond proof\. Aristotle's term *pistis* refers to rhetorical proofs, connecting to faith as a commitment\. __Conclusion\.__ The Holy Spirit is ultimately the chief persuader in any apologetic discourse\. While ethos and logos remain unchanged, pathos requires applying wisdom to the diverse ways, truths, and answers that arise in each encounter\.

__5\. We Destroy Arguments: The Achilles' Heel\. __

__The Good Fight\.__ Christianity stands as the only true religion, implying all others are false, warranting the destruction of contrary arguments\. This notion is supported by 2 Corinthians 10:1\-6, where believers are urged to pull down strongholds and take every thought captive\. Apologetics becomes a battle over authorities, challenging arguments against God's knowledge, which can be destructive to their adherents but always answerable by Scripture\. __Negative Apologetics\.__ This approach involves neutralizing or weakening objections to Christianity, particularly in responding to attacks, distinguishing it from positive apologetics that commend Christianity\. One significant objection is the problem of evil and sin, which argues the incompatibility between God's character and the existence of evil—a reality that impacts everyone deeply\. __Pastoral Care and Logical Defenses\.__ Alvin Plantinga, in *God, Freedom, and Evil*, argues that there is no logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil\. While denying any divine attributes is impermissible, Plantinga posits a third statement compatible with both divine goodness and the existence of evil: Adam freely chose to disobey God, leading to the Fall\. Although this presupposes the truth of Scripture, the possibility suffices to counter potential incompatibilities\. The problem primarily exists within the theistic view, challenging objectors to justify the attributes of God they question\. Thus, disbelief in the third statement is irrelevant, as the question itself assumes it\. __Positive Apologetics\.__ The improbability of reconciling God and evil does not equate to impossibility\. The challenge lies in explaining Adam's responsibility for his choice to disobey God, given God's character\. The Incompatible Properties objection is addressed by Plantinga, who suggests that God's omnipotence is limited by Adam's moral responsibility and independent will\. __Dialogue with Atheists\.__ In dialogues between covenantal apologists and atheistic objectors, positive apologetics involves a comprehensive explanation of the Christian position\. Only Christianity, with full authority to revelation, can adequately address and account for the problem of evil and sin\.

__6\. Walking in Wisdom toward Outsiders\.__

__Pathos in Engagement\.__ The principial status of Scripture, the knowledge of God that all possess \(*sensus divinitatis*\), and God's universal mercy \(common grace\) all underscore the importance of pathos in engaging with outsiders\. __Walking in Wisdom\.__ Colossians emphasizes the supremacy of Christ, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge reside\. Followers are urged to "Walk in the wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time\. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person \(4:5\-6\)\." Wisdom involves an accurate \(ethos\) assessment of pathos to offer the logos persuasively\. __The Spirit of Persuasion\.__ The goals of evangelism and communication of the Christian faith should be premeditated, with reliance on the Holy Spirit, as highlighted in Luke 21:12\-15\. While disciples should prepare themselves, there exists a synergy where the Spirit works alongside the Bible and the testimony of the Holy Spirit facilitates a transition from merely believing that Christ exists to believing into him\. Jesus's words summarize this: focus on defense without anxiety, followed by reassurance that "I will give you a mouth and wisdom\." __Dennett, Dawkins, and Doubt\.__ Scientific knowledge is often treated as dogma, particularly in propositions that claim atheism, rendering them false since there is no neutral evidential ground\. Dawkins suggests in "Blind Watchmaker" that there is no purpose behind apparent design, while Dennett attributes design to blind chance, labeling objectors to evolution as ignorant or insane\. In the debate between Dennett and Dawkins and the covenantal apologist, Dennett and Dawkins view reason as the set net of a tennis match, excluding the covenantal apologist's perspective\. However, the covenantal apologist argues that all are made in God's image \(imago dei\) and born into self\-deception, with God as the remedy\. Science does not undermine Christianity, but presuppositions do\. __Doubt and Plausibility\.__ Doubting evolution leads to accusations of insanity and delusion, yet science is fundamentally based on plausibility rather than certainty\. Two problems emerge: the likelihood of scientific claims depends on background knowledge that excludes the Christian God, and probability inherently contains elements of improbability, allowing for doubt\. __A Concluding Word to the Wise\.__ Positively, there is a legitimate use of ad hominem, acknowledging Dennett's "Argument from Authority," and recognizing antipathy toward doubters while engaging in the search for truth and reasonable responses\. Negatively, Dennett's views were biased, failing to allow opponents to participate in the discourse\. Ultimately, one person's plausibility is another's incredulity, reflecting inherent suspicion towards evidences\.

__7\. You Are Very Religious\.__

__Idol Worship\.__ In false religions, there exists a parody or errant copy of Christianity\. This dynamic involves sensus and suppression, serving as a hermeneutical tool\. The Quicksand Quotient can be applied to religions and beliefs to evaluate their stability\. The phrase "very religious" functions as an ambiguous rhetorical device, potentially serving as both a compliment and a criticism\. To effectively use the Quicksand Quotient, one must identify who the other god is, how that god relates to creation, and what their theory of revelation entails\. __God is \(Not\) Great\.__ For Muslims, scriptures act as principial grounds, with God being necessary and creation contingent\. The interaction between Islamic monotheist and covenantal apologist illustrates key differences\. The Islamic monotheist claims two ways to know God: reason and revelation, similar to Thomas Aquinas\. However, the covenantal apologist contends that only revelation makes God knowable, arguing against reasoning from the contingent to the necessary\. The Islamic monotheist asserts that God's revelation in the Qur'an is an act of free will without necessity\. The Qur'an is eternal and reveals only Allah's will, not his nature, without guaranteeing reward\. This raises questions about whether a transcendent, singular God can communicate, as speech involves plurality\. The covenantal apologist points out that such a God cannot truly relate, reveal, or commit to followers\. Whereas the Islamic monotheist suggests Allah could do things contrary to his revealed will, the covenantal apologist highlights the contrasting certainty of the Christian God, who reveals himself fully\. The mystery of the Trinity is grounded in revelation, unlike the "utter darkness" described in Islam, which relies on reason alone\.

__Conclusion\.__ 

The goal is not to out\-argue our opponents but to engage *suaviter in modo, fortiter in re*, meaning gently in manner, strongly in deed\. Ultimately, God acts through us\. This is exemplified in the biblical story of Joshua and the angel of the Lord, where the question is not whether the Lord is for or against us but whether we align ourselves with God\.
