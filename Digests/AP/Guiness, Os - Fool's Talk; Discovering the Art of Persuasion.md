__Fool’s Talk: Discovering the Art of Christian of Christian Persuasion – Os Guinness__

__Introduction: Recovering the Lost Art\.__

In today's globalized world, characterized by self\-promotion and self\-expression, everyone acts as an apologist, whether they realize it or not\. The present challenge is that "we have lost the art of Christian persuasion and must recover it," largely due to a disconnect between discipleship and apologetics\.

__1\. Creative Persuasion\. __

Creative persuasion involves using surprise and diversion, as exemplified by biblical stories like Micaiah against Ahab and Nathan with David\. People today are not always open or interested in hearing Christian messages, which requires innovative approaches\. Apologetics should always be grounded in five central truths: Creation, highlighting human capacity for reason and the primacy of the heart; The Fall reflects the denial of God; The Incarnation emphasizes person\-to\-person engagement over mere argumentation; The Cross insists that persuasion must be cross\-shaped; The Spirit, acknowledging that true persuasion is a work of the Holy Spirit, not human effort\.

__2\. Technique: The Devil’s Bait\.__

In every generation, discernment about the prevailing spirit \(technique\) is essential\. The myth of progress lures people into believing in a singular solution or 'next thing\.' However, there is no silver bullet in persuasion, which remains an art, not a science\. It involves a mix of stories and rational arguments, requiring the skill to know which to deploy and when\. In contrast to a formulaic "how\-to" approach, the centrality of the cross in persuasion is paramount\. While elements like pathos, ethos, and logos may be useful, they should not overshadow the core message\. Persuasion should lead to a paradigm shift or metanoia, affecting moral and spiritual transformation, engaging the heart as well as the mind\. It's intended for those who love God, not mere salesmen or PR consultants\.

__3\. The Defense Never Rests\.__

Believers, like the heroes of faith, understand that "the known facts were never all the facts\." They trust and wait, learning from past challengers such as Celsus, Hume, and Dawkins\. God himself is the ultimate apologist, and we must glean insights from seasoned apologists\. Apologetics, defined as a 'word back,' serves as a reasoned defense to clear the wrongly accused, ensuring that the defense never rests\. Apologetics is ultimately about God, not personal prowess; it falters when the focus shifts from the divine to human efforts\. The task is not only for intellectuals; the defense is merely corroborative, as truth stands firm independently\. Certification comes from the Holy Spirit’s conviction\. When God is wrongly framed, like in the story of Job, He justifies Himself\.

__4\. The Way of the Third Fool\.__

The so\-called "new atheism" is not truly new, but its aggressive stance can be attributed to the decline of modernism and the resurgence of Christianity\. Erasmus advocated for "fool\-making" to circumvent barriers such as relativism and authority crises\. The Bible presents three types of fools: 

- The fool *proper*, representing people who dismiss God\.
- The fool *bearer*, those who are "fools for Christ's sake," exemplified by Jesus as the Mock King, crowned and mocked during his trials by Caiaphas and Pilate\.
- The fool *maker*, individuals willing to be seen as fools to speak truth to power, akin to jesters revealing the emperor’s nakedness\. Paul notes this as Christ's role on the cross, and Erasmus embodies this tradition\. Humor is used to unveil and expose unbelief\.

__5\. Anatomy of Unbelief\.__

The assertion "truth is dead" reflects the rise of relativism, as intellectuals often prioritize narratives over truth\. This leads to a philosophy of meaninglessness with two categories of thinkers: truth twisters and truth seekers\. Truth remains vital in areas like business and science\. The anatomy of unbelief, according to the Bible, involves willful truth abuse, manifesting as hardening, blindness, and rebellion\. Key Biblical insights indicate unbelief:

- Suppresses truth through deliberate acts\.
- Exploits, inverts, and deceives, ultimately leading to self\-deception\.

__The Poles of Dilemma and Diversion\. __Even while actively resisting, unbelievers cannot escape the truth’s inescapable nature\. Unbelief inherently mixes truth with falsehoods\. This tension lies between two poles:

- The *dilemma* pole, where consistent adherence to one's reality pushes further from God's reality, magnifying their existential dilemma\.
- The *diversion* pole, where inconsistency in worldview makes one mimic God's reality, making diversions necessary\.

__Living Happilly Diverted\. __The diversion pole is more prevalent, where people act as if God exists, enjoying related benefits but denying His presence in practice\. Conversely, the dilemma pole, often associated with figures like Nietzsche, underscores an unresolved existential conflict\. Biblically, diversions before God are futile, offering short\-term satisfaction but leading to long\-term disaster\. Many live "happily diverted," leading unexamined lives while acting as if the world has inherent meaning\. This sets the stage for the next chapter's exploration of remedies\.

__6\. Turning the Tables\.__

__G\.K\. Chesterton's Approach\.__ G\.K\. Chesterton's method involves pushing people towards understanding the consequences of their unbelief\. The upcoming chapter, Signal Triggering, explores making individuals aware of their deeper longings\. __Apologetics and Evangelism__ can often be at odds, with two main pitfalls: prioritizing apologetics can overshadow the simplicity of Jesus's message, while prioritizing evangelism can overlook the necessity of addressing closed hearts and minds\. Effective persuasion requires a balance between preaching and engaging on others' terms\. __Turning the Tables\.__ People can be closed to God either by being content in their unbelief or openly hostile to Christianity\. "*Relativize the relativizers*" involves turning tables, rather than simply amplifying Christian claims\. Worldviews tend to explain away others, making it crucial to discern between internally consistent but incomplete and comprehensive yet inconsistent arguments\. This approach has roots in Christian history and conversion, reflecting God's characteristic response to unbelief\. Questions should be used to pierce indifference, using others' prophets and perspectives to find common understanding\.

__7\. Triggering the Signals\.__

__Signals of Transcendence\.__ Signals of transcendence guide seekers by highlighting deeper longings\. Two gaps exist in these signals: a *logical gap* between signal and discovery, and a *temporal gap* in realization\. Two desires underpin these signals: a longing for what was lost due to the Fall \(joy and desire\) and a historical sense of yearning for more \(fear and grief\), both tied to suppressed truth\. __Positive Apologetics\.__ Positive apologetics involves pointing individuals towards signals of transcendence and rekindling a homesickness for truth\. Despite the gaps, signals serve as pointers to something greater, as exemplified in C\.S\. Lewis's concept of being "Surprised by Joy\." Common human experiences such as hope, play, humor, order, and judgment, though not irresistible, can serve as significant triggers for spiritual exploration\.

__8\. Spring\-Loaded Dynamics\.__

__The Impact of Worldviews\.__ Different worldviews significantly influence perceptions and can lead to profound changes in understanding, akin to experiencing a culture shock or a paradigm shift\. An example is David's confrontation with Nathan, leading to an immediate realization and shift in perspective\. __Strategies for Engaging the Unbeliever\.__ Successfully engaging those with closed hearts and minds involves understanding their context and choosing appropriate strategies:

- Reframing: Changing perspectives on God, as demonstrated in the story of the Emmaus road\.
- Raising Questions: Vital because they are indirect and involving, like the questioning in the Garden of Eden\.
- Story and Parable: These methods are indirect and imaginative, offering a quick transport from current reality to new possibilities\.
- Drama and Ploys: Using indirect and imaginative setups, such as Jeremiah's invitation to the Rechabites, to engage deeper understanding\.

__The Role of Words Today\.__ In an era of inattention and inflated discourse, where words are commodified as mere tools, Christians hold that words are inseparably linked to truth\.

__9\. The Art of Always Being Right?__

__Persuasion versus Truth\.__ In Christian persuasion, the goal should be to win people, not merely arguments\. While persuasion can sometimes distort truth, the Christian approach emphasizes realism grounded in the patterns of the incarnation, the cross, and the Holy Spirit\. __Humility and Vulnerability\.__ Becoming weak and personal, listening, and exercising humility and vulnerability are essential components\. These are seen as the midwives of truth, facilitating genuine understanding and connection\. __Educated Apologetics\.__ While education in apologetics is important, the issue is often not people's intelligence but their openness, as even the brightest can be closed off\. __The Charge of Manipulation\.__ Creative persuasion is not manipulative; it is indirect, involving, and imaginative, prompting individuals to engage and discover truths for themselves\. In a world where everyone is speaking and few are listening, the use of parables, like that of the vineyard, shows that sometimes the most profound truths are realized when individuals make the connections themselves, as seen when Jesus uses parables to let listeners, like the Sadducees, draw their own conclusions\.

__10\. Beware the Boomerang\.__

__Hypocrisy in the Christian Life\.__ Christians often face accusations of hypocrisy, where actions do not align with professed beliefs, which can undermine their testimony even before any dialogue begins\. This can become a boomerang effect when the same strategy to highlight inconsistencies in unbelievers is used against Christians\.

1. __Acknowledge Universal Hypocrisy\.__ Hypocrisy is endemic to humanity, and it is crucial to identify a standard and solution to judge and address it, with postmodern cynicism as one potential response\.
2. __Clarify the Issues of Hypocrisy\.__ Hypocrisy represents a gap between truth and lies, violating truth, justice, and honesty, thereby damaging plausibility but not necessarily credibility\.
3. __Recognize Social Benefits\.__ Hypocrisy, although negative, can highlight societal standards and expectations by which people can judge and recognize deceit\.
4. __Source of Moral Seriousness\.__ God despises hypocrisy, pretense, and inconsistency, and Jesus criticized hypocrites more than sinners\.
5. __Avoid Retaliation and Embrace Confession\.__ Retaliation against accusations of hypocrisy can backfire, while confessing hypocrisy highlights the strength of Christianity\.
6. __Counter\-Hypocrisy Program\.__ Christians are called to seek and live by the truth, as personal growth aligns with effective persuasion\.

__11\. Kissing Judases\.__

__Challenges Within the Church\.__ Some of the most significant challenges to Christianity arise from within the church, sometimes exacerbated by external pressures\. __Proclaim, Don't Persuade\.__ Some church leaders, like Barth and Bonhoeffer, argue against apologetics, fearing it undermines the authority of Scripture and constrains spontaneity and reliance on the Holy Spirit\. __Defend, Don't Dialogue\.__ There is a call for cautious reflection rather than engaging in defensive argumentation\. __Steps toward Compromise\.__ The process of compromise within the church involves several steps:

1. __Assumption:__ Influences like Bultmann suggest adopting a scientific worldview leads to skepticism, rendering New Testament miracles implausible\.
2. __Abandonment:__ Non\-conforming elements are discarded\.
3. __Adaptation:__ Remaining beliefs are modified to fit new frameworks\.
4. __Assimilation:__ Modern assumptions are fully integrated, overshadowing traditional beliefs\.

__12\. Charting the Journey\.__

__Life as a Journey\.__ Life is often metaphorically described as a journey, raising the question of whether it follows one way or many paths\. Os Guinness outlines a *four\-step journey*, not as a prescription but as a description of common phases encountered in spiritual exploration\.

1. __A Time for Questions\.__ This initial phase involves questioning the previously held meaning of life, often triggered by life’s disruptions or signals of transcendence\. For apologists, welcoming genuine seekers is crucial, while being realistic about the term 'seeker' itself\. It’s important to counter the Freudian objection that questions are mere wish fulfillment, as genuine queries may lead to disbelief as much as belief\.
2. __A Time for Answers\.__ Here, individuals search for answers, making this phase particularly significant for apologists\. The search for meaning is often conceptual and critical, determining the journey's outcome\. Comparison plays a key role, though it is often seen as odious, dangerous, misguided, and futile due to its perceived exclusivity, potential to reinforce relativism, failure to recognize commonalities, and the impracticality of comparing all possible answers\. Guinness points out that seekers have specific questions, and 'families of faiths' serve as narrows to guide their search\.
3. __A Time for Evidences\.__ In this stage, seekers use evidence to test the truth and adequacy of chosen answers or presuppositions\. Apologists need to be prepared with thorough explanations and sincere encouragement to support seekers in their quest for truth\.
4. __A Time for Commitments\.__ The journey concludes with a commitment of faith that is both personal and experiential\. God must reveal Himself for this commitment to be genuine\. Apologists play a supportive role, though ultimate realization comes through God's work in the Spirit\. The leap of faith is rational and warranted, yet seekers retain the choice to continue their journey instead of surrendering fully\.

__Conclusion\. The Way of the Open Hand__

Apologetics involves both an open hand, which represents a positive and welcoming approach, and a closed fist, symbolizing a defensive posture\. Positive apologetics invite seekers towards truth, while negative apologetics defend against critiques, embodying both the welcoming and protective aspects of faith engagement\.
