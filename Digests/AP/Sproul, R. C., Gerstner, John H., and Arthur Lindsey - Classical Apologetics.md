__Section III: A Classical Critique of Presuppositional Apologetics\.__

__Chapter 10: An Outline of Presuppositional Apologetics\.__

__Evidentialists against Presuppositionalism\. __The authors of this book consider themselves *evidentialist* apologists and Reformed theologians\. Their book deals with presuppositional apologetics, especially with Van Til, its leading exponent\. They do so because “presuppositionalism … undermine\[s\] the Christian religion” \(184\)\. Presuppositionalism maintains against classical apologetics that autonomous man must not be the starting point, could never reach his goal, and has an inherently “unworthy goal\.” On top of that, the presuppositionalist aims to prove his own strategy right\. __Presuppositionalism\. __The presuppositional argument is essentially one of worldview \[my own words\]: “Without knowing everything, we cannot know anything” \(186\)\. We can only know things really analogically \(by thinking God’s thoughts after him\) if we have been born again by the Holy Spirit\. Summarized on page 188: “Presuppositionalism teaches heteronomy instead of autonomy, regeneration instead of the noetic influence of sin; analogical rather than univocal thinking; presupposing instead of proving\. It departs from evidentialism at every apologetic point, just as it shows evidentialism to be in error at every apologetic point\.”

__Chapter 11: General Apologetic Tradition on Reason and Faith: Augustine, Luther, and Calvin\.__

__Augustine\. __In Augustine’s thought, there is a place for reason before and after faith\. First, reason provides a ground on which authority can be evaluated\. Second, reason plays a subordinate role in explaining and confirming doctrines\. Yet, the acceptance of doctrine is not dependent on its rational defense\. __Luther\. __While Luther was very much opposed to reason, he used the word in several ways: “Luther uses reason as \(1\) natural reason ruling within its proper domain; \(2\) arrogant reason trespassing on the domain of faith; and \(3\) regenerate reason dealing with spiritual matters, but always subject to the Word” \(196\)\. Luther attacks the second but praises the other two\. __Calvin\. __For Calvin, knowledge of God was available to all people through the *sensus divinitatis* or *deitatis*\. Yet, this knowledge available in nature does not lead to salvation\. What is less agreed upon, according to the authors, is whether, for Calvin, this knowledge is available to the unbeliever\. Some passages seem to claim that the unbeliever is blind to all knowledge of God, while others “indicate that they are blind not to natural knowledge of God’s majesty, but to the things of salvation” \(200\)\. This knowledge can never be erased entirely by the unbeliever, as is evident from Calvin’s use of pagan philosophers\. Calvin also uses very compressed versions of theistic proofs\. Yet, he remains clear that evidences and proofs cannot produce saving knowledge\.

__Chapter 12: The Starting Point: Primacy of the Intellect and Autonomy\.__

__Introduction to Classical Apologetics\.__ In classical apologetics, the starting point for understanding the divine is often rooted in the individual's intellectual journey\. Classical apologists emphasize the use of human reason to draw conclusions about God, often utilizing philosophical arguments and evidence from the natural world\. They propose that while human reason is finite, it still holds the capacity to, through rational thought, engage with the infinite nature of the divine\. __The Presuppositionalist Challenge\.__ Presuppositionalism offers a distinct challenge to classical apologetics by arguing that finite human reasoning cannot truly comprehend the infinite God if starting with the self\. Presuppositionalists assert that epistemological assumptions must be grounded in God as the fundamental basis of all thought\. This view contrasts sharply with the classical approach, where the process begins with the self, whether considering from a first or third person perspective\. __Ontological vs Epistemological Starting Points\.__ A central debate between classical apologists and presuppositionalists is the distinction between ontological and epistemological starting points\. Ontologically, all apologists agree that God is the ultimate source, but they diverge on where to begin epistemologically\. Van Til, a key figure in presuppositionalism, maintains that observable facts can be a proximate starting point but insists that God remains the ultimate reference point\. __Analyzing Van Til's Perspective\.__ The authors criticize Van Til's conflation of epistemological and ontological starting points \(e\.g\., God\), suggesting that his approach misunderstands the capability of the unregenerate to see God\. According to Van Til, the inability of the unregenerate results from a willing suppression of the truth, indicating that while unbelievers psychologically or metaphysically know God, they suppress this knowledge epistemologically, leading to a cannot\. The authors view this as inconsistent, yet seem to miss Van Til's explanation of the complex relationship between human will and understanding\. __The Role of Intellect in Van Til's Thought\. __Despite rejecting the primacy of the intellect, Van Til paradoxically arrives at the Creator\-creature distinction through intellectual means, according to his critics\. His rejection of human reason's autonomy is tied to his belief in the supremacy of divine revelation\. The authors argue that Van Til's framework is circular, as it relies on the internal testimony of the Spirit to validate the authority of scripture and vice versa\. __Conclusion\.__ The discourse between classical apologists and presuppositionalists highlights fundamental tensions in Christian apologetics in regard to how human reason and divine revelation interact as pathways to understanding God\. While they agree on God's ontological primacy, their different epistemological methodologies reflect deeper philosophical differences about truth and human cognition\.

__Chapter 13: The Noetic Influences of Sin\. __

The starting point and the notion of autonomy reveal—according to presuppositionalism—how the non\-presuppositionalist errs, while the noetic influences of sin explain why he errs\. Calvin argues that persuasion is the work of the Spirit rather than the result of arguments, yet he does acknowledge that arguments can demonstrate that the Bible is the Word of God\. The authors infer from this that "something is wrong with the heart—not the mind—which needs the nonrational super\-rational revelation of divine majesty\." After detailing how later Reformed thinkers remained consistent with Calvin, the authors explore how presuppositionalists like Van Til, Bahnsen, Rushdoony, Dooyeweerd, and Runner perceive the noetic influence of sin\. __The Nature of Mind in Sinful Influence\.__ Traditionalists and presuppositionalists both agree that the darkening of the mind arises not from a lack of knowledge but from the suppression of the truth\. According to Van Til, this suppression acts directly upon reason and is not merely an indirect consequence of the heart's wickedness\. For Van Til, as interpreted by the authors, there is nothing left but to assert that the mind itself has effectively been destroyed by sin\. This stark portrayal challenges the nature of reason's autonomy in a fallen state\. __Van Tillian Methodology and Critique\.__ The authors describe "reasoning from the impossibility of the contrary," a methodology used by Van Til to deconstruct the unbeliever's worldview from the inside out\. This method, they argue, assumes "a legitimate autonomy, the primacy of the intellect," in order to effectively engage with opposing worldviews\. While this necessitates temporarily adopting the interlocutor's perspective, the ultimate goal is to dismantle, not affirm, that very worldview\. By doing so, Van Til seeks to expose the faulty foundation of non\-Christian thought and highlight the necessity of a God\-centered epistemology\.

__Chapter 14: The Attack on Theistic Proofs\.__ 

Van Til agrees with Immanuel Kant's rejection of theistic proofs but repudiates his dismissal of Christian revelation\. For Kant, the noumenal realm is unknowable, yet it must be postulated to account for the phenomenal world we experience\. The authors find it both surprising and telling that Van Til sides with the antitheists on the issue of theistic proofs\. However, they take issue with Van Til's anachronistic claim that Calvin aligns with his presuppositionalist perspective\. __The Unbeliever's Knowledge of God\.__ While Van Til argues that unbelievers suppress the knowledge of the true God despite possessing it, classical apologists contend that they attempt to suppress this knowledge without actually succeeding\. According to Rushdoony, theistic arguments wrongly assume the neutrality of the mind and the independence of both human reason and natural facts from God\. The authors criticize Rushdoony for failing to make a clear distinction between the roles of mind and heart in this context\. __Disagreements with Traditional Orthodoxy\.__ The authors continue to show how traditional apologists sometimes find themselves at odds with traditional orthodoxy\. Van Til's claim that true knowledge is impossible without special revelation stands in contrast to scholastic views, as well as those of Augustine and Anselm, regarding categories of knowledge\. Van Til rejects any form of univocal or equivocal thinking, advocating instead for analogical reasoning as the only valid path\. __The Nature of Unbelievers' Knowledge\.__ According to the authors, Van Til posits that unbelievers have genuine cognitive knowledge of God, which is only possible through the revelation given in Scripture\. In reality, Van Til teaches that the true knowledge of God is inescapable and is rooted in the fact that humans, as covenant creatures made in God's image, possess this knowledge psychologically and metaphysically\. Epistemologically, however, the unregenerate cannot help but suppress this knowledge\. This view contrasts with that of Aquinas and Butler, who assert that the unregenerate are capable of sound reasoning about God and the world\.

__Chapter 15: The Attack on Christian Evidences\. __

There are three traditional Christian evidences: 1\) the witness to the Bible as the Word of God, 2\) the witness of the Bible as the Word of God, and 3\) the effects of the Bible as the Word of God\. Presuppositionalists reject miracles and prophecy as sound arguments, whereas evidentialists dismiss self\-attestation as a credible form of argument\. Van Til takes exception to three elements that classical apologetics maintains, namely, that humans must establish the *possibility* of the Bible, establish the *necessity* of the Bible, and that we have a philosophy with which we do both before approaching the Bible\. __Van Til's Approach to Knowledge and Revelation\.__ Van Til argues that unless we presuppose the knowledge which the Bible provides, we cannot truly know anything at all\. Classical apologists counter that if we do not first understand the possibility of the Bible at the outset, we could never acknowledge it as reality\. For Van Til, the necessity of revelation cannot be comprehended without the revelation itself serving as its own foundation\. Moreover, he insists that we must not approach the Bible with a philosophy that is independent of its teachings, including basic laws of logic and thought\. __Presuppositional Apologetics and Evidences\.__ In Van Til’s framework, miracles and prophecy are excluded from presuppositional apologetics because they represent brute facts that do not convey meaning on their own; they are mute in the absence of Scripture's interpretive framework\. This marks a stark departure from evidentialist approaches that rely on historical and empirical evidence as validation for the truth of Christian claims, underscoring a fundamental divide in methodologies between these schools of thought\. 

__Chapter 16: The Self\-Attesting God\.__ 

The most important principle connected to the self\-attesting God is paradox\. It addresses the complexities surrounding the issues of the one and the many, freedom and determinism, and beginning and end\. The authors aim to demonstrate that while presuppositionalism is a form of Paradox Theology, presuppositional apologetics is paradoxical in its handling of such paradoxes by denying paradox even while relying on it continually\. Van Til introduces a hard\-core paradox between proximate and ultimate causes, as seen in the assertion that God makes man evil yet God does not make man evil\. __The Nature of Paradox in Van Til's Thought\.__ In Van Til’s view, God’ controls whatsoever comes to pass, and at the same time, human choices have significance\. He refers to this as an apparent contradiction, while the authors contend that it should be acknowledged as a paradox\. Another paradox highlighted by the authors is the tension between the universal call of the gospel and the doctrine of election\. They are not satisfied with Van Til’s explanation that what seems contradictory to us is harmonious in God's mind\. __Affirmation of Univocal vs\. Analogical Thinking\.__ This issue uncovers a fundamental difference in perspective, as the authors affirm univocal thinking—that human and divine understandings can align perfectly—while Van Til does not\. For Van Til, the human inability to fully reconcile these paradoxes reflects the limits of human cognition rather than inconsistencies in God’s nature or revelation, highlighting the unique position of presuppositional apologetics in theological discourse\.

__Chapter 17: The Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit\. __The authors aim to demonstrate that the traditional Reformed doctrine of the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit differs from the presuppositionalist’s understanding\. Figures like Calvin and Voetius argue that while saving knowledge is impossible without the Holy Spirit, the unregenerate can still possess a theoretical and purely external knowledge of Scripture\. Edwards similarly differentiates between the sources of these two kinds of knowledge\. In contrast, Van Til denies any common ground between believers and unbelievers regarding concepts of man, fact, and logic, extending this denial to the natural knowledge of God\. __The Role of Natural Knowledge in Theology\.__ Classical apologists, in alignment with the Westminster Confession of Faith, contend that nature provides abundant arguments or evidence supporting the truth of Scripture and God, which become persuasive only through the Holy Spirit's internal testimony\. John Frame supports the idea that the testimony of the Holy Spirit operates independently and prior to any speculative knowledge or evidence concerning the inspiration of the Word\. __Subjectivity Concerns with Internal Testimony\.__ The authors object to this view, arguing that it leads to subjectivity: whatever John Frame, or Van Til for that matter, claims to be testified by the Holy Spirit is automatically affirmed as true, whereas claims of revelation from others might be dismissed as false\. This criticism highlights a key tension between the objective and subjective elements of faith and knowledge, challenging presuppositionalists to address the potential pitfalls of relying solely on internal witness without external corroboration\.

__Chapter 18: Presuppositionalism and Verification\.__ The authors argue that the fundamental issue with presuppositionalism lies in its relationship with verification\. They summarize their critique with a poignant analysis: if a presuppositionalist offers any reason to support their beliefs, they effectively cease to be a presuppositionalist\. Bahnsen, noted for his consistency, avoids doing so\. However, a faith in Scripture—or in anything—that lacks supporting reasons becomes fideism\. Therefore, if Van Til or Bahnsen deny that their faith in Scripture is fideistic, they contradict their own presuppositionalist stance\. Conversely, admitting to fideism corroborates this critique\. 

__Chapter 19: Analogical Thinking\.__ 

Analogical thinking originates from medieval scholasticism, offering a middle ground between univocal thinking, associated with pantheism, and equivocal thinking, linked with skepticism\. Reformed theologians have affirmed its use, though Barth rejected the *analogia entis* as it potentially encroaches upon God's sovereignty\. For Van Til, humans cannot truly know anything because, as creatures, their knowledge is limited to understanding brute facts, which he considers mute facts\. Van Til's resolution is found in God's all\-encompassing knowledge, where no facts are brute or mute\. __Critiques of Analogical Knowledge\.__ The authors present several objections to Van Til's concept of analogical knowledge\. *First*, they argue that the idea of brute\-mute facts is rooted in a false idealistic perspective\. *Second*, they contend that God cannot communicate knowledge to humans, as true communication would necessitate imparting omniscience and infinity, given the presupposition that to know anything, one must know everything\. *Third*, they reason that acknowledging our knowledge as analogical adds nothing substantive, as our understanding of a simple object like a flower on the wall remains unchanged\. __The Limitations of Analogical Knowledge\.__ The authors’ primary issue with the presuppositionalist stance is that finite analogical knowledge cannot equate to true knowledge of the infinite truth known by God\. By this reasoning, if human understanding can only be a shadowy reflection of divine knowledge, it challenges the adequacy and authenticity of said knowledge—posing a significant philosophical and theological challenge within presuppositionalism\.

__Chapter 20: Circular Reasoning\. __

Presuppositionalism uniquely embraces circular reasoning, viewing it not as a flaw but as an inevitable aspect of any coherent system of thought\. The core argument is that unless one presupposes God, the world cannot be understood intelligibly\. Van Til posits that all reasoning, in essence, involves some form of circularity\. The authors challenge this notion, arguing that even if Van Til could demonstrate that all other systems are circular, it would only show that everyone’s reasoning is as flawed as his own\. __Presuppositional Justification of Circularity\.__ Van Til consistently argues that no worldview can adequately account for the concepts of intelligibility and logic without engaging in circular reasoning\. According to him, only the presupposition of the triune God provides a solid foundation for understanding these elements\. The authors object, stating that this presupposition assumes the existence of intelligibility or linear reasoning from the beginning, thus contradicting itself by starting with autonomous reasoning\. __The Role of the Triune God in Presuppositionalism\.__ Van Til would defend his position by asserting that his reasoning method stems from the impossibility of the contrary\. He aims to demonstrate that alternative worldviews depend on the notion of intelligibility without being able to justify it\. The presuppositionalist framework begins not with intelligibility or logic but with the acknowledgment of the Triune God of Scripture, who is posited as the ultimate source of all intelligibility, thus ostensibly resolving the circularity concern by grounding it in divine revelation rather than human autonomy\.

__Comments and Questions\.__

“Furthermore, Van Til is always proving to the non\-Christian that predication is impossible without presupposing God, obviously assuming that the non\-Christian can understand his argument” \(CA, 216\)\.

- This is a good point and has been raised in a similar fashion elsewhere\. Van Til’s method presupposes that there exists something like reasoning, logic, or intelligibility\. The whole method is to show that only the Christian worldview can account for that\.

“Suppose that Van Til counterattacks by objecting that we are beginning hypothetically with logic and, when we discover God, we conclude certainly that logic is valid\. This, he may charge, is inconsistent, for a certain conclusion is reached from a hypothetical premise” \(CA, 222\)\.

- This is not what CVT would argue at all\. We don’t discover God; we start with him\. Yet, see the point raised above\.

“If our analysis is sound, the traditional Aquinas\-Butler apologetic is immune to Van Til’s criticisms, while his alternative is inconsistent\. Thomas and Butler are faulted for assuming that unregenerate humanity can reason soundly about God and the world\. This is thought to be inconsistent with fallen, sinful human nature\. A sound view of the Fall, however, does not entail that the very essence of human nature— rationality—was lost\. Moreover, Van Til himself admits that fallen sinners do know God\. So it turns out here that Van Til does not think that human rationality is lost in the Fall” \(CA, 262\)\.

- Van Til argues that the unregenerate still has true knowledge about God, which differs from “assuming that unregenerate humanity can reason soundly about God and the world\.” Also, rationality is not the very essence of human nature – only in the substantive and rather reductionist view of the imago Dei\.

“THE HEART OF THE presuppositional apologetic is a God whose proof is solely in Himself\. All other systems argue to God—this one, from God\. All other systems are supposed to fail because God cannot be reached at the end of a syllogism, this one claims to succeed because here the syllogism is derived from God” \(CA, 287\)\.

- This is an accurate description of presuppositional apologetics\.

“So the proof of circular reasoning would be its necessity for linear reasoning\. Van Til, of course, would not want to say that\. This would be the autonomous thinker beginning, once again, at an autonomous starting\-point, calling for linear reasoning and finding that only if he begins with circular reasoning can he end with linear reasoning\. Van Til falls back into the vernacular and insists that if we would have linear thinking, we must begin with circular thinking” \(324\)\.

- The problem here is that Van Til does not start with the autonomous thinker on his own but only in order to dismantle the unbeliever’s worldview from the inside out\. On the assumption of the unbeliever’s presuppositions, he shows that they cannot account for linear reasoning\. I do wonder how Van Til would respond to a worldview that does not assume any kind of linear thinking or intelligibility\. Probably by showing that such a worldview is inconsistent because that would be impossible in practice\.
