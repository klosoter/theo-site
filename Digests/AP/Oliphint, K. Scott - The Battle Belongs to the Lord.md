__The Battle Belongs to the Lord – K\. Scott Oliphint__

Oliphint emphasizes that apologetics must be rooted in the Bible, suggesting that autonomous human reason should not be the starting point for defending the faith\. The Bible itself serves as an apologetic tool, showcasing that spiritual battles are for God to win, not humans\. The purpose of apologetics is to reveal God's existence, salvation, and the means by which He saves, utilizing supernatural "weapons" like humility and submission to God\.

__1\. Your Master Proclaim \(1 Peter\)\. __

Oliphint highlights that believers, especially in hard times, are "strangers" longing for God due to their alienation in the world\. Persecution encourages believers to remain focused on Christ, setting Him as Lord in their hearts\. This demands a reliance on Scripture, as commanded in 2 Timothy 3:16, and requires a meek attitude in all interactions\.

__2\. Beware the Ides of March \(Jude\)\. __

Jude warns of counterforces within, urging believers to be vigilant against internal threats to the Gospel\. This fight is centered on faith, culminating in Christ and His complete revelation\. Understanding Scripture is crucial for combatting false teachings\.

__3\. The Stealth Attack \(2 Corinthians\)\. __

In Corinthians, intruders purported another Gospel, a challenge that believers must meet by demolishing such arguments, while emulating Christ’s meekness and gentleness\. Paul advises taking every thought captive, reinforcing strongholds with the truth\.

__4\. The Good with the Bad \(Romans 1\)\. __

Believers should be confident apologists, unashamed of the Gospel\. All humanity suppresses the truth, yet God’s reality is evident in creation, continually proclaimed\. The good news brings revealed righteousness through Christ, while the bad news is the revealed wrath for unrighteousness\.

__5\. The Divine Psychologist \(Romans 2\)\. __

Romans 2 merges hard and soft sciences, addressing psychology as knowledge of the soul, reflecting universal general revelation of God\. Although not salvific, all people hold down this truth in unrighteousness, making them inexcusable\. As Calvin notes, humans construct idols, knowing God's law even as they suppress it\.

__6\. Jerusalem Meets Athens: Apologetics in Action \(Acts 17\)\. __Paul, confronted by Epicureans and Stoics, is moved by idolatry\. He emphasizes persuasion through valid, sound, and enticing arguments\. Knowing the sensus divinitatis and recognizing the Holy Spirit as the true persuader, Paul clarifies God's nature, humanity's position, and the Gospel\. He uses Greek poets to unravel misconceptions, employing wisdom rather than condemnation\.

__Conclusion\.__

Followers of Christ must always be ready to contend for the faith, armed with the Lord's spiritual weapons\. Taking every thought captive to Christ's obedience, believers should dismantle arguments against truth with gentleness and reverence, addressing those who suppress and trade God's truth for lies\. The Creator, deserving worship forever, is central to this battle\.

__Appendix 1: Apologetics and the Holy Spirit\.__

Human arguments lack persuasiveness without the Holy Spirit, who is essential in apologetics\. Despite this, Scripture calls us to defend the faith \(Luke 21\)\. The Holy Spirit came post\-ascension to glorify Christ, manifesting in inspiration, synergy, and testimony — moving belief from mere acknowledgment to heartfelt assurance\. Luke 21 encourages believers not to premeditate defense strategies, emphasizing reliance on Christ's provision for the right words in each moment\.
