__Common Grace and the Gospel – Cornelius van Til__

__Foreword__

*Common Grace and the Gospel* contains a collection of essays spanning about twenty\-five years\. It provides a third way to the common grace problem by avoiding the right \(Hoeksema denies common grace\) and the left \(Kuyper’s common grace is ultimately patterned after natural theology\)\. Three themes are important in Van Til’s revision of common grace: “fearless anthropomorphism,” “concrete thinking,” and “limiting concept\.” *Fearless anthropomorphism*: we need to be fearlessly anthropomorphic in our speaking of how God’s actions in eternity and history are related\. *Concrete thinking* means biblical and historical thinking by taking all factors of revelation seriously rather than *abstract* thinking which serves logic\. A *limiting concept* entails both fearless anthropomorphism and concrete thinking and means transcending the standard rules of thought \(e\.g\., syllogisms, the law of non\-contradiction\) and letting mysteries \(e\.g\., Trinity, predestination, and the free offer of the gospel\) be what they are\.

__The Christian Philosophy of History\.__

A philosophy of history deals with facts under the aspect of change and the problem of the one\-and\-the\-many \(many facts, one pattern\)\. According to Van Til, there is a difference between the believer and the unbeliever both regarding the facts and their interpretation\. Epistemelogically, for the unbeliever facts are brute facts governed by impersonal law waiting to be interpreted by autonomously reasoning man\. For the believer, facts and laws are what they are because they are God\-controlled\. They are to be interpreted by a God\-controlled man\. Only by holding to the presupposition of the self\-contained ontological trinity \(who both one and many in himself\) is intelligibility of facts possible\. That presupposing something incomprehensible \(Ontological Trinity\) is required to be saved from the really contradictory \(unintelligibility\) might seem paradoxical to some\. However, it is a limiting concept because due to the creator\-creature distinction full exhaustion of reality is impossible for man\.

__Abraham Kuyper’s Doctrine of Common Grace\.__

Herman Bavinck maintained the absolute character of Christianity \(against Pelagianism\) and appreciated everything good and beautiful that God has given to sinful man \(against Pietism\)\. Abraham Kuyper’s was ambiguous on common grace in his *De Gemeene Gratie \(The Common Grace\)*\. In the first volume he described its constant aspect as a restraint, an omnipresent operation of divine mercy by which the covenant\-breaker’s disintegration was kept in check\. It did not change man’s ethical hostility but only tamed it\. In the second volume Kuyper stressed the progressive aspects of common grace as making human life and the life of the world pass through a process and develop itself more fully and richly\. Man had a place in this operation as an instrument and a co\-laborer \(*Nebenzweck*\)\. Kuyper’s contention was defended by the Church’s Synod in 1924 by affirming \(1\) God’s favor to mankind in general, \(2\) the restraint of sin in the individual and society, and \(3\) ‘civic righteousness’ by the regenerate\.

__Common Grace in Debate\.__

__I\. Recent Developments\. __Van Til lists three parties that are struggling with common grace: \(1\) Kuyper\-Bavinck sympathizers \(Hepp\), \(2\) those who deny common grace \(Hoeksema\), and \(3\) those who reconstructed common grace \(Schilder\)\. Schilder emphasized that culture was based on the cultural mandate rather than on common grace or anything *in common* with the unbeliever\. For him, common grace is always connected to the common curse\. Hoeksema rejects common grace because it would lead to determinism\. Van Til affirms against these thinkers that common grace must be qualified by the state of the process of differentiation that genuinely appreciates history\. Therefore, before the consummation of history, the elect are also objects of God’s displeasure, and the non\-elect are objects of his favor\.

__II\. Some Suggestions for the Future\. __

__A\. The Danger of Abstract Thinking\.__* *According to Van Til, Kuyper, Bavinck, and Hepp all have remnants of an abstract way of thinking in their epistemologies\. __Kuyper\.__ Kuyper opposed neutral thinking and stated that the *attitude of the heart* was involved in true scientific interpretation\. Yet he seems to separate the world of perception \(facts/particulars\) from the world of ratiocination \(laws/universals\)\. The *passive intellect* receives facts from the latter, while the *active intellect* transforms them into knowledge\. Van Til describes this as Platonic/Kantian\. Kuyper does bring in an *Original Subject *\(God\) who brought the universals into being, and we are to think his thoughts after him\. While this must be affirmed, argues Van Til, we need to drop the Platonic/Kantian procedure\. The distinction between the perception and the ratiocination must be a *limiting concept* that affirms temporal creation and God\-interpretation of the universals\. __Bavinck\.__ According to Van Til, Bavinck advocated a form of *moderate realism* that combined the good elements of rationalism and empiricism\. Ultimately, according to Van Til, in doing so, the “abstract principles of rationalism are not made concrete,” and the “brute facts of empiricism are not made accessible” \(57\)\. Rather, the Christian notion of mystery \(cf\. limiting concept\) rests on “the presupposition of the existence of the self\-contained trinity of God, who dwells in light that no man can approach unto\.” Bavincks treatment of the so\-called “proofs” shows that he did not do away fully with autonomous reason as he “virtually admits that the ideal of science is abstract universal validity, which every rational creature should be able and willing to accept” \(61\)\. Bavinck fails to distinguish between the psychological and the epistemological\. __Hepp\. __Accordin to Hepp, as the special testimony of the Spirit testifies the truth of Scripture to us, so does the general testimony of the Spirit \(*testimonium Spiritus Sancti externum*\) testify within us to truth in general\. Yet, Hepp has two methods of reasoning: on based on neutral premises and one based on Christian premises\. For Hepp, the “proofs” have some validity and conclude that God “probably exists\.” That is to say that he does not exist at all, according to Van Til\. In contrast, Van Til argues that when the objective \(the perspicuous truth of the proofs\) hits the subjective, he suppresses it in unbelief\. 

__B\. Positive Line of Concrete Thinking\.__

Particulars and universals are what they are because of their common dependence on the ontological trinity\. The facts are correlative to the universals, and therefore, there is genuine process in history\. According to Calvin, man’s sin is the proximate cause and God’s counsel is the ultimate cause of man’s final perdition\. This cannot be grasped by syllogisms \(Phigius\) but only as a *limiting concept* by *thinking concretely*, that is, biblically and in *history *starting with the ontological trinity as interpretive concept\. Because God has determined everything, secondary causes have genuine meaning\. History has genuine meaning because God controls whatsoever comes to pass\. In history – before the full differentiation – God shows both favor and displeasure to both the elect and the reprobate\. God increases his attitude of wrath upon the reprobate as time goes on and vice versa with the elect\. The fact that the unbeliever is capable of civil righteousness is due to this rather than because there exist, in some lower dimension, some neutral territory\. 

__Particularism and Common Grace\. __

Van Til maintains both the sovereignty of God and the particularism of the gospel\. God approached *all men* with his cultural mandate through *one man* \(Adam\)\. Common objections raised against the commonness \(task, curse\) and particularism \(elect/reprobate\) are that it is determinism or denies free will and the genuine meaning of history\. Van Til brings several Christian Theologians into conversation with each other\. Aquinas, advocating some degree of human autonomy denies God’s sovereignty and makes all grace common grace\. Schleiermacher, Barth, and Ritschl advocate universalism because everything is in Christ, and that which is in Christ cannot be rejected\. The Lutheran and the Arminian essentially believe in a “finite God \[who\] does the best He can to save men” who “has to limit Himself when He creates man with a full will of his own” \(143\-144\)\. Only the Calvinist is able to hold on to both the sovereignty of God and the particularism of the gospel\.

__Common Grace and Witness\-Bearing\. __

The elect are “formed” by God for the purpose of witnessing to the unbeliever\. The unbeliever challenges our witness by questioning apparent contradictions in the Christian message: \(1\) between God’s universal call and the perdition of the non\-elect, \(2\) the fact that all men know and do not know God at the same time, \(3\) the law that is written and at the same time unwritten on the hearts of man, \(4\) the proximate and the ultimate cause of election, \(5\) infra\- and supralapsarianism\. The elect must reply humbly and know their place: “Who art thou that repliest against God?” 

__A Letter on Common Grace\.__

In *A Letter on Common Grace* Van Til discusses Masselink’s critique of his views on common grace\. Masselink argues that Van Til claims that Christians ascribe to God what modern science ascribes to man \(fact interpreting\)\. The difference, however, is that God *produces* facts whereas man needs material to do so\. Masselink further accuses Van Til of characterizing Reformed thinkers as Greek philosophers but Van Til claims that he never discredited their Reformedness and only criticized subdivisions of their theology\. Further, he contends that in Van Til’s view, the natural man has no knowledge of either God or morality, whereas Van Til argues that these are indeed not the result of common grace but rather their presupposition\. Masselink criticizes Van Til’s starting point, the *absolute ethical antithesis*, and finds especially problem with the word “absolute\.” If the antithesis would be *absolute* then man would be as bad as he can be, which is the devil, says Masselink\. Van Til objects that it is clear that he simply meant ‘total’, in the sense of total depravity, by ‘absolute\.’ Due to the restraining aspect of common grace, the ethical antithesis is never fully consistent\. Masselink rejects theistic proofs because they would make certainty rest on the created object \(creation\) or the created subject \(conscience\)\. Van Til argues that there is no lack of certainty in revelation *but only in the ethical response*\. 

__A Reply to Criticism\.__

Masselink does not distinguish between the ethical and the metaphysical\. Van Til: The image of God is never lost in man, not even in the final destination of the reprobate: “They must have this image in order to be aware of their lost condition” \(228\)\. The metaphysical aspect of man *could not* be affected by sin as sin cannot destroy God’s work\. It only tries to and is thus ethical\. Kuyper distinguishes between the image of God in the narrower \(true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness\) and in the wider sense \(reason, understanding, knowledge, intellect – rational\-moral being\)\. Through common grace, some remnants of the image are preserved in both the wider and the narrower sense\. “In the former case common grace is required to save the metaphysical situation intact\. Thus we are virtually back with the Romanist concept of the *donum superadditum*\. In the latter case common grace seems to be a means of toning down the doctrine of total depravity\. The “remnants” of the image of God in the natural man then appear to be little specks of true knowledge, true righteousness, and true holiness\. The difference between the believer and the unbeliever then becomes one of degree” \(234\-235\)\. Van Til concludes that a strict separation between the two senses \(metaphysical and ethical\) leads to real contradictions\. Rather, the wider and the narrower sense are *correlative*\.

__“Reformed Dogmatics” of Herman Hoeksema\.__

Hoeksema finds fault with the doctrine of common grace; he claims it is destructive of the whole system of Reformed theology as set forth in the Heidelberg Catechism\. Says Hoeksema, there is no such thing as natural theology because God is always greater than his revelation\. Only through redemption and regeneration can we receive and accept revelation\. Van Til objects that although there is truth in that, revelation was already present and known – although suppressed – in man\. It was present and perspicuous\. Hoeksema continues to argue – similar to Masselink – that theistic proofs have *some *validity as they witness to the natural man\. But, says Van Til, if they have some validity, they have absolute validity as they proof that all Reality is and ccan be only that which man, by his logical power, ways that it can and must be\. Rather, the proofs *presuppose* that the God of the Bible does not exist and does not reveal himself\. Hoeksema distinguishes between a *formal* \(a capacity for the image of God\) and a *material* \(spiritual ethical virtues\) aspect of the image of God\. Van Til objects that the *humanum*, the formal sense, is a Platonic abstraction\. Both aspects must be taken as correlative to one another on the presupposition of the presence of God's direct revelation to man\.

__Terminal Considerations\.__

In the last essay, Van Til discusses *Algemene Genade,* in which Douma evaluates Kuyper’s, Schilder’s, and Calvin’s views on common grace\. A couple of topics are treated: double predestination, infra\- and supralapsarianism, the scope of predestination, culture and development, Christ and the covenant of grace, Kuyper’s speculative philosophy of culture, grace for the reprobate, judgment and God’s wrath, the relation between God’s attitude and facts, the necessity of grace, culture and pilgrimage, and common grace\. On most topics, Van Til agrees with Douma and his assessment of Kuyper, Schilder, and Calvin\. Against Douma, Van Til prefers to not settle for either infra\- or supralapsarianism but to treat it as a *limiting concept*\. Against Douma’s contention that Kalamazoo holds that God’s favorable attitude is without context, Van Til maintains that we must bow before the mystery of God in Christ regarding God’s unity of purpose which the believer cannot exhaustively understand\. 

__Discussion\.__

*Common Grace and the Gospel* was a very helpful read\. Many of the questions I still had after reading Bahnsen’s analysis of Van Til’s thought were addressed here\. Especially, being *fearlessly anthropomorphic*, *limiting concepts,* *concrete thinking*, and *earlier* and *later* common grace were helpful categories that help understand Van Til better\. Less helpful was the second part of the book which contained letters and responses to criticisms\. It was often not very clear who was talking and whose opinions were being refuted by whom\.

__Questions and Comments\.__

Q\.1 Van Til often argues that “history has meaning just because God’s counsel is back of it\.” Often Van Til uses it to argue against determinism that the particular \(special grace, man’s responsibility, etc\.\) has meaning just because of the universal \(God’s sovereign control\)\. Obviously, these two seem contradictory\. How must this be understood? As a *limiting concept*? And why does history have meaning because of God’s counsel? Is the idea that there would not be any facts, or intelligibility if it were not for God’s sovereign control and that the particular would be in a vacuum \(if at all\)?

Q\.2 What exactly does Van Til mean by the Roman Catholic view of man as having a natural tendency toward *non\-being* if it were not for the *donum superadditum*? 

C\.1 Van Til is very helpful in showing that there is both a common grace/favor \(depending on the state of history\) and a common curse\. He uses this to show that God has a favorable attitude even toward those who were not elected to glory\. “If we can say of one who is elect that he was at one point in his history totally depraved, we can, with equal justice, say of a reprobate that he was at one point in his history in some sense good” \(112\)\. There is a positive development in God’s attitude toward the elect as history unfolds and a negative development in God’s attitude toward the reprobate\. 

C\.2 “It was also impossible to agree with the Old Princeton position to the effect that appeal must be made to reason without differentiating between a reason conceived of as autonomous and reason conceived of as created\. Finally, it was impossible to agree with what seemed to be a lowering of the claim for Christianity by Kuyper and Bavinck when they concluded from the fact that sinful man cannot of himself accept the truth to the idea that there is no objectively valid reason to be given for the truth” \(214\)\. *Common Grace and the Gospel* shows clearly how and where Van Til differs from Old Princeton and Amsterdam\. This is very helpful\.
