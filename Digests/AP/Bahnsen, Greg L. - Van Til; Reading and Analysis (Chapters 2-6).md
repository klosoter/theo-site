__Van Til’s Apologetic: Reading and Analysis – Greg L\. Bahnsen__

__Chapter 2: The Task of Apologetics__

__2\.1 The Nature and Necessity of Apologetics\. __

Apologetics – a defense of one’s belief system – is necessary for response to accusations, ridicule, and challenges\. It aims to vindicate the Christian worldview over against all non\-Christian worldviews\. Multiple elements of the Christian worldview can be questioned: miracles, revelation, incarnation, Christ’s deity, the historical or scientific accuracy of the Bible, the resurrection, and many more \(including ‘Christian’ heretics\)\. Apologetics is to refute these and demonstrate the truth of the Christian worldview\. At its core, however, apologetics is a clash of fundamental worldviews \(presuppositions\)\. Apologetics must also be used against atheists and heretics, but also against brothers in Christ \(e\.g\., Kuyper, who thought apologetics was futile\)\. __Apologetics Defends Christianity Taken as a Whole\. __Christianity must be defended as a whole\. It is not true that “apologetics deals with theism, while evidences deal with Christianity\.” The “facts” of Christianity cannot be separated from the Christian worldview\. A pragmatist unbeliever may readily believe all the “facts” and yet refrain from accepting the Christian worldview\. “Evidences deals largely with the historical while apologetics deals largely with the philosophical aspect\. Each has its own work to do but they should constantly be in touch with one another\.” Only by taking into account Scripture can man have full and true information\. __Both Apologetics and Evidences Vindicate Christian Theism\. __Broadly speaking, apologetics is “the vindication of Christian theism against any form of non\-theistic and non\-Christian thought\.” The non\-Christian thought exists in two aspects: non\-theistic philosophy and non\-theistic science\. The former is addressed in apologetics and the latter in evidences\. __Apologetics Provides a Basic Method for Answering Every Challenge\. __Apologetics helps pastors to guide their flock and to give them tools to address the doubts and challenges of their congregants\. __Apologetics Should Be Pursued in a Learned Fashion\. __Apologetics requires a thorough understanding of many scholarly fields, such as Biblical studies and systematic theology, but also a basic understanding of science and philosophy\. __Apologetical Reasoning with the Unbeliever Is Not Useless\. __Kuyper argues that apologetics is futile because the natural man and the spiritual man are mutually destructively opposed\. Yet, the natural man has a sense of deity \(Rom\. 1\) even though he suppresses it\. He should be challenged about this \(with the help of the Holy Spirit\)\. 

__2\.2 The Relationship of Apologetics to Theology, Evangelism, and Philosophy\. __

Apologetics is often strictly separated from theology, evangelism, and philosophy\. Bahnsen argues that the differences are in degree, rather than in kind\. “In Christ, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are deposited\.” All aforementioned disciplines apply the word of God, so the different tasks share a common commitment to the authority of the Scriptures\. “As it turns out, the apologist defends what the theologian has learned, with the tools and insights refined by the philosopher, for the evangelistic purpose of seeing the unbeliever’s heart and mind changed” \(p\. 44\)\. Apologists can and must learn to speak the language of the philosophers without conforming to them: “speaking to the ‘tribe’ of philosophers required him \[Van Til\] to speak their language\. Apologetics and the other disciplines are interdependent; if not, the apologist can operate autonomously – as though self\-sufficient\. Examples of different views: separating apologetics from theology \(Warfield\), philosophy from theology \(Dooyeweerd\), and apologetics from evangelism \(Schaeffer, Kuyper\)\. Warfield: apologetics lays the foundation for systematics\. Dooyeweerd: philosophy establishes the presuppositions of science \(including theology\)\. Schaeffer: apologetics is pre\-evangelism\. __Apologetics and Theology Are Interdependent\. __On this point, the ‘Princeton School’ \(Warfield\) and the ‘Dutch school’ \(Kuyper and Bavinck\) of theology differ\. Warfield: apologetics must establish the presuppositions of systematic theology, such as the existence of God, man, and scripture\. Kuyper: apologetics must only defend that which is given it in systematics\. Warfield’s position seems to deny total depravity\. __Theology and Philosophy Cannot Be Sharply Separated\. __Philosophy deals with a theory of reality, knowledge, and ethics; they present a life\- and worldview, including the presuppositions of experience \(e\.g\., God\)\. Theology deals not only with God but also with reality\. Thus, theology and philosophy overlap\. Roman Catholics separate the two into two realms of reason and faith\. Some Calvinistic philosophers separate them, too, although in a different way\. __Different Ways of Speaking: Theology, Philosophy, Apologetics, Witnessing\. __All disciplines of theology are included in our theory of reality or metaphysics\. The Bible, while teaching primarily about God, contains a theory of Reality\. Philosophy is subject to the Scriptures, but not subordinated to theology\. Van Til takes his metaphysics and epistemology from Scripture\. Apologists should learn the language of philosophy in order to make contact with men\. __Christian Commitment Involves a Distinctive Method of Knowing\. __Because of the Christian presupposition of “God as the absolute, self\-conscious Being, who is the source of all finite being and knowledge,” the method of apologetics is decidedly Christian\. There are only two methodologies that are mutually exclusive: the one of the natural man assumes the ultimacy of the human mind, making himself the ultimate reference point, the Christian position presupposes God’s self\-existence and plan, his self\-contained self\-knowledge, as the only foundation of all created existence and knowledge\. __Reason and Faith Are Both United in Covenantal Submission to Scripture\. __Reason and faith are not to be separated, just as philosophy and theology cannot be separated, nor are they simply complementary \(against the Roman Catholic view\)\. Science and philosophy are only self\-consciously true if they are professed in light of Scripture\. Theology, science, and philosophy must all be understood in a covenantal context\. There are only two classes of men, the covenant breaker \(who serves the creature\) and the covenant keeper \(who serves the Creator\)\. __In the Intellectual Battle, Apologetics Coordinates and Forewarns\. __All theological disciplines must defend their own Christian truths\. The task of apologetics is to coordinate the truths and to function as a messenger boy\. Apologetics covers the whole field and is both defensive and offensive\.

__2\.3 The Aim of Apologetics\.__

Apologetics should not be too reasonable, but Scripture never bypasses the mind and reasoning of its readers; it appeals to the intellect of its readers\. Scripture asserts its truth with absolute certainty, and man is without excuse to believe it\. This view opposes fideism, which holds that “Christian assertions are matters of blind belief and cannot be known or demonstrated to be true\.” Van Til argues that “we as Christians alone have a position that is philosophically defensible\.” __Fideism \(Both Experiential and Evidential\) Repudiated\. __Fideism arose as a movement in response to the evidentialist apologetics of Butler and Paley\. The movement went too far and virtually admitted the validity of the arguments of Christianity by withdrawing from all intellectual arguments\. Other fideists only use non\-philosophical arguments \(i\.e\., scientific\) and try to show that science corroborates the Bible\. __The Goal of Objective, Absolutely Certain Proof\.  __The best and only possible proof for the existence of the Christian God is that his existence is required for the uniformity of nature and for the coherence of all things in the world\. Even though this argument is objectively valid, it is not subjectively acceptable to natural man, who suppresses this in disobedience\. Van Til stresses the objective clarity of God’s revelation of himself wherever it appears\. Aquinas and Butler hold that the evidence can lead to the conclusion that God probably exists\. Van Til: but the evidence is objectively, absolutely, and certainly true\. __The Gospel as an Intellectual Challenge\. __The objective truth of the Gospel stands before men as a challenge\. Men must react to it: either by accepting it or suppressing it\. 

__Chapter 3: A Simple Summary and Illustration\.__

Three general concepts summarize Van Til’s thought: the self\-attesting status of Scripture, Christianity constituting an entire system of truth, and the defense of that self\-attesting system by displaying it as the precondition for the intelligibility of human experience\. Scripture is the final authority in the reasoning of the believer; it sets forth a comprehensive system of truth, which alone can provide meaning for all aspects of the human experience\.

__3\.1 Apologetics as a Conflict Between Final Authorities\. __

Reasoning, the way we use our minds, is an ethical matter – moral obligations and assessments\. We must love the Lord our God with all our minds \(Matt\. 22:27\) and take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ \(2 Cor\. 10:5\)\. In the apologetic dialogue, there are not only two conflicting points of view but also conflicting moral stances\. The unregenerate, the covenant\-breaker, seeks violently to suppress the voice of God in disobedience, while the believer, the covenant\-keeper, subjects his reason to the authority of God in obedience\. Man needs new interpretation \(not just knowledge\) and to be made a new creature\. Apologetics thus involves a conflict over ultimate authorities – a conflict over our presuppositions or final standard\. __Different Final Courts of Appeal\. __Fallen man seeks to do without God in every aspect: he no longer seeks to interpret the universe under God but without him\. The difference is ultimately epistemological: how do we know what we know and on whose authority \(the self\-contained God of Christianity or the would\-be autonomous man\)? For Kant and his modern followers, the idea of God is fine as a limiting concept \(an ideal of exhaustive rationality; the necessary postulation of something transcendental like brute facts\)\. This position allows for sacred and superior books but not for an absolutely authoritative book\. The unregenerated reason is nowhere in Scripture appealed to as a qualified judge\. __Man Not an Autonomous Authority\. __The unregenerate seeks to be autonomous, to set himself up as a judge over that which presents itself to him as revelation\. God’s revelation, however, comes to him with a claim of absolute authority over him\. 

__3\.2 An Implicit Clash of Entire Worldviews \(Thus Methods Too\)\.__

Van Til recognized that the dispute in apologetics was not simply over isolated religious claims or conclusions \(such as creation, resurrection, afterlife, sin, etc\.\) but was fundamentally a dispute regarding entire worldviews\. It is not a matter of faith versus reason but a clash of two mutually exclusive worldviews\. These worldviews encompass the entire structure and system of beliefs and reality\. In true apologetics, there is no “theism in general” but only the full package of Christian theism\. __Total Pictures of Life, Reality, and Method\. __The Christian view of life, the system of doctrine revealed in Scripture, can be subdivided into three main sections: the Christian theory of being, the Christian theory of knowledge, and the Christian theory of ethics or behavior\. Basic to all differences between Christian and non\-Christian views of life is the creature’s attitude towards God’s covenant\. Natural man \(his covenantal creature and his sense of deity\) is the point of contact for the Reformed apologist, and yet, there must be a head\-on collision\. __Conflicting Theories of Reason and Evidence\. __Contrary to our intuition \(suppressing God’s truth\), there is no agreement on the nature of reason and evidence between the regenerate and the unregenerate\. The latter holds to the ultimacy of the human mind and of impersonal laws of logic\. 

__3\.3 The Refutation of the Unbeliever’s Presuppositions\. __

Presuppositional apologetics exposes the presuppositions of opposing worldviews but does not lead to a “presuppositional standoff\.” Van Til does not simply hold that everyone has their own assumptions but that only the Christian one is objectively true\. This is to be done by offensive apologetics, in particular: exposing and showing the inconsistency of opposing presuppositions and removing the foundation of the unbeliever’s argument\. “Can they, on their foundation, even have any such thing as an intelligible philosophy of fact?” The Christian worldview “maintains the indelibly revelational character of every fact of the created universe and the all\-controlling providence of God in governing every event in history\.” Non\-Christian positions are not neutral but have their own assumptions: the presupposition of the autonomy of man, the non\-created, chance\-controlled character of facts, and impersonal, universal laws\. “In presuppositional apologetics, we seek to “remove the enemy’s foundation” by reducing his worldview to absurdity\.” __The Only Rational Faith\. __Van Til rejects the science versus scientism distinction: both are objectionable\. Any philosophy of nature that is not based upon the presupposition of what the Bible says about nature has a view that is hostile to the Christian worldview\. All positions require faith, but only the Christian one has true faith\. __Chance Cannot Provide a Criterion\. __Chance cannot account for the intelligibility of anything\. __Precluding Christianity Is to Preclude Justifiable Order\. __Man was called to “be religiously engaged” in all his activities \(there is no neutral aspect of reality\)\. Modern science rejects what Christianity teaches with respect to nature because God’s sovereign control would make experimentation – which requires an open universe – impossible\. The Christian believes the opposite: nature is orderly because the order of God appears in it\.  __Appealing to the Unbeliever’s Better Knowledge\. __The reason why there is a supposed commonality between the unbeliever and the believer with respect to the foundation and application of fact, logic, possibility, etc\., is that there remains a remnant of a truly theistic interpretation \(by virtue of the sense of deity\) in the non\-regenerate\. Apologists should appeal to this suppressed knowledge\. 

__3\.4 An Example of Presuppositional Proof of Christianity\.__

__Why I Believe in God\. __A great example that covers almost every aspect of Van Til’s thinking\. Summarized in this sentence: “I hold that belief in God is not merely as reasonable as other belief, or even a little or infinitely more probably true than other belief; I hold rather that unless you believe in God, you can logically believe in nothing else” \(143\)\.

__Chapter 4: The Epistemological Side of Apologetics\.__

__4\.1 Apologetics as Epistemological Disagreement\.__

Apologetics entails the application of one’s basic theory of knowledge\. According to Van Til, there is no abstract epistemological neutrality\. There are two kinds of people based on their ethical attitude toward God: covenant\-keepers and covenant\-breakers\. These two groups have no common ground \(they even understand logic differently\)\. __Neutrality as Antitheistic\. __Neutrality does not exist\. All facts are revealed by God; to say a fact is neutral is to speak against God and his Christ\. “To be nontheistic is to be antitheistic\.” To even think neutrally – like Eve when she considered the tempter’s claims – is to deny God’s absolute ultimacy \(and think as a ‘free\(d\)’ person\)\. __Reason as a Tool, Not an Abstract Judge\. __It is impossible to appeal to the intellectual and moral nature of men, as men themselves interpret this nature, because there is no abstract reason that can interpret; it is always in an ethical relation to its Creator\. __The Intellectual Is Itself Ethical\. __The wider and narrower senses of the image of God cannot be separated completely from one another\. Every act of man is a moral act \(for or against God\); so is every intellectual act\.

__4\.2 Knowing as Having Belief, Truth, and Evidence\.__

Apologetics involves epistemological disagreement\. Every philosophical opinion must be refuted by “reasoned argument, instead of ridicule and assumption\.” __Knowing\. __There are \(at least\) three senses of knowing: intellectual comprehension, ability, and interpersonal relationship\. The latter two depend on the first, knowing propositions\. __Belief\. __“Belief is a positive cognitive attitude toward a proposition, an action\-guiding mental state on which a person relies \(whether intermittently or continuously\) in his theoretical inferences or practical actions and plans\.” __Truth\. __Knowing something is a case of believing it\. There are multiple theories of truth: Correspondence \(true propositions parallel reality\), coherence \(all true propositions must be logically consistent\), pragmatic \(true propositions are corroborated by their practical results\), semantic \(‘true’ must be assigned to true sentences only\), and performative \(truth is not ascribed but performed\)\. Van Til opts for ‘revelational epistemology:’ true is whatever conforms to the mind of God\. __Revelational Epistemology / Revelation\. __It is only possible to have true knowledge of reality because God has revealed it to us\. __Correspondence\. __True human knowledge corresponds to the knowledge God has of himself and his world; he has the blueprint of the whole universe\. Van Til calls this a Correspondence Theory of Truth\. __Coherence\. __According to this theory of truth, all facts must cohere with all other facts\. One must first have knowledge of the entire system of reality before having knowledge of its parts\. In Van Til’s theory, there is true coherence because there is true coherence in God’s thinking\. For God, coherence comes first; for humans, correspondence\. Van Til calls his position correspondence theory of truth to bring out its distinctiveness \(in its focus on God’s knowing\)\. __Method/Knowledge\. __Every system of thought has a certain method of its own\. According to the Christian method, “there is not one fact that can be known without God\.” Christianity does not oppose other methods \(e\.g\., inductive, deductive, and transcendental ones\) but the presuppositions at the base of them\. In God, there is coherence of all facts, and our knowledge of them corresponds to his plan\. __Implication\. __We seek to implicate ourselves more deeply into a comprehension of God’s plan in and with every fact that we investigate\. __Deduction and Induction / A Priori and a Posteriori\. __The Christian position includes both deductive \(from general to particular\) and inductive \(from particular to general\) thinking\. The antithesis with the non\-Christian position lies in the final center of reference for knowledge and the basis for human investigation: God or man\.

__4\.3 The Inescapable Knowledge of God in Nature\.__

__Having Evidence\. __Knowledge is justified, true belief\. A person must have sound reasons or good evidence\. There are multiple theories of what counts as good evidence \(rationalism, empiricism, pragmatism, positivism, common sense\)\. __The Unbeliever Knows God Without Confessing It\. __All men already know God, but they are in sinful rebellion, and they deny the obvious\. In doing so, their thinking and attempts to gain knowledge can be reduced to absurdity\. __The Character of the Unavoidable Evidence for God\. __The unavoidable evidence for God and the resulting knowledge that all men have, do not arise from inferential reasoning\. The evidence for God is immediately perceived; it is inescapable and undeniable\. Even professing atheists clearly know that God exists\. __Natural Revelation Distinguished from Natural Theology\. __Natural theology is the result of the interpretive reaction that sinful man has given to the revelation of God to him in the created world\. Natural revelation is God’s act directed manward\. By making this sharp distinction, Calvin \(and Van Til\) reject natural theology \(Aquinas\); man does not know anything independently \(and thus supplementative\) of the revelation of God\.

__4\.4 The Redemptive Self\-Attesting Revelation of God in Scripture\.__

The two forms of revelation \(nature and Scripture\) presuppose and supplement one another\. They form together God’s one grand scheme of covenant revelation to man\. Revelation in nature and revelation in Scripture are mutually meaningless without one another and mutually fruitful when taken together\. __Verbal Revelation Naturally United with Natural\. __Scripture was necessary after the Fall \(God spoke to Adam directly before\)\. Supernatural thought communication on the part of God is thus inherent in the human situation\. __The Mind, Not Now Normal, Needs Regeneration\. __The cause of our blindness is not natural; the mind is not just naturally limited or limited by unfortunate circumstances\. Because of our ethical disobedience, the mind needs regeneration through the Spirit\. __Redemptive Revelation Needed to Read Nature Rightly\. __Because of the willing disobedience of man, no one, on the basis of present general revelation alone, actually knows God aright as the Creator\. Man must be brought back to the knowledge of himself as the creature of God\. This can only happen in light of Scripture\. __Scripture Carries Its Own Evidence in Itself\. __Objections spring from the assumption that man is ultimate and, as such, should properly act as judge\. God’s revelation is always authoritarian; it is the same God who speaks in Scripture and in nature\. “One cannot prove the usefulness of the light of the sun for the purposes of seeing by turning to the darkness of a cave\.” Scripture cannot be proved by autonomous man but has authority over him\. __Natural and Supernatural Revelation Self\-Attesting\. __“It is precisely because God is the kind of God he is, that his revelation is, in the nature of the case, self\-attesting\. In particular, it should be noted that such a God as Scripture speaks of is everywhere self\-attesting\.” The fact and the content of Scripture are interdependent\. The witness of the Holy Spirit is needed to convince men of its divinity; the Holy Spirit inspired the writers of Scripture\. Hence, the system is self\-attesting \(217\-8\)\. 

__4\.5 Thinking God’s Thoughts After Him\.__

Man knows analogously; all of our knowing is a matter of “imaging” God’s thinking about the same things\. God has complete, perfect, comprehensive knowledge of everything in himself\. Man is to think his thoughts after him by using his revelation \(nature and Scripture\) and using the rational and empirical abilities he has as God’s image\. There is a continuity \(same truth\) and discontinuity \(qualitative difference\) between God’s knowing and ours\. We are derivative re\-knowers; God has pre\-interpreted everything\. __Logical and Conceptual Reasoning\. __God’s thinking represents perfect coherence\. For example, “the law of contradiction, therefore, as we know it, is but the expression on a created level of the internal coherence of God’s nature” \(235\)\. There are no impersonal laws that exist and operate outside God\. By suppressing this truth, man “commits to the ultimate mysteriousness of the universe, there being no plan or purpose for what exists or transpires, nor any necessary connection between events \(causality\) or truths \(logic\)” \(236\)\. The non\-Christian position is ultimate irrationalism\. The whole problem is the reality of abstract entities or notions and how these relate to particulars; the problem of the one and the many\. For the Christian, universals exist in a concrete \(not an abstract\) fashion within the mind of the personal Creator Himself\. The key to answering the problem of the one and the many lies in the ontological Trinity\. God is the concrete universal\. The Christian worldview does not face the problem of irrational particulars \(cannot be interpreted according to unifying universals\) standing over against abstract universals \(blank formalities\)\. __Empirical Knowledge\. __Van Til maintained that “we do not limit ourselves entirely to the Bible when we study anything\.” We may use our powers of imagination and reasoning because, since God created and controls all things, there are causal connections, meaning, and purpose to be discovered by man\. Unbelieving worldviews cannot make sense of the possibility of empirical knowledge because they cannot account for this\. The Christian worldview provides a context within which rational and empirical knowing is intelligible\. __God’s Mind Is Incomprehensible\. __God’s mind, his plans, and his knowing are incomprehensible to man\. Van Til argues that “my idea of the incomprehensibility of God, therefore, presupposes his true knowability\. And his true knowability is based on the fact that I am his creature and that all things created are made by him\. I could, therefore, not even assert the incomprehensibility of God unless I presupposed the knowability of God” \(249\)\. __Man Knows Analogously to God’s Knowing\. __Man can only know analogously, not univocally\. There are no facts or truths external to God\. __Rational and Empirical Knowledge Affirmed\. __Because particulars are related to universals, and God has created not only the facts but also the laws of physical existence, they can be studied empirically\. A priorism and a posteriorism on the right presuppositions \(the ontological Trinity\) lead to true knowledge, on the wrong presuppositions to skepticism\.

__Chapter 5: The Apologetical Side of Epistemology\.__

__5\.1 Epistemological Disagreements Entail Worldview Debate\.__

Knowledge of God is the context and prerequisite for knowing anything else whatsoever\. What we know and how we know are interconnected\. Discussions about epistemology must therefore include a discussion about presupposed worldviews as a whole\. Every metaphysics has an implicit, if not explicit, epistemology\. Non\-Christian thought is creatively constructive, while Christian thought is receptively reconstructive\.  __Entire Systems in Opposition\. __Natural man assumes the idea of brute facts \(metaphysics\) and the autonomy of the human mind \(epistemology\)\. These assumptions oppose the Christian worldview completely\. __Atomistic Apologetics a Mistake\. __Apologetics should not use a block\-house methodology\. It cannot deal with theism first and with Christianity afterward\. There are no common notions that make natural man accept theism without accepting Christianity\. The ‘deformed’ theism that has been established cannot be reconciled with Christianity \(contra Roman Catholicism and Arminianism\)\. “No proposition about historical fact is presented for what it really is till it is presented as a part of the system of Christian theism that is contained in Scripture\.” 

__5\.2 The Antithesis in Attitude and Outlook\.__

Faith is the necessary foundation or framework for rationality and understanding\. There are no central truths in philosophy where the disagreement between the believer and the unbeliever will not be seen\. Kuyper applied this antithesis to the supernatural principle of interpretation but not to intellectual reasoning pertaining to external or formal matters, like weighing, counting, or logic\. Van Til disagrees but acknowledges that the antithesis is not fully carried out until the consummation of history\. The antithesis is stronger on the higher levels and weaker on the lower levels \(such as mathematics\)\. There are no common notions, only common ground: because all men have a sense of deity\. __Christianity in Conflict\. __In Kant’s philosophy, man takes the place of God; man is the self\-affirming one\. How do we approach Scripture? Christianity is persecuted not only physically but also intellectually\. The highest threat has been Christians who thought that they could join non\-Christian thought on a common expedition against secularism and materialism\. Victory does not lie in compromise\. __No Commonality Without Qualification\. __All men are in themselves enemies of God; there are no capita communissima\. “Any area of commonness that is any area of commonness without qualification, however small, is a justification for larger areas of commonness” \(293\)\. Neutrality is antitheistic because everything is God’s revelation\. __Religious Antithesis Even Affects the Study of the Bible\. __No sinner can interpret reality aright\. The physical world cannot be truly known when it is cut loose from God\. Non\-Christian investigators of nature are as successful as they are because they work with stolen capital\. __The Disagreement in “Systems” Is in Principle and All\-Inclusive\. __The point of contact is the sense of deity that the non\-Christian seeks to suppress\. The argument between Christians and non\-Christians involves every fact of the universe\. If it does not involve every fact it does not involve any fact\. If one fact can be interpreted correctly on the assumption of human autonomy then all facts can\. __Two Mutually Exclusive Principles of Interpretation\. __“Facts of experience must be interpreted either in terms of man taken as autonomous, or they must be interpreted in terms of God\. There is no third possibility” \(303\)\. __Agreements Are Possible, But Are Incidental and Peripheral\. __For example, both the Christian and the non\-Christian hold that murder is wrong\. The former because it violates the justice of God, and the latter because it is not in the best interest of the human race\. __Differing Versions of Objectivity\. __Objectivity for the Christian means that our knowledge corresponds to God’s\. If not, it is subjective\. The point of reference is God for the Christian \(leading to true objectivity\) and man for the non\-Christian \(ultimately leading to subjectivity\)\. __Some Systematically Basic Points of Disagreement\. __The universals of knowledge have their source in God\. From him all facts and all universals that we ordinarily deal with derive their meaning\. __Logically Incompatible Assumptions\. __Van Til sums up the attitude of natural man: 

1. natural man thinks of himself as the ultimate judge; 
2. in doing so, he makes an assertion about the nature and sovereignty of God; 
3. this implies that man’s thought is absolutely original; 
4. the facts of man’s environment are not created or controlled by God; they are brute facts\.

__5\.3 The Epistemological Failure of Unbelief\. __There are essentially only two types of worldviews: the Christian and the non\-Christian\. The latter may take different shapes, but these are, in essence, the same; they all “take for granted that man, not God, must function with ultimate intellectual authority, being the measure or “reference point” for all that he believes to be true” \(312\)\. No worldview except the Christian one can “give a philosophically adequate account of the universality and invariance of the laws of logic or the laws of morality” \(315\)\. __Ancient Idealism: Plato\. __Plato accounts for knowledge by making man essentially divine: in his intellectual soul he was participant in the very being of the ideal world\. Nature is revelational because the realm of matter has been in\-formed by Ideas from the realm of being\. CVT lists three tendencies of Plato’s thought that are characteristic of all anti\-theistic thought: a tendency to \(a\) identification of the human mind with the laws of the universe as a whole, \(b\) toward depersonalization and abstraction, and \(c\) toward intellectualism\. __Ancient Empiricism: Aristotle\. __Whereas for Plato, universals and particulars are unreconcilable, Aristotle taught that universals are present in particulars\. As particulars can only be known in their universals, they are either unknowable or lose their individuality upon being known \(footnote 140\)\. The mind is ultimate and correlative to facts and has to abstract from particulars in order to know them\. __Modern Rationalism and Empiricism\. __According to the rationalists \(e\.g\., Spinoza and Leibniz\), “the results of science are rationally deducible and thus in principle knowable apart from observation” \(n\. 158\)\. Logic, then, inherently containing all facts of the universe, would be reduced to an eternal changeless principle of identity\. To counter this, empiricists proposed bringing facts into relation by means of induction rather than deduction\. “The mind of the knower, the subject of knowledge, is said to be purely passive instead of creative, and the objects of knowledge are said to exist independently of the subject of knowledge“ \(336\)\. According to skeptic Hume, concepts are faint replicas of sensations, and laws of association are psychological rather than logical\. Leibniz: wholly univocal, God lost his individuality in order to be wholly known\. Hume: wholly equivocal, god maintained his individuality but remained wholly unknown\. __Resultant Skepticism: Hume\. __All knowledge comes from sensation; there is no a priori reasoning\. All our reasoning of cause and effect goes back to sensations, which are discrete\. CVT concludes, “There is simply no logical relation between the past and the future” \(340\)\. Hume finds thus no justification for Butler’s presumption “that the constitution and course of nature will be the same in the future as we have seen it to be in the past” \(342\)\. __Critical Philosophy: Kant\. __According to Kant, empiricism leads only to brute facts without a systematic relation between them\. Rationalism, on the other hand, would merely lead to the idea of order without any ordering of facts\. Rather, the mind does the observing and the ordering of the facts without reference to God\. As such, knowledge is limited to the field of phenomena, the field of science\. However, claiming that metaphysical knowledge is impossible is itself a metaphysical statement\. “The validity of universals is to be taken as frankly due to a motion and a vote; it is conventional and nothing more\. Thus the univocation of Leibniz is to be saved by casting it into the sea of equivocation stirred up by Hume” \(346\)\. __The empiricists are not empirical enough:__ their facts are already structured to some extent\. __The rationalists are not rational enough:__ knowledge as a changeless system cannot account for the active organizing activity of the mind\. For Kant, the space\-time coordinates formed the principle of individuation rather than complete description, as Leibniz argued\. Facts cannot be fully known; they are just there\. If God were penetrable to the human mind, we would be back to a position similar to Leibniz’s, in which there is complete description, no contingency, freedom, or brute facts\. Reason deals with universals, so brute facts \(particulars\) cannot be fully interpreted in their individuality, only in generalizations \(cf\. Aristotle\)\. __Recent Idealism\. __Diversity is basic to unity\. For theism, this means that the Trinity is the very foundation of rational thought\. Bosanquet looks for his diversity not within the Trinity but within the Universe \(including God and man\)\. The idealist, wanting to presuppose an Absolute, is at odds with himself because he wants to remain neutral\. By assuming no metaphysics, they assume a metaphysics of relativity\. Including God in the universe leads to correlativity and is essentially pantheistic\. 

__Recent Empiricism: Logical Positivism\. __Logical positivists condemned metaphysics \(everything dealing with the supra\-sensible and non\-verifiable\) as being literally nonsensical; some even explicitly denied that metaphysical entities exist\. However, the verification principle itself cannot be verified\. They accounted for the necessity of logic and mathematics because they were true by definition \(Wittgenstein: tautologies\)\. Ayer proposed a ‘dictionary’ composed of the usage of words conventionally agreed upon by a group of scientists and philosophers\. __Brute Facts are Mute Facts\. __Non\-Christian science has done great work and brought much truth to light, but only because it worked with the borrowed capital of Christian theism\. The scientific ideal \(autonomy of reason\) must be denied legitimacy\. If all facts are a matter of pure chance, then they are brute, not subject to reason, not connected, and unknowable\. If we can interpret any fact without God, then we maintain the bruteness of that fact and consequently reduce God’s thought to the level of man’s thought\. __The Open\-Closed Universe\. __The covenant\-breaking scientist presupposes autonomous interpretation of facts, which denies the authority of Christ\. The scientist’s universe must be open to exclude God’s providence and to affirm freedom and closed to exclude miracles\. __Tension Between Internal Reality and External Facts\. __God controls everything in the space\-time continuum in advance, which kills the idea of open factuality\. But it is also this God who “insists that man’s principle of coherence as it rests on the activity of the mind of man rests, back of this, upon the activity of the mind of God” \(383\)\. “Natural man must on the one hand assert that all reality is non\-structural \(chance\) in nature and on the other hand that all reality is structural in nature” \(384\)\. CVT calls this the “irrationalist\-rationalist idea of fact\.” __Degeneration into Phenomenalism and the Impossibility of a Rational System\. __Reasonably consistent rationalism denies the existence of individuality in history altogether\. Reasonably less consistent rationalism held to the same ideal of individuation by means of complete logical description on the part of man but realized it was not attainable\. Both the rationalist and the irrationalist agree that individuality, in fact, can exist only at the expense of logical system \(386\)\. The Reformed apologist keeps both\. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to become both irrationalists \(denying God’s order\) and rationalists \(assuming order, yet only from the human mind\)\. Kant’s phenomenalism is similarly rationalistic \(the mind structures facts\) and irrationalistic \(factuality is non\-rational in character\)\.  __Autonomy’s Rational\-Irrational Treaty, Regardless of Its Mutually Destructive Internal Tension\. __Pure contingency requires the rejection of creation and providence; anything but Christianity is possible\. This is autonomy’s rational\-irrational treaty\. The irrationalist cannot be God’s creature \(that would entail him being subject to and rationally related to God\)\. Neither can the rationalist because the law that he thinks of as above him, he also thinks of as above God\. The non\-Christian argues that Christianity is not true because reality is not rationally constituted\. He also assumes that reality is rationally constituted and answers exhaustively to his logical manipulations\. To say that God possibly exists is to deny his existence \(‘possibility’ is meaningless if it were not for him\)\. __The Condemning Testimony of the History of Philosophy\. __“In other words, it is the Christian's task to point out to the scientist that science needs to stand on Christ and his redeeming work if it is not to fall to pieces\. Without Christ he has no foundation on which to stand while he makes his contradictions\. A scientific method not based on the presupposition of the truth of the Christian story is like an effort to string an infinite number of beads, no two of which have holes in them, by means of a string of infinite length, neither end of which can be found” \(403\)\.

__Chapter 6 – The Psychological Complexities of Unbelief\.__

__6\.1 Speaking Epistemologically, Speaking Psychologically\. __All men know God from his works of creation and providence, “even those who will not profess and glorify him are able, and actually do, gain considerable knowledge about themselves and about the world” \(406\)\. Yet, because “unbelievers deny personally knowing God, they are unable to give an epistemological or philosophical account of their knowledge of the world and themselves that is intelligible” \(406\)\. They may possess knowledge but cannot account for it\. Psychologically, there are no atheistic men; epistemologically, every sinner is atheistic\. That is, psychologically, man cannot escape hearing the voice of God\. 

__6\.2 The Unbeliever’s Mixed Status \(Which Is Awkward to Articulate\)\. __The unbeliever has a mixed status; he is never fully consistent while in his life\. Because man is created in God’s image, has an ineradicable sense of deity within him, and is able, through God’s grace, to know God \(in a restricted sense\) and do good\. The unregenerate is not yet fully degenerated\. CVT often spoke in generalizations to stress the antithesis with regard to the unbeliever and could say, for example: “No sinner can interpret reality aright\.” In this, he appeared to reduce man to his epistemological and ethical dimension while ignoring the psychological aspect\. This was often misinterpreted by his critics even though, at other times, he was more careful in his formulations\. __The Antithesis Cannot Be Unqualified\. __The unbeliever’s antithesis to God cannot be metaphysical; it is ethical\. Man cannot escape his being an image bearer of God and, through God’s common grace, is able to do good\. __The Antithesis Is “In Principle\.” __Man cannot carry out this antithesis to its full degree\. God restrains him, which enables him to help build the culture of the race and fulfill the cultural mandate\. “Fallen man knows truth and does “morally good” things in spite of the fact that in principle he is set against God\.” __Metaphysical Common Ground and Psychologically Common Knowledge\. __Metaphysically, believers and unbelievers have all things in common: God, every fact in the universe, and knowing these\. Psychologically, there is common knowledge between believers and unbelievers: as creatures made in God’s image, they have common knowledge about their metaphysical situation\. __Yet No Epistemologically Self\-Conscious Common Notions\. __The presuppositionalist rejects common ground of interpretation, the facts are revealed the same but interpreted either in terms of the biblical teaching with respect to God or in terms of the assumption of human autonomy\. Common notions are only based on the *sensus deitatis*\. 

__6\.3 Common Grace Does Not Dilute the Apologetical Challenge\.__

There are no neutral, common truths that could function as a platform for apologetical dialogue with the unbeliever\. Natural theology does not work because the unregenerate man is always hostile to serving and glorifying God in all his endeavors\. Common grace does not enable him to do this, it only restrains the extent of his depravity\. __Common Favor and Sincere Invitation\. __“Both the wheat and the tares receive rain and sunshine so that both may reach the day of judgment for the revelation of the glory of God“ \(427\)\. There is commonness, whether applied to grace or to the gospel call, and it is closely connected to differentiation\. __Avoiding opposite Extremes Regarding Common Grace\. __Arminian: all grace is common grace to all men\. Hoeksema: all grace is special grace to the elect\. CVT: special grace to the elect and common grace to all\. “Common grace is not a gift of God whereby his own challenge to repentance unto men who have sinned against him is temporarily blurred” \(431\)\. Rather, common grace must be tool by which the apologist challenges the unbeliever to repentance\. __Masselink’s Twilight Zone\. __Masselink does not recognize the difference between the two principles of interpretation and argues that there are central truths about God, man, and the world on which Christians and non\-Christians do not greatly differ\. Through common grace, the differences are blurred, and in a ‘twilight zone’ believers and unbelievers cooperate in science\.  __Cooperation Between Advocates of Conflicting Worldviews\. __Cooperation only exists through God’s restraining common grace\. __Common Grace Leads Not to Natural Theology But to a Call for Repentance\. __Christians and non\-Christians can have common ideas in the sense that they agree on certain meanings without any difference\. But there are no common notions or common reactions about God and man\.

__6\.4 Intellectual Affinity and Rapport\.__

Pressed to utter consistency, the unbeliever’s theories of reality, knowledge, and ethics would render meaning, logic, science, absolutes, and personality incoherent and unintelligible\. There is a distinction between understanding the unbeliever epistemologically and psychologically\. Inwardly, he will understand the gospel while outwardly rejecting it\. __An Ever\-Present Point of Contact\. __The *sensus divinitatis* is a universal point of contact through which every man actually possesses knowledge of God and knows himself to be a covenant\-breaker\. Yet, although all men ought to recognize God, they suppress this knowledge\. The point of contact lies underneath man’s own conception of self\-consciousness as ultimate\.

__6\.5 Unbelievers Suppress the Truth, and Thus Work with Two Mind\-Sets\. __The unbeliever knows God and, at the same time, does not know him\. This is the result of an internal contradiction within himself\. True knowledge of God is that which accompanies repentance and which is necessary for man to become what God originally made him to be\. It submits to the truth\. The other kind of knowledge is an awful awareness of the truth about God that no man can successfully escape\. It hates truth and willfully suppresses it\. Unbelievers know God hatefully and do not know Him lovingly\. The former kind must not be described in terms of the subconscious so as not to imply that the unbeliever is not morally responsible for suppressing it\. Men, in general, are truth suppressors even though they are truth possessors first\. No matter how hard they try, they will never succeed in wholly suppressing the truth\. They even suppress God’s revelation of Grace\. By knowing and not knowing God at the same time, they inconsistently rely upon believing presuppositions\.
