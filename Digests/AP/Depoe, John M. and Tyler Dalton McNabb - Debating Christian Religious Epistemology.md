__Debating Christian Religious Epistemology: An Introduction to Five Views on the Knowledge of God – John M\. Depoe, and Tyler Dalton McNabb__

__149\-164: K\. Scott Oliphint: Covenantal Epistemology\.__

Oliphint outlines the guiding principle of "*credo ut intelligam*" \(I believe that I may understand\), emphasizing that theological foundations are crucial for Christian epistemology\. Two central categories emerge: the nature of God as Triune, ultimate, and absolute, and the nature of humans as created beings, mirroring the original\. Humans are lords over creation, after God's example, though not equal to Him\. The Fall introduced the problem of knowledge, with sin leading to irrationality and suppression of truth\. Knowledge is inherently relational and covenantal, and the *sensus divinitatis* is not an empty capacity but contains inescapable content reflective of God's covenant\. Even special revelation through Scripture can be suppressed, necessitating the testimony of the Spirit\.

__165\-169: John M\. DePoe: A Classical Evidentialist Response to Covenantal Epistemology\.__

DePoe argues that theology cannot provide the foundational principles for all epistemic practices since some epistemic principles are needed to acquire sound theology itself\. He points to the issue of circular reasoning and the varied traditions within theology\. DePoe posits an alternative approach, placing faith over reason, where the authority of Scripture is recognized after applying commonly available epistemic principles\. He draws on C\.S\. Lewis's analogy of Christianity to the sunrise, where Christianity illuminates understanding\. DePoe, adopting an Arminian stance, suggests that God grants sufficient common grace for humanity to justifiably accept religious authorities\.

__170\-174: Logan Paul Gage and Blake McAllister: A Phenomenal Conservatist Response to Covenantal Epistemology\.__

Gage and McAllister challenge Oliphint's reading of Scripture, asserting that God can be known rationally, though not exhaustively, echoing Thomas Aquinas's idea of unaided reason\. They question Oliphint's perspective on Scripture and epistemology, arguing that while cognitive faculties are impaired, they are not entirely useless\. They contemplate whether both Cornelius Van Til and K\. Scott Oliphint agree with this stance\.

__175\-176: Tyler Dalton McNabb: A Proper Functionalist Response to Covenantal Epistemology\.__

McNabb critiques the circular reasoning inherent in covenantal epistemology, questioning whether the sensus divinitatis functions properly\. He posits that the design plan of human faculties determines when circularity is permissible\.

__177\-181: Erik Baldwin: A Tradition\-Based Perspectival Response to Covenantal Epistemology\.__

Baldwin suggests that Aquinas might agree with Oliphint on God's incomprehensibility, contrasting with Oliphint's views, especially noted in discussions between Islamic monotheist and covenantal apologist perspectives\. Baldwin notes his position not as a theologian but in terms of Aquinas's reliance on Aristotelian principles\.

__182\-190: K\. Scott Oliphint: Covenantal Epistemology: Response to Critics\.__

Oliphint responds by asserting that Adam's rational faculties, while necessary, are insufficient for knowing God\. Disagreeing with Baldwin's Thomist interpretation, Oliphint argues that although reason involves circular reasoning, it applies to all reasoning\. DePoe's claim that *sensus divinitatis* does not invalidate other knowledge modes is addressed by Oliphint, who maintains they are insufficient and not the foundational sources, merely means through which knowledge is accessed\. Oliphint affirms the truth of Reformed Christianity as the starting point, emphasizing the necessity of the Holy Spirit, making it something to be received rather than adopted\.
