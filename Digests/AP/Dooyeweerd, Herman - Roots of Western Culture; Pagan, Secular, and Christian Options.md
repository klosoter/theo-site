__Roots of Western Culture: Pagan, Secular, and Christian Options – Herman Dooyeweerd__

__Translator's Preface\.__

Herman Dooyeweerd, renowned for his study of law, wrote against the spiritual apathy prevalent in the Reformed Community\. He sought to break through oppositions, advocating for unity without abandoning one's roots—rather by returning to them\. The translator identifies three key points from Dooyeweerd's concept of *ground motives* \(“grondmotieven”\):

1. Ground motives represent ultimate meaning, revealing the intrinsic connection between religion and all of life\. They embody the true character of cultural and spiritual battles, indicating non\-negotiable lines of demarcation that highlight religious dimensions\.
2. These ground motives serve as community\-establishing forces and hermeneutic keys for interpreting history and culture\. They clarify historical divergences, establish criteria for testing spirits, and facilitate authentic confrontation with diverse worldviews\.
3. As spiritual powers, ground motives influence hearts and inspire understanding and action\. Reflecting on them prompts self\-reflection and critique, leading to fundamental choices\. Alternatively, one may be carried by supra\-individual powers towards false hopes\. Recognizing these as religious ground motives enables open dialogue among different convictions, acknowledging the shared reality of a world broken by human actions and inactions\.

Notably, Dooyeweerd's perspective stands against historical relativism\.

__Introduction\. __

In 1945, Dooyeweerd opposed the "verzuiling" movement of the Nederlandse Volksbeweging, which sought a synthesis between Christian and humanistic worldviews\. He challenged the manifesto's principle, arguing for the antithesis, where the Christian principle is a vital, spiritual force to be confessed\. This principle of antithesis cuts through Christian life itself, as opposed to dividing Christian from non\-Christian groups, rooting in the spiritual battle between God's spirit and the spirit of darkness\. It's dynamic, unstoppable, and fundamentally universal, opposing the manifesto's stance\. __Genuine and Superficial Dialogue\. __Dooyeweerd emphasizes the importance of genuine dialogue over mere superficial comparison\. This involves a fundamental, mutual evaluation that is religious, not merely scientific, and is relevant to everyone\. The post\-war "spiritual renewal" must reach the depth of human life where self\-examination becomes unavoidable\. This depth is where genuine discussions and spiritual dialogues should occur, fostering a climate of introspection and renewal\.

__1\. Roots of Western Culture\.__

__Antithesis and Opposition\. __The concept of antithesis signifies opposition\. In the theoretical realm, thinkers like Hegel and the Greeks sought synthesis by navigating logical opposites, viewing them as relative rather than absolute\. However, the religious antithesis between creator and creature affects all aspects of temporal life and defies synthesis\. Philosophy requires an absolute starting point, found in religion\. __Religious Ground Motives\. __These ground motives, which are *spiritual forces driving societies*, hinge upon allegiance either to God or idols\. They are communal in nature and cannot be fully penetrated by scientific analysis, as science has its own underlying motives\. These motives are grounded in God's revelation and stand in opposition to all forms of idolatry\. __The Religious Ground Motives of Western Culture\. __Western culture has been shaped by various religious ground motives: 

1. Greco\-Roman: Defined by concepts like the polis, res publica, and imperium, which faced a crisis during the rise of Christian influence as the sacrum imperium\.
2. Christian: Encompassing the influence of the Roman Catholic Church during classical times, the Reformation, and the Counter\-Reformation during the Renaissance\.
3. Humanistic: Emerging during the Reformation and Enlightenment, aiming to be free from religious constraints\.
4. Anti\-humanistic: Encompassing ideologies like Marxism, Darwinism, the concept of the Übermensch, Bolshevism, Fascism, and Nazism\.

__The Religious Dialectic\. __Throughout Western history, four major religious ground motives have clashed:

Three of these are internally dualistic and fragmentary, characterized by polar opposites and a religious dialectic\. This dialectic involves the *deification and absolutization* of parts of created reality, leading to inherent tension since the relative cannot become absolute\. 

1. Ground motives break into antithetical motives that cancel each other out\.
2. Each motive is defined by its relation to the others, necessitating a choice due to their interdependence\.

This dynamic is evident in the attempted synthesis of Christian and Greek/humanistic thought, which constantly struggles within this religious dialectic\.

__Four Religious Ground Motives in Western Civilization__

1. The "form\-matter" ground motive of Greek antiquity in alliance with the Roman idea of imperium\.
2. The scriptural ground motive of the christian religion: creation, fall, redemption through Jesus Christ in communion with the Holy Spirit\.
3. The roman catholic ground motive of "nature\-grace," which seeks to combine the two mentioned above\.
4. The modern humanistic ground motive of "nature\-freedom," in which an attempt is made to bring the three previous motives to a religious synthesis concentrated upon the value of human personality\.

__Greek__

__The Matter Motive\. __The Matter Motive in Greek thought was heavily influenced by the communal ground motives of nature religions\. It embraced the deification of a formless and cyclical stream of life, where time was perceived as cyclical and controlled by Anangke, or blind fate\. This worldview was fluid and invisible, contrasting with concrete or personal deities, and involved a plethora of divine powers associated with various natural phenomena\. __The Form Motive\. __Over time, Greek culture developed a new religious conception where gods assumed form\. Poetic theologians like Hesiod and Homer were pivotal in shaping this ground motive based on form, measure, and harmony\. The concept of Moira, which evolved from Anangke, partitioned the cosmos among deities \(heavens, sea, underworld\) to establish order and the irresistible nature of divine will\. __Dialectical Tension\. __The Greek culture religion, which focused on order and Olympus, couldn't be fully understood without considering the earlier nature religions, which represented polar opposites\. Attempts by poets to reconcile these conflicting views failed due to neglecting fundamental issues like fate and mortality\. Olympian gods, publicly celebrated, did not uphold the moral values of the Greeks, creating disenchantment and surprise private adherence to ancient nature rites, leading to criticism and the emergence of 'atheism\.' __Orphism__ emerged as an intermediary religious form, viewing the soul as imprisoned in a cycle of life and reincarnation until its heavenly return\. This reconciled the Olympian ideals of immortality with nature religion's emphasis on 'light' and heaven, portraying the soul's immortality as residing in heaven\. Within this framework, the Matter Motive represented a formless principle of becoming and decay, considered a dark mystery\. In contrast, the Form Motive encapsulated the cultural aspect of temporal reality, expressed through theoria and contemplation\. __Polar opposites__ of form and matter were evident in contexts like the polis, where the cultural ideal \(form\) structured human existence\. Over time, this evolved into democracy, perceived as an aristocratic system limited to 'free citizens,' showcasing the enduring tension between these philosophical motives\.

__Roman Imperium__

__Alexander the Great's Influence\. __Alexander the Great played a crucial role in blending Greek and Asiatic beliefs, notably the divine ancestry of monarchs\. This fusion led to rulers being seen as heroes, and eventually as gods, with Alexander's own worship paving the way for the concept of religious imperium, which much later evolved into the sacrum imperium\. His worship of Dionysus reflected a fatalistic view, aligning with the idea of a formless, cyclical stream of life and reincarnation, where resistance to fate was deemed futile\. __The Motive of Power\. __This period saw the transition from ancestor worship to the deification of emperors, encapsulating the motive of power\. The deification of the imperium created an antithesis with the earlier ancestor worship, manifesting as a juridical form of ancestor reverence\. __Two Spheres: Familia and Civitas\. __Roman society was structured into two distinct spheres:

1. Familia: This was a religious sphere with absolute authority and autonomy from the state\.
2. Civitas: In this civic sphere, household heads, or *patres familias*, were considered mutual equals and formed the core of the *populus*, excluding *clients*\(?\)\.

__Public Law and Private Law\. __During the Roman Empire, the development of universal law, or *ius gentium*, signified a shift from being tied to religious obligations of *gens* or *familia* to establishing every person as a legal subject\. This law introduced a sphere of personal freedom and self\-determination, drawing authority from *ius naturale*, or natural law, as espoused by the Stoics, emphasizing freedom and equality\. This progression is an example of God's common grace influencing Western culture\. However, personal freedoms remained constrained under the empire's demands for the 'common good\.' The *familia* was the sole exception to these limitations\. Under the Byzantine emperors in the 3rd century, the model of *familia* was diminished in favor of absolute state power, leading to the establishment of a state\-controlled church or *caesaropapacy*\.

__Creation, Fall, and Redemption__

__The Creation Motive\. __In stark contrast to Greco\-Roman antiquity, the creation motive in Christianity recognizes God as the absolute and integral origin of all things, without any contradictory principle, unlike the Greek duality of blind fate and Olympian gods\. Later Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle viewed form as divine, yet this is seen as the deification of relative aspects of creation—form and matter\. Such absolutization stands in direct opposition to the biblical revelation of God, making any synthesis impossible\. God’s revelation is __covenantal__, creating humanity in His image, mirrored in the heart, soul, or spirit as the religious center and root\. This establishes communion with God and dominion over creation\. However, the __Fall__ introduced a spirit of apostasy affecting all of humanity and temporal reality\. In Christian thought, nature is not independent of man, with all properties subject to human perception and standards\. This underscores that everything in creation has its root unity in the religious community of mankind, hence the Fall's effect on all temporal reality\. __The Scriptural View of Soul and Body\. __Understanding the tension between Greek thought and Christian anthropology is crucial\. Greek philosophy viewed the soul as imperishable and the body as a prison, emphasizing a dualistic separation\. In contrast, Christianity asserts the unity of body and soul, reflecting an absolute central root unity contrary to Greek dualism\. Concepts of soul and body should derive from the scriptural narrative of creation, fall, and redemption, rather than Greek philosophy\. Self\-knowledge is hindered by the Fall, making true self\-understanding reliant on knowledge of God, which is inaccessible due to human idolatry\. While Greek thought characterized the rational soul as abstract and divine, Christianity sees it in *unity with the body*\. The Christian view negates the Greek duality, emphasizing religious root unity over scientific or theoretical conceptions\. __Common Grace\. __Despite the radical consequences of sin, which only exist in relation to God, redemption is equally radical\. Sin is not autonomous from the Creator; it is an ethical, not dualistic, issue\. Redemption through Jesus Christ began with His incarnation, entering fully into human nature, leading to the rebirth of humanity and the entire temporal world\. God's common grace sustains the fallen world, curbing sin's effects and restraining man's degeneration, evident in systems like Roman law\. He upholds creation ordinances and provides talents and gifts to individuals\. Common grace does not diminish the antithesis between God's kingdom and the fallen world; rather, it is understood in light of this opposition, from the Sovereign King Christ to the broken world, persisting until the final judgment and creation's ultimate renewal\.

__2\. Sphere Sovereignty\.__

__Creation and Sphere Sovereignty\.__

Sphere sovereignty refers to the concept that various aspects or modes of existence:

1. Number \(mathematics\)
2. Space \(natural sciences\)
3. Motion \(natural sciences\)
4. Organic life \(biology\)
5. emotional feeling \(psychology\)
6. logical distinction \(logic\)
7. historical development of culture \(history\)
8. symbolic signification \(language\)
9. social interaction \(sociology\)
10. economic value \(economics\)
11. aesthetic harmony \(aesthetics\)
12. law \(legal theory\)
13. moral valuation \(ethics or moral science\)
14. certainty of faith \(theology

These aspects and their associated specialized sciences operate with distinct integrity and have specialized sciences\. Absolutizing any single aspect leads to a distorted view of reality\.

__Historicism\. __During Dooyeweerd's time, historicism emerged, absolutizing history and suggesting historical relativism\. Although every element has a historical aspect, including revelation and Scripture, no single aspect should be absolutized\. Kuyper's concept of sphere sovereignty emphasizes each aspect's unique and irreducible nature, maintaining inner coherence and inseparability\. __Two Types of Structure\. __There are two potential structures within sphere sovereignty:

1. Abstract and Scientific Structures: These pertain to the conceptual frameworks of various aspects or modes\.
2. Concrete Structures of Reality: These involve tangible entities like things, events, and acts\.

__Sphere Universality\. __Sphere universality underscores the *interconnectedness and coherence* among temporal aspects, rooted in the religious focus of existence—the soul—which remains inseparable from God\. Idolatry arises from the absolutization of one reality aspect, contrasting with the antithetical Christian ground motives versus apostate ones\. __Society and Sphere Sovereignty\. __Social institutions like family, state, and church exemplify sphere sovereignty\. The religious root community, both fallen in Adam and restored in Christ, defies totalitarian models from Greek, Roman, and Byzantine perspectives\. Kuyper's sphere sovereignty underscores independent, autonomous spheres, mistakenly equated with functional decentralization in modern socialism\. __History and Sphere Sovereignty\. __Historicism risks reducing reality to an absolutized historical aspect, where individuals or nations follow historical fate without universally valid laws\. This outlook, epitomized by concepts like *Schicksal*, influences historical narratives\. __Friedrich Julius Stahl\. __Stahl emphasized tradition as a revelation of divine guidance, intertwining history's blend of good and evil with universally valid norms, like the Ten Commandments\. Historical development serves as a secondary norm for shaping state realization and life spheres\. __Guillame Groen van Prinsterer\. __Prinsterer advocated state formation along historical\-national lines with a differentiation between state, church, and family, preventing state interference in other spheres' inner life\. __Abraham Kuyper\. __Kuyper saw sphere sovereignty as a creational principle, advocating autonomy in societal spheres to counter historicism\. He believed spheres are inherently distinct and not subordinate to the state\. __Autonomy and Sphere Sovereignty\. __Kuyper's idea of sphere sovereignty is a reaction against historicism, emphasizing spheres rooted in their own distinctive character, not historical developments or state control\. Scripture, alongside the Word and Spirit, should inform our engagement with the world, avoiding biblicism while promoting a holistic spiritual attitude\. __Barthianism\. __Dooyeweerd critiqued Barthianism for sidelining creation ordinances and for separating creation, fall, and redemption\. Instead, aspects of creation—impacted by sin—require understanding through a biblical lens, acknowledging common grace that sustains divine ordinances and the need for institutions like church and state\. The fall affected reality, yet everything remains in relation to God's order\.

__3\. History, Historicism, and Norms\. __

__Historical Relativism in Christianity\. __Historicism \(Ranke\), which links all truth to historical context, challenges even Christianity, suggesting that words and ideas are molded by history\. However, historicism stands as an antithesis to Christian thought\. __The Historical Aspect\. __Historicism conflates the historical aspect of reality with concrete history, ignoring the many non\-historical aspects present in history\. While historians study events' historical aspects, they must be guided by the creation motive of Word\-revelation to truly understand reality\. At its core, the historical aspect involves the cultural way of being, exemplified in stories like creation and the cultural mandate, which form the nucleus of historical study\. Greek philosophy focused on the realm of forms, while modern historicism aligns with humanism's nature and freedom\. __Cultural Power\. __Cultural formative activity, exercised through power, is part of God's creation—a good gift\. Jesus’s authority, as noted in Matthew 28:18, exemplifies this goodness\. The direction of power is crucial, as it is subject to norms, not natural laws, being ultimately under God's sovereign power\. Divine ordinances serve as norms for responsible, accountable beings, guiding human behavior and requiring competent authorities for their formation\. Totalitarianism deviates from this by equating might with right\. 

__Tradition\. __Culture is inseparable from tradition, essential for historical development\. Tradition ensures continuity and development yet must not be seen as an absolute religious antithesis\. Historical formation often arises from the clash between conservative forces preserving tradition and progressive forces pushing development\. __Disclosure and Differentiation\. __Historical formation occurs through the interplay of conservative and progressive cultural powers\. Tradition, whether good or bad, is subject to historical norms, binding the present to the past and promoting development in conformity with cultural openness\. Differentiation occurs when culture divides into distinct spheres, reflecting creation ordinances\. __Undifferentiated Societies\. __In such societies, life spheres are absent, and small communities like family and ethnic groups dominate\. Tradition reigns, often rejecting renewal due to the fear of upsetting divine balance and protecting against external influences\. __Medieval Society\. __Largely undifferentiated, medieval society evolved under Greco\-Roman and Christian influences\. The Catholic Church initiated differentiation through structures like canon law\. Though still bound by nature \(emperor\) and grace \(pope\), medieval setups did not fully embrace differentiation\. Guilds, akin to fraternities, exemplified this\. The household remained a powerful religious sphere, with the *pater familias* wielding absolute authority\. The German *Mund* was the household power sphere of a king, the *Führer* \(*Gefolgschaft*\)\. __Hitler's Retrogression\. __Hitler's regime echoed past structures where leaders were deified and tied to familial models seen in the Roman city\-states and the medieval Germanic world\. __Differentiation\. __Historical development, understood as an unfolding process from undifferentiated to differentiated societies, aligns with God's creation order, preserving distinct spheres without blending\. __Cultural Economy\. __The norm of historical development, tied to cultural economy and sphere sovereignty, ensures efficient cultural growth\. __Individualization and National Identity\. __In undifferentiated cultures, individual and national characteristics lack development due to isolation\. Differentiation fosters genuine national individuality, evolved through common historical experiences and cultural interactions\. According to God's norms, this should guide the formation of national identity contrary to ideologies like Nazism\. The Dutch *volksaard* reflects a scriptural\-Calvinistic ethos, and abandoning antithesis risks degrading national character\. __God's Judgment in History\. __Cultural differentiation and national individuality lead to personal and potential development\. Historical consciousness grows in open cultures, marked by preserving symbols and narratives\. Primitive remnants, like the Easter Bunny, lack true vitality\. Hitler’s revival of myths through race ideology illustrates misdirection\. God's judgment follows the dominance of one sphere over others, as seen in historical episodes like the French Revolution and the rise and fall of totalitarian regimes, highlighting the peril of deviating from divine norms\. The authoritarian Catholic Church led to individualism, while Nazism and totalitarianism led to the destruction of cities and cultural treasures\.

__4\. Faith and Culture\.__

__Might and Right in History\. __Might refers to safeguarding a nation's independence, sometimes justifying war\. However, international laws exist to prevent a mere "right of the stronger" approach as seen with Hegelian thought\. Within the framework of life spheres, each sphere is sovereign and possesses its own rights\. __Love of Culture\. __The recognition of the historical right of culture leads to a love of culture\. This hinges on the principle of sovereignty within each sphere, respecting the autonomy of cultural expressions and developments\. __Faith as the Boundary Aspect\. __Faith is described as a boundary aspect between time and eternity, distinct from the religious root, which can be apostate or Spirit\-guided\. 

1. The faith __aspect__ of reality encapsulates the dimension of temporal existence that points towards eternity\.
2. The subjective __function__ of belief, possessed by individuals, is governed by God's revelation and the norm of faith, originating from the soul\. Sin, however, leads to apostasy\.
3. The __objective__ function in temporal things pertains to their role within the faith aspect\.
4. The __content__ of our subjective faith shapes our understanding and actions\. Roman Catholicism traditionally views faith as intellectual acceptance, while Kuyper emphasizes it as a unique function of inner life\.

__Faith and Revelation\. __Faith operates as a boundary aspect of temporal reality, serving as a window to eternity\. It differs from opinion, providing "ultimate certainty in time" concerning the foundational grounds of existence\. This certainty is revealed and orientated towards divine revelation\. Revelation bridges the temporal and eternal, grounding faith\. __The Analogies of Faith\. __Faith's connections encompass temporality and eternity, occupying the final aspect of temporal existence\. It points beyond time to the root and origin of existence, interacting with various aspects like morality\. Two major challenges arise: 1\) maintaining faith in a *closed* culture and 2\) navigating cultural *openness* and apostate faith\. __Faith in a Closed Culture\. __Faith guides cultural disclosure in history, influencing differentiated and undifferentiated aspects\. Pagan faith offered guidance without true revelation, informed by general revelation in nature\. Special revelation through God's Word allows divine communication with humanity\. After the Fall, the faith function, residing in the soul, remained but turned apostate, leading to unbelief\. A "closed structure of faith" limits apostasy’s reach\. Yet, the Holy Spirit can restore faith in Christians\. Apostate faith often deifies aspects of nature, misinterpreting God's general revelation and fostering fear\. Modernism can deify itself and reason, straying from divine intent\. __Disclosure of an Apostate Faith\. __Greek religion evolved from nature worship to cultural religion, emphasizing form\. Primitive societies initially suppressed individual identity, but personal gods encouraged independence and differentiation\. National gods promoted universality, fostering consciousness in apostasy and freeing individuals from tradition\. __Disclosure of an Apostate Culture\. __Apostate faith drives the deification of certain creation aspects, leading to disharmony if one sphere dominates others\. Historical development, guided by differentiation norms \(sphere sovereignty\), requires coherence among aspects to avoid judgment\. “The excessive expansion of power within a given cultural sphere always occurs under the guidance of an apostate faith which absolutizes and deifies such a cultural sphere\.” __Example: Enlightenment\. __The Enlightenment ideal sought human control through science, promoting individualism against state, church, and family structures\. While it made significant contributions through common grace, its focus on individualism and rationalism fostered disharmony\. __The Radical Challenge of the Word of God\. __The ground motive of creation, fall, and redemption offers an invisible unity capable of transforming worldviews, challenging and unmasking ideological and totalitarian community tendencies\.

__5\. The Great Synthesis\.__

__Dualistic Nature of Non\-Biblical Motives\. __Throughout history, non\-biblical ground motives have displayed an inherent dualism, leading to internal division\. In Greek thought, this appeared as a separation between nature and culture, or body and reason/soul\. Zoroastrianism featured a dualism of light and evil\. While the Church upheld the unity of the Father and Son, Gnostic teachings separated the Creator God of the Old Testament from the Redeemer God of the New Testament, valuing contemplation over revelation and confession\. The Church further emphasized unity between the Old and New Testaments, although Greek Church Fathers often regarded material creation as lesser, viewed Christ incarnate as a semigod mediator, and prioritized knowledge over faith\. __Augustine\. __Augustine's ground motive was rooted in scripture, opposing the Greek synthesis which offered mere accommodation instead of reform, leading to scholasticism\. He rejected the autonomy of philosophy, yet remained influenced by Greek ideas, particularly regarding the dualism of soul and body and interpretations of 'original sin' through Platonic views of sexual desire\. 

__The Roman Catholic Ground Motive\. __The Roman Catholic Church navigated a dialectic of nature and grace, integrating Greek philosophy with its theology\. __The Impact of Greek Thought\. __Greek philosophy distinguished nature into matter and form, as expounded by Aristotle\. In this view, the soul was equated with form, and the body—with matter plus form—was considered lesser and perishable\. The concept of *'donum superadditum*,' a supernatural gift lost after the Fall, implied that reason remained intact, suggesting autonomy\. This framework limited understanding of the Fall's radical nature and redemption through Jesus Christ, making grace accessible largely through philosophical avenues like those of Aquinas\. __Thomas Aquinas\. __Aquinas perceived nature as an independent stepping\-stone to grace, forming the substructure of a Christian superstructure where grace perfects nature \(matter\)\. Roman Catholic theology utilized revised Greek thought but restricted the scope of the biblical creation motive\. Aquinas associated matter with imperfection and form with perfection, aligning these with natural and supernatural realms\. __The Pretended Biblical Basis\. __Romans 1:19\-20 points out that God's eternal power and deity are evident in creation, yet wickedness suppresses this truth \(Romans 1:18\)\. Aquinas's natural theology proposed proofs of God, yet Dooyeweerd argues that reason is always inherently guided by faith\. Romans 2:14\-15 illustrates that Gentiles demonstrate law written on their hearts, highlighting that conscience and morality transcend written law and speak to an intrinsic divine order and universal moral understanding\.

__The Roman Catholic View of Natural Society__\. Dominated by the ground motive of nature and grace, Thomas Aquinas' view of scripture incorporates Aristotelian teleology, seeing development as a process where each being moves towards its perfection\. In this view, humanity is not seen as totally depraved but requires societal support to achieve moral and rational completeness\. Family provides for basic needs like sustenance and procreation, while the state functions as the perfect community\. __The State Structure\. __The state comprises various parts such as provinces and municipalities that possess autonomy yet remain dependent on the overarching common good\. While scripture highlights sovereignty within these spheres, their function is determined by innate nature and law rather than solely by the common good\. __The Principle of Subsidiarity\. __Aquinas proposed that the state, rooted in human rationality, is essential for guiding humanity towards perfection and restraining desires\. According to the subsidiarity principle, while spheres are subservient to the state, the state should only intervene in matters beyond an individual's or lower community’s capacity\. Although spheres have sovereignty, they’re seen as parts of the state, contradicting fully differentiated independence\.

__Modern Roman Catholic Social Thought\. __Thomists continue to hold the traditional whole\-part relationship vis\-à\-vis the state and natural life spheres through subsidiarity\. Postwar Roman Catholic thought diverged into two camps: 1\) the whole\-part relation camp emphasizes order and autonomy within the natural sphere, leaning towards *universalism*; 2\) the solidaristic camp advocates for cooperation for communal welfare, asserting *individual* precedence over the community\. This view aligns more closely with Calvinistic sphere sovereignty, although not entirely opposed to totalitarianism\. 

__The Roman Catholic View of Christian Society\. __In Roman Catholic doctrine, the Church represents the totality of Christian society in its supernatural form, surpassing its natural substructure\. This concept aligns with body\-soul dualism—where the institutional Church assumes a totalitarian state role, overseeing all life spheres and particularly influencing Christian matters\.

__Summary of Roman Catholic View\. __Roman Catholicism, shaped by the Greek form\-matter motive, interprets temporal society as a whole\-part composition\. The Church assumes the role of the total community of natural life but maintains supremacy in matters affecting supernatural well\-being, which necessitates adherence to church guidance\. __A Recent Affirmation\. __Postwar Catholic beliefs in the Netherlands underscore the assertion that "the church\.\.\.has juridical authority over the state," exemplifying sovereign church autonomy alongside the autonomy of other spheres\. __A Parallel: Faith and Philosophy\. Formation of Roman Catholic Parties\. __Rooted in the service towards supernatural perfection, 'nature' supports a unity that combines Roman Catholic political practice with its overarching worldview, emphasizing the inseparability of faith and philosophy in guiding societal engagement\. 

__Disintegration of the Synthesis\. __The ground motive of nature and grace in Roman Catholicism historically involved a "religious dialectic," attempting to synthesize Greek philosophy with Christian theology\. This synthesis faced challenges and eventual disintegration\. __William of Ockham: Herald of a New Age\. __William of Ockham exposed the inner dualism of the Roman Catholic ground motive, challenging the coherence between creation and a sovereign Creator\. He emphasized the arbitrary nature of God's will, conflicting with Thomistic views that equated the Decalogue with natural law\. Ockham proposed the Decalogue as a result of divine arbitrariness, dismissing natural knowledge and undermining the pope and the Church's authority\. This led to two paths: 1\) a return to the scriptural ground motive seen in the Reformation, or 2\) the development of modern humanism focused on exalting human personality\. __Law and Gospel in Luther\. __Educated in Ockham's tradition, Martin Luther grappled with the dualism between natural and supernatural life\. He viewed the law as stern and contrary to the Gospel's commandment of love, serving as a taskmaster leading to Christ\. For Luther, the radicality of the Fall meant redemption involved the death of nature without a fundamental rebirth\. Duties in life existed, yet the Christian religion seemed disconnected from earthly life, reflecting a dialectical tension between evangelical freedom and law\. __Birth of Protestant Scholasticism\. __Luther posited reason as the sole guide in nature, although not in supernatural matters, echoing a nature\-grace dualism within the church\. While indifferent to temporal church organization, emphasizing only Word and sacrament, justice, and order remained worldly concerns\. Subsequently, Melanchthon contributed to Protestant scholasticism by merging Greek, Lutheran, and modern humanist ideas\. __Dialectical Theology\. __Karl Barth represented dialectical theology, opposing antithesis and rejecting connections between Christianity and various aspects of secular life, like politics and scholarship\. Dooyeweerd critiques Barth for perpetuating a dialectical nature\-grace motive intertwined with the humanistic ground motive\. Barth's radical dualism saw nature as inherently sinful \(cf\. *ganz Andere*\), denying any point of contact between Christian faith and natural life, thereby opposing Christian culture\. He argued the Fall left nature corrupted, negating knowledge of creation ordinances—contrasting Brunner, who acknowledged their knowability through common grace\. __No Papal Authority in Reformation Theology\. __The dialectical tension in the nature\-grace ground motive, left unchecked after the Reformation, led to numerous schisms, highlighting the absence of centralized papal authority in Protestant thought\.

__6\. Classical Humanism\.__

__Ground Motive of Nature and Freedom in Humanism\. __The late\-medieval period saw a fracturing of the synthesis between the Greek view of nature and the Christian religion\. This led to two divergent paths: 1\) pursuing nature or 2\) returning to scripture\. The Renaissance emerged as a natural rebirth celebrating freedom and autonomy, often positioning itself against Christianity\. However, movements like biblical humanism advocated for autonomous scripture study, with figures like Erasmus and Hugo de Groot treating the Bible more as a moral code than a vehicle for salvation\. The __new motive of freedom__ underpinned a fresh view of nature, countering notions of fate and total depravity\. Nature was now viewed as an expansive arena for human exploration and mastery, where human sovereignty would be demonstrated through control over natural phenomena\. This perspective laid the groundwork for scientific revolutions led by figures like Copernicus and Newton, as humanism embraced science for its potential to control and understand nature\. __Science__ began to replace the concept of creation ordinances, celebrating autonomous reason in a way distinct from Thomistic synthesis, as it departed from Greek ideals by rejecting speculative forms and the supernatural\. __Dialectical Tensions\. __Humanism's ground motives of nature and freedom are inherently dialectical, leading to conflict\. The pursuit of total scientific control over nature conflicts with the ideal of personal freedom, creating a tension between the scientific and personal ideals\. The religious priority of the new science ideal proposed that science would liberate modern humanity from religious constraints, yet this perspective struggled to reconcile thought with natural\-scientific explanation\. __Descartes and Hobbes\. __*Descartes* introduced a dualism between the material body and the thinking soul, reflecting the tension between nature and freedom\. *Hobbes* extended 'the new science ideal' across all domains, including morality, law, politics, and the human soul\. His approach involved breaking down and reconstructing everything through scientific and mathematical frameworks, endorsing *reductionism *and* materialism*\. This underscored the conflict between nature and freedom, leaving both Roman Catholic and Reformation forces on the defensive against the growing influence of humanistic ideals\.

__Political Theories of the Modern Age\. __

__State Absolutism\. __In the rise of modern humanism, the concept of state absolution emerged, dismissing the limits traditionally set by societal spheres in the creation order\. The state was reimagined as an instrument of control, consolidating all power through science\. Jean Bodin introduced an absolutist notion of sovereignty, proposing that the government exists above all positive law, with laws deriving solely from the state's lawgiver, thereby placing the church under state authority\. Hugo Grotius contributed by advocating state intervention in church affairs to promote tolerance, deriving natural law from the rational, social nature of man, yet relying heavily on classical Roman law\. This marked a turn towards secularization and independence from divine mandate, leading individuals to voluntarily surrender their freedom to the sovereignty of a ruler\. __Critical Turning Point\. __A shift towards the natural\-scientific motive of control overshadowed the principle of freedom, anchored in mathematical and scientific thinking aimed at eliminating subjective bias\. This focus sparked epistemological doubt about reality's foundations, notably by Locke and Hume, leading to the eventual failure of deterministic science and the resurgence of a freedom motive\. Rousseau emphasized freedom, equality, and happiness, critiquing rationality for leading to tyranny and suffering\. His state concept involved relinquishing individual freedoms to regain them in a higher, collective form embodied in citizen rights and democracy\. Locke maintained that rights to life, property, and freedom were inalienable, even within societal contracts\. __Classical Liberalism\. __The French Revolution embodied the ideas of freedom and equality, supported by thinkers like Locke and Rousseau\. This era marked a shift from feudal structures to a civil law framework embracing human rights\. In classical liberalism, the state and human rights are intertwined, defining a republic as founded on popular sovereignty, with representation as a safeguard for private civil rights\. Hobbes argued for strong government to unify the 'people,' while Locke advocated for representative government to ensure sovereignty remains with the people, underlining revolution as a recourse if this balance is not upheld\. __Later Developments\. __Montesquieu introduced the separation and balance of powers concept, known as Trias Politica—comprising legislative, executive, and judicial branches, forming the basis of a *rechtsstaat*, or rule of law state\. This state is a representative democracy, founded on popular sovereignty, with checks and balances designed to protect civil rights\. Nonetheless, representation does not equate to freedom, as authority often operates independently of constituents, with both government and voters drawn from elitist circles\. __Radical Democracy\. __Modern commentators often equate liberalism with freedom and democracy with equality, viewing both as reactions against feudal remnants\. However, liberalism typically implies moderate democracy tempered by representative institutions and balanced governance\. Contrarily, radical democracy rejects representation and the separation of powers, positing that the sovereign people's indivisible authority negates political freedom in favor of collective state freedom, verging on totalitarianism as Rousseau advocated, forcing man to be 'free\.' __Separation of Science from Faith\. __In humanism, the dualism between nature and freedom manifests as an irreconcilable conflict\. Kant prioritized freedom by positioning science as a phenomenal concern, with freedom residing in the suprasensory realm of faith—the noumenal\. This created a mechanistic worldview within the science ideal, prioritizing a single aspect over creation's order and modeling the modern state after a machine, severing its foundational ties to spiritual and moral dimensions\.

__7\. Romantic Redirection\.__

__The French Revolution and Restoration\. __The aftermath of the French Revolution saw a shift towards restoration and a new direction in thought, marked by a departure from classical and mechanistic worldviews\. __The New Personality Ideal\. __This era embraced a freedom motive, focusing on emancipation from classical nature concepts and mechanistic views\. It fostered a personality ideal, heavily influenced by Kant's idea of the autonomy of human personality, which is recognized through the universal form of the moral law \(*nomos*\)\. Romanticism and the *Sturm und Drang* movement proposed that the *nomos* originates in the individuality of the *autos*, making human personality a law unto itself\. While initially empowering, this concept could lead to relativism, particularism, and subjectivism\. Individuality, however, is also shaped by family, societal, and national identities, negating the notion of a universal man\. __Ideology of Community\. __

Rationalistic and individualistic theories sought to dissolve subjective human experiences through universal laws\. In contrast, classical science aimed to rationally control nature through general laws\. Romanticism, however, emphasized the unique genius of individuals, suggesting that each person is a law unto themselves, which required checks such as community membership \(*volksgeest*\)\. Cultures, states, legal systems, art, and morality emerged as autonomous creations of national spirits\. This idea of community clashed with the scriptural motive of creation by promoting autonomous national spirits and overextending temporal community at the expense of societal relations\. Humans are unified genetically \(as one blood\), not temporally, as each lives within distinct life spheres as ordained by God\. __The New Science Ideal\. __History deals with particulars, while science concerns universals\. Historicism initially considered culture as the product of national spirits, yet deeper reflection revealed that individual creative freedom often masked hidden natural necessities\. Romantics viewed these hidden laws as divine providence or destiny \(*Schicksal*\), even applying to nature and physics, perceiving nature as a dialectic interplay between freedom and necessity\. __Counterrevolution and Christianity\. __An overestimation of autonomous community mirrored earlier emphasis on individual autonomy\. Though the French Revolution is labeled progressive for promoting civil freedom and equality within the state, it failed to recognize the rights of non\-state communities, leading to a lack of historical continuity and a perpetual revolutionary sentiment\. The Restoration period sought to preserve the nation and community, but blurred societal structure boundaries, retreating to undifferentiated feudalism and paving the way for volk ideology by confusing civil and folk law\. This period also saw an unnatural alliance between Christianity and universalistic historicism, challenging scriptural foundations\.

__8\. The Rise of Social Thought\.__

__Third Party in Intellectual Discourse\.__ Emerging as a distinct perspective apart from Christian or idealistic views, modern sociology entered the scene as a new analytical framework for understanding society\. __Birth of Modern Sociology\. __Modern sociology sought to conceptualize a "perfect society" by emphasizing the social nature of humanity\. Initially, the Historical school did not recognize sociology as an independent science, instead viewing it as a universal discipline\. National communities were perceived as products of purely historical development, reflecting social reality rather than being abstract components of society\. Modern sociology was grounded in the universalistic thought of the Restoration—focusing on a universal conception of human society—and the natural\-scientific principles of the Enlightenment, aiming to identify universal sociological laws to manage societal dynamics\. __Distinction between State and Society\. __In the evolving discourse, tension arose between the motives of nature and the universal unity of community\. Society emerged as a sphere where individuals could exercise civil freedom, separate from state intervention, while the state was seen as embodying sovereignty, requiring individuals to relinquish some freedoms for collective order\. __Civil Society and Class Conflict\. __The rise of free enterprise contrasted sharply with the hardships faced by the working class, exacerbated by the production process and large\-scale capitalism, which lacked the protective structures of earlier guild systems\. Karl Marx provided a sociological analysis, highlighting the class struggle as fundamental to historical societal processes\. He posited that mechanization rendered parts of the population obsolete, pushing them to find new occupations or succumb to the competitive pressures of industrialization, driving wages down as women and children entered the workforce\. For Marx, the state functioned as an instrument of the ruling class, inherently connected to civil society and incapable of overcoming class struggle without revolution\. 

__The Class Concept\. __Saint\-Simon introduced the concept that economic production and property regulation are interdependent, with societal changes fostering social class formation\. In France, historic tensions manifested as Franks \(lords\) and Gauls \(slaves\), eventually transforming as bankers emerged\. Saint\-Simon's natural\-scientific approach sought to control social reality through causal laws\. However, the contradiction lay in viewing social classes both individually and universally—society seen as an organic whole where parts are interconnected\. Classes emerged from societal interactions \(*maatschappijverhoudingen*\) and were distinct from communal relationships \(*gemeenschapverhoudingen*\), primarily arising from economically driven conflicts\. Can society's structuration be solely explained through class divisions? This question highlights the complexity of class concepts in sociological analysis and the multifaceted nature of social interaction beyond mere economic determinants\.

__Estates \(Standen\) and Classes\. __The historical transition from the governance of persons to the administration of things marked a significant shift in social structure and thought\. __Physiocratic School\. __Francois Quesnay, a key figure in the Physiocratic school, categorized society into wage earners and independent entrepreneurs, including farmers, merchants, industrialists, and landowners\. This distinction emphasized economic roles and their impact on societal function\. __Hegel's View\. __Hegel opposed the notion that the state should merely serve as an instrument for class domination\. Instead, he saw the state as embodying the ethical idea within the new universalistic understanding of personality\. He advocated for the absorption of society into the all\-encompassing state, replacing the concept of classes with 'Stande' \(estates\)\. Quesnay's class concept aligned with the Enlightenment's natural\-scientific thought pattern, promoting an individualistic view where economic self\-interest drove societal development, yet the state, too, could act as an instrument for class domination\. Hegel, while embracing universalism, acknowledged limited individualistic tendencies\. 

__Basic Problems in Sociology\. __

__Alleged Value\-free Character\. __The concept of 'social facts' in sociology raises questions about which norms and standards should guide evaluation\. The natural\-scientific \(emprical\) attitude often involves rejecting norms, but social classes and estates, as non\-sensorily perceptible entities, inherently presuppose legal norms like ownership\. Thus, maintaining norms and evaluation standards is vital\. __Causal Explanation versus Normative Evaluation\. __The opposition between causal explanation and normative evaluation stems from the humanistic ground motive, highlighting the tension between nature \(causality\) and freedom \(normative evaluation\)\. Kant distinguished between *Naturwissenschaften*, focusing on general laws devoid of evaluation, and *Geisteswissenschaften*, which prioritized individuality and values\. By the 20th century, it was clear that science could not be disentangled from evaluation\. Modern materialistic presuppositions underscore this bias inherent in humanism\. __Dual Structure of Reality\. __In societal contexts, things possess real existence through a subject\-object relationship, functioning across all reality aspects and experienced as typical totality structures\. This dual structure includes a modal structure relating to all aspects and a typical totality structure that reflects the whole individual experience\. Understanding this structure is crucial for scientifically sound causal study in sociology\. __Ideal Types and Creational Structures\. __Sociology must integrate all aspects to understand their mutual interrelations\. Ideal types, such as the *homo economicus* \(a person driven solely by economic self\-interest\), abstract and often exaggerate human behavior\. __The Fundamental Question of Sociology\. __Sociology seeks to understand how various societal aspects arrange within typical totality structures to form unique individual entities\. Eliminating the normative perspective from social reality undermines creation ordinances and results in scientifically unsound abstractions\. By analyzing the modal structures of society's distinct aspects, one gains insight into the typical totality structures and their complex interconnections\.
