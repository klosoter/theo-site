__Reforming Apologetics: Retrieving the Classic Reformed Approach in Defending the Faith – J\. V\. Fesko\.__

__Chapter 1: Introduction\. __Fesko wants to restore natural theology because there are two books \(nature and Scripture\)\. The use of the Book of Nature has been accused of blasphemy because John Locke was against common notions and their association with Roman Catholicism\. 

__Chapter 2: The Light of Nature and Common Notions\. __Still, the ‘light of nature,’ ‘common notions,’ and ‘natural theology’ were very present in the Reformed traditions and confessions\. All agree that it is insufficient and yet renders man inexcusable\. Earlier theologians \(Augustine, Boethius, Aquinas, Calvin, etc\.\) referred to conscience as a natural law inscribed on the heart and yet insufficient for salvation\. The majority of the early Reformed tradition accepted common notions \(except Barth\) based on Romans 2, regarded them as affected by the noetic effects of sin, and regarded common notions not as neutral territory but as part of the image of God \(cf\. Van Til\)\.

__Chapter 3: Calvin\. __John Calvin is often pitted against scholasticism and presented as rejecting common notions\. Barth says Calvin rejected natural theology because of sin, Van Til that Calvin rejected common notions and broke from scholasticism, and Dooyeweerd argues that the Roman Catholic synthesis of Greek and Biblical thought poisoned Calvin’s legacy\. Fesko maintains that Calvin uses the scholasticism method a lot\.  Calvin argues that the Decalogue and the inscription on the heart are both legitimately accessible and that gentile law demonstrates innate knowledge of God’s natural law\. Universal reason and common notions overlap with *semen religionis*, *sensus divinitatis*, and *naturae lux*\. Still, natural knowledge is affected by the noetic effects of sin\. These effects hamper fallen humanity’s ability to use natural knowledge \(e\.g\., proofs of God’s existence\) for their salvation\. The testimony is suppressed and ignored; knowledge of earthly things is still true, while knowledge of heavenly things is affected by sin and its consequences\. Somehow, Fesko concludes that natural knowledge is integral to Calvin’s theology\.

__Chapter 4: Thomas Aquinas\. __Fesko compares Aquinas and Van Til\. He argues that Aquinas \(1\) does not start with reason but with Scripture, \(2\) presupposes faith, \(3\) sees that natural reason is flawed, \(4\) and that faith presupposes natural knowledge because we are material beings\. Turning to the discussion of Van Til, Fesko argues that he misunderstood Aquinas because he \(1\) followed later \(twisted\) interpretations, \(2\) trief to separate the philosopher from the theologian, and \(3\) failed to pay sufficient attention to the primary sources\. Fesko argues that the proofs were moved to the locus of creation, which obscured the original function of the proofs\. Also, Aquinas is said to point out that God’s grace is necessary for salvation\. Finally, Fesko argues that Butler is completely different from Aquinas because he starts with reason without mentioning Scripture at all\. For Fesko, Aquinas was primarily a commentator of Holy Scripture and a theologian secondly\. 

__Chapter 5: Worldview\. __Worldview or *Weltanschauung*, is an exhaustive systematic explanation of reality and it comes from German idealism: rejecting common doctrines and embracing a single principle to build a worldview that is incommensurable with other worldviews\. According to Orr, the Christian worldview is antithetical to all other worldviews, based on revelation, and has incarnation as the central principle\. Kuyper agreed with most of this but elevated Calvinism as the purest expression and form of Christianity and maintained that there could be some agreements and areas of shared knowledge between different worldviews\. For Van Til, the ontological Trinity functions as an interpretative concept and has to be presupposed\. He agreed with Kuyper on common grace but was strictly antithetical and purely biblical\. Van Til rejects common notions because of his strict epistemology: true knowledge or interpretation is only possible in covenant\-keepers who think analogically\. There is a common ground, though: *sensus divinitatis* and the *imago Dei*\. __Fesko on Van Til\. __According to Fesko, Van Til \(1\) had an erroneous understanding of Scholasticism, \(2\) wanted to distance himself from Romanism as much as possible, \(3\) believed Aquinas began from below \(using Aristotle’s autonomous reason\), \(4\) believed Aquinas was a seamless robe, and \(5\) allowed his use of Historic Worldview Theory to affect his theology \(blockhouse methodology, principles\)\. Fesko argues further that Van Til’s epistemology is too strict: it is not restricted to knowledge of God or salvation, but all knowledge must be grounded on Scripture\. However, Fesko seems to confuse the ground of knowledge with the source and content of knowledge\. Van Til does not claim anywhere that science must get all its facts from Scripture; rather, Van Til argues that science must have a scriptural epistemology \(analogical thinking\), or else it won’t be able to truly know anything at all\. __Fesko on the Incommensurability Principle\. __Fesko goes on to question the incommensurability principle because there is always a commonality \(cf\. Kuyper\): common grace and the *sensus divinitatis*\. He points to the use of foreign philosophy in Scripture: Moses and Hammurabi, Paul at Mars Hill, and Paul and Aristotle in Romans 2\. Then, Fesko identifies a second problem with Historical Worldview Theory, the exhaustive explanation of reality\. He argues that the Bible does not provide knowledge for everything and that it is not a comprehensive survey of world history\.  Again, he confuses knowledge with epistemology or epistemological warrant\. No one, and Van Til the least, argues that “the Bible provides an exhaustive view of the world\.” It does show, however, where our knowledge comes from and how that is warranted\. In the end, Fesko rejects worldview theories because they are rationalistic \(claiming an exhaustive explanation of reality\), and incommensurability is a myth\. He rejects Christian worldviews in particular because God cannot be known exhaustively\. 

__Chapter 6: Transcendental Arguments\. __According to early Reformed theology, the Book of Nature contained innate \(*sensus divinitatis*\) and acquired \(created order\) knowledge of God\. These two are connected\. In the transcendental argument, the argument goes not from effect to cause but the other way around\. According to Fesko, this argument is a useful tool \(but not at the expense of the book of nature\), but not a silver\-bullet argument, nor the most biblically pure form of Reformed apologetics\. Transcendental arguments find their origin in Kant, who postulated the noumenal \(the realm of mental experiences/concepts\), which is necessary to account for the existence of the phenomenal \(the realm of empirical experiences\)\. For the phenomenal to exist, the noumenal must exist; hence the presupposition of the noumenal\. Transcendental arguments often go hand in hand with historical worldview theories because they are exhaustive explanations of reality\. Van Til’s transcendental argument presupposes the ontological trinity to account for the intelligibility of reality: “The ontological trinity will be our interpretative concept everywhere\. God is our concrete universal; in Him thought and being are coterminous; in Him, the problem of knowledge is solved\.”  Van Til and Kant have in common that they focus on the issue of epistemology, which they aim to resolve with the transcendental argument for God\. The difference is that Kant starts with man \(autonomous reason\) while Van Til starts with the ontological trinity, God\. Fesko closes his analysis of transcendental arguments with __three observations about Van Til’s use of the transcendental argument__:__ __

1. Does Van Til use synthetic thinking by employing idealist language and transcendental argument? Even though he uses them differently, it raises questions about antithesis and common notions and makes one wonder how different this is from Thomas’ use of Aristotle\. 
2. What is the importance and what is the necessity of acknowledging the correspondence theory of truth? According to Van Til, truth only exists because reality is coherent in the presupposed Triune God of the Bible\. For Fesko, however, because creation is God’s revelation, reality already corresponds to the truth\. He argues, therefore, that both the coherence theory of truth \(Van Til\) and the correspondence theory of truth \(truth is that which corresponds to reality – the facts, cf\. Aquinas\) are necessary\. This is a classic example of where Fesko disagrees with Van Til: the intelligibility of nature by human reason\. For Van Til, autonomous man cannot truly know reality, so the correspondence theory of truth is out of the question\.
3. If apologists rigidly and inflexibly employ the transcendental argument to the exclusion of other arguments, do they unnecessarily wed their apologetics to passing philosophical trends? One wonders how relevant or plausible the transcendental argument is in our postmodern time, where people no longer accept claims of metanarratives \(hermeneutic of suspicion\), which the transcendental argument clearly is\.

__Chapter 7: Dualism\.__ One of the most common critique against using natural theology is its alleged dualistic character\. For example, Van Til criticizes Roman Catholicism for maintaining a dualism of nature \(autonomous reason\) and grace \(*donum superadditum*\)\. According to Fesko, these criticisms are not backed by accurate historical\-theological evidence and fail in four ways:

1. They separate what theologians merely distinguish, 
2. They have little or no historical evidence to support them, 
3. They rest on questionable philosophical claims rather than biblical exegesis, and 
4. They employ the debunked Hellenization thesis of Adolf von Harnack\. 

Fesko distinguishes __three different dualisms__\. *Classic Platonic Dualism*\. This views the dualism of body and soul as the irreconcilable conflict between the material \(matter\) and the immaterial \(form\)\. Aristotle did not follow Plato completely in this respect and viewed body and soul as inseparable\. This is important because scholasticism is often associated with Aristotelianism\. *Cosmic Dualism*\. The perpetual conflict between two different but equal powers in the universe: good and evil, light and darkness\. Manichaeism is an example\. *Dooyeweerdian Dualism*\. Dooyeweerd finds dualisms in the central dogmas, motivating factors, or ground motives of philosophical schools of thought\. According to Dooyeweerd, there are two primary ground motives: a *biblical ground motive* and an *apostate \(non\-biblical\) ground motive*\. The biblical ground motive is the motive of the linear motive of creation – fall – redemption, while there are three subtypes of the apostate ground motive: \(1\) the Greek form\-matter motive, \(2\) the scholastic nature\-grace motive, and \(3\) the Enlightenment nature\-freedom motive\. __Doyeweerd\. __According to Dooyeweerd, the apostate ground motives are essentially dualistic\. He rejects the Greek form\-matter distinction, the scholastic nature\-grace distinction, and the modern nature\-freedom distinction as dualistic\. He then goes on to argue that the dualistic Greek roots are not eradicated from Protestant theology: law\-gospel \(Luther\), sacred\-secular, and common\-special grace\. __Dooyeweerd’s Three Realms\. __According to Dooyeweerd, there are three different realms: the eternal, the created supratemporal, and the temporal realms\. Humans originate in the supratemporal realm \(the soul, the inner core\) and are given bodies in the temporal realm\. The body is the structural whole of man in his temporal appearance, and the soul is the radical unity of his spiritual existence, which transcends all temporal structures\. Human beings are, therefore, non\-dualistic wholes\. Every worldview that does not presuppose the biblical ground motive of creation\-fall\-redemption, the central motive of the Holy Spirit, leads inevitably to antithetical dualism because it absolutizes or deifies one of the extremes\. __Fesko on Dooyeweerd\. __Fesko’s analysis of Dooyeweerd can be summarized under two main points: dualism and worldview\. For Fesko, there is a major issue with how Dooyeweerd defines __dualism\.__ In classic dualism \(Plato’s body\-soul, matter\-form\), there are two antithetical elements in perpetual irreconcilable conflict\. In cosmic dualism \(Manichaeism\), good and evil are in perpetual and yet unsuccessful conflict for superiority\. This simply does not apply to Aquinas’ understanding of soul and body or matter and form, which was Aristotelian\. The soul is the substantial form of the body; they are inseparable\. There is simply no antithesis, let alone an irreconcilable conflict\. It also does not apply to the supposed dualism of gospel and law\. Gospel and law are not two warring, irreconcilable principles\. Reformed theology does not completely eliminate the law from salvation, only from justification\. Similarly, common grace and special grace are not in an irreconcilable conflict\. Common grace supports special grace until Christ consummates history, and then common grace becomes unnecessary\. Rather, Fesko prefers to call them *distinctions* instead of dualisms\. When applied to Dooyeweerd’s \(and Van Til’s\) position on Dualism, Fesko has the following critiques:

1. Dooyeweerd misidentifies a dualism between nature and grace\.
2. Dooyeweerd does not use primary sources\.
3. Dooyeweerd confuses scholasticism with theological content, while it is just a method \(which Calvin used too, by the way\)\.
4. Von Harnack: “Greek philosophy turned the dynamic Christian faith into a series of propositions to which people had to assent\.” Dooyeweerd has a similar attitude toward Scholasticism which explains why his system of thought is not backed by exegesis \(which would be scholasticism\)\.

As we saw in chapter 5, __Fesko strongly dislikes worldviews__ or exhaustive systematic explanation of reality\. He argues that the Bible does not provide knowledge for everything and that it is not a comprehensive survey of world history\.  Again, he confuses knowledge with epistemology or epistemological warrant\. Fesko goes on to question the incommensurability principle because there is always a commonality \(cf\. Kuyper\): common grace and sensus divinitatis\. He points to the use of foreign philosophy in Scripture: Moses and Hammurabi, Paul at Mars Hill, Paul and Aristotle in Romans 2\. For these two reasons, Fesko rejects systems that are dominated by central dogmas, such as Kuyper’s sovereignty of God, Van Til’s ontological Trinity, and Dooyeweerd’s biblical ground motive of creation\-fall\-redemption\. 

__Assessment\. __Fesko might have a point about the misinterpretation of scholasticism if one accepts his definition of *dualism*\. He is right in rejecting the alleged dualism of grace and gospel, sacred and secular, and common and special grace\. This does not clear scholasticism or Aquinas from all neo\-Calvinistic charges, however, which Fesko seems to forget\. There is still the issue of Greek thought and the role of autonomous reason that needs to be dealt with\. His analysis of *worldviews*, however, misses the mark\. He sounds suspiciously postmodern, and his rejection of metanarratives or central dogmas is reminiscent of the hermeneutic of suspicion\. However, I fail to see how the perceived commonality \(common grace and sensus divinitatis\) pleads against the incommensurability of worldviews\. Again, it is not about content or knowledge but epistemology\. The existence of commonality only shows God’s restraining common grace, not the truth or validity of other worldviews\.

__Chapter 8: The Book of Nature and Apologetics__

In chapter 8, Fesko turns to the central point of his book: apologetics and the book of nature\. After ‘dusting off the book of nature,’ he aims to show how it can be used legitimately in apologetics that falls into the ‘faith seeking understanding’ category\. God created humanity in a covenant context, which means that the covenant characterizes metaphysics, anthropology, and epistemology\. Obeying God’s revelation \(sensus and command\) would have led to greater knowledge of God \(love\) and greater conformity to the image of the covenant Lord \(eschatology\)\. Covenant\-breakers are in epistemic, moral, and covenantal exile from God\. Because of the noetic effects of sin, natural and special revelation no longer work in tandem but are suppressed\. Christ, as the true image of God, achieves true covenantal obedience and fulfills and repairs human nature\. __Purpose of Apologetics\. __According to Fesko, the purpose of apologetics is threefold: \(1\) refuting intellectual objections, \(2\) clarifying our understanding of the truth, and \(3\) encouraging and edifying believers in their faith\. “In a post\-fall world, natural revelation still carries the same information about God’s existence, being, and character so that fallen humanity can accurately perceive and interpret this information\. But in their fallen condition, sinful people do not submit to it and instead “by their unrighteousness suppress the truth\.” “The only reason we know anything is because God has chosen to reveal it; he reveals an … analogical counterpart to his own … knowledge\.” __Point of Contact\. __According to Fesko, there are two points of contact: \(1\) the image of God/the law written on our hearts and \(2\) the creation over which Christ is sovereign\. Fallen humans use their corrupted reason to access and interpret the world around them but are unable and unwilling to submit to the truth and authority of that revelation\. 

__Questions and Comments\.__

C\.1 Fesko repeatedly seems to confuse epistemology for knowledge\. “The Bible is not a comprehensive survey of world history: the vast majority of the world’s history lies outside the pages of Holy Writ\. The Bible explicitly states that many things are beyond humanity’s knowledge, not just about God, but also about creation\.”  Yet, this is not what CVT or covenantal apologetics claims\. The point is that the Scriptures teach the self\-attesting ontological Trinity, who is the source of all knowledge\. The Scriptures themselves do not contain all knowledge but they reveal that man is a covenant\-breaker and that he can only truly understand things by reasoning analogically, by thinking God’s thoughts after him\.

C\.2 Fesko rejects worldviews because they do not allow for commensurability \(common measure\)\. Because there are common notions between believers and unbelievers \(e\.g\., Hammurabi, Paul and Epimenides\) worldviews are not to be strictly separated\. However, CVT would argue that there is an antithesis between the worldviews on the epistemological level\. They cannot account for truths because they suppress the innate truth and knowledge of God \(the sensus divinitatis; the psychological common notion\)\. The only reason that there appears to be commonality is the restraining power of common grace\. At its epistemological core, the antithesis remains\. 

Q\.1 “However, to say that fallen sinners require the testimony of the Holy Spirit to understand anything and that Scripture is the ground of our epistemology represents a departure from both the catholic and Reformed traditions\. It also inadvertently scuttles what the Westminster divines called the common operations of the Spirit \(WCF 10\.4\)\. In other words, there are common and special operations of the Spirit, but if general knowledge requires the regeneration of the Spirit, then what exactly are the common operations of the Spirit?”  Does CVT really argue that general knowledge requires the special testimony of the Holy Spirit? Would he not argue that the fact that unbelievers seem to know anything is because their destructive hostility has been restrained by common grace? Or is Fesko right, and are unbelievers unable to have any knowledge at all without special grace?

Q\.2 To what extent is Fesko right in rehabilitating Thomas Aquinas? Was he really an exegete first and a theologian second? Even if CVT misunderstood Aquinas on some doctrines, does he remain right in rejecting his epistemology?

Q\.3 Toward the end of the book, Fesko comes really close to understanding the crucial point of Van Til when he discusses epistemology and axiology\. He discusses the mathematical proposition 2 \+ 2 = 4\. According to CVT, this proposition can only be known by presupposing the ontological Trinity\. Otherwise, there is no intelligibility; laws of logic or brute facts like ‘2’ cannot be warranted epistemologically\. Fesko, however, thinks that CVT’s crucial point here is that only regenerate humans “will rightly evaluate the ultimate significance of the truth of \[this\] mathematical formulation\.”  Why does Fesko make this distinction between axiology \(valuing knowledge\) and epistemology \(theory of knowledge\)? Why is it so hard to understand the fundamental epistemological antithesis that CVT teaches? For CVT, there is no common epistemology but only common psychology, although this is willfully suppressed\.
