__Consistency of Van Til’s Method – K\. Scott Oliphint__

__I\. Introduction\. __

Consistency of Van Til's Method\. The introduction questions whether Cornelius Van Til's method is consistent, aiming to clarify his approach through selected works\. Notable texts include his doctoral thesis "God and the Absolute" \(1927\), "A Survey of Christian Epistemology" \(1932\), "Defense of the Faith" \(1955\), and "A Christian Theory of Knowledge\."

__II\. God and the Absolute \(1927\)\. __

__The Necessity of a Self\-Sufficient God\.__ Van Til asserts that human experience lacks meaning without a self\-sufficient God, challenging traditional rational methods\. His argument posits that God's existence must be presupposed before any proof can be presented\. __Transcendental Argument\.__ Van Til's approach is transcendental rather than relying solely on formal logic, stressing the "impossibility of the opposite\." While formal arguments are utilized, they must undergo critical scrutiny to determine their validity\. The transcendental argument is not equivalent to formal logic, but formal argumentation must be critically analyzed within a transcendental framework\. __Critique of Pragmatism and Idealism\.__ According to Van Til, pragmatism aligns with idealism in that both rely on *a priori* arguments to define reality\. He critiques their presuppositions for leading to contradictions and skepticism\. Pragmatism, by focusing on facts, neglects to consider the possibility of those facts arising\. Van Til proposes beginning with the validation of human knowledge and examining the presuppositions underlying actual experience, echoing Kantian transcendentalism\. __Presupposing God\.__ Van Til emphasizes that rational experience depends on presupposing an absolute rationality—namely, God as self\-sufficient creator\. This approach excludes potentiality as ultimate and insists on justice being done to the theistic position\. __Relation of the Absolute to the World\.__ Van Til diverges from idealism, distinguishing the absolute from being part of reality \(anti\-correlativity\)\. Though not transcendental, the absolute is vital for the reality of temporal experience\. Thus, Van Til's presuppositional method upholds the necessity of acknowledging God as the foundation of all rational experience\.

__III\. Early Van Til__

This section explores whether there significant changes occurred between *The Metaphysics of Apologetics* and *A Survey of Christian Epistemology*\. Van Til posits that all systems employ methods rooted in autonomous reason\. His methodology presupposes God as the creator of facts and Christ as the interpreter of those facts, asserting that God possesses exhaustive knowledge of all facts\. __Epistemological Methods\.__ Van Til emphasizes implicating oneself more deeply into understanding God's plan with every fact investigated\. He incorporates both correspondence and coherence theories of truth\. In the correspondence theory, the truth lies in the alignment between an object and our mental conception of it, both knowable independently\. In coherence theory, he's closer to the notion that mind and object are parts of one interconnected reality best understood as a whole\. __Dual Correspondence\.__ Van Til extends correspondence theory to include a relation between human and divine knowledge\. Our understanding of facts must align with God’s exhaustive awareness of those facts\. Thus, truth is not only an internal coherence among facts but also rests on our knowledge’s correspondence with God's knowledge\. __Analogical Reasoning\.__ Unlike a univocal approach, Van Til stresses an analogical distinction between God and man, asserting a qualitative difference\. He critiques Gordon Clark's view, which asserts an identical content between divine and human understanding that Van Til rejects\. He maintains a creator\-creature distinction, emphasizing man's dependence and finite comprehension\. __Addressing Opposing Systems\.__ Van Til employs a method of demonstrating self\-contradiction within opposing views, only on their logical consistency grounds, and contrasts it with the viability of Christian presuppositions\. This is not done abstractly but through a Christian framework and analogical reasoning\. __Inductive and Deductive Reasoning\.__ Van Til advocates starting from any fact, inducing from non\-theist positions to show their inherent unintelligibility\. The method uses both inductive aspects and a priori deductive reasoning\. __The__ __Verdict\.__ Van Til's method displays consistency, with three key developments:

- Emphasizing analogical over univocal reasoning\.
- Incorporating reasoning from the contrary by understanding the opponent's position\.
- Employing a theistically inductive method, highlighting a flexible approach to presupposition\.

__IV\. The Defense of the Faith and Supplement \(1955, 1969\)\.__

__The Presupposition of Christ\.__ Van Til emphasizes that without presupposing Christ, human understanding and predication lack meaning\. This negative task, highlighting the impossibility of the contrary, dovetails with the positive affirmation that life only gains intelligibility through Christ\. These ideas echo earlier sections of his work\. __Focus on Methods Over Systems\.__ In his later works, Van Til shifts focus from opposing philosophical systems to critiquing methods\. His approach remains indirect, avoiding reliance on evidences or abstract laws\. Instead, he challenges presuppositions starting from any fact to demonstrate their inherent contradictions\. __J\.O\. Buswell's Critique\.__ Buswell criticizes the presuppositional method, claiming presuppositions should be derived inductively and resting on the laws of logic\. Van Til counters by emphasizing the necessity of starting and ending with divine presuppositions\. Buswell's reliance on logic leads to a probabilistic view of God, which Van Til finds unbiblical\. __Conclusion on Van Til's Consistency\.__ Throughout his apologetic career, Van Til consistently maintained that God is the essential presupposition for all thought and life\. His transcendental method, argument by presupposition, method of implication, and *ad hominem* argument all reinforce the conviction that everything must be interpreted through the lens of the Triune God\. Despite developments and elaborations, Van Til's foundational conviction never wavered\.
