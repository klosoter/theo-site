__Nate Shannon and Kevin DeYoung on Junius, Van Til, and Natural Theology__

__Nathan Shannon – Junius and Van Til on Natural Knowledge of God__

__Introduction to Natural Theology\.__ Nathan Shannon explores the views of Franciscus Junius and Cornelius Van Til on the knowledge of God before and after the fall\. Shannon emphasizes that understanding these perspectives enhances the historical validity of Van Til's views on natural theology and natural reason, with both thinkers highlighting the limitations of natural theology\. __Pre\-Fall Knowledge According to Junius\.__ Junius posits that before the fall, finite human reason could truly contemplate an infinite God\. This natural knowledge, while genuine, was veiled, imperfect, and incomplete\. It required supplementation and replacement by the supernatural because the natural principle was necessary for advancing toward the supernatural\. __Post\-Fall Knowledge According to Junius\.__ After the fall, humanity's comprehension suffered due to the noetic effects of sin\. Man became blind, weak, and confused, perceiving only a distorted version of God's truth\. The internal discord caused the natural principle of theology to oppose the supernatural \(which would have constituted its fulfillment\), resulting in a "natural god" distinct from the "specially revealed God\." Thus, post\-fall natural theology cannot achieve perfection or truth without "redemptive grace," although it remains active and industrious\. __Van Til's Perspective on the Fall\.__ Van Til contends that the damage from the fall affected man’s response to natural revelation, rather than the revelation itself \(natural theology vs natural revelation\)\. Pre\-fall, humans reasoned analogically\. However, post\-fall reasoning became univocal and autonomous\. Van Til asserts that natural revelation was intended as a context for encountering special revelation, emphasizing that true natural theology is covenantal and only feasible in the prelapsarian order\. __Shift in Post\-Fall Epistemology and Ethics\.__ According to Van Til, the fall altered epistemological and ethical attitudes, leaving sinners ethically hostile to God\. They suppress the truth, making it as difficult to accept God's revelation in nature as in Scripture\. Van Til posits that one must know God to know anything at all; thus, the objectivity of general revelation is more covenantal than epistemic or evidential\. __Agreement and Ambiguities Between Junius and Van Til\.__ Shannon argues that Van Til and Junius align on pre\-fall and hamartic natural theology\. However, Junius’s use of "theology" is sometimes ambiguous, potentially referencing either natural revelation or the human response to it\. Shannon concludes that for both thinkers, the God\-human relationship defines the structure and status of natural theology, making true theology reliant on a redemptive relationship\.

__Kevin DeYoung – Franciscus Junius, Old Princeton, and the Question of Natural Theology\.  __

__Critique of Shannon’s Interpretation\.__ Kevin DeYoung critiques Nathan Shannon’s interpretation of Franciscus Junius, arguing that Shannon confuses Junius’s rejection of pagan theology with a dismissal of natural theology itself\. DeYoung asserts that natural theology is a form of divine revelation and should be seen as true theology\. __Understanding Junius’s Perspective\.__ DeYoung highlights that Shannon misinterprets Junius’s references to "natural theology\." In Junius’s Treatise, earlier references to "natural theology" critique pagan understandings, while later references indicate a legitimate branch of true theology, communicated through natural grace rather than special grace\. __Clarification of Natural Theology\.__ DeYoung contends that Junius views natural theology as originating from principles known through human understanding and considers it a part of true, ectypal theology revealed by nature\. This perspective affirms natural theology’s validity and places it within the broader framework of divine revelation communicated through the natural world\.

__Nathan Shannon – A Brief Rejoinder to Kevin DeYoung\.  __

__Response to DeYoung's Critique\.__ Nathan Shannon briefly counters Kevin DeYoung's critique, arguing that DeYoung misinterprets Junius’s work\. Shannon acknowledges that Chapter 1 of Junius’s Treatise addresses false pagan philosophy under the label of natural theology, but contends that Chapters 9 and 10 focus on natural theology in the contexts of pre\- and post\-fall\. __Prelapsarian and Post\-Fall Theology\.__ Shannon clarifies that although prelapsarian natural theology has its role, Junius considers it ultimately insufficient compared to revealed theology\. In Chapter 10, Junius discusses how post\-fall natural theology is marred by sin, becoming imperfect due to its noetic effects\. __Distinction Between Natural Revelation and Theology\.__ Shannon emphasizes that DeYoung fails to distinguish between natural revelation and natural theology\. Natural revelation remains unaffected by the fall, while natural theology becomes ineffectual\. This difference is crucial for understanding Junius’s views as Shannon interprets them\.
