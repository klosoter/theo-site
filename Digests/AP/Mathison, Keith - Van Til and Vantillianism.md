__Keith Mathison: Christianity and Van Tillianism\. __

__Background\. __Keith Mathison seeks to evaluate the soundness of Van Til’s views on their own terms, noting that Van Til’s teachings are inherently complex, often presented in dense prose, and involve redefinitions of philosophical and theological concepts\. Van Til has frequently been misunderstood by both critics and followers, and Mathison argues that some of his followers equate Van Til’s teachings with true Reformed theology\. __Van Til’s Core Teachings\. __Mathison briefly outlines Van Til’s core teachings, which include the presupposition of the ontological Trinity as necessary for predication and intelligibility, the Creator\-creature distinction, analogical thinking as a means of obtaining non\-comprehensive yet true knowledge, the noetic effects of sin, the antithesis between believer and unbeliever, the complete blindness of natural man regarding all knowledge, and the paradoxical state of the unbeliever knowing and not knowing simultaneously\. Apologetics, as a component of systematic theology, must presuppose the existence of God, and through the transcendental argument, Christians aim to demonstrate that nothing can be consistently predicated within the framework of an unbeliever's worldview\. __Mathison’s Friendly Critique of Van Til\.__ Mathison provides a friendly critique of Van Til by first accusing him of not incorporating exegesis to support his claims, noting that even though Van Til might have relied on colleagues for this in teaching, he should have included exegesis upon publishing his syllabi\. He also critiques Van Til for using ambiguous language and applying philosophical, idealist, and theological concepts in non\-traditional ways, particularly regarding the knowledge of unbelievers\. Mathison suspects that Van Til intended to communicate that believers and unbelievers share everything metaphysically and psychologically while having nothing in common epistemologically\. __Van Til’s Statements on God and Trinitarian Theism\.__ Van Til’s descriptions of God include seemingly contradictory statements, such as God being simultaneously a one\-conscious and tri\-conscious being, as well as notions of God being "one person and three persons" and "one being and three beings\." Mathison acknowledges the possibility that Van Til’s language might be purposefully ambiguous in these instances\. __Critique of Historical Theology and Idealistic Influences\.__ Mathison criticizes Van Til for rejecting classical realism—the metaphysics and epistemology foundational to classical theism—while incorporating elements of Kantian and Hegelian philosophy\. Van Til is accused of misrepresenting figures like Aquinas, Scholasticism, Aristotle, and Calvin, and of integrating Christianity with idealism due to influences from Kantian and Hegelian thought\. Mathison notes that while Van Til did not fully adopt these philosophical systems, the influence of idealism is evident\. __Misunderstandings in Classical Apologetics\.__ Mathison contends that Van Til misunderstood classical apologetics, suggesting classical apologists view the human mind as metaphysically ultimate, a belief no classical apologist held\. Instead, Van Til argued they viewed the mind as epistemologically ultimate, or the independent starting point of all knowledge\. __The Presupposition of Intelligibility and Logic\.__ Mathison points out that Van Til’s call to presuppose God and Scripture inherently presupposes the existence of intelligibility, predication, and logic\. This presents a potential contradiction, as Van Til’s argument implies these concepts cannot exist apart from the presupposition of the Triune God\. __Rejection of Natural Theology\.__ As a logical extension of his views critiqued by Mathison, Van Til rejected Natural Theology\. Mathison notes the need to carefully distinguish Van Til’s view of natural theology from natural revelation\. Van Til acknowledges that natural revelation reveals something about God, but humans, due to ethical hostility, suppress this knowledge, rendering Natural Theology incapable of reaching true knowledge of God\.
