__Reasons of the Heart – William B\. Edgar __

__Introduction\. The Credibility Gap\.__ The section titled "The Hour of Apologetics" discusses the perceived irrelevance of the Christian message in a world with numerous alternative answers\. The Christian culture seems isolated, and figures like Barth consider apologetics an illegitimate pursuit\. However, apologetics is commanded in Scripture and is impossible to avoid\. __Balancing Mind and Heart\.__ It is essential to balance intellect and emotion in apologetics because people are lost without Christ and ultimately, actions must be to God's glory\. In this balance, reason is submitted to the truth\. __Don't Apologize\.__ Apologetics is not about saying sorry but about offering a defense and providing reasons for belief\. __An Appeal to the Heart's Reasons\.__ This approach emphasizes a foundational understanding, addressing obstacles and opportunities, the biblical basis for belief, and the method of apologetics\. It considers various pertinent questions like overcoming barriers to faith, dispelling illusions, demonstrating the uniqueness of Christianity, and addressing the problem of evil\.

__Part One: Foundations__

__1\. Today's Unusual Opportunity\.__ The concept of a golden age is a myth, but the current era provides a unique opportunity for apologetics\. We are in the age of communication, which is valuable, yet real persuasion remains essential\. Post\-modern hope emerges as a significant opportunity, highlighting that major obstacles to Christianity stem from modernity where reason has lost prevalence, but skepticism has gained ground\.

__2\. Beyond Cheap Impact\.__ Effective apologetics must address two main concerns: integrity and credibility\. Integrity requires faithfulness to the fundamental principles of the Christian faith, without which true impact is impossible\. Credibility involves communicating the message in a way that resonates with people while avoiding capitulation to secular mindsets\. There are three potential compromises: losing patience and resorting to violence, privatizing Christianity by retreating from public engagement, or reducing Christianity to mere evangelism focused solely on saving souls rather than making disciples\. The right strategy involves worshipping God fully—body and soul, heart and mind—and being active in this world, extending love to neighbors\. The paradox presented is that those who are most devoted to God are often the most productive in worldly matters\. Augustine is an example, with his concept of two cities and two loves: the hope of heaven enhances earthly life and fosters better citizenship\.

__3\. Apostolic Apology\.__ Drawing from 1 Peter 3:15, Christians are advised to be ready to provide answers about their faith with gentleness and respect\. The term *apologeia*, used similarly in Luke 12:11 and in Paul's defense before Agrippa, serves as encouragement during persecution and suffering\. It emphasizes transitioning from fear to faith, akin to Aslan's portrayal as not safe but good\. As believers set Christ apart and abandon worldly fears, they prepare to witness effectively\. This process involves two key components: 1\) possessing knowledge about the hope in Christ and the coming Kingdom and 2\) being sensitive to the needs and understanding of the audience, the times, and culture\. Furthermore, every Christian has a specific call—not to know all answers but to be prepared\. This preparation is primarily spiritual and tactful, rather than solely intellectual\.

__4\. The Larger Biblical Mandate\.__ Apologetics is woven throughout the Old Testament, seen in figures like Eve, Qohelet, Noah, and through God's invitations to reason, as well as in the prophets\. Wisdom literature, including Job, addresses themes like God's justice and the problem of evil, showing that Job grows in faith through suffering, ultimately vindicating God's plans\. Proverbs and the Sermon on the Mount further contribute to apologetic wisdom\. New Testament confirmation emerges with Simeon's prophecy in Luke, highlighting revelation as central to apologetics, and through Paul's confrontations with authorities\. Apologetics is a calling for all disciples, executed with the Holy Spirit's guidance and deep conviction\. It is not merely defensive but also offensive, as described in 2 Corinthians 10:5, and forms part of God's overarching purpose and redemption plan\.

__5\. A Richer Palette\.__ This section acknowledges the existence of many valid arguments and various effective ways to persuade others of the Christian faith\. These four methods are part of a whole, not standing alone but functioning collectively in the process of effective apologetics\.

1. Matching the Message to the Audience\. This involves creating a point of contact, which refers to the inherent knowledge of God's reality, as described in Romans 1:19\-21\. This idea includes the concept of *semen religionis*, although a natural person often suppresses this knowledge\.
2. Disclosure\. This step requires engaging with the worldview of the unbeliever to expose its internal inconsistencies and demonstrate how it fails to address critical questions\.
3. Homecoming\. Building on disclosure, it involves first unmasking unbelief and then presenting the Christian narrative, which fundamentally begins and concludes with God\.
4. Truth and Plausibility\. Working in concert with the first three parts, this concept involves establishing the plausibility of Christian truth, meaning it becomes confirmed, evident, and concrete\. Knowledge is acknowledged as being rooted in specific social contexts, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in making faith plausible\. Plausibility varies for each individual, as illustrated by figures like Lewis, who found aesthetics compelling\. Factors such as the problem of evil and doubt can contribute to the perception of implausibility, so it is important to understand a person's position from within their perspective\.

__Part Two: Conversations\.__

__6\. Initial Barriers\.__ This section explores how initial barriers to faith can be broken down, highlighting several key approaches\. The problem of goodness suggests that there must be something or someone to whom gratitude is owed\. Observing the remarkable aspects of the natural world can point to the eternal\. Humor can be a subtle way to engage, while shock treatments, like the death of a loved one, can provoke deeper reflection\. Other types of "deaths," such as unfulfilled dreams, can also serve as entry points for spiritual conversation\. The question "What kind of man is this?" \(Wie is Deze?\) invites inquiry into the person of Jesus\.

__7\. Beyond Belief \(Illusion\)\.__ This section addresses thinkers like Feuerbach, Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida, who view religion as an illusion\. While Edgar acknowledges that religion can sometimes be illusory, he warns against the dangers of idolatry\. The question arises: whose illusion is it? Critiques branding religion as mere anthropology or illusion also apply to non\-religious perspectives and can be explored through the tactic of disclosure\. The process of homecoming acknowledges that dreams are not inherently wrong\.

__8\. One Way? No Way? __The rise of multiculturalism has led to pluralism, raising the question: why is Christianity deemed true over other religions? If Christianity is true, then no one is without excuse, as truth is not democratic\. While imposing beliefs might seem inappropriate, Christians have a mandate to proclaim truth and persuade others\. Today, truth is often perceived as subjective or private, a legacy of Romanticism equating belief with feelings\. However, traditional theology maintains that Christianity is the sole path to salvation, with Jesus as an exemplar who endured typical human suffering and temptation without capitulation\. Christ's unique experience allows Him to represent every type of human being\. The diversity in cultures and humanity is typically viewed as good and enriching, metaphorically painted by God from a many\-colored palette\.

__9\. The Great Outrage\.__ Evil is described not merely as a problem, but as the central problem faced by humanity, and it is not exclusive to Christianity\. There are three basic questions to consider: 

1. __The Origin of Evil\.__ How did evil come into existence, and does it serve a purpose? If God is good, how did evil infiltrate the universe?
2. __The Nature of Evil\. __What exactly is evil—is it a substance, a state, or perhaps a counter\-reality?
3. __The Solution to Evil\.__ What actions can be taken against evil? Should it be ignored or endured, and is there a possibility of triumph over it?

__Instructive Evil\. __Despite its malevolence, evil can sometimes be instructive, as expressed in the phrase "O felix culpa," which speaks to the fortunate fall that necessitated a Redeemer of such greatness\. __Three__ __Perspectives on Evil\.__ One perspective suggests that everything could be a dream or *simulation*, dismissing the reality of evil\. While this world may be less than ultimate, it remains very real, and Augustine describes evil as "privatio boni," a lack of good—a dreadful reality\. Another view is *dualism*, positing necessary coexistence with evil without truly explaining its nature or extent, potentially attributing the authorship of evil to God\. The *risk of freedom* presents another perspective, proposing that God created the possibility of evil, placing the blame on human beings\. This raises questions about divine control and human freedom, with open theism as a possible discussion point\. 

__Three Affirmations:__ 

1. We might not fully grasp why God allowed evil into the universe, yet we know that evil can lead to personal improvement, is temporary, opposes God, and stems from human decisions\. 
2. Evil is not separate from God’s plan, as it did not catch Him by surprise, and nothing lies beyond His control\. 
3. While the Scriptures do not elucidate the origin of evil, they provide comprehensive insight into its resolution\.
