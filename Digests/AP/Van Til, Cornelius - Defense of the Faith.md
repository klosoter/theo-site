__Defense of the Faith \- Cornelius Van Til__

__Introduction\.__ Van Til's work addresses the charges of idealism, particularly those based on nomenclature, while contrasting his position against Hegelian rationalism and modern existentialism\. His aim is to clarify his apologetic approach and dispel misinterpretations\.

__Part One: The Structure of My Thought\.__

__1\. Christian Theology\.__ 

Van Til's apologetics emphasizes Reformed theology, asserting that both theism and Christianity emerge from the Bible, rather than suggesting theism precedes Scripture\. __The Doctrine of God\.__ The Reformed faith defines God's incommunicable attributes as independence, aseity, absolute immutability, eternal omnipresence, and unity, which encompasses both numerical and compositional aspects\. Communicable attributes include spirituality, invisibility, and omniscience, highlighting God's absolute personality and Trinitarian co\-substantiality\. __The Doctrine of Man\.__ Humankind is made in the image of God and exhibits personality traits and particular attributes such as true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness\. While like God, humans are finite and possess an organic relationship with the universe, taking roles as prophet, priest, and king\. The Fall led to humanity's adoption of a false ideal of knowledge\. __The Doctrine of Christ\.__ Christ embodies one person with two natures, fulfilling the roles of prophet, priest, and king through His word, death, and subduction\. __The Doctrine of Salvation\.__ Christ, through the Spirit, must subdue humanity to impart true knowledge\. __Doctrines of Church and the Last Things\.__

__2\. The Christian Philosophy of Reality \(Metaphysics\)\.__ 

In apologetics, one should start by understanding opposing viewpoints while maintaining clarity about God's self\-sufficiency and the universe's dependence on His plan, creation, and providence\. __Eternal Unity and Plurality\.__ The concept of the one\-and\-many describes an eternal self\-complete unity where God is the concrete universal, combining personality \(unity\) with the Trinity \(plurality\)\. Temporally, this reality reflects creation by God with inherent order, where natural laws act as generalizations\. __Sin and Its Curse\.__ Sin leads to a curse, incites opposition to God, and finds its remedy in Christ\.

__3\. The Christian Philosophy of Knowledge \(Epistemology\)\.__ 

This section contrasts the Christian epistemology with other systems, noting that sin leads individuals to see themselves as the final authority in all interpretation, rejecting God's authority\. Nevertheless, nature still teaches, but it must be interpreted through Scripture for proper understanding\. __God's Knowledge of Himself\.__ God is omniscient, with knowledge coterminous with His self\-consciousness, characterized by complete internal coherence\. __God's Knowledge of the World\.__ Through eternal planning and omniscience, God possesses full knowledge of creation, which remains ultimately incomprehensible to finite beings\. __Man's Knowledge of God\.__ Human understanding of God is analogical, as our thoughts reflect God's original thought\. Knowledge is true but not comprehensive, marking the limit of analogy\. __Man's Knowledge of the Universe\.__ God is man’s ultimate environment, having already interpreted the immediate environment\. Man knows truly but not comprehensively, with satisfaction arising only when knowledge is related to both the object and subject of the divine\. __Sin and Its Curse\.__ Sin represents an ethical departure from God, not a metaphysical one, as humans continue to be God’s creatures\. Man assumes absolute knowledge authority, mistaking the finite as self\-sufficient\. Consciousnesses vary, with Adamic consciousness being perfect, receiving God’s full revelation, the fallen or nonregenerate consciousness rejecting creaturehood and unity, and the regenerate consciousness being restored in principle to the Adamic state\.

__4\. The Christian Philosophy of Behavior \(Ethics\)\.__ 

This philosophy identifies the summum bonum as the establishment of God's kingdom, with the criterion being God's revealed will in Scripture rather than human standards, and motivation stemming from faith provided through regeneration by the Holy Spirit\. God, as the absolute personality, is the ultimate interpretive category for humanity in all aspects\. Derived from the imago Dei, moral consciousness is meant to be receptively reconstructive rather than creatively constructive\. __Sin and Curse\.__ Sin has corrupted human will, resulting in total depravity, which necessitates reliance on Scripture alone for moral guidance, as morality is finite and sinful\. __Regenerated Consciousness\.__ Reinstated in principle to the imago Dei, it must always be tested against Scripture\. Roman Catholicism posits man's independent responsibility before God's counsel, suggesting autonomy that negates the need for Scripture's submission, which challenges non\-Christian positions\. Evangelicalism views man, through grace, as participating in the divine nature\. __Ethics and the Christian Philosophy of Reality\.__ God embodies absolute rationality and absolute will, being inherently good from everlasting and ultimately self\-determinative\. His absolute will presupposes man's will\. __The Kingdom of God as Man's Highest Good\.__ Non\-Christian perspectives assume a summum bonum as normal and correlational\. In contrast, the Biblical summum bonum is rooted in Scripture, presenting an absolute ideal encompassing law, judgment, and transformation of sin into a divine gift\. This paradigm sees *Aufgabe* becoming *Gabe* while recognizing *Gabe* is also an *Aufgabe* for humans\. It necessitates the absolute eradication of sin and evil and embodies an ethics of hope that anticipates perfect recreation\.

__5\. Christian Apologetics: Point of Contact\.__

__Roman Catholicism\.__ Roman Catholicism holds a universalistic and naturalistic view compared to the Protestant particularistic and supernaturalistic stance\. According to Catholicism, sin does not impair the capacities of unbelievers, suggesting Christianity is only an addition to human nature\. However, Van Til argues that sin blinds humanity, and without God, man knows nothing\. The fundamental difference lies in the disturbance of human nature—with Calvin arguing it results from sin, necessitating the renewal of the whole person through the Holy Spirit's power, while Roman Catholicism sees it as endemic to human nature, thus requiring no supernatural help\. Van Til asserts that mankind already possesses some truth but contends that the revelation of a self\-sufficient God is meaningless to a mind that considers itself ultimately autonomous\. __Evangelicalism\.__ Evangelicalism leaves room for an ultimate decision by individuals similar to Roman Catholicism, perceiving some intelligibility of man, God, and the world\. __Less Consistent Calvinism\.__ Less consistent Calvinism, represented by thinkers like Hodge, posits reason as necessary for receiving and judging the credibility and evidences of revelation, which Van Til counters by viewing reason as merely a tool impaired by the Fall\. Meanwhile, Hepp suggests the existence of central truths accepted by many; however, Van Til warns against deriving God from personal notions, emphasizing that such reasoning approaches disbelief\. He acknowledges sensus divinitatis, as Calvin proposed, but notes that the reaction to this revelation is distorted by sin\. __The Reformed Position\.__ The Reformed Position avoids the extremes of absolute ignorance or omniscience by considering man’s mind as derivative\. In the covenant, humans are ethically responsible and originally in contact with, though not yet in possession of, the truth and are therefore inexcusable when they fail to recognize God\. The belief that man's self\-consciousness is ultimate rather than derivative was instilled by Satan\. __Point of Contact\.__ Deep within, every person knows they are God's creature and a covenant breaker, although this truth is suppressed\.

__6\. Christian Apologetics: The Problem of Method\.__

__Reasoning by Presupposition\.__ Given the lack of a point of contact, Van Til argues that one cannot engage with other positions on shared grounds\. All reality reveals the same God described in Scripture, meaning one's worldview must be based on biblical truth\. This involves indirect reasoning, which is circular since all reasoning ultimately is, focusing on final reference points\. It provides the only framework for successful human reason and true progress in knowledge\. True knowledge of natural things is possible but only by subconsciously presupposing Christian theism\. __Scripture\.__ The Bible is an infallibly inspired final revelation of God to humanity, with Christian theism as a unified whole\. All universe facts must be interpreted through the lens of the Bible, which is self\-attesting\. This requires subordinating reason to Scripture, given humanity's fallen, sinful state as covenant\-breakers\. __Roman Catholicism__ suggests Christianity must be acceptable to natural man, disregarding Scripture's authority\. __Arminian__ views, such as Butler's, argue that knowledge of God and Christianity without Scripture is probably true, which Van Til refutes completely, asserting that this conception of God is not omniscient\. Calvinism, recognizing impaired human reason and no point of contact, thus places Scripture's authority over reason and aims to challenge opponents' presuppositions\. __ Block\-house Methodology\.__ In Calvinism, Christian theism is seen as one unit based on presupposition, where every aspect's meaning depends on the whole of Christian theism\. In contrast, Roman Catholic and Arminian approaches separate theism from Christianity, using reason to build understanding piece by piece\. There are no brute facts, as understanding requires either total or zero knowledge: "one must know everything or one cannot know anything\." Hence, man's knowledge is an analogical replica of the system of knowledge that belongs to God\.

__7\. Christian Apologetics: Authority and Reason\.__

__Non\-Christian Views\.__ In these views, reason is central, yet it is deemed insufficient for comprehensive understanding\. Authority is often placed in experts, but never positioned above reason\. Five forms of acceptable authority exist that do not violate the autonomy principle, including chance \(irrationalism\) and modern irrationalism, where reason recognizes its limits but continues trying to grasp an endless stream of facts\. __Modern Theological Views\.__ Schleiermacher's religious phenomenalism and Barth's viewpoint, where God as the absolute other remains entirely unknowable, lead to a rejection of authority based on any known premise\. __The Roman Catholic View\.__ This view posits reason as a source of natural knowledge, functioning apart from and preceding faith, under the 'order of the faith'\. Though natural reason is seen as wounded and needing healing, it is still considered capable of acquiring natural knowledge\. However, for Van Til, saying God's existence as pure essence renders it unknowable\. This presents a compromise incompatible with Van Til's belief that humans are wholly subject to God, opposing the notion of autonomous reason\. __The Arminian View\.__ Arminianism champions human autonomy, treating reason as autonomous and placing Scripture's authority under its judgment\. From a common ground, they argue for the possibility and probability of God and recognize the historical fact of revelation in Scripture\. Yet, this approach fails to challenge the non\-theistic position effectively\. __The Reformed View\.__ Here, reason acknowledges no brute facts or neutral basis, as facts neither challenge the faith nor God's self\-contained existence\. Central facts include God's self\-contained existence, humanity being made imago Dei, and God's comprehensive plan and providence over the universe's events\. Reason is seen as derivatory and reliant on revelation, with authority resting solely in God and Scripture\.

__8\. Common Grace and Scholasticism__

The central question is whether a nonbeliever can judge the Bible to be the Word of God using autonomous reason, and if there is a common ground or neutral basis\. Kuyper and his followers assert there is none, whereas Old Princeton believes there is\. __All Men Unavoidably Know God\.__ According to Kuyper, all men have inherent knowledge of God, manifested through the *sensus divinitatis* and undeniable evidence of God's power and divinity\. This knowledge is common and suppressed, but humans remain always accessible to God, indicating no absolute antithesis\. Christ as Redeemer plays a role in redeeming both mankind and science, fostering unity in the latter\. __ Natural Theology\.__ The Roman Catholic perspective blurs the distinction between Creator and creation, suggesting that humanity participates in the same being as God\. However, Van Til argues there are no brute facts, challenging individuality and discontinuity\. Calvin views sin and redemption as ethical, maintaining that humans, although weakened, still bear the *imago Dei* and consistently face God’s revealed will\. Conversely, Roman Catholicism and some evangelical views interpret sin as a metaphysical deficiency with ethical impacts, requiring a *bonum superadditum* to maintain being\. __Differences Among Reformed Theologians\.__ Kuyper and Bavinck do not adequately differentiate their views from Roman Catholic ideas of innate knowledge and common notions, sometimes utilizing brute facts and abstract universals\. Common grace is depicted as God's tool to fulfill His purpose through humans, displaying His glory until judgment day\. Ridderbos presents the non\-Christian contributions to scientific progress despite ethical sin, facilitated by using natural gifts\. Through common grace, a sinner strives to efface and confront ethical hostility in acknowledging God but remains an object of the Spirit's invitation to return to God\. Ethical hostility does not obfuscate science, even with assumed autonomy of facts and the denial that God communicates through these facts\. Human internal principles would lead to relativism and unknowability, yet the *sensus divinitatis* and common grace operate unconsciously\. Despite this, theistic proofs lack absolute probative force, rendering God's existence only probable\. Yet, this probability leaves excessive room for reason and autonomy\. Van Til emphasizes that Christian\-theistic views must demonstrate their indispensability in preserving intelligent human experience, not merely their defensibility against other systems\. Van Til rejects the idea that man can fall back into non\-being \(consistent with their covenant\-breaker status\) due to common grace\.

__Part Two: Objections Considered\.__

__9\. Theological Problems\.__

__The Bible\.__ Van Til contests several approaches to Scripture: he opposes Roman Catholicism's equal weighting of Scripture and Tradition, as well as the evangelical \(Arminian and Lutheran\) approaches that do not subordinate human reason to Scripture\. He challenges modernists who treat Scripture as an "expert authority" and neo\-modernists \(Barthians\) who refuse to equate Scripture with the Word of God\. Additionally, non\-Christian views that place authority in human reasoning over Scripture are refuted\. Van Til responds to Daane's objections, which are rooted in dialectical existentialism and Kierkegaard's ideas, accusing Van Til of determinism and denying God's comprehensive plan\. Van Til maintains that God controls all events and provides clear revelation, countering accusations of indeterminacy\. Jesse De Boer and others, such as Roelofs and Kuhn, support Classical Realism, asserting the Bible's interpretation as inherently ambiguous and rejecting divine revelation\. John Wild summarizes classical realism, positing a world of contingent entities with real relations, known through epistemological realism, offering immutable principles for human action\. __The Doctrine of God\.__ Van Til asserts the understanding of God through the ontological Trinity presented in Scripture, the derivation of all major attributes from Scripture rather than deduction, Calvin's perspective of God's self\-contained nature, and the distinction between opera ad intra and ad extra\. Daane objects, accusing Van Til of philosophical reliance\. Van Til counters idealistic views, asserting that temporal creation is essential, opposing pantheism and pancosmism\. Orlebeke's difficulty arises from Van Til's claim that "God's interpretation/thought precedes and is constructive or constitutive of facts," which Orlebeke sees as idealistic\. Van Til clarifies that God's plan causes the universe's existence, meaning His thoughts are constitutive in that logical sense\.

__10\. Christian Metaphysics\.__

Van Til outlines his metaphysical framework with five foundational points: 

1. The doctrine of the self\-contained God or ontological Trinity
2. The divine plan or counsel concerning created reality
3. The temporal creation as the origin of all universal facts
4. God's providential control over all created reality, including the supernatural
5. The miraculous redemption of the world through Christ

__Objections\. __Dr\. Buswell raises objections particularly referring to Van Til's "Presuppositionalism" as addressed in AP 725\. __Second Causes\.__ A specific critique comes from Cecil De Boer, who argues that Van Til does not accord sufficient justice to second causes, suggesting that viewing God as absolute leads to determinism, thus nullifying second causes\. Van Til responds by clarifying that his intent is to emphasize the existence of secondary causes as reliant on the presence of an ultimate first cause\. __Contingency\.__ Regarding contingency, Van Til references the Westminster Confessions, which use the term to counter determinism, contrasting non\-Christian ultimate indeterminism\. Cohen promotes a metaphysics favoring chance over providence to liberate science, advocating for a balance between pure chance and determinism to avoid absurdity\. De Boer suggests an approach to science and nature that collaborates with non\-Christians, integrating the concept of creatureliness, which Van Til insists must be presupposed\. __Van Til's Conclusion\.__ Ultimately, Van Til asserts that Christianity is essential \(sine qua non\) for the intelligibility of anything, positing that without the Christian worldview, coherence in understanding reality is unattainable\.

__11\. Christian Epistemology\.__

__The Presuppositions of Revelation\.__ The presuppositions of a truly Christian\-theistic theory of knowledge are synonymous with those of revelation\. __The Fields of Revelation\.__ The presupposition of Christianity makes it possible to study nature and science intelligibly\. Without Christianity, hypotheses can neither be consistently included nor excluded\. Without knowing God, which may be actively suppressed, human beings cannot possess true knowledge of anything\. Non\-Christians can engage in activities like weighing or measuring, but they cannot account for the existence of knowledge itself\. __Kuyper on Weighing and Measuring\.__ Kuyper suggests that anyone can weigh and measure, but Van Til counters by emphasizing that there is no "neutral reason," rejecting ideas promoted by Warfield and Masselink\. He denies the existence of general truths, challenging Hepp and Masselink, and opposes endorsing the Roman Catholic view of truth as posited by Cecil de Boer, pointing to the concept of total depravity\. Van Til also rejects classical realism, as argued by Jesse de Boer, asserting that weighing and measuring are grounded in the assumption of order and distinguishability, which is only possible by acknowledging God's existence\. __Kuyper on Logic\.__ Kuyper posits the existence of only one logic, and Van Til agrees that regenerate Christians do not use a different set of logical laws than others, nor do they have different sensory experiences\. The distinction lies in the ethical realm, where the suppressing or not suppressing of truth varies\. __Supernatural and Natural Revelation\.__ Jesse de Boer claims it is unnecessary to think God's thoughts after him by citing the ability to distinguish between entities, such as apples and tomatoes, independently\. Van Til rejects this notion, emphasizing that even such distinctions require a grounding in God's thinking\. He points to Jesus Christ as the ultimate supernatural revelation\.

__12\. Christian Apologetics\.__

__The Place of Reason in Theology\.__ After the Fall, humanity no longer possesses Adamic consciousness, leaving only regenerate and unregenerate states\. The regenerate consciousness is, in principle, restored and supplemented\. There is no universal "reason" without consideration of the sense of deity and suppression of truth\. The nonregenerate mind operates under monistic assumptions, actively suppressing truth\. Scripture holds all humans accountable for their blindness and teaches believers to preach to those who are spiritually blind\. __Defending the Faith\.__ Apologetics should not use a block\-house method, but advocating a single Reformed Christianity from the start, in opposition to Roman Catholicism and evangelicalism\. This approach discourages cooperation in apologetic efforts\. While the question arises whether all Roman Catholic and Evangelical efforts are in vain, it is acknowledged that God can use them, much as He uses their preaching\. __The Believer Meets the Unbeliever\.__ The metaphorical interaction between Mr\. White, Mr\. Grey, and Mr\. Black illustrates differing worldviews\. Grey advocates a Block\-house method but remains unconvincing by suggesting that Black must accept additional doctrines\. White recognizes Black as spiritually dead, necessitating total regeneration\. __A Consistent Witness\.__ Grey advocates for common ground, while Black notes Grey and White share a common witness\. Grey sometimes aligns with Black against White\. The result is that Black may accept some notions from Grey but attributes them to chance rather than God\. __The Authority of Scripture\.__ Grey views truth as rational probability, while White asserts that all historical facts must be set within the framework provided by the Bible, the only system that leads to true intelligibility\. Black subscribes to utter relativism\. __Proofs for the Existence of God\.__ Black considers unconditional surrender to the authority of Scripture as irrational, a sentiment Grey acknowledges\. Grey holds that the book of nature points to a highly probable God, but Black counters that this undermines God's absoluteness and self\-sufficiency, as probability presupposes possibility\. The causality argument is seen to lead to irrationalism and reliance on chance\.

__13\. Amsterdam and Old Princeton\.__

__Kuyper and Warfield__ represent two differing approaches to natural theology and its implications for understanding revelation and sin\. Butler \(drawing from Aquinas\) aimed to demonstrate that theism and Christianity are more probable than any other theories of reality, sin, and redemption\. Kuyper held that natural theology is not just fruitless but destructive due to sin, asserting that revelation without Scripture is impossible\. Cornelius Van Til supports this absolutist stance\. Warfield countered that Kuyper's views undermine science, positing that right reason can adjudicate Christianity’s truth, thus assuming a neutral territory and endorsing classical realism, a view shared by Cecil and Jesse de Boer\. Van Til agrees with Kuyper that natural theology is ineffective and sinful, yet acknowledges Warfield's view that Christianity is objectively defensible given the sense of deity\. __William Brenton Greene Jr\.__ aligned with Warfield in suggesting that Scripture and its evidences should be judged by reason, demonstrating the reality and manifestation of the supernatural, which ultimately appears probable\. The supernatural requires a personal or immediate manifestation through miracles, the Decalogue, or Christ, emphasizing that the idea of a personal God accounts for universal laws\. __Floyd E\. Hamilton__ proposed that theism can be established by neutral reasoning, placing man's reason above Scripture and advocating a bridge from cause, order, purpose, and morality to God\. Kuyper criticized this "after this" method, emphasizing a faith that begins with confronting God in every fact\. __Kuyper__ argued that true self\-identification occurs through recognizing oneself as God’s creation\. Faith remains formal within exact sciences, a perspective Van Til questions as inconsistent with Kuyper's thought\. By insisting that only through Scripture can true contact with nature be achieved, Kuyper underscores the necessity of revelation\. __Bavinck__ posited that Scripture is the *principium unicum* for Christians\. At times, Van Til notes, Bavinck seems to imply that humans can interpret much of experience without this principle, suggesting a neutral ground\. Bavinck’s stance that reality is recognized through self\-consciousness is critiqued by Van Til for failing to differentiate revelation from its often\-perverse interpretations\. Beyond this, Van Til argues that while Scripture is authoritative, rational arguments must counter the notion of inherently clear revelation\.

__14\. Common Grace and Existentialism\.__

__The First Point of Kalamazoo\.__ Common grace is extended to God's creatures broadly, applicable to humanity as a whole, while election pertains specifically to the elect\. Both the elect and non\-elect are treated similarly until the end of history\. __God's Original Favor to Mankind in Adam\.__ Grace is understood as God's benevolence toward humanity, a grace not owed but freely given\. __The General Offer of the Gospel\.__ During the undifferentiated stage—before individuals are ultimately saved or rejected—there exists a shared experience of grace and the gospel\. Common grace enables natural humans to engage in good works\. __Points Two and Three of Kalamazoo\.__ Point two addresses the restraint of sin within individuals and society\. Point three posits that while the unregenerate cannot achieve saving good, they are capable of performing civic good\. Van Til notes that God's restraint means the sinner does not fully express their corrupt nature\. A Christian sins against their will, whereas a non\-Christian sins against their fundamentally satanic principles\. __Daane's Charges\.__ Daane critiques several aspects of Van Til's theology:

- The Triune God Not Ultimate in Himself\. Daane implies that revealing God through Christ challenges His ultimacy\.
- God's Decrees Are Not Determinate\. Daane argues for a temporal stream independent or indeterminate by God's counsel\.
- No Equal Ultimacy of Election and Reprobation\. Van Til contends this denies God's control over all events, as stated in the Westminster Larger Catechism\.
- Equal Ultimacy of Adam's Choices\. Van Til attributes Daane’s view to his refusal to begin with God's counsel, leading to charges of determinism\.
- Adam, Who Art Thou? Daane's conception of Adam is not connected to God's counsel, contrary to Van Til's emphasis on Adam's historicity\.
- The Common Grace Problem\. Daane ties common grace to sin, while Van Til differentiates between common favor, common grace, and common curse, which Daane views as deterministic\.
