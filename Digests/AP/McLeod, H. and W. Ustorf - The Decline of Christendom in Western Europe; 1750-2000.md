__The Decline of Christendom in Western Europe, 1750\-2000 – H\. McLeod and W\. Ustorf__

The book explores the decline of Christianity in Europe over time, identifying four stages: increased religious tolerance, rise of anti\-Christian ideas, separation of Church and state, and weakening Church\-society ties\. It addresses the secularization thesis, examining how modernism impacts religious institutions and the alternatives that emerge, such as increased religious diversity\.

In Part I, the focus is on the religious landscape at the close of the 20th century, particularly the 1960s' influence on secularization, Sweden's decline in Christendom, and the emergence of new spiritualities and indifference\.

Parts II and III delve into the historical narrative of religious decline and key themes such as technology and language, with case studies from England, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France\.

Part IV considers the future of Europe post\-Christendom, discussing long\-term religious narratives and missiological perspectives\.
