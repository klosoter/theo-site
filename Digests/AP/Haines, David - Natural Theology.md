__Natural Theology – David Haines\. __

__Introduction\.__

Natural theology is defined as "that part of philosophy which explores that which man can know about God \(His existence, divine nature, etc\.\) from nature alone, via man's divinely bestowed faculty of reason, unaided by special revelation from any religion, and without presupposing the truth of any religion" \(12\)\. Natural revelation serves as its source data and "is not sufficient for telling us more than that God exists, something of His nature, and that God is worthy of worship" \(14\)\. It is crucial to distinguish natural theology from natural religion to grasp its particular focus and limitations\.

__1\. The Biblical Foundations of Natural Theology\.__ The Bible must be interpreted using natural knowledge and reason, as the Bible itself contains interpretation\. Haines notes that this requires "acquired linguistic knowledge, experience and knowledge of the world, philosophical or theoretical knowledge, natural knowledge of the divine nature, and the very hermeneutical principles that we so meticulously apply to Scripture in order to arrive at 'biblical' teaching" \(23\)\. Warfield considers natural theology, or apologetical theology, foundational to systematic theology\. According to Haines, understanding the Scriptures necessitates natural knowledge, and the Scriptures themselves assume such knowledge is viable\. He cites passages from Psalm 19, Acts 14 and 17, Romans 1:19\-20, 32, and Romans 2:14\-15 to substantiate this claim\. With regard to Romans 1:19\-20, Haines states that Van Til's view is that these verses "only apply to Adam and Eve" \(39\)\. In contrast, Haines argues that they apply "to all men at all times who know and reject God," emphasizing a broader application of natural theology and suggesting that all humans inherently possess knowledge of God, which they actively suppress or reject\.

__2\. Pre\-Socratics to the Early Church\.__ Mythology and philosophy are distinct in their pursuits; mythology seeks to fulfill a desire for the marvelous, whereas philosophy aims "to understand the causes and reasons for the marvelous" \(49\)\. Thales of Miletus shifted focus from practical or mythological concerns to the fundamental cause of everything, concluding that there must be a single cause and principle, which he identified as water, equating it with god\. Anaximander expanded on this, proposing an infinite principle that continues to govern reality\. Anaximenes, Heraclitus, and Empedocles each identified different elements as ultimate first principles: air, fire, and earth, respectively\. Xenophanes introduced the idea of a god as a personal and conscious being\. __Plato and Aristotle's Divine Concepts\.__ For Plato, the highest divine principle is the One\-Good, which he describes as "intelligent, wise, powerful, and personal" \(61\)\. Aristotle's conception of god is as the "first unmoved mover," characterized as "eternal, pure actuality, immutable, necessarily existing, alive, joyful and eternally happy, thought thinking itself, most good, immaterial, transcendent, unextended, absolutely simple, absolutely infinite, and impassible" \(62\-63\)\. Cicero examines the "presupposition" of the divine existence within Socratic, Stoic, and Platonic thought, offering arguments to support these presuppositions\. __Neo\-Platonic Influence\.__ Plotinus, who influenced Augustine and the Neo\-Platonists, articulates the theory of the One: "That, therefore, which is primarily good, that is, that which is the Good, reveals itself to us as being over all beings and uniquely good and having nothing in itself, but unmixed with anything and over anything and the cause of everything\. For indeed neither that which is beautiful nor beings come from what is evil nor from that which is indifferent\. For that which produces is better than that which is produced\. For it is more perfect" \(77\-78\)\. Proclus also provides philosophical arguments asserting that there must be a single first cause, thereby affirming the existence of the One\-Good, or God\. __The Early Christian Apologists\.__ Aristides appealed to the reasoning ability of the unregenerate and their observation of the universe as evidence for Christianity, leading them to conclude its truth\. Justin Martyr regarded Christianity as the true philosophy, while Tertullian argued that "God’s creation, including the human soul itself, testifies to the existence and great power of God" \(86\)\. Athanasius echoed this view, stating that God can be known through the order and beauty of creation, as supported by Scripture \(Rom 1 and Acts 14\)\. Gregory Nazianzus emphasized that humans can gain knowledge of God through observing nature, providing arguments based on beauty and order\. Gregory of Nyssa, using Romans 1 and Psalm 19, argued that "we can prove the existence of God via an argument based upon our rational observations of nature" \(98\)\.

__3\. Augustine on Natural Theology\.__ The Augustinian school is renowned for asserting that "all understanding must begin with faith" \(101\)\. Yet, Haines discusses Éttiene Gilson's perspective, noting that "we cannot believe something, be it the word of God Himself, unless we find some sense in the formulas we believe" \(101\-2\) and that "it can hardly be expected that we will believe in God’s Revelation unless we be given good reasons to think that such a revelation has indeed taken place" \(102\)\. Haines suggests that "in a sense, Augustine portrays natural theology as whatever truths the pagan philosophers discovered about the one true God" \(103n10\)\. He emphasizes the importance of understanding Augustine’s conception of knowledge, despite Augustine not having developed a clearly articulated epistemology \(107\)\. __Haines Defense of Augustine’s Epistemology\. __Haines defends several contested claims about Augustine’s epistemology\. *First*, Augustine accepted the existence of ideas as true, eternal, and immutable, meaning that essences are real and exist independently of the particulars in the mind of God\. *Second*, although sensible particulars are changing, through them, we can come to know much about divine ideas: "All true knowledge is a grasping of the divine ideas" \(109\)\. *Third*, while the Forms cannot be known through sensible particulars, our knowledge of the divine ideas must judge our knowledge of the sensible particulars\. The divine ideas are communicated to humans through divine illumination\. __Augustine’s Theory of Divine Illumination\.__ Haines explains Augustine’s divine illumination theory thusly\. *First*, God implants divine reasons or ideas into each human mind at birth\. *Second*, this knowledge is not immediately known but becomes apparent via inner instruction taught by the divine light through the divine reasons implanted at birth\. *Third*, "the created sensible universe is known by the human mind through the senses, in interaction with the divine ideas, but truth is obtained when the human mind compares its sensory knowledge of the created universe with the divine ideas already implanted in his mind, and recognizes the sensible things as participating, in some manner, in the divine ideas" \(112\)\. __Implications for Human Knowledge of God\.__ Humans know God because of the divine ideas implanted at birth and through observing the sensible things participating in them\. However, the question remains "how and to what extent?" For Augustine, natural reason, "which is clearly given by God to all humans, is not only a necessary aid in all theological discussion, but a necessary precondition for biblical interpretation" \(116\)\. Through nature, humans can know certain things about God: that He exists, is immaterial, immutable, the creator of every Form of every contingent thing, and therefore the Creator of everything in the sensible universe\. God is also perceived as being alive, intelligent, blessed or joyful, divinely simple, uncreated, incomparable, eternal, and powerful \(131\)\. Yet, despite this knowledge of God's existence and attributes, it is not sufficient for salvation\.

__4\. Thomas Aquinas on Natural Theology\.  __

__The Necessity of Revealed Knowledge\.__ For Aquinas, "without revealed knowledge of God, man could attain neither his natural end nor his salvation" \(135\)\. Yet, he also maintains that the proposition "God exists" is self\-evident due to the innate knowledge of God implanted in us by nature\. Hodge describes these innate ideas as "primary truths which lie dormant in the mind" and are stored in the soul\. Such propositions must be both universal and necessary, applying to the knowledge of God: it is imprinted on the hearts of all men, and all men accept it unless they "do violence to the laws of human nature" \(138\)\. __The Universal and Innate Knowledge of God\.__ Aquinas argues that "whilst it could be said that man has a naturally innate and confused knowledge of God, he does not know God as God in this way, but merely as the ultimate good that man desires" \(140\)\. Although the proposition "God exists" is self\-evident to God, it is not self\-evident to humans, nor is it universally known\. Nevertheless, Aquinas asserts that it can be demonstrated that God exists and that something can be known about His nature\. __The Clarification of Innate Knowledge\.__ The distinction Aquinas makes concerns the clarity with which humans understand the concept of God\. While there exists a fundamental, albeit confused, awareness and desire for God as the ultimate good, the detailed and clear comprehension of God’s nature requires more than just innate knowledge\. It involves philosophical reasoning and demonstration to establish the existence of God and to glean insights into the divine nature, complementing innate inclinations with rational exploration\.

__5\. Protestant Theologians from the 1500s to 1700s\.__

__The Role of Natural Theology in Reformed Orthodoxy\.__ Turretin sees acknowledging natural theology as the litmus test of Reformed orthodoxy\. In this chapter, Haines aims to demonstrate that the early Reformed indeed embraced natural theology\. By "knowledge of God" is meant knowledge about the existence and attributes of God, his plan for fallen humanity, and that knowledge which is necessary for the ultimate salvation of man \(144\)\. This can be separated into knowledge of God as Creator and God as Redeemer\. This distinction is affirmed by Calvin, the French Confession of Faith, the Canons of Dordt, the Westminster Confession, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Junius, Turretin, Jonathan Edwards, Cranmer, Tyndale, Perkins, Ames, Sibbes, and Charnock\. __Natural and Special Revelation\.__ Knowledge of God as Creator can be known through natural revelation and reason, while knowledge of God as Redeemer can only be known through special revelation\. All Reformers, says Haines, claim that all men can attain some knowledge of God, even the unregenerate \(e\.g\., Calvin’s *sensus divinitatis*\)\. Whether or not man accepts this—and Van Til would argue that natural man suppresses it—all men know that there is a God and that this God is their maker\. Vermigli, Junius, Beza, and Davenant all teach that philosophy, through natural reason, can attain certain truths about God\. __The Capacity for Natural Knowledge Post\-Fall\.__ Haines goes on to claim that "most of the early Reformers affirmed that all men, in spite of the Fall, can know some truths about the one true God" \(153\)\. He cites Vermigli, Beza, Calvin, and Luther as theologians who affirmed that reason, although weakened and corrupted by the Fall, was still able to arrive at natural knowledge of God\. __Sources of Knowledge: Scripture and Nature\.__ The early Protestant theologians held that there are two sources of knowledge of God: Scripture and nature\. For Calvin, nature not only means the *sensus divinitatis* but also creation itself, human nature and human history, and God’s providential control of all creation\. He even talks about "innumerable proofs\." The content of natural knowledge of God includes his existence, attributes, and providence\. __Humanity's Response to Natural Knowledge\.__ The positive aspect of this knowledge is that humans arrive at some knowledge of the true God through nature\. The negative aspect, though, is that they "rather than worship the one true God, turn away from the Creator and worship the creature—they fall into idolatry" \(167\)\. Man is held inexcusable because, knowing God, he chose not to know him\.

__6\. Responding to Some Objections\.__

__Objection 1: A God Who Is Not the Trinity Is Not the True God\.__ Haines addresses Van Til’s objection that the God demonstrated by theistic proofs is "always a God who is something other than the self\-contained ontological Trinity of Scripture" \(172\)\. Haines argues that a knowledge of the doctrine of the Trinity is not necessary to have knowledge about God, backing his position with compelling arguments\. However, he misses Van Til’s point entirely\. Van Til asserts that the God reached through natural reason is not God at all, as there is no general theism that Christianity must supplement\. __Objection 2: Natural Theology Introduces Greek Thought into Christian Doctrine\.__ Haines cites Van Til, who claims that "the theism of Romanist theology is a theism heavily freighted with pagan elements of thought," and that the Romanist theism validated by philosophical arguments cannot coexist with Reformed theism\. Haines rejects both contentions\. He argues that Romanist theism is identical to Reformed theism and accuses Van Til of committing the genetic fallacy by assuming a truth statement is false due to its origins\. Roman theism would be deemed false because of its reliance on Greek philosophy, according to Haines\. Again, he misinterprets Van Til, whose argument is not that Roman theism is false due to its Greek philosophical roots, but rather that any ‘god’ deduced from natural reason cannot be the supernatural, transcendent God\. __Objection 3: Greek Philosophy Is Erroneous and Incoherent\.__ Haines contends that incoherent or partially erroneous knowledge does not invalidate all knowledge, nor does incomplete knowledge imply falsehood\. However, it is unclear where this objection arises from, as it does not appear to align with Van Til’s arguments\. Haines notably fails to quote a specific objector, raising questions about the origin and relevance of this critique in the context of Van Til’s views\.

__Comments and Questions\.__

__Interpretation and Natural Theology\.__ Interpretation requires "acquired linguistic knowledge, experience and knowledge of the world, philosophical or theoretical knowledge, natural knowledge of the divine nature, and the very hermeneutical principles that we so meticulously apply to Scripture in order to arrive at 'biblical' teaching" \(23\)\. Is this natural theology, though? Van Til would argue that these skills and types of knowledge are indeed required to understand Scripture but only function correctly when enlightened by the Holy Spirit\. 

__Romans 1:19\-20 and Van Til’s Perspective\.__ With regards to Romans 1:19\-20, Haines claims that Van Til’s view is that these verses only apply to Adam and Eve \(39\)\. In contrast, Haines claims they apply to all men at all times who know and reject God\. This seems like a highly unusual reading of Van Til\. Rather, he would argue that all men—not only Adam and Eve—know God but suppress this knowledge\.

__Early Christian Thinkers and Natural Theology\.__ It really seems that early Christian thinkers affirmed the legitimacy of natural theology to the extent that it could produce knowledge of God’s existence and attributes\. Who is misreading them? Van Til or Haines? See, for example, Calvin on "innumerable proofs" on page 160\.

__The Purpose of Natural Revelation in Van Til's Thought\.__ What is the point of natural revelation according to Van Til? Is it just to hold all men inexcusable?

__Natural Knowledge and Presuppositionalism\.__ Haines quotes Hodge, saying that all men accept natural knowledge of God unless they "do violence to the laws of human nature" \(138\)\. Van Til would agree, but what is meant by the laws of nature, and how are these accounted for? Is this not a form of presuppositionalism, after all?

__Selective Quoting and the Canons of Dort\.__ Haines cites the Canons of Dort selectively \(as did Fesko\) on page 152\. Further in the quote, the Canons of Dort say "that \[man\] is incapable of using \[natural light\] aright even in things natural and civil\. Nay further, this light, such as it is, man in various ways renders wholly polluted, and holds it in unrighteousness, by doing which he becomes inexcusable before God\."
