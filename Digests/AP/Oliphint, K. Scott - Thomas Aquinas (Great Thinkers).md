__Thomas Aquinas \(Great Thinkers\) – K\. Scott Oliphint__

__1\. Introduction\.__

__Compatibility with Reformation Thought\.__ Thomas Aquinas's work is examined for compatibility with Reformed theology, focusing on the principles of being and knowing \(*principium essendi* and *principium cognoscendi*\)\. __Theological Insight\.__ The exploration considers what is theologically and biblically identifiable today, despite historical context, leading to a concept known as 'Reformed Thomism\.' __Background and Influences\.__ Born in 1224, Aquinas became a Benedictine oblate and studied Scripture and the Church Fathers\. Influenced by Aristotle and Augustine, he became a Dominican priest and extensively commented on Peter Lombard's Sentences\. __Key Works\.__ Aquinas's major contributions include the *Summa Contra Gentiles* and the *Summa Theologica*\. The *Summa Contra Gentiles* addresses divine attributes, creation, providence, and truths known only by faith, while the *Summa Theologica* remains a crucial theological text\. His exploration of supernatural gifts further aligns with Roman Catholic theology\.

__2\. Foundation of Knowledge\.__

__Reason and Revelation\. __Aquinas posits a twofold truth of divine things: 1\) knowledge attainable through natural reason and 2\) that which is accessible only by revelation\. The foundational structure encompasses truths like God's existence and oneness, using Romans 1:19 to highlight that all people share natural reason through participation in true light, but not divine enlightenment\. Divine things known only through revelation, like the Trinity, form the superstructure\. At times, Aquinas refers to a 3\) third kind of universal knowledge: implicit understanding of "being" or "happiness," often linked to perception\.

__Three Modes of Knowledge:__

1. Obscure and indirect, leading to general knowledge of "being" and creation\.
2. Demonstrative, using natural reason to prove God's existence and aspects of His character\.
3. Knowledge from revelation, surpassing yet potentially including naturally revealed knowledge\.

__The Problem of Self\-Evidence\. __Aquinas asserts God's existence is not self\-evident to us; He must be known through His effects\. Though God is self\-evident per se, our inability to conceive Him necessitates this approach\. __Epistemology and Metaphysics\. __Aquinas employs foundationalism with syllogistic reasoning, avoiding inference\. Immediate propositions, where predicates are contained in the subject, serve as the base, with mediate demonstrative propositions forming the sides of a pyramid\. For Aquinas, immediate propositions are *grounded metaphysically,* not merely epistemic grounds for mediate propositions\. He percieves a direct link between beliefs and the nature of the world, intertwining epistemology and metaphysics\. __Praeambula Fidei\. __The debate on whether philosophy grounds theology or vice versa is significant\. Traditionally, philosophy is seen as the *praeambulum* of faith, marking its autonomy\. Some argue Aquinas's philosophy is theological, aligning philosophy with \(biblical\) revelation and making reason dependent on prior grace\. This debate is crucial due to Aquinas's pure nature and natural reason, placing apologetics in the principle of reason\. Aquinas's realism highlights foundationalism's propositional structure, with theology relying on natural reason \(philosophy\)\.

__Critique\.__

__Reason and Revelation\. __While reason has temporal priority, it is not a *principium*; it serves as a tool\. Aquinas, despite applying reason to Aristotle, overlooks sin's radical effect on the mind, failing to assess Acts 17 correctly\. Revelation provides content for the tool of reason\. __The Light of Reason\. __Drawing from John 1:9, Aquinas views 'light' as universal and incorporating participation in the Logos\. Oliphint expands this, seeing 'light' as a revelational activity of the Logos, offering knowledge of God beyond natural reason\. __The Problem of Self\-Evidence\. __Referencing John 1:9 and Romans 1:18\-19, Oliphint argues for the true knowledge of God revealed but suppressed due to sin\. This knowledge of God's existence involves relational, covenantal knowledge with ethical and moral implications, understood yet suppressed\. __Epistemology and Metaphysics\. __Oliphint aligns with the inseparable link between epistemology and metaphysics but highlights the sin\-induced abnormality in acknowledging knowledge of God\. __Praeambula Fidei\. __Where Aquinas champions natural reason, Oliphint contends that post\-fall, natural reason merely leads to idolatry\.

__3\. Foundation of Existence\.__

__*Principium Essendi* and Proofs of God's Existence\.__ Aquinas outlines the transition from *principium cognoscendi*, the principle of knowledge, to *principium essendi*, the principle of being, both rooted in existence itself\. His five ways \(*quinque viae*\) to demonstrate God's existence are:

1. __Motion or Change:__ Observes that moving things must be set in motion by other things, culminating in a first mover to avoid an infinite regress\. This argument is philosophical rather than theological\.
2. __Efficient Causality:__ Sensory observations reveal an order of causes, where nothing is the cause of itself, necessitating a first efficient cause\.
3. __Necessity and Possibility: __The contingency of existence suggests that something must exist necessarily to bring contingent things into being\.
4. __Gradation:__ There is a hierarchy of qualities or grades, implying the existence of a highest grade or perfection\.
5. __Design/Providence/Teleological:__ Natural entities act towards ends, indicating an intelligent being directing them toward their purposes\.

__Existence and Essence\.__ Aquinas posits that potentiality limits actuality, where essence is equated to potential existence\. In his view, the analogy of proportionality, where God is good by essence and man by existence, applies to creatures but not to God\. Instead, an analogy of intrinsic attribution, based on causal relationships, better characterizes God's essence as existence and pure act\.

__Who God Is\.__ Aquinas describes God with distinct attributes:

1. God has no physical body\.
2. God is not composed of matter or form\.
3. There is no composition or *whatness* \(quidity?\) and subject\.
4. God’s essence and existence are identical\.
5. God is not composed of *genus* or *difference*\. 
6. God is not composed of subject and accident \(God can’t have accidents, or would cease to be absolute, complete, and uncaused\)\.

These foundational perspectives highlight Aquinas's philosophical rigor in defining and defending the nature of divine existence\.

__Critique of Aquinas on the Proofs of God's Existence and God's Nature\.__

__Proofs of God's Existence\.__ Aquinas's reliance on natural reason and sensory observations for his cosmological arguments introduces specific challenges\. The concepts of motion, causality, and necessity hinge on temporal causality, yet Aquinas perceives God as eternal, unbound by time\. His conclusion that these arguments definitively point to God as understood by all is critiqued as a *non sequitur*\. There are two main issues in these premises: 1\) conceding the initial starting points to humanist perspectives and 2\) engaging in question begging by assuming the conclusions within the premises\. __Who God Is\.__ The simplicity of God, as presented by Aquinas, cannot be fully derived from sense or rational reason, only by presupposing the Triune God\. Plantinga argues that God has a nature rather than being equated with His properties, suggesting that if God were identical to His properties, He'd essentially be a single property, compromising His nature\. This approach questions the necessity and control of God over eternal truths, which Aquinas claims are independent of God\. __Oliphint's Perspective\.__ Oliphint emphasizes the Trinity, highlighting distinctions within unity without composites\. God's properties are both distinct and identical to Him, understood as *modal rather than substantial*\. Before creation, necessity did not exist, emphasizing God's self\-existence\. He critiques assertions like mathematical truths existing before creation, noting God's control over propositions without suggesting their falsity\. __Challenges to Divine Attributes\.__ Aquinas's views on God's simplicity and freedom face critique\. The notion of God having intrinsic accidental properties conflicts with immutability, as accidents change with time, not possible worlds\. God is bound by conditional necessity and His decisions, yet Stump contends that such characteristics, extrinsic to God's will, do not affect His simple nature\. Critiques question how a simple God acts without losing simplicity\. Oliphint’s concept of the ontological Trinity suggests God remains one, but acts according to each person's unique role within the Trinity, transcending the limitations of traditional metaphysical distinctions\. __God's Responsiveness in Creation\.__ God's condescension and engagement with creation are seen primarily through the incarnation, where the person, not the essence, takes on human nature\. This highlights the covenant and God's expressed interaction with creation via the Trinity\. Aquinas’s *principium* of natural reason is seen as inadequate for addressing the complexities inherent in divine responsiveness and the covenantal relationship\.

__4\. Conclusion\.__

__Thomas Aquinas’s Commitment to Natural Reason\.__ Aquinas maintains a strong commitment to natural reason and its role as the *praeambula fidei*, or the "preparation for faith\." While debates persist about the extent of this commitment, it is evident that Aquinas upholds the neutrality of reason within his philosophical framework\. __Exegesis Challenges\.__ The core disagreements often revolve around the interpretation of biblical passages like John 1 and Romans 1, where concepts of 'the light' and 'the truth' are analyzed\. These interpretations are often informed by philosophical considerations rather than strict exegetical approaches, leading to tension between theological and philosophical underpinnings in Aquinas’s work\. __Starting with Scripture\.__ Oliphint suggests that even the *principium cognoscendi*, the principle of knowing, should have its foundation in Scripture, rather than philosophy\. Aquinas's reliance on natural reason is critiqued for its inability to fully account for the divine categories necessary to predicate God, highlighting limitations in his framework\. __Incompatibility of Principia\.__ The inherent tension between Aquinas's use of natural reason and the foundational starting point of Scripture suggests two incompatible *principia* within his system\. This incongruity underscores the need for a more integrated approach that aligns philosophical inquiry with theological revelation\.
