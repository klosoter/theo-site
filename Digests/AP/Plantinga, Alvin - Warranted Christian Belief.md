__Alvin Plantinga: Warranted Christian Belief__

This book delves into the concept of "warrant," which is defined as the quality or quantity that turns a true belief into knowledge\. Plantinga's central thesis is that a belief is warranted if it is produced by cognitive faculties functioning properly in an appropriate environment and according to a design plan aimed at producing true beliefs\.

__Part 1: Is There a Question?__

__1\. Kant\.__

__I\. The Problem\. __The primary question \(*de *jure\) posed is whether it is rational, reasonable, justifiable, or warranted to accept Christian belief\. This extends to whether we can apply human concepts to God, who is a transcendent and infinite personal being\. 

__II\. Kant\. __Kant suggests that while we might reference God, our categories of understanding are limited to appearances and do not extend to the noumenal realm\. 

__*A\.  Two Worlds or One?*__* *Kant differentiates between "Dinge an sich" \(things in themselves or noumena\) and "Dinge fur uns" \(things as they appear to us or phenomena\)\. In the noumenal realm, while properties and concepts can have correlations, negations, and complements, positive properties cannot be ascribed\. 

Two\-World Picture: This involves both the noumenal and phenomenal worlds\.

- Moderate Subpicture: Though we can apply concepts to things in themselves, we cannot truly know them\.
- Radical Subpicture: Argues that we cannot refer to God or assign properties to Him, rendering God conceptually inaccessible\.

Kant posits that things stand in a causal or interactive relationship with the transcendental ego, or us\.

__*B\. Arguments or Reasons? *__Kant suggests that there are no definitive arguments for understanding the Dinge, but presents the concept of antinomies, where both opposing thesis and antithesis are true\. This implies we cannot conclude anything definitive about the Dinge\. However, Plantinga points out that the arguments supporting these antinomies are not conclusive\. __Conclusion\. __There is no solid reason to adhere to the view that our concepts do not apply to God, rejecting the notion of conceptual agnosticism\. This opens the possibility for belief in God to be rational and justified within the constraints of our cognitive faculties\.

__2\. Kaufman and Hick\.__

__I\. Kaufman\. __

__*A\. The Real Referent and the Available Referent\. *__Kaufman argues that God cannot be identified with any particular finite reality, leading to the question: what meaning does the term 'God' hold? Since God is not finite, nothing in our experience can correspond to 'God\.' He suggests that 'God' does not refer to anything tangible\. Plantinga counters that God can indeed be perceived, questioning why an infinite, omnipotent God could not make himself experienceable\. He notes that concepts can often refer to things outside direct experience, such as the Big Bang\. Kaufman maintains that the real referent either does not exist or cannot be referred to, but Plantinga finds this position incoherent, arguing that if there is no real referent, the term 'real referent' is self\-defeating\. Therefore, Kaufman views the available referent as an imaginative construct\. 

__*B\. The Function of Religious Language\.* __Kaufman suggests that while God might not exist, using the term 'God' benefits human flourishing, implying that religious language serves psychological and social functions\. Plantinga dismisses this view as inadequate\. 

__II\. Hick\. __

__*A\. The Real\. *__Hick distinguishes between God\-in\-itself and God\-for\-us, positing that we cannot describe the Real with our terms\. Despite this, he occasionally states that the Real can be experienced, leading to ambiguity in his position\. Hick argues that none of our concepts apply to the Real, allowing only for formal and negative concepts\. Plantinga challenges this by questioning Hick's claim that the Real possesses all negative properties for any positive property identified\. __*B\. Coherent? *__Plantinga questions if a being can possess only negative and formal properties, suggesting the possibility of multiple such beings\. He highlights the inconsistency that the Real is experienced and causally connected to us, indicating positive properties\. The distinction between positive and negative properties, such as "infinite" versus "not limited," becomes problematic\. __*C\. Religiously Relevant? *__If the Real cannot be known, we cannot determine whether it resembles Jesus, Vishnu, or Buddha\. __*D\. Is There Such a Thing? *__Hick claims that the Real must be presupposed but can encompass any Real, suggesting each religious tradition is mostly false\. He views everyone as mistaken, which Plantinga critiques as intellectual imperialism\. __Conclusion\. __Plantinga affirms that there is indeed such a thing as Christian belief, raising the *de jure* question of whether it is warranted, reasonable, and justified, rather than questioning its truth\.

__Part II: What is the Question?__

The central inquiry of this section pertains to what is specifically considered unreasonable or unjustifiable about Christianity and its beliefs\.

__3\. Justification and the Classical Picture\. __

__I\. John Locke\. *A\. Living by Reason\. *__Locke emphasizes reason as the guiding principle over fideism, which places faith above reason\. He distinguishes between opinion and knowledge, identifying four kinds of knowledge\. These include self\-evident propositions, knowledge about one's own mind's contents, knowledge of external objects, and demonstrative knowledge such as logic and deduction\. While we cannot control knowledge, opinions must be informed by reason\. Reason enables us to discern logical relationships between propositions, whether deductive or probabilistic\. Locke asserts that opinions should be regulated by reason, with assent proportionate to evidence\. __*B\. Revelation\. *__Locke contends that God's revelation is inherently true; however, Plantinga questions its relation to evidence\. Locke insists revelation must not contradict known facts\.

__II\. Classical Evidentialism, Deontologism, and Foundationalism\. *A\. Classical Foundationalism\. *__Foundationalism involves believing propositions based on evidential backgrounds of other propositions, suggesting all true propositions derive from basic beliefs\. __*B\. Classical Deontologism\. *__Locke posits a duty to regulate opinions through reason\. One's assent to a proposition is justified only if proportionate to its probability concerning certainty\. Believing otherwise constitutes flouting epistemic duty\. 

__III\. Back to the Present\. __The *de* *jure* question revolves around evidence, argument, and propositional evidence, emphasizing justification from a deontological perspective\. Here, W\. K\. Clifford's influence is notable, with evidentialists typically objecting to Christianity\. 

__IV\. Problems with the Classical Picture\. __Plantinga argues that there is no reason to believe Christian belief requires argument or propositional evidence for justification\. The classical picture suggests that a person is justified in a belief if it is properly basic \(self\-evident or evident to senses\) or derived from propositions that support it deductively, inductively, or abductively\. __*A\. Self\-Referential Problems\. *__The classical picture presents self\-referential problems\. It is not properly basic, neither self\-evident, nor based on mental states or evidences\. Thus, one must believe it through propositions that support it\. However, these arguments are unknown or improbable, leading to a contradiction within the classical picture itself\. __*B\. Most of Our Beliefs Unjustified? *__According to the classical picture, many beliefs we hold, such as daily recollections, are unjustified, yet this does not seem to violate epistemic duty\. 

__V\. Christian Belief Justified\. __From a deontological standpoint, Christian belief remains epistemologically responsible and cannot be adequately addressed by the classical picture\. 

__VI\. Analogical Variations\. *A\. Variations on Classical Foundationalism\. *__Some argue that evidence supporting Christian belief is only personally relevant to the believer, while others insist that propositional evidence is necessary for justification, often diminishing the role of deontology\. __*B\. Variations on Deontology\. *__Justification occurs if belief is based on adequate grounds\. The probability of a belief B, given it is grounded on G, is assessed as P\(B|G\)\. __*C\. Is This the de Jure Question? *__Plantinga suggests that asking for grounds differs from the *de jure* question, which focuses more on aprioricity and whether grounding beliefs in reason and evidence is necessary\. Not all ground\-beliefs are sensible; for example, believing the earth is round based solely on a comic book constitutes an incorrect reasoning ground, despite its truth\.

__4\. Rationality\.__

__I\. Some Assorted Versions of Rationality\. __The fundamental inquiry is whether the *de jure* question asks if Christian belief, with or without evidence, is rational\. __*A\. Aristotelian Rationality\. *__Defining humans as rational animals is overly simplistic given the widespread acceptance of Christianity among humans\. __*B\. Rationality as Proper Function\.* __Concerns arise about what happens when rational creatures malfunction\. However, individuals with properly functioning cognitive faculties have historically believed in God, indicating that belief can be rational even amid varied cognitive conditions\. __*C\. The Deliverances of Reason\. *__

A proposition is deemed *rational* if it emerges from the deliverances of reason, including self\-evident propositions and their logical consequences\. Christianity, while not self\-evident or a deduction from self\-evident propositions, does not face credible accusations of irrationality, as denying Christian propositions is neither self\-evident nor deducible\. Thus, these considerations address a *de facto* question rather than a *de jure* one\. __*D\. Means\-End Rationality\. *__This concept revolves around actions aimed at achieving goals, such as traveling quickly to Los Angeles, where rationality dictates choosing a plane over a bike\. Here, rationality is recognized as a property of actions, and if a Christian's aim is to know and believe the truth, it is simplified to this form of rationality\. 

__II\. Alstonian Practical Rationality\. *A\. The Initial Question\. *__Christian Mystical Practice involves forming beliefs about God based on experiential perceptions of the divine or the Ultimate\. __*B\. Doxastic Practices\. *__These are socially established methods of belief formation, like sense perception\. __*C\. Epistemic Circularity\.*__

Neither Christian Mystical Practice nor sense perception has robust non\-circular arguments, which is a condition observed across all doxastic practices\.  __*D\. The Argument for Practical Rationality\. *__We can demonstrate practical rationality in engaging with these practices, as neither sense perception nor Christian Mystical Practice leads to substantial inconsistencies or unreliability\. Furthermore, no epistemically non\-circular alternatives exist, and changing practices would entail significant disruption\. __*E\. Practical Rationality Initially Characterized\. *__Rational actions are those that most effectively contribute to realizing one’s goals\. __*F\. The Original Position\. *__Socially established doxastic practices are generally deemed more reliable than unique, idiosyncratic practices, given their grounding in shared social frameworks\. __*G\. The Wide Original Position\. *__Reflecting on the reliability of doxastic practices like sense perception and Christian Mystical Practice within the original position calls attention to the impossibility of providing non\-circular arguments, yet conviction in these practices sustains belief despite this triviality\. 

__Conclusion\. __The pivotal question appears to be: "What determines whether a specific mode of action or belief is rational or reasonable under particular circumstances?" The answer hinges on what a being of our kind, with properly functioning rational capacities, would do or believe if placed in those circumstances\.

__5\. Warrant and the Freud\-and\-Marx Complaint\.__

__I\. The Freud\-and\-Marx Complaint\. __The complaint from Freud and Marx critiques Christianity not on factual grounds \(*de facto*\) but on its rationality or justification \(*de jure*\)\. __*A\. Freud\. *__Freud argues that Christianity is an illusion rooted in wish\-fulfillment\. He claims that the cognitive functions producing religious beliefs are malfunctioning or irresponsible, as they are not aimed at forming true beliefs\. __*B\. Marx\. *__

Similar to Freud, Marx views Christianity as an illusion associated with wish\-fulfillment\. According to Marx, these beliefs arise from disordered cognitive processes that distort reality\. __*D\. How Shall We Understand the Freud\-and\-Marx Complaint? *__This criticism relies on naturalistic explanations of religious belief, suggesting that such beliefs are not produced by properly functioning cognitive faculties aimed at truth\. Therefore, the implication is that religious belief is irrational, even if it might happen to be true\. 

__II\. Warrant: The Sober Truth\. __Warrant involves beliefs aligning with our *design plan* and functioning as intended for *proper cognitive function*\. The Resolution Condition \(RC\) specifies that a belief produced by an exercise of cognitive powers has sufficient warrant for knowledge only if the environment with respect to the belief and exercise is favorable\. 

- A belief *B* produced by an exercise *E* of cognitive powers has warrant sufficient for knowledge only if *MBE* \(the mini\-environment with respect to *B* and *E*\) is favorable for *E*\.
- __Favorable__: 
	- *MBE* is favorable just if there is no state of affairs *S* included in *MBE* but not in *DMBE* such that the objective probability of *B* with respect to the conjunction of *DMBE* and *S* falls below *r *\(reliability?\)\.
	- *DBME* = *MBE* \+ Circumstances \(*C*\) detectable by *E*

What does 'favorable' mean? The mini\-environment is favorable if there is no state of affairs included within it that is not in the designed mini\-environment, causing the objective probability of the belief to fall below a certain threshold\. Here, the designed mini\-environment is the mini\-environment along with circumstances detectable by the cognitive exercise\.

__Part III: Warranted Christian Belief\.__

__6\. Warranted Belief in God\.__

__I\. The Aquinas/Calvin Model\. *A\. Models\. *__This section introduces two models: the *Aquinas/Calvin model* and the extended *Aquinas/Calvin model*\. Plantinga makes four key claims regarding these models:

- They are possible frameworks\.
- There are no cogent objections against them\.
- The models are not only possible but also true, beyond philosophical challenge\.
- There are multiple models offering similar insights\.

__*B\. The Presentation of the Model*\.__ Calvin posits the concept of *sensus divinitatis* as an innate faculty\. Plantinga describes this as an *input\-output mechanism*: specific circumstances trigger the belief in God\. 

1\. Basicality: Beliefs about God are considered basic; they are not inferred or deduced, akin to perception or a priori beliefs\.

2\. Proper Basicality with Respect to Justification: The *sensus divinitatis* is considered properly basic\. It is not evidentially supported or propositionally based, yet epistemically responsible to hold\.

3\. Proper Basicality with Respect to Warrant: Like memory and perception, beliefs arising from the *sensus divinitatis* possess warrant and are considered basic\.

4\. Natural Knowledge of God: The sensus* divinitatis* is part of our original cognitive framework, present even before the fall\.

5\. Perceptual or Experiential Knowledge? Plantinga argues that distinguishing between perceptual and experiential knowledge is not crucial in this context\.

6\. Sin and Natural Knowledge of God: The *sensus divinitatis* is damaged by sin but still functions to produce warranted, theistic beliefs in a basic manner\.

__II\. Is Belief in God Warrant\-Basic? __If belief in God is false, it is unlikely to be considered warrant\-basic\. If belief in God is true, it is likely to be warrant\-basic\.

__III\. The De Jure Question Is Not Independent of the De Facto Question\. __The warrant of belief in God is tied to its truth, illustrating the interdependence of *de jure* \(justification\) and *de facto* \(factuality\) questions\. 

__IV\. The Freud\-and\-Marx Complaint Revisited\. __Believers might perceive unbelief as unwarranted, stemming from dysfunction and brokenness, due to suppression of the senses intended to apprehend God\.

__7\. Sin and Its Cognitive Consequences\.__

__I\. Preliminaries\. __The *sensus divinitatis*, which facilitates the innate awareness of God, is broken due to sin\. This issue is not tied to any specific Christian denomination, but rather concerns the epistemological status of belief\. 

__II\. Initial Statement of the Extended Model\. __This model broadens the concept of the image of God into two aspects: a\) broad image: Encompasses qualities such as personhood, intellect, and will; b\) narrow image: Includes the *sensus divinitatis*, affections like gratitude, and knowledge of God\. __Sin__ introduces alienation and renders individuals unfit for communion with God, damaging and causing resistance to the *sensus divinitatis*\. God's revelation, through Scripture and the Holy Spirit, counters this corruption\.

__III\. The Nature of Sin\. __Sin damages the *sensus divinitatis* and is characterized by disobedience, pride, and self\-deception\.

__IV\. The Noetic Effects of Sin\. *A\. The Basic Consequence\. *__Sin primarily impacts knowledge of others, ourselves, and God, rather than knowledge of nature and the world\. It leads to hatred, hostility, and a malfunctioning *sensus divinitatis*\. __*B\. Sin and Knowledge\. *__Sin results in a failure to truly know God\. According to Calvin and Cornelius Van Til, this extends to a failure to know anything in a meaningful sense\. 

1. Sin and Skepticism: The probability of the reliability \(R\) of our cognitive faculties, given relevant facts \(F\), is inscrutable\. Philosophers like Hume argue that agnosticism about our origins undermines knowledge entirely\.
2. Naturalism and Lack of Knowledge: When considering metaphysical naturalism \(N\) and the proposition that our cognitive faculties developed through evolutionary mechanisms \(E\), the probability of reliability \(P\(R/N\)\) is either low or inscrutable\. This is because naturalism prioritizes adaptive behavior over true belief\. In such a framework, P\(R|NP1|2|3|4|\) remains problematic\.

The question then becomes: how can the damaged *sensus divinitatis* be repaired? The implication is that divine intervention and revelation, such as through the Holy Spirit, are necessary to restore this fundamental cognitive faculty to its proper function\.

__8\. The Extended Aquinas/Calvin Model: Revealed to Our Minds\.__

This model emphasizes justified, rational, and warranted Christian belief, supported by the Bible, the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit, and faith\. 

__I\. Faith\. __Faith is understood as a cognitive activity that involves knowledge being sealed upon our hearts and revealed to our minds\. It entails a belief in the good news, its application to the individual, and the necessary actions to receive its benefits, prioritizing belief over action\.

__II\. How Does Faith Work? __Faith is shaped by three fundamental factors: Scripture, the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, and the resulting human belief\. While basic, faith can be reasoned as Scripture equals divine testimony\.

__III\. Faith and Positive Epistemic Status\. *A\. Justification\. *__If one's belief is a result of the inward instigation of the Holy Spirit, it can seem obviously true, with no deontological reasons to reject it\. __*B\. Internal Rationality\. *__Faith arises from a properly functioning cognitive system, held epistemically responsibly, such as by investigating potential defeaters\. Plantinga sees nothing wrong with such belief following the Holy Spirit's instigation\. __*C\. External Rationality and Warrant: Faith is Knowledge\.* __Faith represents special knowledge of great significance, produced by an extraordinary cognitive process \(Revelation\)\. If true, the process involves no malfunction, as it is designed by God and testified by the Holy Spirit\. 

__IV\. Proper Basicality and the Role of Scripture\. __Christian belief is immediate and properly basic, akin to perception, rather than experiential\. Scripture is self\-authenticating but not self\-evident; its divinity and reliability are not inherently obvious\. Calvin's view is that arguments are unnecessary; faith, through the Spirit, renders belief evident\. 

__V\. Comparison with Locke\. __Locke argued that beliefs should form through "following reason" and first verifying a proposition as divine revelation\. In the testimonial model, divine revelation precedes individual reasoning\. 

__VI\. Why Necessary? __Without God's special intervention, humanity remains in sin\. Belief must transcend historical facts about Christ to be imprinted in the heart\.

- K: relevant body of knowledge or information\.
- P\(A|T&K\): God would make some kind of revelation \(of himself, or perhaps of what we need to know about him\) to humankind\.
	- P = 0\.9\-1
- P\(B|T&K\): Jesus’s teachings were such that they could be sensibly interpreted and extrapolated to G \(the great claims of the Gospel\)
	- P = 0\.7\-0\.9
- P\(C|T&K\): Jesus rose from the dead\.
	- P = 0\.6\-0\.8
- P\(D|T&K\): In raising Jesus from the dead, God endorsed his teachings\.
	- P = 0\.9
- P\(E|T&K\): The extension and extrapolation of Jesus’s teachings to G is true\.
- P\(E|T&K\) is the probability of the conjunction of:

1. Jesus intended to \(and did\) found a church to interpret and preserve his teachings,
2. God ratified that intention in raising him from the dead,
3. The church Jesus founded is still extant,
4. God has preserved that church from error,
5. That church teaches G

- On K&T&A&B&C&D
	- P\(\(1\)&\(2\)&\(3\)&\(4\)|K&T&A&B&C&D\) = 1 
	- Why?

__VII\. Cognitive Renewal\. __Sin has ravaged human faculties, leading to affective issues and cognitive blindness\. Through the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit and God's teachings in Scripture, a belief\-producing mechanism arises that generates the beliefs constituting faith, thereby warranting them despite our epistemic limitations\.

__9\. The Testimonial Model: Sealed upon Our Hearts\.__

__I\. Belief and Affection\. __Mere knowledge of God is insufficient, as illustrated by demons who "know and shudder\." Christian belief requires not just cognitive assent but also affection, where knowledge is sealed upon the heart by the Holy Spirit\.

__II\. Jonathan Edwards\. __Edwards emphasizes that faith is primarily about affections, specifically love for God and hatred for sin\. __*A\. Intellect and Will: Which Is Prior? *__Debate arises over whether sin primarily affects intellect or will\. Edwards acknowledges the centrality of affections but posits that intellect is prior to will\. Plantinga suggests that neither intellect nor will is primarily responsible in faith and regeneration, as *sin impacts both*\. __*B\. The Affirmations of Faith\. *__Edwards presents three pathways to faith:

1. A quick inference from the beauty and glory of the Gospel to its truth\.
2. Uninferred belief directly resulting from the design plan\.
3. The perception of the Gospel's beauty inspires admiration and delight, leading to belief\.

__III\. Analogue and Warrant\. __Our intellect is naturally oriented toward truth, and our affections and will are directed toward suitable objects\. Both intellect and affections can be justified or unjustified in their orientations\.

__IV\. Eros\. __Conversion entails a transformation of will and healing of disordered affections\. In Hebrew, knowing can imply an erotic element, mirroring the human longing for God as akin to human sexual desires\. Freud suggested religious feeling is diverted sexual energy, but Plantinga argues the opposite: longing for God is reflected in our sexual longings, serving as a sign of the human desire for divine union\. He speculates that God's capacity for suffering, like his knowledge, surpasses ours\. 

__The Extended Aquinas/Calvin Model:__

This model explains how Christian belief can possess justification, internal and external rationality, and warrant\. In this view, humanity's fallen state results in a condition from which only divine intervention can rescue us\. Jesus Christ, both fully human and divine, atoned for human sin through his suffering and death, enabling the right relationship with God\. The Bible is God's communication to humanity, declaring this good news\. However, due to our sinful nature, information alone is insufficient; a transformation of the heart is necessary\. This change is effected by the Holy Spirit's internal instigation, guiding our affections and revealing the Gospel's truths\. This process ensures that belief satisfies the conditions for warrant and its affective analog, demonstrating that these beliefs are often both justified and internally rational\.

__10\. Objections\.__

__I\. Warrant and the Argument from Religious Experience\. __Anthony O'Hear argues that religious experience requires a good, non\-circular argument from premises reporting the occurrence of such experiences\. Plantinga counters that this need is not applicable to other *a priori* beliefs, such as memory or perception\. O'Hear and Mackie also perceive Christian belief as akin to a scientific hypothesis\. Plantinga contends that if Christianity is true, then the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, the *sensus divinitatis*, and faith are also true, negating the need for external *justification* \(*de jure* vs *de facto*\)\.

__II\. What Can Experience Show? __Some object that experience cannot reveal something as specific as God, which may hold for sensuous or perceptual experiences, but not for doxastic experiences, which are belief\-forming\.

__III\. A Killer Argument\. __Richard Gale poses the question of whether religious experiences are 'cognitive\.' He suggests:

1. Religious experiences are analogous to sense experiences\.
2. Sense perceptions are cognitive\.
3. Therefore, religious experiences are cognitive\.

Plantinga argues that while religious experience can be like perceptual awareness of God, it does not equate to being purely cognitive\. The questions arise about the nature of this perception: Why is God not always perceived, and why do multiple people perceive Him simultaneously? Is it the same God? Plantinga criticizes these assumptions as dubious\.

__IV\. Son of Great Pumpkin\. __The idea that if belief in God is properly basic, then arguments against it are irrelevant\. However, this irrelevance does not apply universally\. The claim that if God is properly basic, then any belief could be, such as belief in the Great Pumpkin from Halloween, does not logically follow\. Proper basicality remains distinct and does not invalidate theistic belief\.

__V\. Circularity?__

Plantinga's claims for the model are:

1. It is possible\.
2. It is not subject to philosophical objections\.
3. If Christian belief is true, the model closely approximates the truth\.

The Aquinas/Calvin model is not an argument for Christianity nor the singular source of warrant\. It operates within the believer's framework, but potential defeaters will be considered in the following chapter\.

__Part IV: Defeaters?__

__11\. Defeaters and Defeat\.__

In previous discussions, it has been established that Christian belief can possess warrant in the absence of defeaters\.

__I\. The Nature of Defeaters\. __Defeaters come in two forms\. A *Rebutting Defeater* occurs when what you learn is inconsistent with the belief in question\. An *Undercutting Defeater *occurs when what you learn undermines the grounds or reasons for your belief without being directly inconsistent with it\. Defeaters are relative to one's noetic structure, meaning that a belief might be a defeater for one person but not another\. A defeater for a belief is something that, given an individual's noetic structure, prevents them from rationally holding the belief if they hold the defeater\.

*D* is a purely epistemic defeater of *B* for *S* at *t* if and only if 

1. *S*’s noetic structure *N* at *t* includes *B* and *S* comes to believe *D* at *t*, and 
2. Any person *S\**
	1. whose cognitive faculties are functioning properly in the relevant respects,
	2. who is such that the bit of the design plan governing the sustaining of *B* in her noetic structure is successfully aimed at truth \(i\.e\., at the maximization of true belief and minimization of false belief\) and nothing more, 
	3. whose noetic structure is *N* and includes *B*
	4. who comes to believe *D* but nothing else independent of or stronger than *D*, would withhold *B* \(or believe it less strongly\)

__II\. Defeaters for Christian or Theistic Belief\.__

A defeater would be such that a rational and sophisticated believer would need to accept it and thereby alter their belief\. Such defeaters could come from arguments or experiences\.

__III\. Projective Theories as a Defeater for Christian Belief?__

Theories proposed by figures like Marx, Freud, and Durkheim propose projective explanations for religious belief\. Though these theories are not rationally compelling, *accepting them would create defeaters*\.

Quinn suggests an "*explanatory defeater:*"

1. The existence of God is not required to explain theistic belief\.
2. Thus, God's existence is explanatorily idle\.
3. Therefore, this serves as a good reason to deny God's existence\.

Plantinga responds:

1. Christians do not treat God as a mere hypothesis or postulate; such postulations are typical in science\.
2. There is no need to derive God's non\-explanation solely from a lack of need to postulate Him; theism might explain much beyond God's mere existence\.
3. If God's existence is explanatorily idle, why infer His nonexistence? Theism is not merely an explanatory hypothesis, so its status should not be considered idle based solely on explanatory factors\.

Q4: \(If *S* can give an explanation of a certain range of her beliefs without assuming the existence of the entities whose existence those beliefs affirm, then *S* has an undercutting defeater for those beliefs\.\)

__12\. Two \(or More\) Kinds of Scripture Scholarship\.__

In examining scripture scholarship, two primary approaches emerge: 1\) that considers scripture as divinely inspired and 2\) higher criticism, which analyzes scripture through scientific and rational methodologies\.

__I\. Scripture Divinely Inspired\. __

The belief in the divine inspiration of the New Testament is underpinned by several key points: 

- The apostles were divinely commissioned as witnesses, 
- they produced teachings that incorporated Jesus's messages, 
- the New Testament books stem from apostolic writings or teachings by their close associates, 
- and the canonization involved divine authorization of these texts as a single volume of divine discourse\. 

These beliefs are not derived from historical investigation or as direct inferences from the Bible, but are immediately believed through the Holy Spirit\. According to the Belgic Confession, this belief arises from the Holy Spirit compelling acceptance of the content as God's message, and the Bible proving itself as divine\.

__II\. Traditional Christian Biblical Commentary\. __

While interpretations of Scripture are varied, it is broadly seen as inspired and truthful\. Traditional commentary holds certain assumptions: Scripture is wholly authoritative for faith and morals due to divine revelation, God is the primary author with humans as secondary, and what Scripture teaches is true, though not always clear\. This view contrasts with Historical Biblical Criticism, which seeks factual results through modern scientific means, discarding assumptions of inspiration or divinity and focusing on composition and authorship questions\.

__III\. Historical Biblical Criticism\. __

Historical Biblical Criticism attempts to analyze the Bible using scientific methodologies, removing theological assumptions\. Diverse forms of Historical Biblical Criticism include Troeltschian, which employs methodological doubt and excludes divine action; Duhemian, which avoids theological assumptions not widely accepted; and Spinozistic, focused solely on reason\. These methodologies contrast with traditional Christianity by positing the Bible as separate books rather than a unified revelation, isolating the Old Testament from New Testament references, and dismissing miracles\.

__IV\. Why Aren't Most Christians More Concerned?__

Despite the differences, many Christians remain unconcerned due to inconsistencies among critics and a lack of conclusive arguments that Historical Biblical Criticism should be preferred over traditional commentary\. This may result from historical developments that have limited alternatives or from the perception of Historical Biblical Criticism as being driven by elitist assumptions\. Though Historical Biblical Criticism risks sectarianism, it could provide a broader contextual understanding\.

__V\. Nothing to Be Concerned About\.__

Troeltschian Historical Biblical Criticism argues that modern belief systems conflict with traditional views, yet Plantinga finds such moral and ethical critiques unconvincing\. Duhemian and Spinozistic approaches prioritize reason exclusively, rejecting other forms of warrant, though they do not challenge the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit\.

__VI\. Concluding Coda\.__

Ultimately, Historical Biblical Criticism faces criticism as either Troeltschian, carrying assumptions that Plantinga rejects, or non\-Troeltschian, insufficiently considering all evidence\. In neither case does it provide substantial defeaters against the foundational concepts of Christian belief as being divinely inspired and guided by faith\.

__13\. Postmodernism and Pluralism\.__

__I\. Postmodernism\.__

Postmodernism challenges traditional notions of foundations, objectivity, truth, and even historical relativism\. It famously declares there are no foundations, truths, or objective standards, essentially rejecting the concept of deconstruction\. __*A\. Is Postmodernism Inconsistent with Christian Belief? *__While the rejection of foundationalism might seem consistent with Christian belief because it refutes rigid structures, postmodernism fundamentally opposes Christian belief by asserting 'God is dead,' and denying truth and objective standards\. __*B\. Do These Claims Defeat Christian Belief? *__Postmodernism doesn't necessarily defeat Christian belief\. Its aversion to using structured arguments diminishes its capacity to act as a defeater\. Postmodern theorists, like Richard Rorty, propose that truth is constructed by societal consensus, which fundamentally contradicts Christian belief\. This idea suggests truth and propositions are relative, which conflicts with the objective nature of Christian teachings\. 

1. __The Argument from Historical Conditionedness\. __The central premise suggests that if one's religious belief hinges on their historical context, it lacks warrant\. However, applying this argument to itself reveals it as self\-defeating\.
2. __Do Human Beings Construct the Truth? __Rorty's idea that truth is contingent on societal consensus conflicts with Christian belief by implying God's existence depends on societal constructs\. Plantinga argues that truth is not solely a linguistic construct and exists independently of human creation\.

__*C\. Postmodernism as a Failure of Nerve\. *__The decline of classical foundationalism, which upholds truth and universality, leads to a relativistic pursuit of self\-creation and self\-definition, rejecting realities not constructed by ourselves\.

__II\. Pluralism\. __

The question arises: does the knowledge of religious pluralism act as a defeater for Christian belief? Plantinga posits two personal beliefs: 

1. The world was created by an almighty, all\-knowing, and perfectly good personal God\.
2. Salvation is provided uniquely through Jesus Christ\.

Not everyone agrees with these beliefs, raising the question of exclusivism—whether to maintain belief in these propositions despite pluralistic knowledge\. One's belief should not depend on the ability to rationally convince others of its truth, challenging the notion that pluralism serves as a defeater for Christian belief\. __*A\. A Probabilistic Defeater? *__Plurality might imply a reduced probability of knowing the truth\. However, this probability only makes sense when considered alongside other beliefs a person holds, rendering it irrelevant under scrutiny\. __*B\. The Charge of Moral Arbitrariness\. *__Holding beliefs despite contrary opinions can be perceived as egotistical\. This objection argues that if one knows others disagree and lacks persuasive arguments, they shouldn't hold their belief\. However, this rule also applies self\-reflexively to those proposing it, revealing its inconsistency\.

1. __The Abstract Case\. __Arguing for exclusive beliefs on salvation and creation could be seen as dismissive of other beliefs\. However, calling Christian belief egotistical for contradicting others paradoxically invalidates dissenting views by the same logic\. 
2. __A Concrete Case: Gutting\. __Considering multiple disagreements that challenge the credibility of Christian belief suggests epistemological egoism—persisting in belief despite lacking persuasive justification—yet if Christian belief is truthful, it inherently stands superior within its claims amidst conflicting beliefs\.

__14\. Suffering and Evil\.__

Reconciling the existence of a good, omnipotent God with the presence of evil\. 

__I\. Evidential Atheological Arguments\.__

__*A\. Rowe's Arguments\. *__Rowe argues that there is no known good that justifies an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being in permitting extreme cases of evil, such as the rape and murder of a child \(E1\) and a fawn suffering in a forest fire \(E2\)\. From his stance:

1. P: No known good justifies permitting E1 and E2\.
2. Q: No good at all justifies permitting E1 and E2\.
3. Therefore: There is no perfect being\.

Plantinga critiques Rowe's conclusion, suggesting Rowe assumes his conclusion based on evidential insights into P\. 

__*B\. Draper's Argument\.*__

Draper contends that the pattern of pain and pleasure is less probable within theism than under a hypothesis \(*h*\) inconsistent with theism\. Now, let “O” stand for a statement reporting both the observations one has made of humans and animals experiencing pain or pleasure and the testimony one has encountered concerning the observations others have made of sentient beings experiencing pain and pleasure\. By “pain” I mean physical or mental suffering of any sort\. The statement O records observed pain or pleasure experiences among sentient beings\. Draper introduces the Hypothesis of Indifference \(HI\): 

1. Hypothesis of Indifference: Sentient beings' conditions aren't influenced by benevolent or malevolent non\-human actions\. The claim is that HI better explains O than theism\.
2. The epistemic probability P\(O|HI\) is greater than P\(O|T\), suggesting a stronger likelihood of HI\.

__On Being Evidentially Challenged\.* *__Plantinga challenges Draper's argument, questioning the seriousness of alternative hypotheses that aren't ad hoc and maintain initial plausibility\. Despite evidential challenges, Plantinga asserts that a typical theist could rationally continue to believe in God even after learning H \[theism is evidentially charged\] is true\.

__II\. Nonargumentative Defeaters?\.__

The notion of nonargumentative defeaters is illustrated with an individual mistaking someone's real name due to personal assertion rather than probabilistic reasoning \("I have always thought your name was Sam; you tell me that Sam is only your nickname and that your real name is Ahab; I then give up the belief that your name is Sam"\)\. Plantinga considers that evil might similarly be encountered without serving as a logical defeater for theism but instead posing pastoral or spiritual dilemmas\. For __classical Christianity__, evil isn't inconsistent with Christian belief, though it remains perplexing\. According to the Aquinas/Calvin model, the reality of evil does not constitute a defeater for theistic belief for a rational person with properly functioning cognitive faculties\. __Regenerated believers__, for whom God is evident, experience little to no inclination toward atheism or agnosticism when facing horrifying evil\. In the story of Job, his struggle is intellectual as he grapples with understanding why God allows his suffering\. Job's anger signifies a *challenge not with God's existence but with understanding divine action or inaction*\.
