__Created and Creating: A Biblical Theology of Culture – William B\. Edgar__

__Introduction\.__

William B\. Edgar begins by highlighting various cultural phenomena, such as Brazil's passion for soccer, educational differences in France and America, and the business culture globally\. In recent times, there has been increasing focus on culture, both from secular and Christian perspectives\. But what is culture? Edgar explores three denotations of the word: 

- Coulter: Referring to the cutting edge of the plow\.
- Colonus: Signifying partnership\.
- Cultus, Cult: Meaning to honor with worship\.

Culture is often construed as a measure of human achievement, a trait of a specific group, or a characteristic of a society\. It can be wielded to serve various agendas and is marked by negative aspects like hunger, poverty, distraction, and insatiability\. With culture acting as a "supreme explanatory principle," its scope is both vertical, covering elite to mundane interests, and horizontal, indicating a plurality of cultures rather than a single ideal\. This plurality has led culture to usurp religion, creating tension between nature and culture\.

__Part One: Parameters of Culture\.__

__1\. Cultural Analysis\. __

Edgar discusses the complex nature of cultural studies, noting that "culture is not only what we live by but also what we live for\." Cultural analysis involves three overlapping phases:

1. Culture as an ideal, representing improvement\.
2. The power dimension within social dynamics, encompassing economic, political, and psychological aspects, which can be descriptive or prescriptive\.
3. Culture broken down into anthropological entities\.

__Phase One\. __*Sir Edward Burnett Tylor* defines culture as "the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society," emphasizing progress through societal connections over individual independence\. *Matthew Arnold*, amid the Industrial Revolution’s dichotomy of increased wealth and decreased living conditions, saw culture as "the best which has been thought and said\." The *Romantic Spirit* in the arts focused on divine inspiration and imagination, with literature seen as a savior of civilization from turmoil\. Advocates for civilization indirectly align with the *biblical mandate* in Genesis to multiply and subdue the earth\.

__2\. Phase Two\. Culture and Power: Marxism\. __Marxism centers on emancipation and liberation from suppression and alienation, contrasting biblical alienation from God with Marx's focus on alienation due to money's artificial role\. Two key propositions include:

- Humanity's struggle focuses more on *class conflict* than ideas\.
- *Alienation* is the fundamental problem, where "modes of production" shape history and relations between classes\.
- History is a dialectical process with capitalism being the current stage of antagonism, leading to inevitable revolution\.

Nietzsche introduces the concept of secular redemption\.

__3\. Phase Three: The Anthropological Turn\. __This phase traces progress through magic, religion, to science, with contributions from Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Franz Boas, who emphasize cultural plurality and a move away from grand evolutionary schemas to appreciating diversity\. *Functionalism* views culture as a holistic entity, where any change affects the whole\. This phase focuses on identifying meaning by examining cultural phenomena\.

__Summary\. __

1. From advocates of civilization, we learn that human improvement and flourishing are integral to our calling\.
2. Marxism teaches that power, alongside ideas, governs humanity\. If used rightly, power structures effectively but can easily turn oppressive\.
3. The anthropological turn reveals that each culture exhibits traits reflecting humans made in God's image\.

__2\. Biblical and Theological Reflections\.__

__Word and Concept in Scripture\. __The term "culture" itself does not appear in Scripture, but notions of cultivation can be found in passages like Psalm 140:14, Ecclesiastes 5:9, Romans 11:24, and Hebrews 6:7\.

__Christian Voices\. __H\. Richard Niebuhr explores the relationship between Christ and culture, proposing five views: Christ against culture, the Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture paradox, and Christ the transformer of culture\. Niebuhr describes culture as the "artificial, secondary environment" created by humans, including languages, habits, ideas, beliefs, customs, social organization, inherited artifacts, technical processes, and values\. He critiques relating an abstract Christ to an artificial environment instead of recognizing Christ as both the goal and mediator of creation from the beginning\. __T\. S\. Eliot__ examines the interplay between Christian faith, culture, and literature, asserting that culture cannot exist without religion, despite its pluriform nature\. He opposes relativism and argues that society must be Christian in three ways: 1\) providing a Christian framework for political conduct, 2\) maintaining a community of practicing Christians engaged directly with their environments, and having a smaller intellectual community of Christian elites\. __C\. S\. Lewis__ is wary of cultural messianism, emphasizing holiness and self\-sacrifice over societal programs\. Despite his platonic tendencies focusing on the next world, he cautions against confusing the proximate with the ultimate\. __Abraham Kuyper__ identifies two worldviews: modernism, which constructs a world from natural data, and knee benders, those who revere Christ and aim to preserve Christian heritage\. Although he dismisses Christian culture as a notion, he acknowledges the Christian faith's influence on Western culture\. __Klaas Schilder,__ who coined the term "culture mandate," warns against it becoming merely programmatic and critiques Kuyper's concept of common grace\. Schilder insists grace pertains solely to salvation, maintaining a distinction between Christian and non\-believer work\. __Francis Schaeffer__ and other culture warriors highlight impulses toward orthodoxy and progressivism across five steps: philosophy, art, music, general culture, and 'the new theology\.' __Christian Liberationists,__ including liberationist, black, and feminist theologians, focus on power relations and resistance to oppression\. __Missiological Culture Students__ balance between bounded \(rigid and formal\) and centered \(vague and amorphous\) sets\. Leslie Newbigin emphasizes the triangular relationship between the gospel, culture, and the church, promoting conversion, reciprocal relationships, and missionary dialogue\. __Conclusion\. __Culture holds significant sway in global affairs, with varying interpretations of its dialectic and earthly significance\. This complexity is further enriched by cultural critics and diverse theological perspectives that underscore its importance and multifaceted nature\.

__Part Two: Challenges From Scripture\.__

__3\. Facing the *Contra Mundum* Texts\.__

There is a perception that the New Testament carries an anti\-cultural sentiment, often interpreted through texts such as the Sermon on the Mount, which emphasizes not storing treasures or worrying about material needs like clothing, and the story of the young rich man who is regarded as too worldly\. The admonition to "remember Lot's wife" and the teaching on God and Caesar further reinforce this view\. The Book of Acts often highlights disdain for earthly concerns in favor of heavenly focus\. John's writings warn against worldliness, targeting both the Pharisees and the broader worldly system\. Other letters in the New Testament advise, "do not be conformed to this world," acknowledging that the Spirit comes from God, and likening believers to "jars of clay" imbued with divine purpose\.

__4\. Read It Again \- Life in This World\.__

The obligation to oppose cultural evils is not a war against creation itself but against the malignancy of sin, similar to resistance efforts against oppressive regimes like the Nazis\. Finding a balance between resisting evil and exerting positive influence is essential\. Rather than a simple Aristotelian balance, it's about living in God's good creation while resisting the temptation to deny His authority, maintaining no inherent opposition\. __Re\-reading__ key texts like the Sermon on the Mount reveals the focus on Kingdom values and primary allegiances\. It's not about excluding concerns for food and clothing but prioritizing these within a broader understanding that emphasizes more than mere survival or preservation\. The blessedness of living according to these values starts in the present, serving as a warning not to forget the larger picture\. Earthly pursuits are significant but should not become idols, as illustrated by the Grand Inquisitor narrative\. The discourse on __God and Caesar__ challenges false dilemmas, asserting that everything, including what belongs to Caesar, ultimately belongs to God\. Despite sin's corruption, the fundamental order of creation continues to function, linking present life to future hope\. Christ’s life is presented as the ultimate goal, affirming our status as beings made in God’s image\. The Gospels and Acts consistently assert that life is never diminished for those who follow Christ, promising rewards manifold in this life and beyond\. In__ conclusion,__ it's vital to maintain a distinction among creation, fall, and redemption\. The fall is understood as an ethical lapse rather than a metaphysical one, a perspective notably articulated by Francis Schaeffer\. This provides a framework for understanding the relationship between biblical texts, culture, and Christian life in the world\.

__5\. This World, No Friend?__

Augustine's "City of God" explores the dichotomy between the earthly and heavenly cities, suggesting that while the earthly city is temporary, Christians must live alongside others and pursue peace and necessities in this world, albeit motivated differently\. Augustine is sometimes critiqued for suggesting the earthly city is not part of God's creation tainted by sin, potentially dividing God's good creation too sharply from human failings\. __Facing Pilate\. __Jesus's statement, "my kingdom is not of this world," is often interpreted as supporting Augustine's division between heavenly and earthly realms\. However, Jesus’s extensive ministry in the world—healing and engaging with people—indicates that His Kingdom includes a relationship with the world\. The spiritual and worldly are interconnected, and Jesus remains the ruler of all\. __The World According to John\. __John uses the term "kosmos" in various ways, referring to the human condition, the universe, and more\. There are positive portrayals of the world, recognizing the goodness of creation order, bringing light, giving life, revealing the Father's will, and expressing God’s love for the world\. However, John also warns of negatives like ungodliness and worldliness\. In John 17, Jesus leaves His disciples in the world, not to escape it but to fulfill a mission with His blessing\. __The Non\-Johannine Letters\. __These writings encourage believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices, embodying their faith while living in the world\. They are called not to conform to the world but to be transformed, indicating that such transformation naturally occurs within this world\. This reflects the theological concept of "already and not yet," where believers live in anticipation of the Kingdom while engaging actively with the present world\.

__6\. The End of the Beginning\.__

__A Roaring Fire\. __The writings of Peter highlight the imagery of fire as a symbol of impending judgment and destruction, as seen in Psalm 102 which describes things perishing and wearing out like a garment\. However, this imagery does not suggest total annihilation\. Peter calls believers to live in holiness and godliness, anticipating a future judgment that leads to a refined creation—a new heavens and a new earth\. Fire is both destructive and refining, preparing creation to be habitable for people\. __The Day Will Come\. __Old Testament prophecies, like Zephaniah 1, predict a consummation by fire that purges evil\. Despite the impending destruction, the Lord’s presence remains among His people, deserving praise\. This judgment eradicates destroyers and their cultures but also denotes purification, suggesting a future where righteousness prevails\. __Heaven and Hell\. __The concept of 'eternal life' can be perplexing, yet it is understood to begin in the present—believers already possess eternal life\. The notion of immortality is also complex, implying continuity of body and soul beyond death\. The general resurrection further supports the enduring life of believers\. __Conclusion\. __The eschatological vision does not include complete annihilation\. Instead, it revolves around the destruction and judgment of sin, oppression, and their cultures\. Believers and their righteous deeds, along with constructive cultural efforts, will endure, albeit purged of unholiness\. This affirms the lasting impact of faith\-informed cultural contributions\.

__Part Three: The Cultural Mandate\.__

__8\. The First Vocation\. __

The concept of the cultural mandate highlights humanity's primary vocation to engage with and cultivate creation\. This involves a balance between evangelism and social action, often viewed through the lens of two\-kingdom theology, which distinguishes between the order of creation and redemption\. Mission is understood as Christian service in the world, encompassing both evangelistic efforts and social justice initiatives, driven by love and combating hate\. __First and Last Callings\. __The cultural mandate and the Great Commission are not distinct commands but represent two stages of God's covenantal relationship with humanity\. The first invites humanity to steward creation, while the latter calls for sharing the gospel\. __The Image\. __Humanity shares certain attributes with God, carrying a royal task that includes exercising dominion and being fruitful, as well as filling and subduing the earth\. There is no dualism here; the whole person, soul, and body are involved\. Humanity as God's image means being His representative, embodying life in a manner akin to Michelangelo's artwork that brings life to form\. __The Creation Mandate\. __The image of God is both constitutive and functional, with the mandate having two iterations: God's intent for mankind's dominion and the blessing and command to procreate, fill, and exercise dominion over the earth\. While objections arise concerning population expansion, environmental degradation, and dominion as a control paradigm, Psalm 8 clarifies that humanity's significance stems from serving on behalf of God, not as a replacement\. __Culture and Common Grace at Creation\. __Klaas Schilder emphasized the cultural mandate should not compromise with non\-Christian ideas of culture\. Questioning whether there was common grace before the fall, the answer is affirmative, as an attitude of common favor permeated creation\. __Civilization and Progress in Scripture\. __Civilization is a God\-ordained project promoting human growth, but the term often bears elitist connotations, referring to the material or instrumental aspects of human culture\. Genesis emphasizes the human calling to develop and extend God's purposes\. Os Guinness distinguishes culture as a shared way of life and civilization as a culture with breadth, longevity, and elevation\. __Conclusions:__

1. God's covenant blessing extends to the human race\.
2. Humanity is called to be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth with our productive presence\.
3. We are to rule over creation with benevolent lordship\.
4. Cultural engagement becomes a human response to the divine call to enjoy and develop the world that God generously provides to His image\-bearers\.

__9\. Culture After the Fall\.__

Even after the Fall, humanity's dominion over creation persists, albeit tainted by sin's malignancy\. Human culture and work, although cursed, remain legitimate pursuits\. Genesis outlines three stages post\-fall: 1\) A rapid increase in sin and evil, exemplified by Cain’s lineage; 2\) The emergence of God’s redemptive purposes through Seth’s line; and 3\) Intermarriage between the Cainites and Sethites, suggesting a blended cultural milieu\. Redemption amidst this evil is evident, and it's not merely a contrast between worship and culture\-making, but an interdependent reality\. Enoch and Noah represent two hopes within these narratives\. __Noah\. __Noah serves as a 'reboot,' prefiguring Christ as a giver of rest\. His narrative reiterates the cultural mandate through a renewed covenant blessing, for all creation, inviting humanity to "be fruitful and multiply\." New features in this mandate include a redefined human\-animal relationship *based on fear*, the allowance of eating all moving creatures, and a prohibition against murder\. __Is Noah's Covenant Redemptive? __Meredith Kline argues it reflects common grace rather than a redemptive covenant, suggesting believers should avoid theocratic ambitions\. However, Edgar emphasizes:

1. God's covenant blessing is central \(Genesis 8:21\-22, 9:1, 8, 13\)\.
2. Noah’s descendants are tasked to repopulate the earth \(Genesis 9:1, 7\)\.
3. They are entrusted with dominion over creation, governing human society \(Genesis 9:2\-6\)\.

__The Dark Tower\. __Jacques Ellul views the city as civilization's apex, yet paradoxically a parasitic entity reliant on external resources\. The Tower of Babel narrative portrays humanity's quest for autonomy and self\-aggrandizement by "making a name\." God's intervention serves two purposes: 1\) disrupting the humanistic project and 2\) preserving humanity by dispersing them through linguistic diversity\. __Abrahamic Covenant\. __The covenant with Abraham reestablishes the call to be fruitful and multiply, stating:

1. God’s covenant blessing, confirmed by oath and sign, is given to the future Jewish nation \(Genesis 12:2\-3; 15:17\-18; 17:2, 7; 22:15\-18; 26:3\)\.
2. Abraham’s descendants will multiply, though they will face persecution \(Genesis 13:16; 15:5, 13; 16:10; 17:2; 22:15\-17; 26:4\)\.
3. They will eventually rule the Promised Land \(Genesis 13:15; 15:14; 17:6\)\.

While the Fall marred the original beauty and integrity of creation, sin affected all aspects of the world\. Nonetheless, through narratives like the gospel to the Dark Tower, and covenants with Noah and Abraham, redemption and promises of hope and blessing persist, underscoring a continuous divine narrative\.

__10\. The Cultural Reflex\.__

__Cultural Mandate in Psalm 8\. __Psalm 8 highlights the cultural mandate by declaring, "You've given them dominion over the works of your hands\." This underscores human dominion over creation, highlighting our metaphysical finitude while being just a little lower than the gods or heavenly beings\. Humans rule over all creation as a subset of God’s greater rule\. __Fulfillment in Christ\. __Hebrews 2 cites Psalm 8, applying it to Jesus Christ\. As the founder or champion, Christ leads us in fulfilling the cultural mandate, putting all things in subjection under our feet\. His thousand\-year reign, inaugurated by the resurrection, signifies ruling with Him\. Three features of the cultural mandate are reiterated:

1. The covenant blessing of a majestic God is reaffirmed\. Despite human frailty, God re\-creates humanity with glory and strength \(Psalm 8; Ephesians 1:3; 3:15; 6:10; 1 Peter 4:11\)\.
2. Praise arises, as seen in King David and infants, underscoring fruitfulness against obstacles \(Psalm 8:1\-2, 9; Matthew 11:25; 19:14; 21:15; Romans 8:16\)\.
3. The Lord grants dominion over all works of His hands \(Psalm 8:6\-8; Ephesians 1:21; Colossians 1:18\)\.

__Culture During Exile\. __Jeremiah's call in exile to be fruitful and multiply \(Jeremiah 23:3\) indicates God's sovereignty over creation and providential power over Babel and its king\. This echoes the cultural mandate: multiply and build while in captivity and seek the city's welfare\. The message of Jeremiah applies:

1. God extends covenant welfare \(shalom\) and restoration according to His timing, not as false prophets promise \(Jeremiah 29:7, 11\-14\)\.
2. Multiplying and fruitfulness in exile remain central \(Jeremiah 29:6\)\.
3. Exercising dominion, building, and intercessory action can continue under oppression \(Jeremiah 29:5, 7\)\.

__11\. Culture in the New Covenant\.__

__Jesus and Culture\. __Jesus, embedded in Jewish tradition and utilizing the synagogue and parables, framed the world He lived in as Creator\. He subjected and conformed to the prevailing culture to fulfill His mission\. __The Missions Mandate\. __The New Testament presents multiple versions of the missions mandate, emphasizing making disciples by going, baptizing, and teaching\. Three themes arise:

1. God's rich covenant blessing gathers people into His kingdom through the preached word and relevant social action\.
2. The good news spreads to all nations, preparing to populate the new Jerusalem\.
3. Dominion over opposing forces—including human guilt, idols, and death—is exercised\.

__New Testament Life\. __Everything done should be for the glory of God \(1 Corinthians 10:31\), emphasizing not only ethical but also cultural living\. Persecution shaped cultural contexts, with cultural references addressing how to handle internal and external hostility\. All authority belongs to God, and conversion signifies a radical transformation of one’s life\. Cultural concerns in the New Testament include:

- Marriage and celibacy, influenced by creation ordinances with cultural implications\.
- Work and monetary practices, reflecting cultural values tied to creation mandates\.
- Dietary practices, revealing cultural nuances\.
- Education and government, shaped by cultural contexts\.
- Missions strategy, demonstrating cultural sensitivity\.

__12\. Culture in the Afterlife\.__

The idea that all elements of human culture, tainted by sin, will be discarded is challenged by the belief that aspects glorifying God will continue into the New Heaven and New Earth\. Cultural endeavors aligned with godly purposes are anticipated to persist beyond the present age\. __What Is Heaven Like? __Augustine viewed temporal enjoyments as having no lasting good, while others might overly invest in the present world, overshadowing the hope for eternity\. The Bible does not provide a detailed description of the state of glory, but emphasizes that:

- God will be central, shifting focus from us to Him\.
- It will be without sin or misery, embodying an imperishable, perfect image of God\.
- Seeing Christ as He is will be the ultimate good \(*summum bonum*\)\.

Believers are promised never to experience eternal death, with life continuing into eternity\. This continuity renders present\-day culture\-making meaningful as it connects to a future cultural life\. Glorification encompasses being sinless and perfectly worshipful, loving our neighbors as ourselves\. __Redeemed Cities\. __In Revelation 22:5, believers are depicted as ruling forever, indicating the presence of cities\. Revelation 21:24 and Isaiah 60 portray the nations walking by divine light with their kings contributing their glory, alluding to:

1. God's judgment and the shining glory of Israel, drawing nations to her wealth\.
2. A heavenly future marked by security, openness, and perpetual divine light\.

This suggests a spiritual but substantial continuation of cultural pursuits\. Scholars like Richard Mouw, Anthony Hoekema, and Richard Bauckham propose that the cultural achievements dedicated to God, from art to societal contributions, will be refined and perpetuated in the new creation\. __Conclusion\. __

1. The ultimate blessing from God is His covenantal presence with humanity, eliminating suffering and death as the full redemption of God's children is realized \(Revelation 21:3\-4; Romans 8:19\)\.
2. Though traditional human institutions like marriage will cease, varied activities like worship, discovery, and culture\-making will flourish without the limitations of the present world\.
3. The culmination of the age reveals everything subject to Christ, with the glory of nations integrated into the New Jerusalem, where believers share in governance and stewardship \(Revelation 21:22\-27\)\.

N\.T\. Wright emphasizes the significance of bodily life and its deeds, asserting they contribute to God's kingdom and will carry over into eternity\. What we do now—whether through art, service, or acts of justice—are integral to the kingdom's construction and not merely temporary relief for present life's burdens \(*Surprised by Hope*, 193\)\.
