__Why Should I Believe Christianity? The Big Ten: Critical Questions Answered – James N\. Anderson and Greg Welty\.__

__Introduction: Why Believe\.__

We believe things fundamentally because we consider them true, informed by reasons such as information, argumentation, and evidence\. This book aims to provide compelling reasons to believe Christianity is true, *challenging contemporary relativism*—which Anderson argues is self\-defeating, as the statement "all religious claims are relative" itself claims objectivity\. Believers do not typically see their claims as relative, which conflicts with such relativism\. Skepticism, suggesting that truth is unknowable and fostering doubt, contrasts with Christianity, which is posited as more than just a lifestyle, moral code, or social identity\. Anderson's book intends to demonstrate Christianity as the correct worldview and does not primarily focus on defending against external criticisms\.

__2\. The Big Picture\.__

Christianity is presented as a comprehensive worldview, more than a mere collection of doctrines\. A worldview represents an all\-encompassing perspective that influences how we understand ourselves and everything else\. It answers the 'big questions' of existence, providing a foundational framework that shapes morality, metaphysics, and epistemology, which are essential and deeply influence our thinking and perception of truth claims\. Not all worldviews are equal or true; there can only be one true worldview since not all claims and assumptions internally or externally match reality\.

In evaluating worldviews, common sense suggests several tests:

- The *consistency* test checks for logical consistency\.
- The *coherence* test examines completeness and connectedness\.
- The *explanation* test seeks better explanations for critical questions\.
- The *evidence* test assesses how well the worldview fits available evidence\.

Anderson emphasizes the importance of evaluating a worldview *on its own terms* to truly grasp its validity and applicability\.

__3\. Christianity as a Worldview\.__

Central to the Christian worldview is the Bible, which serves as the foundation of its understanding, providing authority and guidance for life\. __God\. __At the heart of this worldview is God, an absolute and personal being who embodies every perfection and exists as a Trinity\. God is the ultimate creator and sustainer, instilling in the universe a rational order and structure\. Everything in creation is for His glory, reflecting His intimate and sovereign involvement\. __Humans__, created just a little lower than angels as noted in Psalm 8, are tasked with significant responsibilities, bearing God's image\. This reflects not only a likeness but also a call to live out His purposes on earth\. The narrative of the __Fall__ explains humanity's descent into rebellion and separation from God, marked by significant consequences such as condemnation, corruption, and the curse of death and misery\. Despite this, God continuously reaches out, revealing Himself and His will through various means, ultimately through Jesus Christ\. This revelation highlights who God is, what He intended humanity to be and do, and His plan for salvation to redeem humanity from its self\-imposed predicament\. __Salvation__ in the Christian worldview is not something humanity can achieve independently\. God intervened, planning from the start with the incarnation and work of Jesus Christ—culminating in atonement and resurrection\. Salvation requires faith, which means turning towards Jesus, and repentance, which involves turning away from sin\. The __essence of salvation__ lies in forgiveness of guilt and reconciling with God, transforming the life of the believer by breaking free from sin's hold\. The Christian narrative anticipates a __final chapter,__ one of consummation following creation, fall, and redemption\. This includes not only the spreading of the gospel but also God's final triumph over evil, the anticipated return of Jesus, and the general resurrection leading to the final judgment of heaven and hell\. *In the end, this worldview envisions a renewed creation, freed from its fallen and cursed state, where God's plans for humanity and the cosmos come to fulfillment\.*

__4\. God is There\.__

__Proofs of God\. __The concept of God posits that He is beyond our universe, transcendent, and self\-sufficient \(a se\)\. Therefore, He remains undetectable within the physical realm\. However, the universe only makes sense if God exists\. Under naturalism, reality is ultimately non\-personal, non\-rational, and non\-moral\. __Six Interrelated Arguments for the Existence of God\.__

1. God and Existence: Existence is contingent for every physical object\. Naturalism offers no explanation for this contingency, but Christianity does through three tenets: God exists, God is not contingent, and He freely chose to bring the universe into existence using His unlimited power\. Existence suggests the necessity of a necessary being, aligning with the ontological proof and the concept of the Trinity\.
2. God and Values: Value judgments require an objective standard, which implies an absolute Good—God\. Naturalism lacks absolutes, whereas the universe's imperfections point to a transcendent standard of perfection\.
3. God and Morality: Moral standards are assumed to be objective and absolute\. Christianity provides a transcendent moral lawgiver, whereas naturalism fails to provide an explanation\.
4. God and Reason: The ability to reason implies the existence of God, the supreme intellect\. Human rationality originates from God's absolute intelligence, whereas naturalism suggests reason arises from non\-reason, redirecting truth towards survival without satisfactory explanation\.
5. God and Mind: Mind precedes reason, requiring consciousness\. Naturalism claims matter preceded mind but offers no satisfactory explanation for consciousness\. Christianity identifies God as the personal eternal being with mind\.
6. God and Science: Science presupposes objective moral values, reliable senses and observations, and an ordered and rational universe\. The universe's intelligibility aligns with human reason under a Christian worldview\. These assumptions, necessary for science, are unsupported by naturalism but plausible within Christianity\. The fine\-tuned universe further suggests intentional design\.

__Does God Really Need to Be Proven? __Christianity is not just for intellectuals and believes God’s existence is plainly evident to everyone, as stated in Romans 1\. Atheism stems from suppression of truth and self\-deception rather than lack of evidence for God\.

__5\. God is Not Silent\.__

__The Bible as God's Word\. __The Bible is considered God's Word, a testament to His voice and communication with humanity\. Hearing God's voice is viewed not as a deduction but as a properly basic belief, akin to direct perception and recognition facilitated by the internal witness of the Holy Spirit\.  __Reasons to Believe God Speaks\. __There are two main reasons to believe God speaks through the Bible: 1\) its coherence and 2\) the inherent nature of a personal God to communicate with humanity through language\. God has spoken publicly and in written form, ensuring His message is preserved, objective, and accessible\. __Evaluation of Divine Communication\. __When evaluating where God has spoken, Christianity stands out among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\. Judaism leaves the Old Testament narrative incomplete, and while Christianity fulfills prophecies and resolves problems through kept promises, offering coherence\. In contrast, Islam misrepresents Christian beliefs and scriptures, leading to contradictions and incoherence\. Ultimately, the suggestion is to "ask an expert"—ask Jesus, whose teachings and life evidence divine communication\. 

__6\. God with Us\.__

__Historical Jesus and Christian Belief\. __Jesus is recognized as a historical figure, central to the Christian faith as outlined in the Apostle's Creed, which attests to his humanity, suffering, death, and divine sonship\. __Purpose of the Incarnation\. __The incarnation is coherent in solving the problem of sin; a human needed to die to pay the penalty, making Jesus the mediator between God and humanity\. This reconciliation is reasonable—God's holiness necessitates judgment, which, coupled with compassion, demands atonement that is both human and divine\. __Identity of Jesus\. __In questioning Jesus's identity, he is affirmed as the Son of God, equal and eternal, fully embodying God’s nature\. Jesus referred to God as "my Father in heaven" and used the divine "I AM" to identify himself, confirming his lordship and divine identity\. __Evidence of Divinity and Incarnation\. __The evidence for Jesus’s divinity is self\-attesting, demonstrated through his actions which reveal his divine character and power\. The possibility of Jesus being God incarnate might be questioned as illogical or impossible\. However, these doctrines, though partly comprehensible by human reason, suggest that the inability to fully grasp how God could achieve something does not imply its impossibility\. Every worldview has its mysteries, and the lack of understanding should not be seen as evidence against the truth of the Christian claims about Jesus’s divine nature\.

__7\. Defying Death\.__

__The Promise of Immortality\. __Christianity offers the promise of immortality through the belief that Jesus died and conquered death\. Although thinkers like Hume find this hard to accept, the Bible affirms this narrative as a cornerstone of faith\. __Miracles and the Resurrection\. __Miracles are considered possible under the assumption that if God established natural laws, He could alter them\. Their probability should not be dismissed due to initial skepticism\. The resurrection of Jesus is portrayed as the pinnacle of his miraculous deeds, with Jesus recognized as no ordinary individual\. As a known healer, exorcist, and miracle worker, his resurrection is supported by an empty tomb, eyewitness accounts, and ultimately confirms his claims, bringing coherence to his identity\. __Critique of Alternative Explanations\. __Alternative explanations for the empty tomb, such as theories of a stolen body, Jesus not dying on the cross, removal of the body by authorities, or hallucinations, tend to be unsatisfactory\. The belief in the resurrection is an integral part of the Christian worldview, making sense of Jesus's life, the transformation in his followers, the New Testament narrative, and the history of the church\.

__8\. What Now?__

__Unanswered Questions\. __In spite of Christianity's answers to many existential questions, certain issues remain unresolved, such as the problem of evil and suffering, the implications of evolutionary theory, alleged errors and contradictions in the Bible, the nature of the Old Testament God, the compatibility of hell with divine love, and hypocrisy among believers\. __Categories of Objections\. __These challenges fall into two main categories: 1\) misrepresentations of Christianity and 2\) critiques with assumptions from other worldviews that presuppose Christianity's falsehood\. Ironically, many objections rely on concepts within the Christian worldview itself\. __Exploring Alternatives\. __In considering alternative worldviews, these issues often remain inadequately addressed\. The belief in the need for supernatural guidance and communication is affirmed, asserting that God continues to speak and provide insights to illuminate these questions\.
