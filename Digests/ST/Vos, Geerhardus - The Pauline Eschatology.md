__The Pauline Eschatology \- Geerhardus Vos__

__I\. The Structure of Pauline Eschatology\.__

__Old Testament: *Hayomim Acherit*\.__ In the Old Testament, the term Hayomim Acherit represents the eschatological concept that does not point to a fixed moment in time but is a flexible concept within prophetic vision\. It emphasizes collective destinies rather than those of individuals, and its implications can be both favorable and unfavorable\. __New Testament Outside of Paul: *Eschaton*\.__ In the New Testament, excluding Paul's writings, "eschaton" refers to either a specific point in time or the final stretch of history\. Jesus speaks of it as a definitive point, whereas the Epistles often portray it as a stretch of time\. The New Testament authors express an acute awareness that the last days are unfolding, with "eternal" indicating a point or period concluding history\. __Pauline Eschatology\.__ Paul employs eschatological terms with an antithetical thrust, such as "last" versus "first," drawing contrasts like that between the First Adam and the Last Adam\. This contrast extends to two ages \(aion\) and two worlds \(kosmos\)\. Paul did not originate this dichotomy; it was present in contemporary Jewish thought, indicating its antiquity\. In Paul's usage, aion pertains to temporal sequences, while kosmos often associates with evil\. The temporal scheme shapes the world's understanding, central to Paul's theology and future\-oriented religious mindset\. __Centrality of Eschatology in Paul's Theology\.__ Eschatology occupies a central place in Paul's thought, with his theology characterized by a forward\-looking hope based on present realities\. This hope enlivens believers' consciousness of future promises, tying them to the present assurances\. Believers exist in a tension between realities of Heaven \(e\.g\., eternal citizenship\) and earth \(e\.g\., physical existence\), per Paul's model of eschatology\. Christ's ascension reconciles these worlds, drawing their ultimate "fruits" through the historical process of his earthly work and heavenly governance of the Church\. The Holy Spirit plays an essential role by unifying the dual aspects of believers' lives, representing the foretaste of the celestial state\. This eschatological view distances itself from Greek dualism, highlighting a uniquely cohesive theology\.

__II\. The Interaction Between Eschatology and Soteriology\.__

__Eschatology as the Crown of Soteriology\.__ In the Pauline framework, eschatology is considered the pinnacle of soteriology\. Paul demonstrates this connection through four crucial structures:

1. __Resurrection\.__ Christ's resurrection is viewed as the firstfruits, signifying that believers are risen with Christ, marking them as a new creation and signifying regeneration through baptism\.
2. __Salvation\.__ Paul articulates salvation as both a present and future reality\. He states, "we shall be saved with him" \(Romans 5:9\-10\) and "saved by hope" \(Romans 8:24\-25\), indicating future salvation\. The eschatological aspect is prioritized in his theology, underscoring that salvation is nearer now than when believers first believed\. This future\-oriented perspective is further emphasized in Philippians 2:12, urging believers to "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling\."
3. __Justification\.__ For Paul, future sins and judgment necessitate an eschatological dimension of justification, extending beyond present experiences to encompass the entirety of the eschatological timeline\.
4. __Pneumatology\.__ Paul's pneumatology denotes a supernatural reality in contrast to the natural, emphasizing a celestial over a worldly perspective within the role of the Holy Spirit\.

__III\. The Religious and Ethical Motivation of Paul's Eschatology\.__

__Responses to Objections\.__ Two prevalent objections to Paul's focus on eschatology are addressed:

1. __Otherworldly Focus\.__ Critics argue that Paul's eschatology is too otherworldly and detached from the present life\. However, Paul stresses the significance of current labor, linking it to eschatological reward—asserting that efforts are "not in vain" \(1 Corinthians 15\)\. The eschatological reward encompasses glory, honor, immortality, and eternal life, affirming the importance of earthly endeavors within an eschatological framework\.
2. __Alleged Egotism\.__ Some perceive Paul’s high regard for the body within eschatology as self\-centered or hedonistic\. Contrary to this, Paul sees a restored body as integral to glorifying God fully\. The richer glorification of God through the complete restoration of human beings surpasses that of a disembodied state\. Eschatological fulfillment, therefore, is inherently tied to communion with God, not mere personal pleasure\.

__IV\. The Coming of the Lord and Its Precursors\.__

__Judgment and Resurrection\.__ In Paul's eschatology, the coming of the Lord entails the summation and judgment of the fallen world, alongside the resurrection which restores the world to its intended state\. Paul uses three key terms to describe this event: 1\) *Parousia*\. This term, akin to a "visit," indicates Christ's becoming present in a definitive, catastrophic event, rather than a sequence of events, affecting both believers and enemies; 2\)* Revelation or Apocalypse*\. Drawing from Jewish eschatology, this refers to the Messiah's unveiling, revealing Christ from the hidden to the visible realm, focusing primarily on believers\. 3\) *He Hemera \(The Day\)*\. Symbolizing light and deliverance, this term contrasts with darkness and wickedness, suggesting a period of joy and renewal, encompassing an extended duration\. __Organic Process of Eschatology\.__ While these terms point to singular events, they fit within an organic process of world history unrolling toward its culmination, marked by "the fullness of time" \(Galatians 4:4\)\. This entails a gradual, orderly progression through tribulation and the spread of the Gospel, leading to the "fullness of the Gentiles" as indicated in Romans 11 and the gradual subjugation of Christ's enemies, leading to His ultimate reign as illustrated in 1 Corinthians 15\. This perspective embodies a redemptive optimism, recognizing tribulation as imminent but ultimately leading to glorious renewal\.

__V\. The Man of Sin\.__

__Antichrist and Paul's Writings\.__ Although the term "Antichrist" does not appear in Paul's writings, he engages with themes that relate to the concept, most notably in 2 Thessalonians 2:3\-12\. Connections to earlier traditions like "Belial" are suggested but not explicitly found in Scripture\. Vos concludes that the closest scriptural correlation is between the Man of Sin in Paul's epistle and the prophecies of Daniel, emphasizing themes such as anti\-divine arrogance, blasphemy, and desolation\. __Themes in Daniel and 2 Thessalonians\.__ Both texts describe the Man of Sin with similar motifs, including opposition to divine authority, desecration of holy spaces, and blasphemous actions\. Thessalonians adds a focus on distorting revealed truth not present in Daniel\. __Continuity with Old Testament Predictions\.__ The New Testament portrayal of an eschatological Antichrist aligns with Old Testament predictions, though it also connects with contemporary historical figures and events\. While Ezekiel's imagery of Gog and Magog is distinct and largely unrelated to Paul's depiction, Paul's prophecy in 2 Thessalonians is significantly influenced by Daniel\. __Paul’s View of the Man of Sin\.__ Paul attributes a personal aspect to the Man of Sin, depicting him as a leader of apostasy empowered by Satanic influence, rather than Satan himself\. This figure deifies himself in opposition to divine authority but should not be interpreted as a pseudo\-Messiah for the Jews\. Unlike in Johannine literature, Paul’s vocabulary does not include "antichrist," and his depiction does not support a strictly military or political figure like Nero\. __Origin and Restraint of the Man of Sin\.__ The origin of the Man of Sin remains ambiguous, with suggestions of either a human figure assuming a public role or a supernatural origin\. Despite his eventual defeat and disposal in the second death, the restraining force preventing his full emergence is not identified\. __Vos's Conclusion\.__ Vos warns against assuming continuous progress for the cause of Christ up to the end times\. Instead, as the truth extends gradually, the power of evil is also gathering strength, necessitating a final divine intervention for true renewal\. The unfolding of eschatological events, including the rise of the Man of Sin, illustrates the complexity of God’s redemptive timeline, rather than linear improvement\.

__VI\. The Resurrection\.__

__1 Thessalonians 4:16–17\.__ In this passage, Paul depicts the resurrection with rich imagery\. The "cry of command" is Christ's authoritative call, not a military one, addressing the dead with a summons to rise\. The "voice of an archangel" and the "trumpet of God" draw on Old Testament themes of angels and eschatological judgment\. __Paul and the Intermediate State\.__ For Paul, the intermediate state is conscious and self\-reflective, not a soul\-sleep\. Terms like "sleep" are more tender descriptions of death, indicating rest and anticipation of awakening in Christ\. Paul expresses a preference for being "in Christ," implying awareness and comfort\. __Nature of Resurrection\.__ Paul's view of resurrection encompasses both forensic and transformative aspects\. Forensically, it involves the removal of guilt and the declaration of righteousness, which is essentially linked to justification\. Transformatively, it affects the inner condition through regeneration and sanctification\. Vos notes that the believer's resurrection flows from Christ's resurrection, highlighting its foundational role in justification\. __Adoption and Transformation\.__ Adoption is both legal and transformative, culminating in bodily resurrection at the parousia, where believers are conformed to Christ's image\. This implies a somatic transformation in line with the spiritual continuity between Christ's resurrection and that of believers\. __Role of the Holy Spirit and Continuity\.__ The Holy Spirit ensures continuity between present grace and eschatological resurrection\. The Spirit, as *the source and sustainer* of resurrection life, bridges this life with the eschatological state, imparting new life as seen in Old Testament references like Joel 2 and Ezekiel 37\. The "spiritual body" in Paul's theology contrasts earthly and heavenly realities, emphasizing the Spirit's transformative role\. __Conclusion\.__ Vos highlights that the eschatological state is primarily a pneumatic state, characterized by the Spirit\-infused life of heaven imparted to believers through resurrection\. This pneumatological dimension underscores the transformative hope embedded in Pauline eschatology\.

__VII\. Alleged Development in Paul's Teaching on the Resurrection\.__

Three \(Four?\) Critical Theories on Paul's Resurrection Theology\. Scholars have proposed developments in Paul's theology of resurrection:

1. __Purely\-Jewish Eschatological Belief\.__ This theory, based on 1 Thessalonians, suggests Paul initially held a Jewish view of resurrection without bodily transformation—a "pre\-pneumatic" perspective\. However, Vos argues that Paul was already aware of the spiritual nature of resurrection, as seen in the phrase "Dead in Christ," which implies a mystical union with Christ through the Spirit\.
2. __Pneumatic Transformation in 1 Corinthians\.__ Here, Paul emphasizes a "pneumatic" transformation, where the body undergoes significant change at the time of the parousia\. Vos agrees with this transformation idea but contends that it doesn't account for the continuity between the original and resurrection bodies, as seen through the imagery of sowing and rising\. The Spirit, as both sower and seed, assures this continuity\.
3. __Spirit in the Life of Believers\.__ This theory posits resurrection occurs at death, with 2 Corinthians 5:1 suggesting an immediate heavenly body\. Vos counters that the heavenly body is not preexistent but awaits the parousia, where "this corruptible must put on incorruption" \(1 Corinthians 15:53\)\. Paul was undecided on whether this transformation happens at death or after an intermediate state, though he preferred the former\.
4. __Gradual Transformation into Glory\.__ This view proposes a gradual transformation, reflected in 2 Corinthians 3:18\. Vos clarifies that the full transformation of the body occurs at the parousia\. He likens the process to Moses's vision, where Christians gain glory by *beholding* with unveiled faces, as if looking in a mirror\.

Overall, Vos affirms that while Paul's teachings on resurrection may reflect different emphases, they consistently convey the eventual transformation of believers into glorified states at Christ's return, with continuity between present and future realities ensured through the Spirit\.

__VIII\. The Resurrection\-Change\.__

__The Nature of Transformation\.__ Vos explores whether the transformation at the parousia is distinct from resurrection, particularly for believers who are alive at Christ's return\. In 1 Thessalonians 4:15\-17, Paul does not directly address a change for those living, whereas in 2 Corinthians 5:1\-5, he implies that a transformation has already occurred\. Passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:51\-53 and Philippians 3:20\-21 describe the transformation from an old body to a new one, indicating a significant change\. __Jesus's Transformation\.__ The transformation of Jesus is inseparable from his resurrection, encompassing both physical and psychical aspects, setting a precedent for believers' transformation\. __Vos's Conclusion\. __*1 Corinthians 15:51\-53\.* Vos acknowledges a balance in interpretations regarding whether the change for the living is distinct from the resurrection process\. He notes that while Paul's conception of resurrection involves a pneumatic transformation, it remains unclear if those resurrected undergo further change along with the living\. The language used by Paul may generically cover both events without specifying which is paramount\. *Philippians 3:20\-21\.* The phrase "waiting for a Savior" may suggest Paul anticipated experiencing the parousia\. Here are two equally plausible interpretations: either the term "transformation" applies solely to living believers at the parousia, or it could also encompass the resurrection process itself\. Vos remains open to both interpretations, recognizing the complexities in Paul's language\.

__IX\. The Extent of the Resurrection\. __

__Who is Raised at the End?__ Vos examines whether the resurrection at the end times encompasses all people or only a specific group who have died by that time\. In Pauline thought, the resurrection is fundamentally a pneumatic event, leading to the question of whether such an event, where the Spirit is so central, could involve non\-Christians\. __Paul's Focus on Redemption\.__ Paul discusses the resurrection primarily from a redemptive perspective, offering comfort to Christians\. He had no apparent reason to propose a resurrection for non\-believers outside the soteric sphere\. Vos suggests Paul consciously avoided discussing the resurrection of the wicked to help maintain the focus on believers\. __Historical Context and Jewish Thought\.__ Similar to Paul's focus, the Pharisees emphasized the resurrection of believers, though they did not explicitly deny a resurrection for all people\. However, the doctrine of a universal resurrection was not a firmly established Jewish belief before or during Paul's time\. __Paul's Explicit Reference\.__ The only explicit mention in Paul's writings of a general resurrection, including the unjust, occurs in Acts 24:15\. Here, Paul expresses hope in God for the resurrection of both the just and the unjust, highlighting its significance in his broader theology\. __Presence of the Wicked at Judgment\.__ While Paul anticipates the presence of the wicked at judgment, he does not clarify whether this involves their physical resurrection\. Vos notes that some Jewish thought allowed for the judgment of disembodied souls, suggesting potential variance in understanding\. Beyond Acts 24:15, Paul remains somewhat ambiguous on the resurrection of the wicked\.

__X\. The Question of Chiliasm in Paul\.__

__Vos's Conclusion\.__ Vos critically assesses the arguments from supposed proof texts advocating for Chiliasm, or the belief in a future Messianic Kingdom, and finds them largely inconsistent with Paul's thought\. He examines texts such as 1 Corinthians 15:24\-25, which some interpret as supporting a discreet millennial kingdom\. However, Vos argues that this passage simply distinguishes between the present reign of Christ and the future realization of God's kingdom\. __Present and Future Kingdom\.__ Vos asserts that the Messianic, provisional kingdom and the current salvation experience \(soteria\) are identical and coextensive\. For believers, the present experience is the firstfruits and pledge of eternal life\. Even the present kingdom of God, as noted in Romans 14:17 and 1 Corinthians 4:20, is characterized by peace, joy, and power through the Holy Spirit, aligning with Christ's current reign\. __No Hard Distinction\.__ Vos concludes that there is no sharp distinction between the Messianic kingdom and the ultimate kingdom of God in Paul's writings\. The present kingdom of Christ is often referred to as the kingdom of God, and the future kingdom can likewise be associated with Christ \(as in Ephesians 5:5\)\. This fluidity reflects Paul's view of the kingdom as a continuum rather than a series of distinctly separated phases\. 

__XI\. The Judgment\. __

The concept of judgment in Pauline eschatology is presented with both realistic and forensic aspects\. Realistically, judgment involves direct actions such as the Man of Sin being disposed of by the breath of Christ’s mouth and is connected with terms like "orge" \(wrath, not exclusively eschatological\) and "olethros," "apollumi," and "apoleia" \(annihilation/destruction, eschatological\)\. __Forensic Aspect\.__ The forensic dimension involves terms such as "kritein," "krenesthai," "krisis," and "krima," with the central idea being discrimination and opinion formation without a technical judicial element\. Terms like "apokrithenai" denote opinion against opinion, while "diakaios," "dikaioun," and "dikaiosis" emphasize eschatological justification, synonymously referred to as "dikaiokrisia" \(righteous judgment\)\. Paul views judgment as a moment for distinguishing future rank and enjoyment among Christians, introducing the concept of reward that blends fear and solemnity with hope and joy\. __Public and Vindicative Aspects\.__ The judgment possesses a public character and serves to vindicate God's ways\. It also encompasses the judgment of angels, including demonic powers, as referenced in 1 Corinthians 6:2–3, where Paul asserts that saints will judge both the world and angels\. __Christ as the Judging Authority\.__ God is the ultimate judge, and Christ’s human nature is essential for his holding judgment\. This is underscored by passages like Acts 17 and John 5:27, which emphasize Christ's authority stemming from His incarnation, although the precise motive for this emphasis is unclear\.

__XII\. The Eternal State\.__ The concept of the eternal state in Pauline theology is explored through the Hebrew term "Olam" and the Greek "aion" and "aionios," which imply "non\-cessation\." Paul does not suggest that time or duration will cease; instead, the eternal state is characterized by unchangeability and imperishableness\. __Goal of Blessed Eternal State\.__ The temporal and partial experience of God is deemed insufficient\. God grants a reflection of His eternal existence by allowing entry into the "aionion" realm, fulfilling the eschatological goal of religious fellowship and offering true satisfaction for Himself\. __State for the Condemned\.__ Paul uses "aionios" only once regarding the condemned in 2 Thessalonians 1:9, describing eternal destruction as separation from the Lord’s presence\. Jesus, however, uses terms like "apoleia" and "Gehenna" to denote this eternal state without implying annihilation\. The eternal state extends its heavenly character to the earthly reality, introducing an otherworldly element\. __Elements Unfolding the Eternal and Heavenly\.__ The eternal state is manifested in four elements: the Spirit, life, glory, and the kingdom of God\. The *Spirit* contrasts with "sarx" and connects earthly life with the heavenly age to come, producing life, glory, and the kingdom of God\. These elements comprehensively define the blessed eternal state\. *Life *opposes death in the heavenly realm, immune to sorrow, sin, and evil\. "Zoe aionios" \(eternal life\) is common in Paul's writings, highlighting dynamism and life's telic character oriented towards God\. God imparts immortality essentially, while believers receive it graciously\. *Glory *is as interconnected with the Spirit as life, representing the external manifestation of higher life, while life symbolizes the internal essence of the eschatological subject\. __Further Progress in the Eternal State\.__ Vos argues against the idea of successive ages or worlds beyond the eschatologically consummated world\. Eternity lacks further sowing and reaping, as God’s inexhaustible fullness negates any want or ennui\. The eschatological Church triumphs eternally as the *Ecclesia triumphans*, laying aside the armor of militancy\. This concept is vital for understanding the eternal state in contrast to temporal concerns\.
