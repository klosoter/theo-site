__Chapter 8: The Vitality of Reformed Systematic Theology \(121\-148\) – Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

In this chapter, Gaffin explores the vitality and future of Calvinism, drawing insights from Herman __Bavinck's__ essay "The Future of Calvinism\." He discusses the current state of Calvinism, the inherent strengths of Reformed theology, and the relationship between Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology\.

He starts by addressing the decline and preservation of Calvinism in the Netherlands\. Despite its decline, a faithful remnant has preserved Calvinist tenets, often in a rigid and reactionary form\. This inflexibility results in a conservatism that risks losing its relevance and vitality\. Bavinck highlights that Calvinism's strength lies in its diversity within theology and church life, which avoids mechanical uniformity\. This multiplicity in confessions and liturgical practices contributes to a dynamic, living faith that retains its vitality\. Gaffin then discusses how Reformed Systematic Theology can either emphasize its oppositional stance or its inherent vigor\. In his approach in this chapter, he favors emphasizing its inherent vitality, rooted in the living and active nature of the Word of God and the vitality of the Holy Spirit\. Systematic Theology should maintain a "sympathetic\-critical" \(cf\., Klaas Schilder\) approach to confessions, always seeking fidelity to Scripture\. This aligns with Vos’s view that the Bible is not a simple dogmatic handbook but rather conveys the progressive character of divine revelation\.

The relationship between Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology is also a central topic\. Gaffin argues that Biblical Theology represents redemptive\-historical exegesis, focusing on the covenantal history that highlights God’s progressive revelation culminating in Christ\. All exegesis should be biblical\-theological, anchoring Systematic Theology in the history of redemption, which sets the agenda for doctrine\.

Gaffin critiques Gordon Spykman's approach to Reformational Theology, which seeks to integrate the historical\-redemptive pattern of biblical revelation into Reformed Systematic Theology\. Spykman highlights the bond between creation and redemption and proposes four categories: creation, fall, redemption, and consummation\. However, Gaffin argues for a simpler division: Creation, Fall, and Redemption, emphasizing that __soteriology inherently involves eschatology__, seen in the "already\-not yet" dynamic\. This perspective should make clearer how each element of the application of salvation \(justification, sanctification, glorification\) is both a present reality and a future promise\.

Gaffin also responds to Spykman's extensive prolegomena, suggesting that it may undermine the redemptive\-historical approach\. He asserts that there is indeed theology in Scripture, countering Spykman’s view that theology is merely concerned with confession as human activity\. Gaffin maintains that theological continuity exists between the apostles and the present church, emphasizing the need for responsible and methodologically self\-conscious theological activity\.

The chapter emphasizes that the relationship between Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology involves recognizing a deep continuity with the apostles' teachings\. This continuity validates theological activity as an extension of apostolic ministry, focusing on the same gospel and eschatological reality\. Gaffin stresses that Systematic Theology must remain correctable by Scripture, ensuring it stays vibrant and faithful to the biblical witness\.

Gaffin concludes that the historical accomplishment of redemption is central to Paul’s theology and is crucial for Reformed Systematic Theology\. Understanding this allows for an ongoing engagement with Scripture, ensuring that theology remains dynamic and relevant\. The vitality of Reformed Systematic Theology, according to Gaffin, lies in its foundation on Scripture and the living reality of redemption accomplished in Christ, continually applied through the Spirit\.
