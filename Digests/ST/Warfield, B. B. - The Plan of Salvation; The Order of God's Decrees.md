__Warfield—The Plan of Salvation: The Order of God's Decrees__

__Introduction\. __Warfield suggests that God's divine activities center around the ultimate goal of the salvation of sinful humanity\. 

__Differing Conceptions\. __Warfield prefers the term "The Plan of Salvation" to denote that theism sees God as acting purposefully\. Unlike deism, which views God as setting a mechanistic universe into motion and then stepping back, theism portrays God as actively involved, including in the plan of salvation\. __Naturalistic and Supernaturalistic Views\. __The naturalistic view holds that man must save himself, as seen in beliefs like Pelagianism \(intermediate views are naturalistic as well\)\. In contrast, the supernaturalistic view maintains that God intervenes to save mankind, asserting that salvation is God's work\. __Variations Among Supernaturalists\. __Within the supernaturalistic camp, Sacerdotalists argue for salvation through intermediaries, such as the church in Roman Catholicism\. Evangelicals emphasize immediate divine grace without intermediaries, aligning with Protestantism\. __Differences Among Evangelicals\. __Evangelicals are further divided\. Lutheranism incorporates a modified sacerdotalism, whereas Arminianism and pure evangelicalism can be distinguished by their universalistic versus particularistic approaches to salvation\. __Variances Among Particularists\. __Some uphold that God focuses on the elect specifically, while others, like in Amyraldianism or Hypothetical Universalism, propose a mixed approach where Christ's redemption is available to all but not universally effective\. __Options in Views\. __Individuals fall into categories of naturalists or supernaturalists\. Supernaturalists subdivide into sacerdotalists or evangelicals, who further differentiate as universalists or particularists\. Among particularists, there is a distinction in whether God's operations are partly or wholly particularistic\. The debate between supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism examines the order of God's decrees: *whether God discriminates to save some or saves some to discriminate*\. Supralapsarianism places the decree of discrimination before creation, whereas infralapsarianism aligns God's decrees with humanity's sinfulness, which Warfield argues is more consistent with reality\.

__Autosoterism\.__

__Doctrines of Salvation\.__ There are essentially two doctrines of salvation: one posits that salvation comes from God, which is central to Christianity, and the other suggests that salvation is from ourselves, associated with heathenism\. __Pelagianism vs\. Augustinianism\. __Autosoterism is epitomized by Pelagius, who taught that grace is merely an inward help from God, with human free will being a crucial, inalienable endowment, turning religion into one of works\. Augustine vehemently opposed Pelagianism and ultimately triumphed over it\. __Church Evolution and Synergism\. __The Church later shifted towards semi\-Pelagianism and eventually semi\-semi\-Pelagianism during the Middle Ages\. While grace was acknowledged as necessary, its irresistibility was denied, leading to legalism and synergism where God's grace needed the cooperation of human will\. __Reformation and Counteractions\. __This was countered by figures like Wycliffe, Huss, and notably Luther, who achieved a final victory by reinstating Augustinianism and firmly opposing Erasmus' Pelagianism\. The Reformers championed the complete inability of man and the absolute need for divine grace\. __Melanchthon's Divergence\. __Melanchthon deviated from this view by blending Augustine's teachings with Aristotelian doctrine, leading to synergism where God's grace requires a willing human response\. __Synergistic vs\. Monergistic Views\. __Numerous examples contrast synergistic and monergistic perspectives on salvation\. Prominent figures like Wilhelm Schmidt, W\. E\. Henley, and Dr\. David W\. Forrest illustrate views focusing on man saving himself through self\-improvement and self\-actualization\. __Philosophical Influences on Theology\. __Influencers like Harnack, Bousset, and Kant further propagate the idea that God's primary role is to forgive sins, emphasizing human effort and achievements in attaining salvation\.

__Sacerdotalism\.__

__Universal Church Doctrine\. __The universal church consistently asserts that salvation is from God and God alone\. __Mediate Action of God\. __A significant portion of the church believes that God acts mediately or indirectly upon the soul through human hands\. __Roman Catholic System\. __The Roman Catholic system views the church as an extension of Jesus Christ in earthly form\. Salvation is seen as belonging to the church, which communicates it to mankind\. God delegates the actual work through the church and its sacramental system, acting as secondary causes to apply grace\. This conception implies a conditional will whereby God desires all to be saved through sacramental grace but only actualizes this for those whom He foresees will receive these sacraments\. The system effectively leaves salvation to follow the ordinary course of nature, making it akin to a deistic outlook\. __Sacerdotalism in the Church of England\. __In the Church of England, the church is viewed as the extension of the Incarnation, acting as Jesus' mystical body and organ in the world, serving as both teacher and repository of grace\. __The Role of Sacraments\. __Sacraments are believed not just to symbolize grace but to actually confer it, operating *ex opere operato*\. In Confessional Lutheranism and high church traditions, the "Word" and sacraments are seen as means of grace, though their effectiveness is tied to faith\. Warfield critiques this as inconsistent and not fully developed sacerdotalism\. __Three Aspects of Sacerdotalism\. __1\) The soul does not have direct contact or immediate dependence on God the Holy Spirit, as the church assumes this role\. 2\) It neglects the personal aspect of the Holy Spirit, treating it as a natural force\. 3\) It implies that the Holy Spirit’s gracious operations are subject to human control\.

__Universalism\.__

__Characteristic of Evangelicalism\. __A defining feature of evangelicalism is the sense of intimate, personal communion with God the Savior, based on immediate love and trust\. This perspective is inherently individualistic\. __Universalistic Tendencies\. __Universalistic inclinations are observed in Arminianism and Evangelical Lutheranism, which propose that God desires the salvation of all people equally, meaning that everyone must be saved without exception\. However, since not all are saved, there are different approaches to this issue: some suggest human dependence, which deviates from evangelicalism, while others note that God's operations may not be truly universalistic\. __Holopraesentinarians\. __This group believes that universal predestination arises from the universal promise\. __Reactions to Calvinism\. __Evangelical universalists are often troubled by Calvinistic doctrines such as everlasting punishment and the concepts of election and irresistible grace\. __Dr\. Patterson's Perspective\. __Dr\. Patterson argues that God owes salvation to all humans and views sin more as a misfortune than a deserved condition, indicating a lower view of sin\. He suggests that God saves as many as His righteousness permits, maintaining His righteousness against human sin\. __Challenges for Evangelical Universalism\. __Evangelical universalism struggles with the question of why all are not saved if not wanting to make God responsible\. This leads to making salvation depend on human actions, challenging doctrines of unconditional election and predestination\. __Baptism and Divine Monergism\. __While some hold to divine monergism, they also see Baptism as a causal factor\. In Lutheranism, there’s acknowledgment of man’s role in responding to grace, with regeneration contingent on human response\. __Wesleyanism\. __Wesleyanism emphasizes two main points: the universal opportunity for salvation and opposition to the exclusive choice of individuals for eternal life\. __Modern Lutheranism\. __Modern Lutheranism links the universality of the call \(via the Word\) with universal salvation, suggesting that if it doesn't happen in the present life, it might in the next\. This reflects a true universalism of grace\. Warfield criticizes this as transforming the concept of no salvation without knowledge of Christ into no damnation without such knowledge, implying that all will face the gospel offer under favorable conditions\. Nevertheless, it still encounters the problem of God's grace not saving everyone, and Lutheranism acknowledges that humans can resist grace, which Warfield points out as leaning towards a naturalistic view of human capability\.

__Calvinism\.__

__Particularism and Grace\. __Calvinism is characterized by particularism and the immediacy of saving grace\. It acknowledges different views concerning the decree of election in divine decrees\. __Varieties of Calvinism\. __Calvinists differ on the timing of the decree of election\. *1\) Supralapsarians* believe the decree of election comes before the fall in God's order of thought, making the decision to elect or reprobate foundational to all decrees regarding creation\. *2\) Infralapsarians* see the decree of election as part of God's soteriological decisions, occurring after the decree of the fall\. *3\) Post\-redemptionists* position the decree of election after individual redemption, suggesting universal intent in salvation that becomes particularistic in application, potentially undermining the concept of a fixed decree of election unless allowing for free will\.

__Diverse Views on Free Will and Grace\. __Some Calvinists integrate free will, involving active responses to the Holy Spirit's application\. Congruism or Pajonism suggests grace is infallibly tailored to whom it is congruously offered \(e\.g\., offered to those who, out of free will, respond\)\. Critics argue this grants humans a role akin to saving themselves\. __Varieties of Calvinism Supporting Particularism\. __1\) Supralapsarianism\. 2\) Infralapsarianism\. 3\) Amyraldianism or Hypothetical Universalism \(viewed as inconsistent because it suggests Christ's death only removes obstacles but does not ensure salvation\)\. 4\. Pajonism\. *Post\-Redemptionism* is criticized as logically inconsistent with Calvinism since it implies universal salvation intent but particular application by the Holy Spirit\. __Universalism vs\. Particularism\. __Calvinism balances universal aspects of the Gospel with particular efficacy in individual salvation\. While the Gospel is universally proclaimed, its saving efficacy remains particularistic through a process involving redemption, regeneration, justification, adoption, and sanctification\. __Cosmic Redemption\. __Cosmic redemption mirrors individual salvation, both being ongoing, incomplete processes until Christ's return\. Calvinism asserts that the biblical doctrine of world salvation encompasses the restoration of all things in Christ, without endorsing universalism in the common sense\. Calvinism maintains the true universal scope of God's redemptive plan alongside the particularism of grace\.
