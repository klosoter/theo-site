__Prolegomena, Revelation, Nature, and Scripture – Herman Bavinck__

__12\. Revelation and Nature __

*Two Misunderstandings of the Doctrine of Revelation\.* Bavinck addresses two major misunderstandings: supranaturalism and naturalism\. Supranaturalism, prevalent in Rome and among the Church Fathers, contrasts miracles with the natural order, which Bavinck challenges as unscriptural\. He defines nature as self\-developing without external intervention, and the supernatural as divine action, criticizing the reduction of the supernatural to merely ethical phenomena\. Rome splits humanity into a natural state \(*puris naturalibus*\) and a state with additional gifts \(*dona superaddita*\) for comprehending God, promoting a higher destiny and virtues\. Bavinck disputes any absolute divide between nature and revelation, asserting there was supernatural revelation even before the fall \(*status integritatis*\)\. The Reformation presents a *qualitative* distinction between nature and grace; Christ's revelation counters sin, not nature itself\. Creation, in Bavinck's view, is revelatory from the beginning, aligning with Romans 1, where all people are inherently supernaturalists\. Christ's incarnation and resurrection affirm the sanctity of human nature, suggesting Christianity opposes sin rather than the natural world\. 

*Naturalism*, championed by figures like Spinoza, equates revelation with natural laws\. Rationalists seek to subordinate or reject special revelation, exemplified by thinkers like Kant and Fichte\. Arguments against special revelation include the immutability of God and the unbreakable laws of nature, rendering miracles and revelation unrecognizable and unverifiable through naturalistic or psychological explanations\. Bavinck finds these unsatisfactory, arguing that Scriptural revelation is mysterious and immune to naturalistic interpretations\. Miracles are integral to the system of revelation, with Christ’s person being inexplicable through naturalism alone\. 

*Monism,* including pantheism and materialism, are challenged by psychic phenomena and the holistic view of being and intellect\. Scripture endorses theism/supernaturalism, asserting harmony, not equivalence, between God and the world\. Mechanical and physical laws differ from logical, ethical, and aesthetic ones, existing harmoniously in God, who is ever\-present in creation\. Miracles are seen as divine interventions rather than breaches in natural laws\. 

*Nature and Revelation's Order\.* Contrary to deistic determinism, Bavinck contends that nature accommodates God's interventions like miracles\. He critiques the God\-of\-the\-Gaps approach in apologetics, where gaps in scientific knowledge are attributed to divine action, only to be filled later\. Both natural order and revelation follow discernible laws \(*leges naturae*\), akin to *decreta Dei* \(divine decrees\)\. Scripture presents history and revelation as a harmonious interplay of God's deeds and words, guiding humanity from a state of sin \(*status peccati*\) to a state of grace \(*status gratiae*\)\.

__13\. Revelation and Holy Scripture__

*Language, Writing, and Religions\. *Bavinck explores the role of holy scriptures in all religions, emphasizing the cohesive relationship between religion, revelation, word, and scripture\. Although he acknowledges that written words cannot fully express thoughts and that scriptures cannot entirely capture spoken words, scripture serves to eternalize the word, linking people across time and space\. Historical revelation leads to scripture, contrasting with deist views \(e\.g\., Hobbes, Locke\) that favor present natural religion over distant, unverifiable revelation\. Bavinck insists that revelation cannot be detached from history; scripture conveys the history and thoughts of God, preserving historical revelation for future generations\.

*Language*\. Scripture functions as a servant to revelation, illustrating God's condescension through the medium of language\. Christ acts as the means of revelation rather than the goal, emphasizing God's intention to dwell in His creatures\. Bavinck distinguishes revelation from scripture: not all revelation is captured in scripture, which often records events second\-hand or long after they occurred\. Nonetheless, scripture is the sole *principium* \(principle\) for accessing revelation, making it imperative and *theopneustos* \(God\-breathed\)\.

*The Goal of Revelation*\. The ultimate aim of revelation is achieved in the *parousia* of Christ, who is the content and central point \(*middelpunt*\) of all revelation\. Christ’s historical presence provides an organic center\. While Scripture is completed and fully revealed in Christ, it remains efficacious, guiding toward the new humanity living with God\. The Holy Spirit continues to reveal truths but does not add new objective facts of revelation, instead applying existing divine wisdom and knowledge\. Understanding Scripture necessitates regeneration, with the Church playing a role in explaining, affirming, and sealing it – and vice versa, Scripture doing the same toward the Church\. 

Scripture is not an isolated entity; it is historically rooted and a living, vibrant document that connects believers to both the past and the risen Lord\. Bavinck emphasizes the living voice of God \(*viva vox Dei*\) and the concept of scripture as God's epistle \(*epistola Dei omnipotentis*\) to creation\. *Theopneustos* refers not only to the inspiration of scripture’s authors but also to its readers, positing that God breathes life through scripture, making it perpetually relevant and dynamic\.
