__Did God Really Say? – Affirming the Truthfulness and Trustworthiness of Scripture \- David B\. Garner et al\.__

__Preface\. __The book challenges the postmodern skepticism that questions the ability to comprehend ancient Scriptures, given their human limitations, historical contexts, and cultural biases\. It contrasts this view with the doctrines of *sola Scriptura* and the Westminster Confession of Faith, emphasizing biblical authority, necessity, inspiration, infallibility, and perspicuity\. This joint initiative by Covenant Seminary, Reformed Theological Seminary, and Westminster Theological Seminary defends the truthfulness and trustworthiness of Scripture\. 

__Introduction\.__

The introduction emphasizes the necessity for the church to commit to the living Word\. While contemporary scholars often dismiss historic orthodoxy as outdated, there is a need for a firm stance against liberalism to prevent epistemic relativism\. Evangelicals must go beyond mere reaction by positively restating and promoting the truth\. The various chapters by different theologians reinforce the foundational principles of the Christian faith and defend the doctrines of biblical inerrancy, the canon of the New Testament, the divine gift of language, and the clarity of Scripture\.

__Chapter 1: Because It Is the Word of God – K\. Scott Oliphint\.__

__The Principles \(Principia\) of Theology__*\.* Theology relies on foundational principles \(*principia*\) that are necessarily true and known *per se*\. These include the principle of being \(existence\) and the principle of knowing \(knowledge\)\. In Reformed orthodoxy, these principles are essential\.__ God and His Word__\. The *principium essendi* \(being\) and the *principium cognoscendi* \(knowing\) explain who God is and how He can be known as Franciscus Junius noted – God’s revelation is necessary for any knowledge\. Scripture \(*norma normans*\) holds original authority, while confessions like the WCF \(*norma normata*\) have derived authority\. Despite their fallibility, confessions articulate biblical truth\. __The Authority of Scripture__\. The WCF sections on necessity, canon, and Apocrypha assert Scripture’s authority over the claims of the Roman Catholic Church\. Section 1\.4 emphasizes Scripture’s self\-referential authority, grounded solely in being the Word of God\. __The Self\-Attestation of Scripture\.__ Scripture is authoritative not because it says so but because God, who is truth, is its author, making self\-attestation objective\. __The Author of Scripture__\. God is the primary author, with human writers as instruments\. Thus, Scripture is fundamentally divine and truly human, and its authority is intrinsic\. __Conclusion__\. Scripture must be upheld as the sole ground for redemptive knowledge of God\. Its truthfulness is essential for the doctrine of God, as without revelation, no knowledge, including knowledge of God in Christ, is possible\.

__Chapter 2: The Church, a Pillar of Truth: B\. B\. Warfield’s Church Doctrine of Inspiration – Michael D\. Williams\.__

__Warfield’s Importance__\. Warfield is essential for understanding the doctrine of inerrancy, although often misunderstood as rigid or obscurantist\. His approach emphasized the truthfulness of the Spirit\-inspired Word and the trust invested by a Spirit\-led community\.

__The Claims of Truth\.__ Warfield asserted that the Bible is the Word of God, not just containing it\. His view, along with Hodge’s, included three affirmations: 1\) the divine origin of the text, its 2\) infallibility, and 3\) its divine authority\. These were under attack in his time, and Warfield defended them against subjectivism, emphasizing the Bible as the objective Word of God and the necessity of the Holy Spirit for commitment to biblical authority\.

__The Church: A Pillar of Truth__\. Warfield viewed the doctrine of Scripture through the lens of faith and historical continuity, emphasizing the work of the Spirit in covenantal communities\. He argued that the church doctrine of inspiration is rooted in the Bible itself and that the belief in the Bible as God’s Word is a Spirit\-led response, not mere subjectivist preference\. \(The Bible witnesses to its own __oracular nature__\)

__A Trustworthy Word\.__ Warfield preferred the term “trustworthy” over “inerrant,” implying *absolute reliability in truth claims*\. This understanding of inerrancy emphasized the Scriptures’ covenantal role and divine reliability\.

__The Presumption of Truth__\. Warfield engaged higher criticism by emphasizing trust over doubt, presenting a dichotomy: either the Bible is divinely inspired, or it is not and thus not God’s Word\. He presupposed Scripture’s truthfulness, advocating for rigorous testing of its claims while maintaining a confessional stance and employing and addressing evidential challenges\. __Investment in Truth__\. Warfield affirmed that Scripture is a personal and intentional communication assuming an audience and that the Spirit uses the church’s ministry of the Word to bring sinners to faith\. However, the church does not determine Scripture; instead, Scripture informs the church\. Our trust in God’s Word encompasses our entire lives, affirming the Bible as God’s Word to His people\.

__Chapter 3: Deconstructing Canon: Recent Challenges to the Origins and Authority of the New Testament Writings – Michael J\. Kruger\.__

__Challenges in Scholarship__\. Kurt Aland noted that the question of the New Testament \(NT\) canon profoundly impacts both the academy and the church, often sensationalized in popular literature\. Kruger discusses *five theses of the critical approach to the NT canon*\.

__Thesis 1: There Was Not a New Testament “Canon” Until the Fourth Century\.__ Critics argue that before the 4th century, the NT was a loose collection of texts\. This claim presupposes a narrow definition of “canon” as a fixed list of books, implying confusion before the church’s formal declaration\. However, Kruger notes that by the mid\-2nd century, a “core” canon was already recognized, including the four Gospels, Paul’s letters, and other texts, which were considered authoritative\.

__Thesis 2: The Idea of a Written New Testament Was Not Innate to Early Christianity\.__ Critics claim that the idea of the NT was a later imposition on texts with different original purposes\. Kruger counters this by pointing to the inseparable link between revelation and redemption in early Christianity\. Like ancient covenants, these writings were an organic outgrowth of the covenantal structure within which early Christians operated, deeply rooted in the Old Testament tradition\.

__Thesis 3: The Authors of the New Testament Did Not Think They Were Writing Scripture\.__ There’s an argument that NT authors were unaware of the scriptural authority of their writings\. Kruger disputes this by highlighting the apostolic awareness of their divine mission and the early designation of some NT writings as Scripture, including self\-referential quotes within the NT\.

__Thesis 4: Early Christianity Was Wildly Diverse\.__ Critics argue that the canon reflects the theological preferences of the “winners” in a diverse early Christianity\. Kruger acknowledges some diversity but argues it’s exaggerated\. The overwhelming manuscript evidence supports the existence and authority of the canon over non\-canonical books, undermining the idea that there was no early consensus\.

__Thesis 5: The Authority of the Canon Is Dependent upon the Authority of the Church\.__ Some claim the church formed the NT canon and thus holds primary authority\. Kruger emphasizes the self\-authenticating nature of Scripture, arguing that the Holy Spirit’s revelatory activity in these writings naturally elicited a corporate recognition by the early church\.

In summary, Kruger addresses each critical thesis, defending the early recognition and intrinsic authority of the NT canon as rooted in the divine revelation and redemptive history of Christianity\.

__Chapter 4: Inerrancy’s Complexities: Grounds for Grace in the Debate \- Robert W\. Yarbrough__

__The Heritage of the Doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy: The Chicago Statement\. __The 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy presents a God\-centered, Christocentric, and soteriologically oriented view of Scripture\. The statement affirms\. 

1. God, who is Truth, inspired Scripture to reveal Himself through Jesus Christ\.
2. Scripture, as God’s infallible Word, commands comprehensive belief and obedience in faith and ethics\.
3. The Holy Spirit authenticates and elucidates Scripture to believers\. 
4. Scripture is without error in all its teachings, including creation, history, and literary origins\.
5. Limiting or disregarding inerrancy impairs Scripture’s authority and adversely affects individuals and the Church\. This doctrine is vital, though not as central as the Resurrection or Christology\.

__The History of the Doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy__\. Inerrancy has been a central teaching within Western Protestantism, tracing its roots back to Augustine through the Reformers and modern times\. It wasn’t invented by Old Princeton scholars like Warfield and Hodge but has deep historical roots\.

__Our Appropriation of the Doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy__\. Confessionally appropriated, the complexities of inerrancy include:

1. Innovationist Edge: The cyclical nature of innovation in reiterating and improving old critical arguments\. 
2. Zealous Overextension: Overplaying inerrancy advocacy without substance can lead to foolishness\. 
3. Lack of Love and Fruitless Polemics: Failing to love opponents and engage in constructive debates\. 
4. Global Perspectives: Inerrancy debates are less of a priority in global contexts\. Western theologians often prioritize inerrancy over broader graces\.
5. Unbelieving Leaders: Some church and academic leaders do not truly know Jesus, undermining their stance\.
6. Inerrantist Hypocrisy: Advocates sometimes fail to live out their convictions authentically\.
7. Coercive Advocacy: Using force instead of genuine personal conviction to promote inerrancy\.

__Conclusion\. __The legacy of Harry Emerson Fosdick \(“Shall the Fundamentalists Win?”\), who critiqued fundamentalists and biblical inerrancy, is addressed within the contemporary context\. Despite challenges, a high view of Scripture founded on inerrancy remains promising\. Examples of thriving ministries and scholarly defenses reinforce faith in God’s inerrant Word\. Nevertheless, modern pressures and the wavering commitment of some evangelicals underscore the need for steadfast adherence to a doctrinally rich Christian faith\.

__Chapter 5: God and Language \- Vern S\. Poythress__\.

__Language and the Trinity__\. God eternally spoke even before human beings existed, with the eternal Word as the archetype for all divine speech, harmonizing with Trinitarian communication\. God is the originator of human language\. __Knowledge Through Language__\. Language isn’t accidental but divinely purposed\. The idea that the \(concept of God\) is beyond linguistic capabilities stems from human rebellion\. God, as the master of language, can communicate perfectly and has enabled us, through the Spirit, to know Him, aligning with the Chicago Statement's affirmation that human language is adequate for divine revelation\. __Metaphor and Analogy__\. Non\-Christian views often dismiss the ability of language to describe God\. However, language, a gift from God, inherently includes metaphor and analogy, allowing us to speak truth about God, like calling Him "Father\." The analogy of our image\-bearing \(Genesis\) and Christ being the image of God \(Colossians 1:15\) exemplify this\. __History and Interpretation__\. Christian belief holds that language can faithfully report historical events, reflecting God’s purpose and meaning\. While human accounts are partial and selective, multiple perspectives \(e\.g\., the Gospels\) don't *create* meaning but *express* God’s original intent\. __Stability of Meaning__\. Postmodern irrationalism leads to relativism, but a Christian view respects even these meanings as they are put forward by images of God\. Above all, we should respect God's own speech in Scripture, which is absolute and the reason to reject relativistic meanings\. God's sovereignty over contexts allows us to understand His word truly, though not comprehensively\. __The One and the Many__\. God established both universals and particulars and provides the ultimate example of one and many through His Trinitarian nature\. __Conclusion__\. Human language, divinely originated, is capable of adequately describing God, historical events, and stable meanings, solving the problem of one and many\. God speaks, and thus, meaningful "God\-talk" is possible\.

__Chapter 6: N\. T\. Wright and the Authority of Scripture \- John M\. Frame__

__N\.T\. Wright's Position__\. He is viewed as conservative, except regarding the "New Perspective on Paul" and justification\. He treats Scripture as substantially historical and is open to the supernatural\. __A Doctrine of Scripture?__ Wright doesn’t systematically emphasize the doctrine of Scripture, focusing more on its content\. However, he does occasionally address it in his works\. __The Authority of Scripture Is the Authority of God Expressed through Scripture__\. Wright posits that the Scripture has authority if "authority of Scripture" is shorthand for "the authority of the triune God, exercised through Scripture\." This suggests a distinction between God’s authority and Scripture as an instrument, somewhat analogous to Barth's view \(i\.e\., Scripture becoming the Word of God\) but not identical\. __Scripture Is Narrative__\. Frame disagrees with Wright's characterization of Scripture as primarily narrative, arguing that it includes various literary forms like law, poetry, and apocalyptic literature\. He contends that "covenant" better captures the unique, *sui generis* nature of Scripture as God’s Word\. __The Authority of Scripture Is the Application of Its Story__\. Wright's narrative theology is flexible enough to incorporate most, if not all, of our traditional uses of the Bible as narrative can inform, motivate, and give insight\. __Scripture Is Power, Not Only Word__\. Wright views Scripture not just as text but as a vehicle of God's transformative power, including propositional revelation\. While evangelicals see much of Scripture as informational, Wright highlights its additional roles, emphasizing its power to enact God’s presence and work\. Scripture serves as a sacred meeting place of heaven and earth, distinct yet unified in God's historical presence\. __Scholarship Establishes Whether the Bible Is Historical__\. Wright asserts the historicity of Scripture, relying on evidence from biblical scholarship, arguing that contemporary resources better address historical questions compared to old modernist approaches\. Frame critiques this reliance, warning that scholarship constantly evolves and Wright’s methods may not be durable\. Frame stresses that Scripture must hold the highest authority, shaping presuppositions about God, miracles, and redemptive history\. Wright’s approach, while affirming these beliefs, lacks the foundation of Scriptural authority as the ground for presuppositions\.

__Chapter 7: Did God Really Say? \- David B\. Garner\.__

__Stanley Fish and Cultural Relativism__\. Stanley Fish argues that the reader constructs the text’s meaning within *communal *cultural boundaries, balancing objective and subjective elements\. Garner contends that this still leads to cultural relativism\. __Clarity and Interpretation\. __*The Lords of Interpretation\(s\)*\. Interpretative authority has shifted from Scripture to readers and their methods, leading to "hyperhermeneutical" despair, as noted by Gaffin\. *Certainty and Uncertainty*: While scholarly methods claim certainty, ordinary believers are often seen as less capable interpreters\. J\. I\. Packer critiques this as a form of new papalism, where elites dictate biblical understanding, a view echoed by Stanley Hauerwas's skepticism of individual Bible reading\. *Implications of an Unclear Word*\. Denying Scripture’s clarity leads to seminary students graduating in unbelief and preaching uncertainty\. Readers often conflate personal application with meaning, undermining biblical authority and certainty\. *Taking Aim at Perspicuity*\. Christian Smith argues that varied interpretations imply the Bible isn’t clear\. Frame counters that interpretive disagreements often arise from not giving Scripture final authority\. Luther believed that while some parts of Scripture are clearer than others, the overall message is transparent, and interpretative chaos comes from spiritual insufficiency\. *Perspicuity and Community: James Callahan*\. Callahan posits that Scripture’s clarity is contingent on the reader's understanding within the community of faith, blending objective and subjective elements \(cf\. Stanley Fish\)\. __Clarity and Scripture\. __*Perspicuity and Hermeneutics*\. Scripture’s clarity is an inherent attribute \(WCF 1\.7\)\. WCF 1\.9 confirms Scripture’s final interpretive authority\. *Who Says?* God, the first speaker in history, created language, and intra\-Trinitarian communication exemplifies perfectly understandable and understood divine speech\. Human communication is modeled after this divine archetype\. *Speech and the Imago Dei*\. Human language, reflecting God's image, remains coherent despite the Fall\. Miscommunication is flawed communication, and God's communicative intent will not be thwarted\. Divine authorship ensures Scripture’s clarity and authority\. *Perspicuity and Illumination*\. Scripture remains clear to fallen humanity through the Holy Spirit’s transformative work, which changes us, not Scripture\. *Perspicuity and Divine Will*\. Romans 1 indicates that God's unspoken words are communicated clearly and irresistibly in creation\. General and special revelation are organically connected, each sufficiently clear for God’s intentions with it\. *Perspicuity and Redemptive History*\. Geerhardus Vos explains that God’s revelation is progressively clear throughout history\. Each stage of revelation, though incomplete, was sufficiently clear for its time, culminating in the clarity of Christ's work\. Biblical revelation is embedded, canonical, and self\-interpreting, providing an unambiguous witness to God's redemptive purposes\. *Conclusion*\. Through history, God's redemptive work in Christ was clearly revealed in Scripture\. This perspicuity ensures that divine communication is both understandable and authoritative\.
