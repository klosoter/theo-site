__Redemptive History and the New Testament Scriptures – Herman N\. Ridderbos__

__1\. Introduction\.__ 

__The Problem of Biblical Authority\. __Biblical authority is questioned in terms of content and biblical criticism\. Herman Ridderbos argues that certainty on this matter cannot arise from uncertain sources, such as biblical criticism, to declare Scripture authoritative\. __Confession of Authority\. __While recognizing the authority of Scripture involves a confession of faith, it is still subject to scientific scrutiny\. Traditionally, the self\-attestation of Scripture has been crucial here\. __Scripture as Revelation in History\. __Ridderbos views Scripture as revelation occurring within historical events and seeks to clarify its relationship to redemptive history, specifically focusing on the New Testament\. __Investigative Steps\. __Ridderbos outlines two steps: investigating the NT canon and examining its authority in light of the redemptive history associated with Jesus Christ's coming and work\.

__Chapter 1: The Canon of the New Testament__

__A\. Questions of Principle\. __

__2\. Recent Reflections\.__ Protestant literature on the NT canon has become unclear due to post\-Enlightenment criticism\. Without an infallible church authority, Protestants question why a church\-established canon should be accepted, reducing it to ecclesiastical discipline\. Consequently, some have rejected the concept of a canon altogether\. Others have separated faith\-based and historical approaches, viewing the canon as a historical fact to be studied descriptively without defending its authority on faith grounds\. 

__3\. Appeals to Luther's Standpoint\. __Luther argued that Scripture is the primary source of special revelation, not the church, although he questioned certain books based on their content rather than historical\-critical concerns\. His criterion was what "urges Christ," leading to the idea of a canon within the canon\. This viewpoint influenced Lutheran confessions, which do not list canonical writings explicitly and support notions like an open canon, the canon\-in\-canon concept, and encountering the Word of God as a contemporary event\. Theologian Käsemann viewed the NT's contradictions as a basis for confessional diversity, maintaining that the canon continually becomes the gospel \(actualistic sense\)\. 

__4\. The Reformed View\. __The Reformed tradition accepted the established canon without introducing new criteria or the concept of a canon within the canon\. The significance lies in the objective authority of the Word of God rather than subjective acceptance\. The key questions revolve around the fixed number of 27 NT books and the basis for their inclusion, which critics argue the Reformed explanations \(infallible witness of the Holy Spirit and self\-attestation\) fail to address satisfactorily\. Calvin and other Reformed theologians, like Bavinck and Barth, emphasized the intrinsic authority of the Bible, reliant on the testimony of the Holy Spirit and self\-attestation\. Calvin supplemented this with rational arguments for canonicity, suggesting a broader context is required for discussions about the canon\. Ridderbos aligns with this perspective, asserting that the history of redemption provides answers to questions of canonicity and inspiration, similar to Kuyper’s idea that the idea of the canon necessitates looking within Scripture to its redemptive\-historical context\.

__B\. Canon and Redemptive History\.__

__5\. The Apostolate\. __Christ, bearing divine authority, reveals himself as the canon\. He appointed apostles, granting them a unique, unrepeatable role in redemptive history \(Acts 10:41\)\. The apostleship is formally structured upon the Jewish legal concept of the *shaliach* \(Matt\. 10:40; John 13:20\), authorized representatives empowered to speak on behalf of another\. Through the Holy Spirit \(Acts 1:2\), apostles were directed to continue Christ’s mission, establishing the foundation of the church with their proclamation \(Hebrews 2:2\)\.

__6\. Tradition\. __The apostolic tradition began orally and was later documented\. Paul urged adherence to the teachings delivered by word or letter \(2 Thess\. 2:15\), this is emphasized by the emphasis on transmission accuracy \(1 Cor\. 15:1\-4; Luke 1\)\. The NT tradition is not a fluid continuation but an authoritative proclamation entrusted to apostles as Christ’s witnesses, linking tradition directly to Christ’s revelation \(Gal\. 1:12\) and the “I have received from the Lord\.”

__7\. Tradition as Scripture\. __The NT equates written tradition with oral tradition in authority \(2 Thess\. 2:2, 15\), signifying that NT scriptures held sacred status from inception\. Apostolic writings like Luke \(1:1\-4\) and Paul’s letters intended for church\-wide reading authored holy texts with inherent authority \(John 20:31; Revelation: “write to the church …”\)\. These writings, akin to OT scriptures, serve as foundational and authoritative standards for the church\.

__8\. The Redemptive\-Historical Concept of Canon\. __*Positive Perspectives\. *\(1\) The church recognized but did not institute the objective authority of the canon, which originated with Christ; \(2\) The canon closed with the apostolic witness, embodying unique and exclusive authority in redemptive history; and \(3\), The permanence of the canon is ensured through its written form\. *Negative Perspectives\. *\(1\) Besides apostolic authority and tradition \(and the OT\), the NT acknowledges no other canonical principle; \(2\) The notion of a canon within a canon is fundamentally incompatible with redemptive history; establishing the canon is not the domain of believers or the church; and \(3\), The actualistic concept suggested by theologians like Käsemann and Barth is problematic\.

__C\. The Recognition of the Canon__

__9\. The A Priori of Faith\. __The question of why only these 27 books form the NT canon centers on the belief that they resulted from Christ's apostolic authority and the Holy Spirit’s inspiration\. Despite uncertainties about the number and identity of apostles \(e\.g\., Paul, James, Judas\), what is apostolic encompasses both the formal apostolic writings and content like the Gospels, affirming the once\-for\-all nature of the apostolate\. The existence of some apocryphal writings shows that historical judgments are not definitive\. Some Protestants argue for a special providence or inspiration guiding the church's canonical decisions – *a posteriori *divine sanction, which Ridderbos rejects\. He acknowledges a historical development process involving debate and consensus but insists the canon's recognition ultimately rests on the internal witness of the Holy Spirit\. This witness should not be seen in isolation from the canon's historical context, as the true basis for recognizing the canon lies in its redemptive\-historical foundation in Christ, preceding faith, church, and canonical history\.

__10\. The Formation of the Canon\. __Initially, the church did not fully recognize the exclusive and formal authority of the apostolic writings but did so relatively quickly, focusing on apostolic tradition fixed in writing influenced by the OT\. The NT canon’s authority stemmed inherently from Christ rather than being a reaction to Marcion’s reductions or Montanist excesses\. The church did not actively select these books but *received* them as foundational to its existence, with their inherent authority recognized rather than conferred by the church\.

__11\. The Closing of the Canon\. __The canon had to be limited, a process characterized by historical development and varied practices\. While debates on certain books were secondary, the universally recognized writings \(*homologoumena*\) contrasted with the disputed ones \(*antilegoumena*\)\. Two decisive factors in canon acceptance were the growth of ecumenical ties within the worldwide church and, most importantly, the content of the writings\.

__Chapter II: The Authority of the New Testament__

__12\. The Redemptive\-Historical Character of the New Testament's Authority\. __The historical\-critical method fails to grasp the unique nature of the NT’s content and its mode of transmission, which Ridderbos attributes to redemptive\-historical organic inspiration\. This viewpoint integrates revelation's history into the analysis of different categories of message in the NT, challenging spiritualistic notions detached from historical context\.

__13\. Kerygma \(Proclamation\)\. __Kerygma, synonymous with proclaiming the Gospel, heralds the imminent salvation by God\. While it primarily applies to the NT's proclamation of salvation, other writings like epistles and Revelations provide explication, application, and recollection of this kerygma\. Ridderbos disputes the separation \(by critics like Kähler\) between the "biblical Christ" \(kerygma\) and the "historical Jesus," asserting historicity is crucial for the kerygma, which emphasizes once\-and\-for\-all redemptive events\. The main purpose of the NT is to proclaim this kerygma, revealing it through redemptive history under the Holy Spirit's guidance\.

__14\. Marturia \(Witness\)\. __Marturia, used prominently in Luke and John’s writings, refers to visibly and audibly bearing witness to Christ’s works and words, which is inherently tied to the actual events\. Apostles, as witnesses, were commissioned by Christ to testify about his historical life and redemptive acts, forming a direct link between these events and the nascent church through the Holy Spirit\. Ridderbos emphasizes that the kerygma functions as authorized historical witness while embracing human elements like eyewitness accounts and varying traditions\. Despite discrepancies, the Gospels’ shared language and narrative provide a consistent witness to Christ – they are what they are: historical description and proclamation\. Witness and kerygma make a claim to faith, without which there is no participation in the salvation it proclaims\.

__15\. Didache \(Teaching\)\. __Didache, primarily found in the epistles, encompasses teaching and preaching\. It explains, instructs, and expounds upon the kerygma, highlighting ethics, redemptive history, the order of salvation, and the broader significance of Christ’s work\. Drawing from the Great Commission, teaching in the NT involves conveying the Gospel in didactic forms, distinguished by their instructive nature rather than content differences from kerygma\. Ridderbos acknowledges challenges such as cultural and linguistic barriers and the need for hermeneutics to bridge the gap while respecting the intrinsic authority of Scripture\.

__Summary Chapter II: __“The preceding may suffice to illuminate the many different forms in which the one kerygma comes to expression and in which, then, the New Testament Scriptures appear\. For that reason, then, the nature of the authority of those Scriptures is not to be expressed in a single word\. Rather, the New Testament bears that authority as the one gospel whose authority derives from one central point\-the activity of God that encompasses the world and history in the coming and the work of His Son, Jesus Christ” \(76\)\.
