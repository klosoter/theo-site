__Attestation of Scripture – John Murray \(The Infallible Word, 1\-54\) – John Murray__

__I\. The Objective Witness__

Murray begins by emphasizing that general confessions acknowledging the Bible as the Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit, do not inherently resolve debates about its origin, authority, and character\. Diversity in opinions arises mainly due to the human factor involved in the Bible's authorship\.

__Human Factor__\. This involves questioning whether human involvement leads to fallibility and error, given that mankind is fallen while Christ is perfect\. Since imperfect yet infallible men wrote the Bible, some conclude that human instrumentality results in an errant and fallible Word of God\. Murray argues that while human authorship might suggest error, it does not preclude the possibility of an infallible Scripture\. If only "spiritual truth" is considered infallible due to divine influence, it is inconsistent to exclude other scriptural aspects from such influence\. The only logical corollary from human fallibility would be the total fallibility of the Scriptures, which Murray refutes\.

__Proving Biblical Infallibility\. __Acknowledging doctrinal difficulties and apparent contradictions, Murray maintains that unanswered questions should not destabilize faith in the Triune God and the incarnated Christ\. The foundation of faith in the Bible as the Word of God lies in the testimony and evidence provided within Scripture itself, which serves as the basis for all doctrines of faith\. Murray engages with the question, "What is the witness of Scripture regarding its own character?" He argues for an inductive approach, deriving the doctrine of Scripture from its self\-attestation and facing criticisms directly\.

__Evidence\. __

__*Negative Evidence*__\. Scripture does not self\-criticize adversely\. Despite chronicling mostly sinful history, it condemns sin, showing candor without indicating fallibility\. The Bible's recognition of temporary and provisional elements, like the Mosaic law, underscores its consistency over contradiction\. 

__*Positive Evidence*__\. The Old Testament's frequent "Thus saith the Lord" affirms its divine origin, content, and authority\. Any errors would negate this divine claim, which Murray argues must be avoided as there are no errors in divine utterances\. The OT’s authority and canonicity are affirmed in the New Testament, supported by Jesus' teachings and declarations of indissoluble law, verbal inspiration, and Scripture's infallibility\. Passages like 2 Timothy 3:16 assert Scripture's divine inspiration without qualifications, endorsing high doctrine of plenary inspiration\. Additionally, 2 Peter 1:20\-21 denies human initiative and asserts human instrumentality, recognizing human authorship without compromising divine origin\. The New Testament provides less testimony about itself than the Old Testament but offers sufficient evidence of its authority\. The organic unity of Scripture presupposes equal divinity and authority of both the Old and New Testaments, reflecting progressive revelation\. Events like Pentecost, which involved the gift of the Holy Spirit, affirm the reliability and inerrancy of the New Testament\. With statements emphasizing the Holy Spirit’s guidance, the NT attests to its own divine character\. Murray criticizes the dismissal of verbal inspiration by "open\-minded" scientific claims, arguing they are unscientific\. Rejecting inerrancy, he asserts, equates to rejecting Christ's own witness\.

__II\. The Internal Testimony__

Murray explores the role of the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit in affirming the Bible's authority\. He contrasts this with Karl Barth's view that regards Scripture as authoritative because it is a vessel or vehicle for the Word of God, meaning that it becomes the Word in moments of encounter, lacking inherent authority outside specific contexts\.

Murray clarifies that this view diverges from the classic Protestant or Reformed position\. According to the Westminster Confession of Faith, "The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God \(who is truth itself\) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God\." Thus, for Murray, Scripture is inherently authoritative because God is its author, and the Holy Spirit's testimony is what convinces believers of this authority\.

The Apostle Paul illustrates this by attributing his preaching not to words alone but to the power of the Holy Spirit, demonstrating the Spirit as the source of faith \(1 Thessalonians 1:5\)\. Similarly, John speaks of an anointing from the Holy One that imparts understanding \(1 John 2:20\-21, 27\)\.

Murray elaborates on why it's termed "testimony": the Holy Spirit continually bears witness to the divine character of Scripture, providing "noetic illumination"—a demonstration of its truth\. This illumination doesn't introduce new content but affirms the entire truth already present in Scripture, carrying it into the believer's heart and mind with irresistible conviction, thereby fostering faith\.

Murray concludes by emphasizing that the objective witness of Scripture requires the internal testimony to elicit the appropriate response in human consciousness\. Together, these aspects form a comprehensive understanding of Scripture's divine authority\.
