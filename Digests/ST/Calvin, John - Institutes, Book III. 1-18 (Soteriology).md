__The Institutes of the Christian Religion Book III\. 1\-18 \(Soteriology\) – John Calvin__

__CHAPTER 1\. THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST MADE AVAILABLE TO US BY THE SECRET OPERATION OF THE SPIRIT\. __Calvin begins his discussion on soteriology by emphasizing the indispensable role of the Holy Spirit as the bond uniting us with Christ, asserting that without this union, the benefits of Christ's redemptive work remain inaccessible to us\. This union is facilitated through the Holy Spirit, who imparts the fullness of his gifts to believers, in accordance with Christ's mediating office and the nature of the Trinity \(1\-2\)\. Various titles attributed to the Spirit, such as the Spirit of adoption, the Word of God, and the Spirit of life, reflect the transformative effect the Spirit has on the believer's life\. Union with Christ is depicted as foundational to salvation, which is comprehensively facilitated by the Spirit \(3\)\. Moreover, Calvin attributes the special work of faith to the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, underscoring the connection between faith and spiritual transformation \(4\)\.

__CHAPTER 2\. OF FAITH\. THE DEFINITION OF IT\. ITS PECULIAR PROPERTIES\. __Calvin provides a detailed examination of faith, clarifying its definition and properties while refuting misconceptions propagated by the Schoolmen\. He insists on the doctrine of faith's necessity and addresses how the Schoolmen have obscured this doctrine by making God the object of faith without reference to Christ\. Calvin critiques the notion of implicit faith, which he believes undermines the true nature of faith as a knowledge of God's will through Christ \(1\-2\)\. Key to understanding faith is recognizing its foundation in the promise of grace offered in Christ\. Faith is described as a firm and sure knowledge of divine favor, founded on God's free promise in Christ and sealed on believers' hearts by the Holy Spirit\. This understanding refutes the Scholastic notion of faith as having only one form or meaning \(7\-8\)\. Calvin distinguishes between true faith and the faith of hypocrites or the reprobate, who may accept the truth of reconciliation hypocritically without a genuine infusion of grace\. He argues that only the elect, sealed by the Spirit, possess firm and abiding faith, whereas reprobate faith is temporary and lacks assurance \(11\-12\)\. Calvin emphasizes that faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves a deep, heartfelt trust in God's promises, which strengthens believers against doubt and affirms their salvation \(15\-17\)\. He acknowledges that believers can experience doubt, yet faith ultimately triumphs over these difficulties, ensuring the certainty and indubitability of the elect's faith through the Spirit's assurance \(18\-20\)\.

__CHAPTER 3: REGENERATION BY FAITH\. OF REPENTANCE\. __Calvin explores the interrelationship between faith and repentance, proposing that repentance follows faith and is produced by it\. He counters the notion that repentance precedes faith, asserting that genuine repentance arises from a knowledge of God's grace and the transformative presence of the Holy Spirit \(1\-2\)\. He explores various opinions on repentance, distinguishing between legal repentance, driven by fear of wrath, and evangelical repentance, marked by confidence in divine mercy \(4\-5\)\. Calvin presents a definition of repentance as a conversion of life towards God, characterized by the mortification of the flesh and the quickening of the Spirit\. This life\-long process is seen as the renewal of God's image within believers, a form of regeneration that is sustained throughout life \(9\-10\)\. Calvin acknowledges the ongoing struggle with sin, understanding regeneration as partial freedom from sin's bondage, which will continue until life's end \(12\-14\)\. He emphasizes the fruits of repentance as a transformation involving piety towards God, charity towards man, and purity of life, aligning with prophetic exhortations \(15\-16\)\. Calvin insists on the primacy of internal repentance, marked by genuine confession and acknowledgment of sins, leading to the reception of divine mercy\. This view counters the idea of repentance as merely external exercises like fasting \(17\-19\)\. In summary, Calvin's exploration of soteriology underscores a cohesive theological vision in which the Holy Spirit facilitates union with Christ, enabling the believer to experience both faith and repentance as elements of a transformative and ongoing relationship with God\. Through a deep reliance on scriptural foundations, Calvin articulates a robust understanding that intertwines the spiritual journey with the promises of grace, ensuring the perseverance of the elect and the ultimate actualization of redemption through Christ\.

__CHAPTER 4\. PENITENCE, AS EXPLAINED IN THE SOPHISTICAL JARGON OF THE SCHOOLMEN, WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PURITY REQUIRED BY THE GOSPEL\. OF CONFESSION AND SATISFACTION\. __Calvin critically examines the errors of the Schoolmen in teaching repentance, highlighting how their definitions—ranging from deploring past sins to being sorry with a heart full of bitterness—fail to capture true contrition\. These definitions are further marred by an absurd division of repentance into contrition, confession, and satisfaction, leading to vain and perplexing doctrines that entangle believers in despair rather than assurance \(1\-2\)\. True repentance, according to Calvin, empowers forgiveness through sincere contrition, a heartfelt yearning for God's mercy, and the acknowledgment of sin\. He argues against the Schoolmen's claim that confession and satisfaction are essential for forgiveness, asserting that such beliefs remove the possibility of true assurance \(3\)\. Further, Calvin challenges the ecclesiastical mandate for auricular confession, noting that it was not of divine authority and was not practiced for 12 centuries before being institutionalized\. He refutes the biblical examples used to justify such confessions, insisting on a focus on God and mutual confession among believers without the sole involvement of priests \(4\-8\)\. Calvin advocates for a biblical understanding of confession, which is made to God and followed by voluntary confession to others only when it serves God's glory or the penitent's humility\. He distinguishes between public confession, which occurs during worship, and private confession, which can provide counsel and reconciliation between individuals \(9\-14\)\. The errors of the popish practices concerning confession are critiqued, particularly the requirement for detailed annual confessions and the invented "keys" said to bind and loose sins\. Such practices are deemed harmful, leading to hypocrisy and despair\. The refutation asserts that confession of being a sinner suffices, as true judgment and absolution are the purview of divine grace \(15\-19\)\. Calvin also dissects the notion of satisfaction, which the Schoolmen tie to the necessity of penance for sin's forgiveness\. He holds that true forgiveness is a divine gift, not contingent on human works or reparation, which leads to an impoverished understanding of Christ’s all\-sufficient atonement\. Calvin argues that no work can satisfy the demands of divine justice, as full satisfaction is accomplished only through Christ \(25\-28\)\.

__CHAPTER 5\. OF THE MODES OF SUPPLEMENTING SATISFACTION—VIZ\. INDULGENCES AND PURGATORY\. __Calvin delves into the concepts of indulgences and purgatory, presenting them as vain extensions of the erroneous doctrine of satisfaction\. Indulgences, purportedly drawing from a "treasury of the Church," including Christ’s and the surplus of the saints’ merits \(supererogation\), are refuted by scriptural affirmations that absolution comes solely through Christ's sacrifice \(1\-3\)\. The idea of purgatory is similarly deconstructed\. Calvin finds no biblical basis for this doctrine and critiques it as undermining Christ's redemptive work\. He refutes commonly cited scriptural passages, like the one that implies some sins might be forgiven posthumously \(Matt\. 5:25, 26\), and emphasizes that purgatory represents a theological aberration inconsistent with the biblical narrative and ancient church teaching \(6\-9\)\. Finally, Calvin insists that the medieval practices concerning the dead arose from tradition rather than scripture, noting ancient theologians' tentative positions on prayers for the dead\. He urges the primacy of holding to God’s Word, which eschews such fictions, revealing purgatory and indulgences as constructs lacking scriptural support and contrived out of theological error and avarice \(10\)\.

__CHAPTER 6\. THE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN MAN\. SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT\. __The concept of regeneration serves as a foundational pillar in Calvin's discussion of the Christian life, emphasizing its necessity for understanding the moral framework presented in Scripture\. This process of regeneration is integral to justification and adoption, leading to a new life for Christians\. Calvin's method highlights a straightforward, scriptural approach to morality, focusing on how a pious individual should conduct themselves according to universal principles\. Personal holiness is considered essential due to God's inherent holiness and the anticipation of believers living in the holy community of New Jerusalem, free from impurity \(1\-2\)\. The second facet is the believer's conformity to Christ's image, which Calvin sees as central to redemption\. This Christian life is painted against the backdrop of God's fatherly benevolence, which demands gratitude; Christ's purifying work, which requires avoiding new pollution; and the fact that believers are united in the body of Christ, which should inspire them to keep themselves unstained by the world\. Additionally, since Christ, the head, has ascended to heaven, believers should aspire to heavenly things\. The knowledge that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit serves as a deterrent against defilement through sin \(3\)\. Calvin criticizes false Christians who contradict this life by failing to truly learn from Christ, allowing the Gospel to guide their actions, or imitating Christ, the Master, resulting in an attempt to disconnect the Spirit from His word \(4\)\. However, Calvin encourages believers not to despair, provided they adhere to certain principles: taking God's word as their guide, sincerely cultivating righteousness, walking according to their ability in God's ways, making progress, and persevering in their faith \(5\)\.

__CHAPTER 7\. A SUMMARY OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE\. OF SELF\-DENIAL\.__ Calvin unfolds the concept of self\-denial, which he considers fundamental to the Christian life\. He lays out the principle that since believers are not their own, they should live and die for God, as guided by the Spirit rather than their own reason\. This involves seeking God's glory and obeying His will, with self\-denial portrayed as an essential doctrine for Christ's disciples\. Ignoring self\-denial leads to pride and hypocrisy, ultimately resulting in destruction \(1\-2\)\. Calvin highlights three virtues to nurture—sobriety, justice, and godliness—while avoiding impiety and worldly lusts\. These are components of a sobriety encompassing chastity, temperance, frugality, and patience \(3\)\. Paul's teachings, which focus heavily on self\-denial, face challenges due to human qualities like ambition, which should be countered by embracing humility, esteeming candor, maintaining mutual charity, and cultivating modesty\. This promotes the good of one's neighbor, an undertaking requiring profound self\-denial yet crucial for the growth of Christian love and charity \(4\-5\)\. Calvin argues that embracing patience and kindness in charity acknowledges God's image in all others, effectively refuting objections against this ideal\. Thus, charity becomes intrinsic to the Christian life, as foundational as the mortification of personal desires and vices seems vital \(6\-7\)\. Self\-denial extends to one's relationship with God, suggesting a state of equanimity and tolerance\. Believers must acknowledge their perpetual subjection to God, shun avarice and ambition, and hope for prosperity as a blessing from God, rejecting ungodly methods \(8\-9\)\. Finally, Calvin encourages committing oneself entirely to God amidst life's accidents and afflictions, maintaining patience through trials like disease and war, viewing them as divine exercises shaping character \(10\)\. 

__CHAPTER 8\. OF BEARING THE CROSS—ONE BRANCH OF SELF\-DENIAL\. __The cross, according to Calvin, is imposed by the Lord upon the elect to refine and prove them, emphasizing its necessity and dignity within the Christian life\. Suffering is depicted as a path to God’s kingdom, where believers, in communion with Christ, find blessing and salvation in their trials \(1\-2\)\. The cross serves as a tool of humility and dependency on God, providing a testing ground for patience and faith, as exemplified in scriptural figures like Abraham \(3\-6\)\. Suffering for righteousness' sake is a singular consolation, turning worldly miseries like poverty or imprisonment into instruments of divine favor and happiness\. Calvin encourages believers to bear these crosses willingly and cheerfully, albeit with the acknowledgment of pain—a sentiment not shared by the Stoic ideal of emotional suppression\. This patience rooted in obedience contrasts sharply with the philosophers’ views, grounded instead in the justice of God and His providential care \(7\-11\)\.

__CHAPTER 9\. OF MEDITATING ON THE FUTURE LIFE\. __Calvin explores the divine purpose behind afflictions, using them to detach believers from the excessive love of the present world and redirect their aspirations toward heaven\. This perspective critiques the blindness caused by prosperity and stresses the cross's role as a corrective \(1\-2\)\. He acknowledges the value of the present life as an expression of divine favor deserving of gratitude but contrasts it with the superior reality of heaven, for which believers are prepared through the challenges of the earthly life \(3\)\. This call to evaluate life beckons Christians to desire a better life, moderating their enthusiasm for earthly pleasures\. Death is transformed into a gateway to incorruptibility and part of a faithful journey towards Christ, seeing believers as perpetual sacrifices conforming to their Savior even unto death \(4\-6\)\.

__CHAPTER 10\. HOW TO USE THE PRESENT LIFE, AND THE COMFORTS OF IT\.  __Calvin stresses the necessity of using earthly goods wisely, warning against the extremes of excessive austerity and indulgence\. God created the world not only for necessity but for delight, a truth affirmed by scriptural and experiential evidence \(1\-2\)\. While extreme disdain for earthly pleasures can be as misguided as wantonness, moderation should guide believers, who must also recognize God’s providential gifts in creation\. However, they should not lose sight of heavenly aspirations amid temporal enjoyments \(3\-4\)\. Calvin underscores accountability in using created goods, for while creation invites love for God, misuse by the wicked leads to sin\. He asserts that life is a station assigned by God, inviting believers to find comfort and purpose in the divine calling, free from restlessness \(5\-6\)\.

__CHAPTER 11\. OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH\. BOTH THE NAME AND THE REALITY DEFINED\. __In this crucial exposition, Calvin connects justification to regeneration and underlines its necessity for understanding Christian faith\. Justification, like sanctification, is obtained through faith and is the principle ground of religion \(1\)\. Calvin defines justification as the sinner being deemed righteous in God's sight through faith in Christ, distinguishing it from any reliance on works \(2\)\. This justification is a forensic term, representing a status granted by God through the imputation of Christ’s righteousness \(3\)\.__ __He further elaborates on this concept by discussing how justification encompasses acceptance by God, imputation of Christ’s righteousness, remission of sins, blessedness, reconciliation with God, and righteousness derived from Christ’s obedience \(4\)\. __Osiander\.__ Calvin then addresses the errors of Osiander, who proposed an idea of "*essential righteousness*," suggesting a divine essence within believers which Calvin refutes\. Osiander's arguments, which include claims of an essential unity with Christ and a transformative mixture of divine essence, are systematically dismantled by Calvin\. He insists that Christ’s righteousness is imputed, not inherent within us, emphasizing that it is the secret agency of the Spirit, not an essential infusion, that unites us to Christ \(5\)\. Osiander’s various arguments, touching on human nature, Christ’s divine role, and the mixture of divine righteousness, are countered by Calvin with emphases on the distinct, imputed nature of Christ’s righteousness and the centrality of his mediatorial work \(6\-15\)\. Osiander’s propositions, which attempt to separate justification and sanctification or diminish Christ's incarnational work, are thoroughly refuted, highlighting the forensic nature of justification where God regards believers as righteous due solely to Christ’s work\. Calvin argues that without divine forgiveness, no righteousness exists in humans, clothed in Christ’s righteousness, enabling believers to face God’s judgment with confidence in their justified state\. Calvin refutes claims of the Sophists that good works contribute to justification, stating that they are a result of, not a requisite for, salvation\. He concludes by reaffirming justification by faith alone, which securely holds Christ’s righteousness, marking it as distinct from sanctification but undoubtedly leading to a life of obedience and holiness \(20\-23\)\.

__CHAPTER 12\. NECESSITY OF CONTEMPLATING THE JUDGMENT\-SEAT OF GOD, IN ORDER TO BE SERIOUSLY CONVINCED OF THE DOCTRINE OF GRATUITOUS JUSTIFICATION\. __In this chapter, Calvin discusses the essential contemplation of God's judgment seat to grasp the concept of gratuitous justification fully\. He critiques the error of the Sophists who approach justification as if debated before a human tribunal rather than in the presence of God's majesty and justice, where absolute perfection is required, and human righteousness is cursed under the law \(1\)\. Calvin warns against hypocritical confidence, illustrated by the natural human tendency to feel morally superior when compared to others\. He exhorts believers to align with scriptural testimony from figures like Job and Paul, recognizing that God is the true measure of righteousness and finding any personal merit utterly lacking in His sight \(2\-3\)\. A serious examination of conscience, set against the standard of God's infinite purity, quickly reveals the fallacy of relying on human righteousness, as exemplified in Calvin's analogy comparing human virtue to stars that dim in the light of the sun \(4\)\. This erroneous confidence stems from inherent human nature, where subjective righteousness is often exaggerated, but true Christian humility lies in abandoning these illusions and trusting solely in God's mercy, as apprehended through faith in Christ \(5\-6\)\. Calvin illustrates this humility using the parable of the Publican, emphasizing the heart's cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner" \(7\)\. Overall, arrogance and self\-reliance must be set aside to fully embrace God's gracious beneficence, underscoring that the more one rests in self, the more one obstructs divine grace \(8\)\.

__CHAPTER 13\. TWO THINGS TO BE OBSERVED IN GRATUITOUS JUSTIFICATION\. __Gratuitous justification preserves God's glory by ensuring righteousness is found in Christ alone, with no room for boasting in personal achievements, as all glory beyond Christ is an affront to God \(1\-2\)\. This justification provides true peace of conscience, rooted not in human works but in the divine promise, as affirmed by scriptural references from Solomon and Paul that stress the futility of law\-based righteousness \(3\)\. The promise is confirmed by faith in Christ's mercy, aligning with teachings from Augustine and Bernard and consistent with prophetic predictions \(4\)\. Calvin asserts that peace through justification by faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit, unattainable through complete personal sanctification, which remains imperfect in this life\. Despite this imperfection, hope persists through the assured inheritance in Christ, provided freely by God's justifying grace \(5\)\. 

__CHAPTER 14\. THE BEGINNING OF JUSTIFICATION\. IN WHAT SENSE PROGRESSIVE\. __Calvin explains varying states of righteousness across four classes of humanity: idolatrous and profane, hypocritical Christians, nominal Christians, and the regenerate\. Idolatrous individuals lack righteousness before God, while all human virtue, however praiseworthy, is inherently corrupted by impure motives and the absence of service to God \(1\-3\)\. Without union with Christ, virtues lack sanctification and true spiritual life\. Scripture paints this natural state as spiritual death, emphasizing the need for regeneration through Christ alone \(4\-5\)\. Calvin criticizes the conflation of good works with redemption, maintaining that outside of Christ, humans remain bound in sin \(6\)\. Regarding profane individuals and hypocrites, Calvin cites passages like Haggai to demonstrate that, absent true faith, all actions are condemned, devoid of genuine righteousness \(7\)\. For the regenerate, even their righteous acts are tainted by inherent corruption and do not merit justification before God\. Despite receiving imputed righteousness from Christ, they still contend with sin \(9\)\. Thus, Calvin argues that any inclination towards self\-justification through works is refuted by Scripture, which insists on faith alone as the path to justification \(10\-13\)\. Calvin argues that all notions of partial righteousness or works\-based merit ignore the fundamental principle that justification springs from Christ's imputed righteousness rather than any human contribution\. Even the righteous living of believers, grounded in faith, cannot withstand God's scrutiny without Christ's mediating work \(14\-17\)\. Addressing objections, Calvin explains that saints find confidence not in their merit but in their adoption by the Father, affirmed through the fruits of the Spirit\. In conclusion, Calvin asserts that no believer attributes their standing before God to personal works, which are overwhelmed by sin, but solely to the saving righteousness of Christ \(18\-21\)\. 

__CHAPTER 15\. THE BOASTED MERIT OF WORKS SUBVERSIVE BOTH OF THE GLORY OF GOD, IN BESTOWING RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND OF THE CERTAINTY OF SALVATION\. __Calvin begins by affirming that good works do not merit favor with God, reiterating that they cannot stand in His sight due to their intrinsic impurity\. Though terms like "merit" are sometimes applied to works by theologians like Augustine, they are ultimately seen as gifts from God and lack sufficiency for salvation, rendering believers "unprofitable servants" \(1\-2\)\. He emphasizes that God's reward for good works is not due to their merit but His pleasure and grace, as human actions, marred by impurity, are unable to attain righteousness before God\. Works are acknowledged only because they honor God, not those who perform them \(3\)\. Addressing objections from Scripture—such as those from Ecclesiasticus and Hebrews—Calvin refutes the idea that works earn a standard of merit for divine reward, instead affirming that blessings are entirely gifts from God, who chooses to account for works in demonstrating His love and honoring the gifts He bestows \(4\)\. Ultimately, he calls believers back to Christ as the sole foundation of salvation, whereby all our righteousness and merit are found in Christ alone, negating any human contribution \(5\)\. Calvin rejects any sophistry that diminishes Christ’s merit to elevate human deeds, maintaining that no works, even moral ones, can render someone agreeable to God without being engrafted in Christ \(6\)\. He critiques the sophists of his time who convolute faith by suggesting that good works aid justification, declaring that such views misuse faith's significance and ignore its true biblical foundation \(7\)\. Calvin concludes this chapter by summarizing the orthodox position: true believers are justified by faith and not works, with subsequent good works serving as evidence of their transformation and the assurance of their calling in the kingdom of righteousness \(8\)\.

__CHAPTER 16\. REFUTATION OF THE CALUMNIES BY WHICH IT IS ATTEMPTED TO THROW ODIUM ON THIS DOCTRINE\. __Calvin addresses accusations from Papists that claim his doctrine negates good works and encourages sin by making justification appear too easy, based solely on free remission of sins \(1\)\. He refutes these claims by affirming the inseparable relationship between faith and works while placing justification solely in faith, thereby maintaining that good works naturally follow as fruits of sincere faith \(2\)\. He disputes the notion that denying merit dissuades people from right conduct, arguing that genuine love for God demands worship and obedience freely\. The grounding of sanctification in justification is such that grace animates believers’ desire to fulfill their duty and live uprightly, independent of merit\-driven motivations \(3\)\. Calvin further contends that the apostles exclude merit as a motive, always pointing instead towards God's mercy and the transformative power of grace\. Thus, free justification is not an invitation to lawlessness but to grateful obedience manifested in good works \(4\)\.

__CHAPTER 17\. THE PROMISES OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL RECONCILED\. __Calvin extends his argument by clarifying why justification cannot be attributed to works, directly engaging with objections based on the promises of the law \(1\)\. He asserts that the law's promises are applicable only to perfect observers, highlighting that the Gospel's free grace, accessed through faith, upholds these promises by allowing for the forgiveness of shortcomings, which makes salvation possible \(2\)\. Calvin explains that promises in the law were given to guide believers towards God’s faithfulness, despite human inability to fulfill the law’s demands perfectly \(3\)\. He distinguishes between God's acceptance of believers and any supposed merit of their works\. Examples like Cornelius are used to show that God accepts individuals freely, and their works are acknowledged only as a fruit of grace working in them \(4\)\. Calvin stresses that this acceptance stems from God seeing His Spirit's work and not from an inherent value in human effort\. He divides promises into legal and evangelical, pointing out that the legal demand is for perfect observance while the evangelical promise is simply to believe \(6\)\. He resolves rhetorical tensions by affirming that faith\-based righteousness remains untainted by the law's impossible demands, relying instead on Christ's fulfillment of those demands \(8\)\. Calvin highlights the inadequacy of human virtue apart from divine grace by noting that even the best works are stained by sin, and none meet God’s perfect standards \(10\)\. The Apostle James’ calls for works are understood as critiques against superficial faith rather than affirmations of works\-based righteousness \(11\)\. Calvin concludes with the assertion that love and faith are inseparable, yet distinct, in their roles in a believer’s life, with no human achievement outweighing the grace received through faith in Christ \(12\-15\)\.

__CHAPTER 18\. THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS IMPROPERLY INFERRED FROM REWARDS\. __Calvin confronts two principal objections regarding rewards for works\. He asserts that God's recompense is understood in sequence, not as cause, meaning works are not the grounds of salvation but reflect the path of holiness expected from the heirs of God’s kingdom \(1\)\. Works, therefore, emanate from God’s prior grace and promises, demonstrated, for instance, in how God promised Abraham blessings before any works were considered \(2\)\. Calvin elucidates that believers anticipate rewards not from a sense of worthiness but as a foretaste of divine promise, embodying the heavenly life through sanctified living on earth\. He views good works as advancing believers towards the hope of eternal life set before them \(3\)\. This path corrects pride and arrogance, reinforcing that God crowns virtues imbued by His Spirit rather than innate human goodness \(4\-5\)\. Addressing objections about accumulating treasures, Calvin emphasizes a heavenly mindset, commending care for others as a way God mercifully rewards through His grace, not as merit \(6\)\. He disputes claims that enduring affliction qualifies one for heavenly reward, clarifying that believers are considered "worthy" only by bearing in our body the marks of our Lord and Master through sharing in Christ’s suffering, not due to inherent merit \(7\)\. Addressing faith and love, Calvin places love as a preeminent fruit yet clarifies that it does not justify; instead, faith apprehends Christ, whereon righteousness rests \(8\-10\)\. Calvin concludes that justification lies in faith, not equated with works, and that true righteousness cannot coexist with the imperfect reach of law\-bounded deeds \(11\)\.
