__Perspectives on Pentecost – Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

__I\. A Promise and a Plea\.__

Theology has recently concentrated on the question of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, leading to intense controversy\. The promise of the Spirit, "who will guide you into all truth," is always bound to the Word of God\. Experiences, while valuable, are neither the source nor the norm of Christian knowledge and doctrine; they must be subordinated to Christ and His Word, as stated in 2 Corinthians 10:5\. Gaffin's plea is to illuminate biblical teaching amidst the confusing contemporary claims about experiencing the Spirit\.

__II\. The Gift of the Spirit\.__

A significant portion of mentions of the Spirit in the New Testament occurs in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation, contrasting with the Gospels' focus on the Spirit's present work\. Pentecost serves as the dividing line for understanding the Spirit's role, as "everything said in the New Testament about the Spirit's work looks forward or traces back to Pentecost\."

__A\. Pentecost and Christ \(the Christological dimension\)\. __*1\. Promise of Spirit\-and\-Fire Baptism\.* John's ministry foreshadows Jesus' fulfillment of baptism with the Holy Spirit and fire, pointing to Jesus as the representative sin\-bearer\. *2\. Fulfillment in Pentecost\.* Pentecost is central to Christ's work, highlighted in Peter's sermon and Paul's commentary in 1 Corinthians 15:45, emphasizing the unity of Christ's resurrection and believers'\. Gaffin intertwines Peter’s declaration of the Spirit’s outpouring and Paul's depiction of Christ as a life\-giving Spirit, underscoring that the gift of the Spirit is ultimately the gift of Christ himself to the church\.

__B\. Pentecost and the Church \(the ecclesiological dimension\)\. __Christ's work is Messianic with implications for the Church, marking it as the new covenant community and body of Christ\. The Spirit establishes the church as a dwelling for God, highlighting both its present and eschatological dimensions\.

__C\. Pentecost and the Individual Believer \(the experiential dimension\)\. __*1\. Pentecost Not a Postconversion Model\.* Pentecost is a historical redemption event, while its ongoing application concerns the ordo salutis\. Events in Acts are extensions of Pentecost, marking foundational gospel spread rather than individual repeated experiences\. *2\. Acknowledging Apostolic Experiences\.* The experiences in Acts should not be diminished but recognized as unique and foundational rather than normative for every believer\. *3\. Baptism with the Spirit\.* The phrase "to baptize in" or "with the \(one\) \(Holy\) Spirit" is mainly linked to Pentecost, with 1 Corinthians 12:13 applying it to believers' ongoing redemption experience\. All believers share in the Spirit from their incorporation into Christ’s body\. *4\. Pentecost as Once\-for\-All Event\.* Pentecost's significance is integrated into Christ's historia salutis, extending to all believers without necessitating a division within the church into spiritual and carnal classes\. *5\. New Covenant Experience Differences\.* The fulfillment in Christ offers believers a more complete spiritual experience than the Old Testament faith community, characterized by a universal Spirit presence beyond Israel\.

__Note on John 20:22\. __The passage in John, where Jesus breathes on the disciples, differs from Acts due to its private setting and Jesus' bodily presence, contrasting with Pentecost's public event\. John's sending of the Spirit aligns with the ascension, indicating continuity rather than contradiction between the accounts\.

__III\. Some Basic Perspectives on the Gifts of the Spirit\.__

*Gifts in Key Scriptures*\. The discussion on the gifts of the Spirit is grounded in passages like Romans 12:1\-8, 1 Corinthians 12\-14, and Ephesians 4:7\-13, which provide foundational insights into the role and nature of spiritual gifts\.

__A\. The Gift of the Spirit and the Gifts of the Spirit\. __*Gift as Universal Work\.* The "Gift" of the Spirit is the work of the Spirit and is universal among believers\. The workings or "gifts" of the Spirit pertain to specific ministry functions and serve as anticipatory, provisional, firstfruits of eschatological life\. Miracles disclose the essence of the kingdom and its blessings, but do not constitute that essence\. 

__B\. Charismatic and Non\-Charismatic\. __*Misleading Distinction*\. The distinction between "charismatic" and "non\-charismatic" can be misleading\. Biblically, "charisma" refers broadly to manifestations of grace, and the entire church is charismatic, as all gifts reflect grace\.

__C\. The Trinitarian Character of the Gifts\. __*Trinitarian Unity\.* The functional unity between Christ’s exaltation and the Spirit emphasizes the trinitarian nature of gifts, with the Holy Spirit acting as the promise of the Father, thereby engaging the full Godhead in the gifting process\. 

__D\. The Ministerial Character of the Gifts\. __*Gifts for Service\.* Spiritual gifts are given exclusively for the purpose of service within the church\. They are meant to aid in building up the church community\.

__E\. Holy Spirit Baptism and the Gifts\. __*Tongues as Evidence\.* The teaching that tongues are the necessary evidence of Spirit baptism is unbiblical—no gift holds a privileged position as an indicator of the Spirit’s presence\.

__F\. Gifts and Office\. __*Harmony of Gift and Office\.* The New Testament does not recognize a tension between spiritual gifts and ecclesiastical office; rather, the Spirit's work includes structure and order, not just spontaneous freedom\.

__G\. Composition of the List of Gifts\. __*Categories and Functions\.* There should not be rigid lines between various gifts, such as knowledge and wisdom or healing and miracles\. Gifts are categorized into word and deed charismata, which are complementary and inseparable\.

__H\. Identifying Your Gift\(s\)\. __*Exploring Personal Gifts\.* There should be no mechanical approach to identifying spiritual gifts based on scriptural lists, which are selective and not exhaustive\. Gifts should be recognized in terms of opportunities for service within one’s life context\. Acknowledging personal weaknesses aligns with the core understanding that God works through our frailties, demonstrating strength in what appears weak\.

__IV\. Prophecy and Tongues__

__A\. 1 Corinthians 14: Some Controlling Observations\. __*Prophecy vs\. Tongues in Corinth\.* The situation in Corinth reflects broader New Testament dynamics, where Paul contrasts prophecy with tongues\. Prophecy is deemed superior due to its clear role in edification; it directly builds up the church\. However, when tongues are interpreted, they achieve functional equivalence with prophecy, as both are word\-gifts meant to complement one another\.

__B\. Prophecy \(the Christian prophet\)\. __*Characteristics of New Testament Prophecy\.* Prophecy is a gift given to the church, characterized by its revelatory nature\. It is for some, not all, believers, yet it aligns with the concept of prophethood for all believers\. New Testament prophets possess insights comparable to apostles and Old Testament prophets, impacting the faith and life of the church broadly rather than in isolated matters\. *Rationale Behind Prophecy\.* In passages like Romans 12:6, prophecy is connected to faith, indicating that no gift is rightly exercised apart from this anchoring\. This relates not only to the objective truth but also to the prophet's own faith\. Acts, especially the example of Agabus, shows prophetic accuracy tied to the Holy Spirit’s guidance, with no need for distinguishing between predictive and hortatory prophecy\. *Comprehensive Scope of Prophecy\.* The Book of Revelation exemplifies Christian prophecy without suggesting a hierarchy of authority\. This aligns with the view that prophecy functions alongside the gift of discerning spirits, ensuring alignment with the Holy Spirit's true intent\.

__C\. Tongues\. __*Understanding and Interpreting Tongues\.* While often compared to prophecy, tongues involve the Holy Spirit acting beyond the speaker's cognitive control, using genuine language for divine communication\. This contrasts with views suggesting tongues arise from primal personality aspects, which Gaffin argues lacks biblical support\. *Tongues as Genuine Language\.* Tongues are interpretable languages, not inherently new but potentially foreign, aligned with prophecy\. The unintelligibility arises from listeners not understanding the language, requiring interpretation as translation\. *Issues Surrounding Tongues\.* The proper use of tongues maintains a Godward focus, aligning with edifying doxology\. The association with prophecy suggests existing languages were used at Pentecost and likely in Corinth\. Tongues should not be deemed a standalone personal gift nor required for all believers\. Instead, they function as part of the broader ministry and are not evidential of spiritual maturity\.

__V\. The Question of Cessation\.__

__A\. The Temporary Nature of the Apostolate\. __*Limited Apostolic Role\.* Apostles were limited to the first generation of the church, serving as eyewitnesses fully integrated with Christ’s earthly ministry\. Paul considers himself the last apostle, and while he mentors Timothy, he does so personally, not positioning Timothy as a direct successor of Christ\. 

__B\. The Foundational Character of the Apostolic Witness\. __*Apostolic Purpose and Foundation\.* The apostles primarily served as witnesses to Christ, with figures like Paul describing them as foundational alongside Christ, the cornerstone, in Ephesians 2:19ff\. This foundational role isn’t based on temporal or personal characteristics but aligns with a historical and absolute foundation essential for the development and legacy of the church\.

__C\. The Foundational Character of Prophecy\. __The Role of__ __Prophecy in Ephesians\. In Ephesians 2:20, prophecy and apostleship form part of the church’s foundation\. The term "prophets" likely refers to existing New Testament prophets rather than Old Testament figures\. New Testament prophecy is covenantal and redemptive\-historical, contributing to the formation of the canon\. So, as with apostleship, the role of prophecy diminished following the early, foundational church period\.

__D\. The Cessation of Tongues\. __*Understanding Tongues and Prophecy\.* Tongues, when interpreted, align with prophecy, serving a foundational period role\. Paul’s discussion in 1 Corinthians 14 emphasizes that tongues are a sign for unbelievers, indicative of judgment, not for evangelization\. Tongues, like parables, hold mystery\-content and serve to discern judgment, focusing on divine action and revelatory boundaries\. __E\. 1 Corinthians 13:8\-13 and "When Perfection Comes\." __*The Transience of Spiritual Gifts\.* Paul highlights the temporary nature of gifts like prophecy and tongues, which cease once perfection arrives, referencing Christ's return – he is not concerned with the question of continuity or a point of cessation\. He stresses the transient and provisional nature of knowledge \(including faith and hope\) and the ways to knowledge \(including prophecy and tongues\)\.

__F\. The Question of Cessation in General\. __*Organic Approach to Cessation\.* Gaffin emphasizes avoiding mechanistic interpretations of scripture concerning cessation, instead advocating for a holistic approach that respects the organic development seen throughout biblical history\.

__G\. Healing and Related Gifts\. __*Nature and Scope of Healing Gifts\.* Healing gifts, which are deed\-based, align with the foundational church period and don't directly connect to continuing sources of revelation\. Contemporary healing lacks the decisive, sovereign power of Christ’s and the apostles’ works\. Nevertheless, divine healing occurs, acknowledging God's ability to heal beyond current medical limitations\. Faith is not the primary determinant of healing, as signified by Paul's endurance of his "thorn in the flesh" without healing despite prayer\.
