__Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments – Geerhardus Vos__

__Part One: The Mosaic Epoch of Revelation__

__1\. Introduction: Nature and Method of Biblical Theology\. __

Theology is the science of understanding God and relies on revelation due to the necessity of studying impersonal objects\. God's self\-revelation precedes human knowledge, as God existed before humanity\. Our sinfulness has altered the original relationship with God\. __Division of Theology into Four Departments\. __*Exegetical Theology* focuses on the study of scripture and its origins, including authorial context and content\. *Historical Theology, Systematic Theology, and Practical Theology* follow\. Exegetical Theology is primary, requiring a passive, receptive approach\. __Biblical Theology__ is a branch of Exegetical Theology that explores God's self\-revelation in scripture, characterized by 1\) Historic progressiveness, interpreting redemption through both objective acts \(incarnation, atonement\) and subjective acts \(regeneration, sanctification\); 2\) Embodiment in history through actions and words with both divine and human instructional purposes\. 3\) Organic progression with accumulated redemptive acts; and 4\) Practical adaptability, focusing on knowledge tied to love, emphasizing covenant over academic study\.  H__istorical Contexts and Guiding Principles\. __Biblical Theology has been seen variably as proof\-texts for Systematic Theology, a Pietist response to scholastic Dogmatics, or a rationalist approach\. Principles include infallibility, objectivity from God to man, and plenary inspiration\. __Relation to Other Disciplines\. __Biblical Theology relates to Sacred History through its focus on revelation \(knowing\) compared to history's focus on redemption \(being\)\. It cooperates with Biblical Introduction and employs a historical principle differing from Systematic Theology’s logical approach\. __Method and Practical Uses of Biblical Theology\. __Determined by historical progression, Biblical Theology is divided into periods based on covenants, informed by biblical cues\. It serves as evidence of organic design, opposes rationalistic criticism, revitalizes truth, and counters emotional religiosity\. It underlines the action, purpose, and direction toward God, ultimately highlighting the glory of God through history\.

__2\. The Mapping Out of the Field of Revelation\. __

__Natural Revelation __existed before sin and comes from two sources: the inner sense of man and the works of nature\. Supernatural revelation, though not limited to redemption, became necessary after sin as natural revelation required correction\. __Pre\-Redemptive and Redemptive Special Revelation\. __Communication with God was available to man, who was morally perfect but had the potential for a higher level of perfection\. This potential, not innate, was revealed through special revelation, indicating an indefinite probation\. __Redemptive Special Revelation\. __*Berith* is not synonymous with *diatheke*/testament\. Pre\-redemptive special revelation is associated with the covenant of works, while redemptive special revelation aligns with the covenant of grace\. *Berith* implies a divinely sanctioned agreement characterized by unalterable and eternal validity\. *Diatheke* originally referred to a personal disposition or legally as a "last will," suggesting potential change until the testator’s death, which is not applicable to God\. It was used in the Septuagint because *synteke*, implying partnership, was less suitable\. The term transitions from the Septuagint to the New Testament, referring to the old and new *berith*, as seen in Jeremiah 31:31, the institution of the Lord's Supper, and the Epistle to the Hebrews, signifying transitions from Moses to Christ and Christ to eschatology\.

__3\. The Content of Pre\-Redemptive Special Revelation\.__

__Four principles__ are central to pre\-redemptive special revelation: life, probation, temptation, and death\. 

1. *Life*\. The tree of life symbolizes the highest potency of life, recurring as a symbol in eschatology\. Adam and Eve did not eat from it, understanding it as reserved for future use\. It symbolized eternal life, attainable through obedience during probation\. Eating from it prematurely would have conflicted with its sacramental purpose\. 
2. *Probation* is symbolized by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and this involves multiple interpretations: 1\) Mythical: A myth keeping man from divine privileges, countered by the divine planting of the tree and the role of Eve; 2\) Autonomous Choice: The tree as a "probation\-tree" representing human choice over God's moral directive, though the meaning of "know" as "choose" is debated; and 3\) Spiritual Instrument: The tree as God’s means to guide man to moral maturity and highest blessedness, countered by Satan's deceptive portrayal of its power\.
3. *Temptation/Sin* is represented by the serpent, who symbolizes evil and temptation, opposing God’s positive probationary test\. The serpent is considered real yet empowered by demonic forces\. Genesis seldom refers to the fall in detail, emphasizing the serpent's cunning approach\. Eve, unlike Adam, might not have heard the prohibition directly from God, leading to Satan's successful temptation in two stages: sowing doubt and refuting God's truth\. 
4. *Death *is reflected by the dissolution of the body\. Arguments contend that man was created mortal, but Vos distinguishes between original life and blessed life after probation\. Death occurs not as a natural destiny but as a curse resulting from sin\. Premature death implies death was not humanity's inherent destiny\.

__Mortality and Immortality\. __Immortality is viewed differently philosophically \(persistence of the soul\) and theologically\. Theologically, it's a state of being without an internal cause of death—humans were both immortal and mortal, subject to death only under certain conditions due to the introduction of sin\. Eschatologically, immortality awaits after the earthly life\. Death signifies separation from God, evidenced by expulsion from the Garden, which equated to expulsion toward death\. This separation is the root of death, which signifies the deprivation of communion with God\.

__4\. The Content of the First Redemptive Special Revelation\.__

The first redemptive special revelation contains elements of both justice, seen in the three curses \(on serpent, woman, man\), and grace, reflected in the curse upon the Tempter and the manner of divine interrogation\. 

The curses follow the sequence of sin's commission\. Consequences of sin: a\) God initiates the *response* to sin; b\) There is a *reversal* in humanity's attitude towards both the serpent and God; c\) a prophecy of *ongoing deliverance* is made, involving the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent\. The term 'seed of the serpent' has been interpreted as reprobate humanity, which presents an issue since humanity is also the seed of the woman\. Vos suggests it is more likely found outside the human race as symbolic of the kingdom of Satan and his evil spirits; d\) an ongoing *enmity* between the woman's and the serpent's seeds is predicted\. __Seed\. __The term 'seed' is collective in both instances\. The seed of the serpent being collective necessitates that the seed of the woman is also collective\. However, from the woman's seed can arise a *single* individual—the Messiah—who will ultimately defeat the serpent\. __Human Suffering\. __Justice is served as both man and woman are condemned to suffer in ways aligned with their inherent nature and roles, highlighting justice in the consequences of sin according to gender\.

__5\. The Noachian Revelation and Development Leading Up to It\.__

The Noachian Revelation primarily reflects the development of the human race rather than redemption, characterized by its negative aspects\.  The line of Cain showcases the rapid spread of sin alongside common grace, contributing to advancements in technology and civilization, but also degeneration and evil\. __Cainites and Sethites\. __The Sethites represent the continuity of redemption, with no focus on inventions or progress, maintaining relative insulation from the degeneration of the Cainites\. God occasionally chooses those outside the redemptive sphere to advance secular culture, as seen with Greeks in art and Romans in law and politics\. Enoch and Lamech serve as narrative opposites\. The narrative highlights divine purpose and the insufficiency of even the good to counteract evil\. Instead, there was an influence of evil through intermingling, as suggested by "daughters of men" \(Cainites\) and "sons of God" \(Sethites\), leaving Noah and his family as the sole faithful ones\. Genesis 6:5\-7 underscores __four aspects of pervasive evil__: 1\) its intensity and extent; 2\) its inward nature, affecting the heart and thought; 3\) the absolute dominance of evil, excluding good; and \(4\) its habitual and continuous presence\. __Revelation After the Flood\. __Post\-flood measures aimed at furthering the divine purpose were constructive, focusing on natural life's development rather than directly on redemption, which continued through Shem's line\. This involved three stages:

1. *Genesis 8:20\-22* assures the regularity of nature and no repetition of such judgments, acknowledging the deep\-seated evil in the human heart—a condition immune to judgment as a remedy\. 
2. Genesis 9:1\-7 introduces ordinations to support the continuation of life through propagation, protection, and sustenance\. The relationship between humans and animals shifts to coercion \("fear and dread"\)\. The importance of the image of God is highlighted regarding the death penalty, both as executing justice and emphasizing the value of human life\. 
3. Genesis 9:8\-17 establishes a covenant with a solemn sign—the rainbow—as an enduring symbol of the divine promise\.

__6\. The Period Between Noah and the Great Patriarchs__

__The Prophetic Deliverances of Noah \(Genesis 9:20\-27\)\. __Noah's prophetic deliverances include a curse upon Canaan, Ham's lineage, and blessings for Japheth and Shem\. The distinction between them lies within the ethical sphere\. Canaan is cursed due to his strong resemblance to Ham's character\. Shem receives blessing through the statement "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem," indicating divine favor, while Japheth is promised territorial expansion and an inclusive role within Shem's domain, "let Japheth dwell in Shem's tents\."

__The Table of Nations \(Genesis 10\)\. __This genealogical table illustrates that while the Shemites will carry the redemptive line in the immediate future, other nations remain within Sacred History's broader narrative\. They are not permanently excluded from it\.

__The Division of Tongues at Babel \(Genesis 11:1\-9\)\. __The Tower of Babel signifies humanity's attempt to establish a centralized empire that glorifies human independence from God\. God's intervention disrupts their unity to prevent the spread of sin\. Vos notes that without sin, humanity's unity would have been ideal\. God's preference indicates nationalism over imperial world powers, setting the stage for redemption through a chosen people and preserving humanity's natural life\.

__The Election of the Shemites\. __The Shemites are chosen as conveyors of redemption and revelation due to their religious disposition\. Characteristics attributed to the Shemites include

1. A passive, receptive mentality seen as a religious endowment,
2. Though Renan emphasizes their land as the birthplace of major monotheistic religions, many Shemitic groups were not monotheistic,
3. A commonality among deities, which despite variations, share fundamental similarities,
4. An emphasis on submission and tribal particularism, manifesting as monolatry,
5. A distinct religion from pantheism, focusing on personal relationships between deity and worshipper,
6. Religious dispositions not produced through evolution but considered inherent to the Shemitic identity\.

__7\. Revelation in the Patriarchal Period\.__

__Critical Views\. __Some critical perspectives, including evolutionary views, regard the descent of nations from a single patriarch as fictional\. Critics like Wellhausen suggest that figures like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are Canaanite demigods rather than historical figures linked to Hebrew genealogy\. Some argue for Babylonian antecedents, interpreting patriarchal stories symbolically, where characters and events correspond to lunar cycles and other ancient myths\. __Historicity of the Patriarchs\. __Vos emphasizes the importance of the historicity of the patriarchs as central actors in the narrative of redemption and the actual beginning of God's people\. He argues that without the patriarchs, placing the start with Moses becomes arbitrary\. For Vos, a true history of redemption should begin with Adam and Eve\. __Theophanies\. __The patriarchal period is marked by distinctions between forms and content of revelation, with more explicit descriptions than in earlier accounts like Adam's\. Abraham received both speaking and visible manifestations of God, while Isaac and Jacob experienced fewer theophanies\. The construction of altars at sites of theophanies within the promised land underscores their significance, though Joseph's life notably lacks theophanies\. __The Angel of Jehovah\. __Distinguished from Jehovah, yet identical, this manifestation aligns with the Trinity but is not intended to reveal it\. The purpose is sacramental, reflecting God's desire for presence with His people, and spiritualizing, as the divine Angel adopts a temporary form akin to the Incarnation\. The Angel, being divine, is uncreated and assumed form for a moment\.

__The Patriarch Abraham\. __

__The Principle of Election\. __Election serves a particular means to a universal end, as seen with Melchizedek\. The scriptural promise "shall be blessed" suggests a more universalistic blessing during this period compared to the Mosaic\. However, election continues to apply on an individual level, transcending nationality\. __Objectivity of the Gifts Bestowed\. __God's promises to Abraham were not contingent on Abraham's actions but on what God would do for him, including establishing a great nation and blessing for all peoples\. __Supernatural Fulfillment of Promises\. __The promises were fulfilled monergistically and supernaturally, evident in miracles like Isaac's birth and Abraham's refusal of spoils from Sodom's king\. __Divine Name 'El\-Shaddai\.' __Vos prefers the interpretation of 'El\-Shaddai' as "the All\-powerful One," signifying God's might\. __Faith in Patriarchal Religion\. __Patriarchal faith involves dependence on God and engagement with a higher spiritual realm\. Abraham's faith was tested repeatedly, requiring blind trust in God's promises, culminating in a shift from fear and awe to faith and desire for more faith\. __Ethical Elements\. __While Abraham's life was imperfect, virtues like hospitality, magnanimity, and self\-sacrifice were emphasized\. Ethics and religion are intertwined, illustrated by circumcision, symbolizing purification—a requirement for propagation—highlighting sin as inherent to human nature\.

__The Patriarch Isaac\.__

Isaac's life contrasts with Abraham's, with repetitions of events showing redemption's stages: energetic beginnings, a passive middle stage of suffering and self\-surrender, and a transformative end\. Isaac's sacrificial role links to the sacrificial cult in Jerusalem\. 

__The Patriarch Jacob\. __

__Principle of Subjective Transformation\.__ Jacob's life illustrates the principle of subjective transformation, with election underscoring the application of redemption\. God's election before Jacob and Esau's births, alongside Isaac and Ishmael's stories, reflects divine monergism\. __Bethel Dream\-Vision\. __Jacob's vision at Bethel, while away from the promised land, reveals God's omnipresence and assurance\. Angels symbolically convey Jacob's needs to God and God's grace to Jacob, signifying divine interaction beyond geographical confines\. __Wrestling at Pniel\. __Jacob's mysterious wrestling with a divine figure, often seen as mythical, involves both physical and spiritual elements\. The encounter, resulting in a name change to Israel, signifies Jacob's transformation—subjective and personal, contrasting with Abraham's more external transformation\.

__8\. Revelation in the Period of Moses\.__

__A\. The Place of Moses in Old Testament Revelation\. __

Some modern critics, like Wellhausen, argue that the Pentateuch was a later creation, with Moses only laying a foundation for future monotheism rather than establishing it\. Vos challenges this, asserting that Moses occupied a central role in Israel's religious consciousness\. He is credited with organizing Israel into a great nation, fulfilling patriarchal promises, and occupying a unique, foundational position as a prophet, priest, and king, thus being central to Old Testament redemption narratives\.

__B\. The Form of Revelation in the Mosaic Period\.__

God's interaction with Moses was unique, manifested through visible and direct engagement—speaking face\-to\-face\. Revelation in this period involved four key elements: the pillar of cloud and fire, the Angel of Jehovah, the Name of Jehovah, and the Face of Jehovah\. These elements underscored God's permanent presence and leadership among His people\.

__C\. The Content of the Mosaic Revelation\.__

__1\. Factual Basis: Redemption from Egypt\. __The Exodus parallels New Testament redemption, rooting Jewish religious identity in God's past acts\. It symbolizes deliverance from foreign bondage and sin, with Pharaoh's hardening representing a judicial process and highlighting religious conflict against Egyptian gods\. The Exodus showcased divine omnipotence and sovereign grace\. The Passover symbolized divine protection and featured elements of sacrificial expiation, pointing towards deeper spiritual truths\. __2\. The Berith Between Jehovah and Israel\. __The covenant at Sinai marked a voluntary acceptance by Israel, involving sacrificial purification and partaking in a communal meal\. Through this covenant, Jehovah became known as 'the God of Israel' in a transformative way\. __3\. The Theocratic Organization of Israel\. __Jehovah as King meant Israel was not to become a purely human kingdom\. Israel's purpose was to exemplify true religion amid paganism\. The law served as a pedagogue, leading the people to recognize and retain divine grace\. Its observance was essential for maintaining inherited blessings\. __4\. The Decalogue\. __The Ten Commandments excluded ceremonial laws, linking the divine act of redemption with holiness and God's will\. Contrary to Wellhausen's critics, who suggested later prophetic origins, the Decalogue is a product of divine revelation, universally relevant and religious in character\. The commandments emphasize a spiritual relationship, with the initial commandments directing human relationships with God and the latter dealing with ethical behavior among humans\.__ 5\. The Ritual \(Ceremonial\) Law\. __The ritual law involved symbols and types pointing beyond themselves to spiritual realities and future fulfillment in Christ\. The tabernacle served both symbolically and typically, representing God's dwelling among Israel and foreshadowing Christ and the church\. The sacrificial system included various offerings, each symbolic of different aspects of atonement and consecration\. Vicariousness was central, where sacrifices stood as substitutes, symbolically representing the offerer's state and obligations\. Rituals signified a process of purification, emphasizing divine holiness and human sinfulness\. Uncleanness and purification rituals signified the need for holiness, integral to one's relationship with God\. Attempts to relate uncleanness to totemism or ancestor\-worship do not hold, as they fail to comprehensively address the ritual and spiritual significance\. Instead, uncleanness associated with sin serves to teach about ethical impurity through the language and practice of ritual law\.

__Part Two: The Prophetic Epoch of Revelation__

__1\. The Place of Prophetism in Old Testament Revelation\.__

Prophetism represents a significant epoch following Mosaism in the Old Testament\. Whereas revelation generally follows historic events, not all occurrences gave rise to substantial revelations\. The establishment of a kingdom was one such critical event, serving as a means of redemption and an expression of Israel's blessed state, with Messianic expectations tied closely to it\. __A Kingdom\-Producing Movement\. __Prophets served as guardians of the evolving theocracy, particularly centered around the kingdom, ensuring it faithfully represented the kingdom of Yahweh\. In this context, religious concerns outweighed patriotic ones\. Prophets like Nathan, Gad, Elijah, and Elisha worked within the framework of kingship, with Elisha actively resisting the Omri dynasty to abolish Baal worship\. Their primary focus was not on enhancing the political state but maintaining the religious integrity of the kingdom\. __The World as the Instrument of Prophetism\. __Prophets did not create events but upheld enduring principles\. They were not selected for their inherent righteousness but became notably pious through their prophetic calling\. __A Factor of Continuity\. __

Prophets played a dual role: retrospectively, by preaching repentance, addressing sin, and reiterating past laws; and prospectively, by predicting future events\. __Two Main Periods of Prophetism\. __1\) From Samuel to the first writing prophets in the mid\-8th century BC, offering the possibility for repentance and conversion in response to prophetic messages\. 2\) From the first writing of prophets until the close of the Old Testament, wherein calls to repentance continued, yet impending judgment was seen as inevitable\.

__2\. The Conception of a Prophet: Names and Etymologies\.__

__*Nabhi\. *__The Hebrew term "Nabhi" includes meanings such as "gush forth," "bubbling," and "announcing," all linked to proclaiming through the Spirit\. It also relates to calling or announcing, as evident in the Assyrian word "nabu\." In the pre\-Mosaic Hebrew understanding, a nabhi' was considered an authorized spokesman for the Deity, with words carrying divine power\. While the nabhi' actively spoke, this role required passive reception from God\. __*Prophetes\. *__The Greek term "Prophetes" means "forth\-teller," referring to one who conveys the oracle's message, emphasizing verbatim inspiration\. This differs from the Hebrew concept of nabhi' and pagan practices\. The Terms __*Ro'eh*__ and __*Chozeh\. *__The terms "Ro'eh" and "Chozeh" translate to "seer," capturing the visionary aspect of a prophet's role\.

__3\. The History of Prophetism: Critical Theories\.__

__The History of Prophetism\. __Starting from the time of Moses, prophets became the primary mode of divine revelation\. This new epoch, termed the Prophetic one, was more public and closely connected to the theocratic kingdom, although prophets remained independent and often opposed the kingdom in cases of apostasy\. During this period, the number of prophets increased\. Vos notes that the distinction between individual and group prophets should not be drawn too sharply, as both faced corruption, leading to the rise of false prophets within both groups\. __The Origin of 'Nabhi'\-ism in Israel\. __Several hypotheses exist about the origin of Nabhi'ism in Israel\. One suggests a Canaanite derivation, noting that "nabhi" lacks a clear Hebrew etymology; however, the absence of etymology is neither unique nor significant\. Some point to similarities between prophetic phenomena and the orgiastic nature of Canaanite worship, yet these comparisons aren't homogeneous\. Additionally, the close contacts between Israelites and Canaanites coincide with these phenomena, potentially serving as either a supporting or contradictory argument\. The purification of prophetic practice over time is sometimes attributed to its foreign origin\. __Did the Later Prophets Create Ethical Monotheism? __Critics claim that a shift to ethical monotheism by later prophets involved developing an ethical conception of Jehovah, which led to monotheism\. This purportedly resolved the transition from a seemingly ethically indifferent origin to a later ethicizing conception of God\. Critics posit a shift between prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who are seen as more nationalistic, and those like Amos and Hosea, who emphasized hyper\-ethicism and spiritualism, distancing themselves from ritual sacrifices\.

__4\. The Mode of Reception of the Prophetic Revelation\.__

__The Mode of Reception\. __Three problems present challenges to understanding prophetic revelation: 1\) the psychological conviction of prophets in their divine message, 2\) the continuity of prophetic supernatural claims over centuries, and 3\) the remarkable and predictive nature of these messages aiming for a distant consummation\. __The Views of Kuenen Examined\. __Kuenen suggested prophets may have been mistaken about the divine source of their messages, as some predictions did not or will not come to pass, believing this helped convey truth to people\. Vos argues against this view, noting that such refutations of false prophets would be inconsistent\. Further, the argument of non\-fulfillment is a separate matter\. __'Kernel\-Revelation\.' __This theory posits that God imparted an essential kernel of truth to prophets, who then expanded it by reflection, but this is not aligned with the prophetic understanding of direct divine communication\. __The 'Divination' Theory\. __While some associate prophecy with mysterious knowledge akin to magic, the Old Testament clearly condemns this type of prophecy\. __Revelation Through Speech and Hearing\. __Prophetic communication from God includes three main expressions: "amar YHWH," "dibber YHWH," and "ne'um YHWH\." These indicate that God speaks literally, often at specific points in time and place, contrasting with dumb idols\. This communication is external and objective, and Vos notes that in public, prophets would vocalize God's messages, with both inward and outward modes being valid\. __Revelation Through Showing and Seeing\. __Visions, common in ancient times, eventually became synonymous with any form of revelation, emphasizing visual communication from God\. __Revelation Through Rapture\. __Various possibilities exist regarding rapture, though Scripture withholds details\. Paul, in 2 Corinthians 12, discusses his own such experience\. __The Intra\-Mental State\. __The prophetic experience involved interaction between body and spirit, and not necessarily deep sleep or ecstasy, which Philo and others associated with insanity\. In 1 Samuel 9:9, "nabhi'" and "ro'eh" are shown to have been synonymous at certain points\.  __Extreme Critical Views Answered\. __Some critics attempt to reduce prophetic phenomena to neurological pathologies or cast visions as mere literary devices, but these views do not align with the traditional understanding of divine revelation in the Old Testament\.

__5\. The Mode of Communication of the Prophecy \(Speech or Miracles\)\.__

__6\. The Content of the Prophetic Revelation__

__A\. The Nature and Attributes of Yahweh\. __Monotheism in prophetic literature is characterized by a strong opposition to idols, equating them with false deities\. Prophets criticized the worship of Yahweh images where they promoted false representations of Yahweh\. Unlimited power is consistently ascribed to Yahweh, with no recognized divine rivalries, establishing a monotheistic worldview\. The prophets described God's nature by emphasizing attributes of *spirit*, which conveyed divine energy, as opposed to flesh symbolizing human inertia\. While *omnipotence* as a term isn't present in the Old Testament, it is vividly illustrated through Amos and Isaiah using creation imagery, like forming mountains and controlling celestial bodies\. The name "Yahweh of hosts" embodies the concept of God as the sovereign ruler of super\-human spirits more than any other interpretations, strengthening the perception of divine omnipotence\. Yahweh's *omniscience* arises from His eternal and omnipresent nature\. *Holiness* is interpreted as ascribed to everything divine, connected to omnipotence and purity\. *Righteousness* encompasses cognizance, retribution, vindication, salvation, and benevolence\. These attributes underscore Yahweh's majestic separation from creation\. Expressions of emotions in Yahweh, often viewed as anthropomorphisms, serve to convey deep theological truths\.

__B\. The Bond between Yahweh and Israel\. __The covenant, or *berith*, is central, emphasizing a sacred bond built on Yahweh's nature and will\. Hosea's marriage metaphor illustrates this bond's divine origination, historical beginning at the Exodus, and voluntary acceptance by Israel\. Although divinely initiated, the covenant is legally established and nationally relevant, according to Hosea\.

__C\. The Rupture of the Bond: The Sin of Israel\. __Prophets predict but don't view the rupture with Israel as irreparable\. They focus on concrete sins against God, highlighting collective national sin\. This includes the condemnation of social classes and a dual class struggle between oppressors and the righteous\. Despite the identification of sin, solidarity in judgment remains\. The prophets condemning ritual corruption stress not a principle against ritual, but the materialistic and mercantile spirit in worship practices\. Prophets like Hosea view sin through religious infidelity analogous to marital unfaithfulness, marked by reliance on wealth and political power\. Isaiah emphasizes God's glory and identifies sins like divination and idolatry as affronts to divine majesty\. These actions are seen as unholiness and impediments to true religious experience\.

__D\. The Judgment and the Restoration: Prophetic Eschatology\. __The critical view proposes that eschatology arose as a prophetic creation associated with ethical monotheism\. This view places more emphasis on ethical monotheism, often minimizing eschatological aspects, seeing the latter as later redactions influenced by mythologies\. Prophetic eschatology asserts that judgment is immediately succeeded by visions of glory—such as Hosea's view of judgment as both wrath and disciplinary love leading to restoration\. __Isaiah's eschatology__ is deeply theocentric, framing judgment as a process of purification culminating in divine glory\. This includes the concept of the "day of Yahweh," with Babylonian captivity seen as atonement, paralleling the Servant of Yahweh in Isaiah 53\. "Latter days" in Hosea speak to an indissoluble union and unification of Israel and Judah following a final crisis\. Isaiah's vision of future glory centers on the sanctuary and city upheld by a personal, sacramental Messiah, reflecting an uninterrupted divine presence with His people\. Isaianic eschatology envisions a restored paradise, a departure from continuous cyclical histories patterned by other prophetic narratives\.

__The New Testament\.__

__1\. The Structure of New Testament Revelation\. __

*Old Testament* scriptures anticipate a future new covenant, as seen in passages like Jeremiah 31:31\-34, which foretell obedience through the law written on hearts and the complete forgiveness of sins\. *Jesus* builds upon these anticipations with teachings such as "my blood of the covenant" and "the new covenant in my blood," marking his death as the inauguration of a new relationship with God\. This relationship is eschatological, looking forward to the Kingdom of God\. His teachings represent not a new revelation but a continuation of progressive revelation\. *Paul and other Apostles* echo the concept of the "new covenant" contrasted with the "old covenant\." This theme is explicitly addressed in the book of Hebrews, which speaks to the transitional nature of this covenant\. __The New Dispensation is Final\.  __According to Hebrews 1:1\-2 and teachings by Paul, the arrival of Christ marks the fullness of time, and Hebrews 13:20 describes it as the eternal diatheke, signaling Christ as the ultimate consummator\. There is a distinction between direct revelation through Christ and the revelation mediated by Christ through the Apostolate\. These elements are seen as interconnected, serving as both prelude and overture to the new dispensation\. __Is a Further Revelation to Be Expected? __Further revelation is considered only in the event of new cosmic events that require divine interpretation\. A third epoch, the Eschaton, is yet anticipated, but it is understood as part of the New Testament's revelatory structure, fulfilling and consummating the existing revelation, with the first group belonging to the Mosaic epoch\.

__2\. Revelation Connected with the Nativity\.__

The sequence of events suggests that events usually precede their interpretations\. Vos prefers the term "nativity" over "incarnation" as it aligns with prophecy advancing to fulfillment in history \(horizontal movement\), whereas "incarnation" depicts the descent of the pre\-existent Christ from heaven to earth \(vertical movement\)\. These perspectives are not mutually exclusive\. __Aspects of the Nativity\. __The nativity involves several annunciations and prophecies, reflecting:

1. A close connection to the Old Testament, beginning with the patriarchs' speech and linking Hannah's song with Mary's\.
2. An effort to integrate new developments within the Old Testament's framework, emphasizing Jesus' lineage from the house of David, prophecies, and the fulfillment of promises to Abraham\.
3. A new redemptive focus as highlighted in Mary's song\.
4. An absence of political elements\.
5. An absence of Jewish legalism\.
6. A combination of theophany \(divine appearance\) and the coming of the Messiah\.
7. Universalism, as reflected in Simeon's song\.
8. A supernatural birth without human paternity, explained through three lenses: sinlessness due to the absence of a human father, identification as the "Son of God," and the supernatural origin influencing the whole Person of Christ\.

__3\. Revelation Connected with John the Baptist\.__

The Gospels position John the Baptist as distinct and subservient to Jesus, though some interpretations overly separate them\. __Matthew 11:2\-19\. __John questions Jesus' identity, with Jesus affirming John's role as a way\-preparing messenger, linking him to the Old Testament prophetic tradition without placing him in the epoch of consummation\. __Connection to Elijah\. __John, a life\-long Nazirite, was sometimes confused with Elijah due to their parallels within Old Testament traditions\. __Testimony to Jesus\. __John's testimony unfolds in two stages\. Initially, he *emphasizes judgment* and the coming Judge through baptism, a unique act symbolizing future forgiveness\. In *baptizing Jesus*, John acknowledges Jesus' superiority and fulfills "all righteousness" as Jesus identifies with Israel\. __Descent of the Spirit\. __The Spirit's descent during Jesus' baptism does not "awaken" messianic consciousness but serves as sacramental assurance\. The event underscores the Spirit's role in Jesus' mission, enhancing his human nature for the Messianic task\. __Post\-Baptismal Testimony\. __John's subsequent testimony elevates Jesus as the Lamb of God and the Son of God, referencing Isaiah's Servant\. Whether John the Baptist or John the Evangelist is speaking, John 3:27\-36 affirms Jesus' divine and eternal origin, underscoring his supernatural connection with God\.

__4\. Revelation in the Probation of Jesus\.__

__The Temptation in the Wilderness\. __The temptation of Jesus in the wilderness is a single definite event that is both historically objective and corporeal\. According to Vos, Matthew 12:29 illustrates that Jesus conquered Satan to later drive out demons, accomplishing this by the Spirit of God, which Jesus received just before his probation\. From Satan's perspective, this was a temptation, while from God's perspective, it was a probation\. __The Lord's Temptation and Our Own\. __Romans 5:15 connects Jesus' probation to his humiliation and atoning work, circumstances not applicable to us since our humiliation is a consequence of sin\. Hebrews 5:7\-9 highlights that Jesus was "tempted like us but without sin\." __The Specific Form Assumed by Our Lord's Probation\. __The initial two temptations are linked to Jesus' messianic consciousness, each beginning with "If you are the Son of God\." The third temptation pertains to idolatry\. During his humiliation, Jesus demonstrated obedience as a man while maintaining divine sovereignty\. __The Lord's Temptations Interpreted\. __In interpretations found in "lives of Jesus" literature, the three temptations counter selfish exploitation, ambition, and thirst for glory\. __Responses by Jesus\. __Jesus' responses to temptation are rooted in Deuteronomy\. 1\) Deuteronomy 8:3 emphasizes spiritual nourishment over physical\. 2\) Deuteronomy 6:16 warns against testing God, equating it with unbelief\. 3\) Deuteronomy 6:13 condemns idolatry, with Vos noting that Satan tempted Jesus through attractive offers appealing to his instinct for obedience and service\. __Temptation and Peccability\. __The question of how Jesus could be tempted is addressed as temptation arises when alternatives are presented for decision\-making\. Vos acknowledges the mystery in Jesus being both innocent and divine, suggesting intemptability\. Yet, having a true human nature means he was susceptible to temptation despite not sinning\.

__5\. The Revelation of Jesus' Public Ministry\.__

__A\. The Various Aspects of Christ's Revealing Function\. Four Divisions of Revelation by Christ\. __Christ's revelation is structured into four divisions: general revelation, revelation from the entrance of sin leading to the incarnation, God's disclosure during Jesus' public ministry, and revelation mediated through chosen servants\. This structure is evident in the Gospels, as seen in John's prologue\. __Jesus' Revealing Work in the Gospels\. __Jesus' ministry involved two modes of revelation that are intertwined rather than entirely separate: the revelation through his nature and character, as well as through his speech and words\.

__B\. The Question of Development\. __There is consideration of development in Jesus' teachings\. Subjectively, His human side could undergo psychical and ethical\-religious development while still maintaining continuity\. Objectively, His teachings developed, but this is not from error to truth; it reflects unfolding complexity within inherent truth\. 

__C\. The Method of Jesus' Teaching\. __Jesus’ teaching lacked systematic or doctrinal cohesion, as He did not define subjects explicitly\. He frequently relied on similitudes, such as similes \("Herod is like a fox"\) and metaphors \("go and tell that fox"\), to convey deeper meaning\. His parables, unlike pagan parables, used similitudes in story form without using animals, representing singular events\. Compared to parables, allegorical methods place detailed comparisons side by side and are considered rhetorically lower by Vos due to their forced comparisons\. __The Philosophy of the Parabolic Teaching\. __Parables serve to vividly render truth, intercept prejudice, and veil truth to prevent it from becoming clear to those who are deemed unworthy\. __True and Truth in the Fourth Gospel\. __In the Fourth Gospel, "true" translates to "alethinos" rather than the ordinary "alethees," emphasizing heavenly trueness rather than common truth\. Truth relates to the sense of heavenly reality and intrinsic nature\. 

__D\. Jesus' Attitude Toward the Scriptures of the Old Testament\. __Jesus regarded the Old Testament as divinely directed and inspired, culminating in Himself\. Without His presence and mission, the Old Testament would lose its significance\. His teachings and discourse derive heavily from Scripture, often through allusions rather than explicit quotations\. Jesus treated Scripture as a rule of faith and practice, affirming its divine, unbreakable nature, and used it to authenticate His Messianic role by showing fulfillment of prophecy\.

__E\. Jesus' Doctrine of God\. __Jesus did not bring forth a new doctrine of God but believed in the divine origin of the Old Testament and acknowledged the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as His God\. Critics argue the Old Testament views Fatherhood mainly in terms of Yahweh's actions rather than inherent nature, applied collectively to Israel, and place it in contrast with other attributes\. However, Vos counters that exceptions exist, such as in Exodus 34:6\-7\. Jesus' conception of Fatherhood includes both collective and individual relationships, focusing on adoption and sonship within the Kingdom, which extends beyond just Israel to all disciples\. __Jesus's Stress on the Divine Majesty and Greatness\. __Jesus emphasized both God's benevolence and transcendence, balancing love and majesty without conflating them\. __The Retributive Righteousness of God\. __Retributive righteousness is another aspect of God's nature, which is not incompatible with love and majesty\. Vos notes that eternal punishment cannot be viewed as an expression of love, yet love and righteousness are not mutually exclusive\.

__F\. Jesus' Teaching on the Kingdom of God\.__

__1\. The Formal Questions\.__

__The Kingdom in the Old Testament:__ The Kingdom of God is pivotal, first heralded by John the Baptist and Jesus, though sparingly mentioned in John's gospel\. In the Old Testament, two notions are apparent: God's rule through creation and providence, and the redemptive theocracy\. This encompasses an eschatological hope for Kingdom\-appearance and the persistent theocratic kingdom of Israel, although its visibility waned to such an extent that the New Testament's Kingdom is seen as new\. Messianic prophecy also alludes to this Kingdom\. __The Kingdom in the Gospels:__ The terms "Kingdom of God" or "Heaven" emphasize varying aspects—royal rule, territory, subjects, and rights\. While the Old Testament presents this abstractly, the New Testament conveys it more concretely—something to be entered, received, or inherited\. Matthew uses both "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Kingdom of God" interchangeably, with similar frameworks seen across several epistles\. Matthew's use of "Kingdom of Heaven" likely stems from Jewish custom avoiding the direct mention of God, preferring "heaven\." __Modern Theories of "The Kingdom:"__ Various modern theories deviate from classical views, often denying its present gradual aspect and focusing solely on its future catastrophic realization, arguing that Jesus expected it to occur in his era\. Vos critiques these theories as undermining Jesus' reliability by reducing his teaching to external\-eschatological matters\. The transition from present\-spiritual to future\-eschatological is non\-linear, emphasizing intervention and catastrophe\. Jesus incorporates both present\-spiritual and future\-eschatological aspects\. The present Kingdom grows gradually, largely internal and invisible, whereas the final Kingdom will manifest worldwide and visibly, devoid of imperfections\.

__2\. The Essence of the Kingdom\.__

__The Kingdom of God:__ The phrase emphasizes its theocentric nature, indicating the actual exercise of divine supremacy and divine influence for God's glory\. Recognized by the phrase "thine is the power," this Kingdom power is associated with the Spirit\. __Faith as Related to the Kingdom's Power:__ Faith, as depicted in John, is a response to the tangible reality of miracles and signifies belief in and trust in the Kingdom's divine action, closely linked with knowledge\. In John's gospel, faith aligns uniquely with Jesus as divine and is seen as a continuous relationship with the glorified Jesus amid an interrelation of faith and knowledge\. It clearly addresses the roots of unbelief while discussing sources of faith\. __Divine Supremacy in the Sphere of Righteousness:__ Righteousness, as a component of Kingdom supremacy, reflects agreement with God and entails being righteous as a cause of the Kingdom\. Jesus critiques Jewish externalism, fragmented law interpretation, negativism, self\-righteousness, and hypocrisy\. Repentance represents turning entirely towards God and entails a comprehensive realignment of life, stressing a God\-centric perspective\. __Divine Supremacy in the Sphere of Blessedness:__ The final Kingdom order embodies perfection and features salvation, sonship, and life\. __Kingdom and Church:__ The Church and Kingdom of God are not separate entities, as stated in Matthews 16:18\-20\. The Church exists as more than an instrument for missions, encompassing broader roles and purposes\. It symbolizes consummation and activity while seeking fruition both now and in the eschatological context, signifying its identity as more than a goal\. The Church's inclusion in the eschatological order affirms its existence as an end in itself\.
