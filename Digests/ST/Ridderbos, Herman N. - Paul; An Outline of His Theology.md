__Paul: An Outline of his Theology – Herman Ridderbos__

__1\. Main Lines in the History of Interpretation\.  __

__1\.1 Introduction\. __The principal entry point into the vast structure of Paul's theology has traditionally been viewed through the lens of justification by faith, as emphasized in Reformation theology, notably by Luther\. Over time, the focus shifted from questions of salvation history to those concerning the order of salvation, bringing the individual's role to the forefront due to influences from Pietism, mysticism, and moralism\. The Enlightenment gave rise to various portraits of Paul: the Hegelian, liberal, mystical, and existentialist versions\.

__1\.2 F\.C\. Baur and the Tübingen School\. __Baur attempted to explain the history of Christianity using Hegelian philosophy, interpreting Paul's dichotomy between Spirit and flesh as a conflict between the infinite and the finite\. Paul is seen as increasingly opposing Judaism to champion a universal Christian faith free from law\. Baur accepted only the four major Pauline epistles \(Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians\) as authentic, viewing others as written under unionist influences of a later period\.

__1\.3 Liberal Interpretation and Its Decline\. __Alongside the juridical\-forensic line, an ethical line emerged that Paul supposedly derived from Greek\-Hellenistic thought\. Here, 'Spirit' contrasts with sensuality rather than the human\. This ethical perspective, also applied to Jesus' teachings, dominated assessments of Paul's theology\. Paul's conversion was seen as crucial, breaking away from Jewish thought patterns\. The goal of liberal theology was to render Paul's theology independent of salvific events, seeking an ethical\-rational religiosity\. H\.J\. Holtzmann and W\. Wrede were notable figures, with Wrede emphasizing the importance of salvation history in Paul's preaching\.

__1\.4 Religio\-Historical Approach\. __This approach examined the religious syncretism of the time, focusing on Eastern religiosity and mystery religions, which lacked fixed doctrinal systems\. The connection between Paul and mystery religions was sought in sacramental actions\. W\. Bousset posited that Paul's Christ\-preaching was a mystical reinterpretation of the "eschatological" Christ of the early community\. The rational\-ethical Christ figure gave way to a more emotional interpretation\. R\. Reitzenstein saw a strong immediate influence of Gnostic Hellenism on Paul, a view now largely abandoned\.

__1\.5 Eschatological Interpretation\. __Albert Schweitzer is significant here, seeing Paul’s mysticism as centered on the eschatological preaching of Jesus concerning the nearness of God's Kingdom\. Schweitzer proposed that Paul envisioned a messianic kingdom preceding the full revelation of God's Kingdom, initiated by Christ's resurrection\. Schweitzer sought to unify Jesus' and Paul's teachings while focusing on the salvation history aspect of Paul's message rather than a Greek\-dualistic interpretation\. Despite some critique associating Schweitzer's views more with 19th\-century theology, his contribution remains valuable\.

__1\.6 Continuing Developments\. __The liberal view has had minimal impact on ongoing research, whereas the religio\-historical approach, notably through R\. Bultmann, has maintained significant influence\. Bultmann viewed Paul's worldview as heavily influenced by Gnostic themes, like the dichotomy between flesh and Spirit\. Recent studies have revived interest in Paul's Jewish background, emphasizing themes such as the struggle between light and darkness and justification by sheer grace, all crucial to understanding Paul's eschatological message\.

__2\. Foundational Structures\.__

__2\.1 The Fullness of Time: Revelation of the Mystery\. __In examining Paul's theology, caution is needed to avoid absolutizing certain aspects\. The essence of Paul's message can be summarized in the proclamation and explanation of the eschatological age inaugurated with Christ's advent, death, and resurrection\. The "fullness of time" does not merely represent a maturing of events within salvation history but signifies the ultimate fulfillment of time\. With Christ's arrival, the world's time has reached its conclusion\. In this context, being "in Christ" means becoming a new creation, participating in God's new world\. Paul also describes the "revelation of the mystery," previously hidden but now disclosed, as the unfolding of God's salvific plan in history\.

__2\.2 The Mystery of Christ: Eschatology and Christology\. __Paul’s eschatology is fundamentally centered on Christology\. His gospel is repeatedly referred to as the gospel of Christ, emphasizing the salvific events surrounding Christ\. Paul's eschatology is theocentric, interlinking past, present, and future under God's sovereignty\. Despite apparent alignment with Jewish eschatology, Paul's theology is independent due to God's decisive action in Christ\. This independent character causes tension between fulfillment and expectation, with Paul acknowledging both the current world and the forthcoming one without providing a specific eschatological timeline\. 

__2\.3 Firstborn from the Dead: The Last Adam\. __Paul emphasizes apostolic tradition, notably Christ's death, burial, and resurrection\. The eschatological significance of Christ's resurrection is illuminated by His unique death, signaling the breakthrough of a new aeon\. Paul regards Christ as the Firstborn, indicating rank rather than order, representing a pioneer entering the realm of resurrection\. Christ is contrasted with Adam, symbolizing two realms: life and death\. As Adam initiated human mortality, Christ inaugurates life, making a transformative impact on the aeons\.

__2\.4 In Christ, With Christ: The Old and New Self\. __A critical issue is how what occurred in Christ applies to others\. Paul asserts that Christ performed His salvific work on behalf of others, creating unity so profound that believers are "in Him\." This language is not mystical but describes an enduring reality influencing the Christian life\. Shared participation with Christ in death and resurrection signifies a collective transformation, where those "in Christ" emerge as part of a new reality, contrasted to being "in Adam\."

__2\.5 Revealed in the Flesh: Flesh and Spirit\. __Paul does not dwell on specifics of Jesus' earthly life but often refers to his existence "in the flesh," highlighting human frailty\. The vital juncture is Christ's death, altering perceptions and transferring believers from one aeon to another\. The Spirit's dominion begins as the flesh's sole reign concludes, connecting the Holy Spirit to creation and renewal\.

__2\.6 Christ as the Son of God and Image of God\. __The confession of Christ as the Son of God extends beyond history, integral to his Christology\. God's sending of the Son presupposes, rather than creates, Sonship\. Christ's depiction as the Image of God intertwines His identity with divine glory\. This aligns with Genesis's description of humanity made in God's image, affirming Christ as the divine and human paradigm who enacted salvation history\.

__2\.7 Firstborn of All Creation\. __Paul's Christology encompasses cosmic dimensions, portrayed as the Head of all creation\. Descriptions of Christ as the Image of the invisible God and Firstborn highlight his unique intermediate role, applying Adamic categories to both eschatology and protology\. Christ serves as the Head of the church and all things, reinforcing his supremacy throughout creation\.

__2\.8 Christ the Exalted and Coming Lord\. __Post\-resurrection, Christ ascended to heaven, seated at God's right hand, awaiting His return\. Contrary to some interpretations linking this to mystical experiences, it is fundamentally eschatological\. The Holy Spirit facilitates communion between the exalted Christ and the church, further emphasizing Christ’s pivotal role over cosmic powers\.

__3\. Life in Sin\.__

__\(a\) Sin as a Manner of Existence\. __

__3\.1 The Present World: Aeon and Kosmos\. __In Paul's theology, "world" refers to the totality of life outside Christ, governed by sin, and is a realm of demonic forces\. While the concept does not suggest a dualism between God and the world—since everything is created and subordinate to God—it highlights sin's dominance in defining "world\." Paul encourages the Colossians to live apart from the 'kosmos'\.

__3\.2 The Universality of Sin: Flesh and Adam\. __Paul states that all have sinned, emphasizing humanity's universal fallen state\. He uses "flesh" to signify human weakness and sinfulness\. Romans 5 parallels Adam and Christ, describing how sin entered through Adam, implicating everyone, and highlighting that the structures of Paul’s theology are corporate, not individualistic\. Sin's universality is not just a collection of individual acts, nor is responsibility divided among individuals\.

__3\.3 The Nature of Sin: Anthropological or Theological\. __Some have argued for a dualistic view in Paul's anthropology, though this is less accepted today\. Paul does not support the notion of a God\-created evil inclination\. Sin is introduced by human action\. Bultmann's interpretation sees "flesh" as a total human reality, visible and tangible, opposing the life in the Spirit\. Sin is rebellion and self\-deification, expressed through disobedience to the law, particularly the Decalogue\. Even Gentiles possess some innate knowledge of the law, demonstrating God's will written in human hearts\.

__\(b\) The Consequences of Sin\.__

__3\.4 The Wrath of God\. __Sin's consequences manifest not as fate but as the wrath of God, an active divine response\. This wrath emerges from God's righteousness and holiness, emphasizing eschatological consequences\. Paul presents God's wrath as a disturbance of relationship, absence of divine fellowship, and incites warning about its inevitable arrival unless averted\. 

__3\.5 Human Corruption\. __Paul presents varied anthropological terms: internal corruption \(noes, heart\) which extends to external actions \(body, members\)\. "Body" and "flesh" often point to human weakness and finitude, but also the whole person\. The term "noes" is central, combining thought and disposition, influencing the capacity to respond to God's revelation\. Sin degrades both intellect and will, leading to a divergence from God\. 

__3\.6 Romans 7 in Pauline Anthropology\. __Romans 7 addresses whether Paul describes a Christian's struggle or a pre\-Christian's incapacity\. Ridderbos opts for the latter, arguing the passage reflects humanity's powerlessness outside of Christ, encapsulating the human plight and the supremacy of sin\. The passage depicts the moral standstill of being bound under the law, underscoring the necessity for a moral force beyond oneself\.

__\(c\) Sin and the Law\. __

__3\.7 The Antithesis with Judaism\. __For Paul, the law offers no liberation from sin’s domain, further entangling humanity in sin's grip\. Paul points to the absolute inadequacy of the law as a means of salvation while affirming the law’s divine origin\. The Jewish perspective viewed the law as a means of earning righteousness, a notion Paul firmly challenges\.

__3\.8 No Righteousness from the Law: "Glory" and "Offense\." __Paul asserts the law’s insufficiency as a means of righteousness and its ineffectiveness against sin\. He critiques Jewish pride in the law and circumcision, which fail to yield righteousness or life\. Paul argues genuine righteousness comes through faith, positioning Christ as a stumbling block \("skandalon"\) for Jews\.

__3\.9 The Law's Powerlessness: Slavery to the Law\. __The law cannot grant righteousness or conquer sin, awakening sin instead\. This reciprocal relationship between sin and law frames Paul's argument in Romans\. The law fails once sin masters the person, echoing themes of captivity\. Describing this dynamic, Paul likens adherence to the law to imprisonment, noting its ineffectiveness under sin's regime\.

__3\.10 The Law as Tutor to Christ\. __Paul distinguishes the law's role as a tutor \(Galatians 3:14\-25\), highlighting its service to God's promises and purpose despite its limitations\. It was given to increase transgressions, serving as a prelude to faith in Christ and the justification it brings when faith is revealed\.

__3\.11 Paul, Judaism, and the Old Testament\. __Paul’s perspective doesn’t distance the positive intentions of the law within Old Testament context\. He views righteousness as grace, not attainable by works\. The Judaic adherence to law is depicted as inadequate, while grace, exemplified by Abraham, is foundational\. Paul’s critique is rooted in Jewish tradition, showing how law alone cannot produce righteousness without grace, and condemning external religious forms, aligning closely with Old Testament prophetic critiques\.

__4\. The Revelation of God's Righteousness\.__

__4\.1 Introduction\. __In Paul's theology of salvation, key concepts like justification and reconciliation describe the new relationship God creates with humanity through Christ\. These ideas are rooted in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan for both individuals and the world, captured in the revelation of previously hidden mysteries\. While justification is a common starting point, other scholars place emphasis on reconciliation or faith as foundational\.

__4\.2 The Eschatological Character\.__ Paul frequently discusses the revelation of God's righteousness, not as a new doctrine or experience, but as the actualization of God's plan in the fullness of time\. This righteousness is understood not as a divine attribute but as the human capacity to stand justified before God’s judgment, a forensic category opposite to condemnation\. While Judaism viewed righteousness eschatologically, as future, Paul proclaims it as already realized in Christ, though he acknowledges its future significance as well\.

__4\.3 Righteousness in Christ\. __Christ embodies the revelation of God's righteousness, particularly through his death and resurrection, which serve as a judicial event judging sin and unveiling divine judgment in the present era\. The concepts of "Christ\-for\-us" and "we\-in\-Christ" are inseparable; Christ’s representative death unites with the communal aspect of salvation\. As in Adam, Christ’s role is corporate and redemptive\. 

__4\.4 Righteousness through Faith, Apart from the Law\. __In Romans 1:17, God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, a departure from Jewish law\-based righteousness\. While Jewish practice emphasized law fulfillment and its associated merit, Paul insists righteousness is entirely a matter of faith \(sola fide\)\. Faith transcends works and law, synonymous with grace, representing a new existence in Christ\.

__4\.5 Justification of the Ungodly: Imputation\. __Romans 4:5 addresses the justification of the ungodly, emphasizing the imputation of faith as righteousness\.

__4\.6 Judgment According to Works\. __A remaining question involves Paul’s references to judgment based on works\. Paul often discusses the future judgment and its relation to works, emphasizing the unity of justification and sanctification in his preaching\. In Paul’s view, grace, faith, and works are interlinked aspects of the believer’s life, reflecting the comprehensive nature of divine righteousness\.

__5\. Reconciliation\.__

__5\.1 God's Reconciling Work in Christ: The Peace of God\. __Reconciliation is frequently equated with justification in Paul's teachings\. While justification is a forensic, legal concept central to Paul's eschatology, reconciliation has a broader, socio\-theological meaning\. Crucially, God is the author and initiator of reconciliation\. Paul calls believers to be reconciled with God, highlighting reconciliation's contrast with divine rejection\. Reconciliation signifies God's redemptive work through Christ, aimed at removing enmity and restoring peace, accomplished through the cross\. God's reconciling work addresses more than human disposition; it encompasses the entire relationship between humanity and God\. Sinful humanity is both actively and passively at enmity with God\. Reconciliation primarily resolves the debt of sin, signifying God's gift, where removing enmity is just the beginning, leading to transformation in the Christian life\.

__5\.2 Christ’s Death as Atonement: Katallagè and Hilasmos\. __Christ's suffering and death play a pivotal role in God’s reconciling actions\. Romans 5:9\-10 speaks of justification through Christ's blood and reconciliation through his death\. The term hilasterion, meaning atoning sacrifice, is linked to cultic practices, while katallagè relates to societal contexts\. Although "atonement" occurs infrequently in Paul, the concept is central, signifying Christ's sacrificial death as substitutionary\. Christ’s death "for us" signals an act in our favor, not merely in our place\. The Bible supports this substitutionary atonement theme, emphasizing divine love demonstrated in Christ’s sacrificial death\.

__5\.3 Redemption: The Ransom\. __Redemption, often conveyed through the legal metaphor of ransom, appears throughout Paul’s writings\. Historically, a ransom could redeem a life, a concept extending to Christ's redemptive work\. Redemption signifies liberation from the law's curse, going beyond transactional views of buying and selling\. Although Paul doesn't explicitly use "satisfaction," the notion of substitutionary fulfillment underpins his soteriology, reflecting God's righteousness rather than simplistic legal fulfilment\.

__5\.4 Adoption as Children and Heirship\. __The concept of adoption originates from Hellenistic legal contexts but is rooted in Old Testament portrayals of Israel as God's child\. Paul frames adoption as a privilege, linking believers with God’s covenantal promises to Israel\. Adoption is more than subjective experience; it represents the divine economy and eternal purpose in Christ\. It's intertwined with justificatory grace and associated with the Holy Spirit's work\. The Spirit affirms believers' status as God's children, fostering a sense of sonship and freedom from fear\. This reflects belonging to God's people, a new status ensured by the Spirit as interim gift pending full realization\. This heirship aligns with the biblical promise to Abraham’s descendants\. Adoption connotes both present reality and future fulfillment, with inheritance representing the consummation of sonship, already begun but awaiting full revelation\.

__6\. The New Life\.__

__6\.1 General Perspective\. __Paul’s theology of new life contrasts with the effects of sin—death and slavery—centering on the transformative roles of the Holy Spirit, faith, liberation, renewal, and sanctification\. These are eschatological realities, revelations of the new age initiated by Christ's work\. Paul does not present a systematic order of salvation; rather, his framework starts with a new creation, emphasizing communal, historic transformation over the individual, personal change\.

__6\.2 Dying and Rising with Christ\. __The phrase "we who died to sin" reflects the community's participation in Christ's death and resurrection\. Baptism symbolizes union with Christ, emphasizing collective identity over individual pasts\. In baptism, believers symbolically die to sin and rise with Christ, experiencing freedom from sin’s authority\. The focus is not just on Christ's atoning death but on liberation from sin's claims\. This transformation leads believers to consider themselves dead to sin and alive to God, manifesting in obedient living that reflects their new status\.

__6\.3 Life Through the Spirit\. __Here, Paul contrasts the Spirit with the law and literal reading with spiritual reception\. Living in the Spirit supersedes the insufficiency of the letter, empowering hearts rather than merely prescribing behavior\. The Spirit offers freedom and enlivens the believer much like Christ’s transcending of the old law system\. The relationship between being "in Christ" and "in the Spirit" denotes a communal and objective reality, where believers belong to a new covenant defined by the Spirit, who guides their actual lives, infusing them with divine knowledge and discernment\.

__6\.4 The New Man\. __In Paul’s view, the old and new man signify not personal conversion stages but collective human transformation\. The Church, as the new man, signifies a transition from death and bondage to life and freedom\. The concept centers on a holistic shift, with believers adopting God's image anew, embodying true righteousness and holiness\. This renewed nature represents something beyond the original creation, embracing God’s glory through Christ’s likeness engaging intellect and will in divine knowledge\.

__6\.5 Faith as the New Life's Mode\. __Faith transitions believers from spiritual death to life in God\. It is not a spontaneous force but empowered by the Spirit of Christ, shifting from "us with Christ" to "Christ in us\." This participation unites the believer with Christ, not reliant on one’s power\. Faith, frequently prior in Paul’s discussions to the Spirit’s work, moves beyond work, rooted in gospel proclamation, fostering a community of the ‘called\.’

__6\.6 The Nature of Faith\. __Faith is central, intertwining with conversion and obedience\. It interacts with knowledge—faith in Christ and gospel—as elements of a defined tradition delivered through apostolic authority\. Knowledge in faith confronts and complements worldly wisdom, reflecting divine progression\. As believers mature, they discern God’s will through increasing wisdom\. Faith embodies trust, not resting on human effort but wholly on divine grace, tying intimately with hope for the unseen eternal\.

Summarizing, Paul's concept of new life is communally transformative, anchored in the unified movement from death to life through Christ’s redemptive work, sustained by faith and the indwelling Spirit, and culminating in shared participation in divine glory and purpose\.

__7\. The New Obedience\.__

__7\.1 Indicative and Imperative\. __Paul’s teachings on new life present a tension between indicative \(what God has done\) and imperative \(what believers must do\)\. The new life is both a gift and a mandate\. The indicative underpins the imperative, making the latter possible\. For example, in Philippians 2:12\-13, believers are urged to work out their salvation because God works within them\. Thus, the imperatives in Christian life are rooted in prior divine action, enabling believers to live out their faith actively through God’s power\.

__7\.2 Theocentric Perspective: Sanctification\. __In Romans 6, new life means transitioning from slavery to sin to freedom in God\. The contrast between "once" and "now" highlights this shift, with true humanity realized in servitude to God\. Sanctification, or being set apart, is the goal and fruit of new obedience, involving dedication to God and reflecting moral status\. This sanctification is less moralistic and more about embodying a life wholly dedicated to God, marked by righteousness and holiness\.

__7\.3 Totalitarian Perspective: Perfection\. __Paul's paranaesis \(ethical teachings\) reflects a comprehensive call to obedience\. Like sin, devotion to God encompasses every aspect of life\. Perfection isn't about flawless morality but embodying the fullness of Christ's victory over sin\. Believers are called to continual vigilance against temptation, upholding the achieved but not yet fully realized victory of Christ\. Spiritual maturity emphasizes growth and empowerment through faith, challenging notions of merely enduring limited beginnings\.

__7\.4 Unity and Multiplicity: Concreteness of Teaching\. __Paul employs various concepts to express the ethical dimensions of the Gospel\. While there’s unity in themes like "fruit of the Spirit," distinct commands address specific situations\. Paul’s approach is neither systematic ethics nor loose exhortations; rather, he contextualizes instructions for each community’s needs\. This method respects congregational autonomy while guiding ethical application, with love as the prevailing principle binding diverse teachings together\.

__7\.5 Tertius Usus Legis \(Third Use of the Law\)\. __The role and norm of the law in Christian life is debated in Paul’s writings\. The law, while not necessary for righteousness, is not nullified as a norm\. Through the Spirit, believers fulfill the law’s demands, emphasizing love as the law’s ultimate summary\. In Christ, the law finds its true intent not abolished but reinterpreted\. The essence of the law continues to inform Christian ethics, linked with love as an expression of divine will\.

__7\.6 Freedom and Conscience\. __The Christian conscience is liberated by Christ, functioning as a moral compass rooted in the believer's self\-awareness\. It reflects divine truth, free from human judgment, and aligns with faith\. Paul emphasizes acting with conviction and warns against misinterpreting freedom\. Conscience reminds believers of God's judgment and the necessity to preserve freedom responsibly, without it becoming the basis for self\-justification, focusing instead on maintaining integrity before God\.

__7\.7 Love\. __Love is the core of new obedience, rooted in God's love made manifest in Christ\. This love fosters community unity, seen in mutual edification and humility\. Love transcends mere fulfillment of the law, shaping the ethical life of the church\. Paul stresses love’s endurance, surpassing temporary spiritual gifts, framing it as the enduring element of Christian maturity and community integrity\. Love extends beyond fellow believers to all, challenging the community to transcend insular perspectives\.

__7\.8 Conduct in the World\. __Paul maintains that nothing is inherently unclean, stressing responsible use of freedom to avoid worldliness and moral compromise\. He distinguishes between void idol worship and the demonic influence of idolatry\. This discernment calls for exclusive devotion to God\. Paul also guides believers’ interactions with outsiders, promoting a distinct lifestyle that reflects Christian values without shunning their participation in society\.

__7\.9 Marriage\. __Paul positions marriage within divine creation, emphasizing mutual love and respect balanced by individual spiritual gifts\. While he acknowledges the advantages of celibacy for spiritual focus, marriage is affirmed as good and necessary to avoid immorality\. Paul’s remarks are not ascetic but endorse marriage’s temporary nature against the backdrop of God's imminent kingdom\.

__7\.10 Social Relationships\. __Regarding social roles, Paul urges orderly living within existing structures\. He encourages societal stability while invigorating relationships with Christ's spirit\. Though not explicitly advocating societal reform, he reframes social duties, including slavery, with a Christ\-centered ethos\. The Epistle to Philemon subtly challenges slavery, showing a gospel\-rooted transformation rather than rebellion against societal norms\.

__7\.11 Submission to Authorities\.__Paul advocates respecting governing authorities as divinely instituted, contextualizing obedience within a broader divine order\. This instructs believers to lead peaceful lives, supporting governance through prayer and example while acknowledging that divine obedience surpasses human authority\. While authorities maintain earthly order, the supremacy of God’s rule remains paramount, shaping how Christians engage with civil structures\.
