__An Introduction to Systematic Theology \- Cornelius Van Til__

__Chapter 1: The Idea and Value of Systematic Theology\.__

__A\. The Idea of Systematic Theology\. __Systematic Theology presupposes the self\-existence of God and His infallible revelation to humanity through the Bible\. This discipline is primarily God\-centered rather than Christ\-centered, contrasting with Barth’s approach\. It integrates various theological branches: Exegesis \(detailed scriptural analysis\), Biblical Theology \(organizing scriptural revelations historically\), Apologetics \(defending these truths\), Practical Theology \(application and teaching\), and Church History \(tracing historical reception\)\. Van Til acknowledges both Warfield’s and Kuyper’s views on the interconnectedness of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, asserting that all disciplines presuppose God’s existence\. Creeds must evolve to reflect advancements in Systematic Theology, without reducing their scope\. __B\. The Value of Systematic Theology\. __The fundamental question is truth and our duty to systematize it, not the value of Systematic Theology itself\. A comprehensive systematic approach prevents one\-sidedness, facilitates the complete proclamation of truth, and supports apologetics in a worldview context\.

__Chapter 2: The Method of Systematic Theology\. __

__A\. The Christian Theistic Method\. __This method incorporates both a priori \(predetermined by God\) and a posteriori \(gathering scriptural facts\) elements\. While idealists accept eternal and temporal aspects, Christian methodology starts with God's self\-existence, acknowledging that all facts are created and directed by God\. *1\. God as the Principium Essendi of Knowledge\.*__* *__God embodies unity and diversity, ensuring that His a priori and a posteriori knowledge aligns comprehensively\. *2\.Human Knowledge Analogical*\. Human knowledge derives analogically from God; humans and God exist on different planes, with human comprehension contingent on God’s voluntary revelation\. Existence and knowledge are dependent on God’s creative act\. __B\. The Theological Method\. __All knowledge, being analogical, is inherently theological\. No fact is truly known without acknowledging God’s existence, countering the idea of natural reason\. Despite man’s covenant\-breaking nature, common grace allows some understanding, challenging Romanism’s natural facts concept and affirming that God’s reason transcends human logic\. Gordon Clark and Van Til highlight that theism is rooted in God’s decree, not abstract logic\. Systematic Theology orders knowledge analogically, conforming to the original knowledge in God’s mind\.

__Chapter 3: Christian Epistemology\.__

__A\. The Object of Knowledge\. __All existence is from God; true human knowledge presupposes God’s being and His universal plan\. __B\. The Subject of Knowledge\. __God's aseity ensures that His interpretation encompasses existence\. Human understanding is partial yet valid, acknowledging God’s comprehensive knowledge\. Although ethically depraved, humans can access certain truths through common grace\. *Adamic consciousness* \(pre\-fall\) connected human reason with divine truth, whereas *sinful consciousness* aspires to divine autonomy but misconstrues the truth\. *Regenerate consciousness* restores this connection partially, striving towards full understanding\. __Unregenerate reason__ is monistic and blind to spiritual truths, yet is responsible for this ignorance\. Preaching aims to awaken the unreceptive, as God can grant understanding\. Once regenerated, intellect aligns with faith, prompting proper interpretation of divine revelations in Scripture\. Reason in theology is harmonized with faith, as faith propels accurate interpretation\.

__Chapter 10: Special Revelation\.__

__A\. The Necessity of Special Revelation\. __Special revelation is not necessary because of any defect in general revelation, as Arminianism suggests, but due to the effects of sin and humanity's rebellion\. Without the Holy Spirit, objective revelation alone is ineffective\. Although creation reveals God's existence, it does not reveal grace, and sin limits humanity's ability to understand even natural revelation\. Calvin pointed out that, because of sin, humans cannot properly know God as Creator or Savior through nature alone\. Van Til emphasizes that science and religion are interconnected, as all statements about the physical world imply underlying spiritual concepts\. Miracles are not violations of natural laws since these laws do not exist independently of God\. Rationalism and irrationalism both fail by their reliance on chance, and Kant's idea that human reason can only postulate God borders on pure mysticism\. __B\. The Names Used to Indicate Special Revelation\. __In the Old Testament, terms like "galah" and "ra'ah" are used, whereas the New Testament uses terms such as "epiphaino" and "emphanizo" to convey the idea of revelation\. __C\. The Modes of Special Revelation\. __Special revelation occurs through *theophanies, prophecies, and miracles*\. These modes of revelation address humanity's innate desire for the supernatural, emphasizing the need for God\. Points of contact exist in human desires for divine revelation, though systems like Arminianism and modernism debate this process\. True theophany involved God revealing Himself intimately in history, such as walking with Adam or dwelling between the cherubim\. Prophecy served as God's authoritative interpretation to His people, safeguarded by true distinctions from false prophecy\. Miracles manifested God's glory and offered corroborative evidence of His redemptive work\. Overall, special revelation compensates for the inadequacies of general revelation, underscoring that God's presence and interpretation are indispensable for human understanding and redemption\.

__Chapter 11: Scripture\.__

__A\. Attributes of Scripture\. __*1\) Necessity*: Scripture is necessary for preserving special revelation, reaching humanity, presenting truth objectively, and providing internal testimony\. *2\) Authority*: Scripture's authority stems from God's ultimate authority, countering human autonomy\. *3\) Perspicuity*: Scripture is clear enough for the ordinary person to understand without requiring priestly intervention\. *4\) Sufficiency*: Scripture alone suffices for conveying God's truth, excluding the need for additional human interpretation\. __B\. The Modern Opposition to Scriptural Authority\.__ Modern criticism is rooted in the belief that facts exist independently of God, positioning man as the ultimate interpreter\. This perspective denies absolute authority, suggesting that evaluation is imperative rather than acceptance\. Van Til argues that true biblical authority recognizes man's derivative relationship to God's overarching creative activity\. __C\. The Roman Catholic Position\. __The Roman Catholic Church positions infallibility in the church, relying on tradition and papal supremacy\. Arguments supporting tradition over Scripture include historical claims and apostolic practices\. Van Til critiques this, emphasizing the superior authority of Scripture interpreted through God’s direct revelation\.

__D\. Objections to False Mysticism\. __Critics suggest ongoing spiritual revelations and an internal kingdom of God, implying that Scripture is not closed\. Van Til counters that all interpretations must align with Scripture's comprehensive, self\-sufficient framework\.

__Chapter 12: The Inspiration of Scripture\. __Critics often accuse orthodox positions of using circular reasoning\. Van Til asserts that Scripture’s inspiration is self\-evident and should not rely on neutral, historical apologetics\. True reasoning acknowledges interconnected divine facts rather than isolating truths\. __A\. The Orthodox Doctrine of Inspiration__\. *1\) Personal Inspiration*: Prophets were conscious of serving as God's mouthpieces, sometimes speaking against their own will\. This inspiration extends to New Testament writers, through the Holy Spirit given by Christ\. *2\) Scriptural Inspiration*: Applies to written Scripture as much as oral transmissions\. Old Testament prophets documented divine revelation, treated as authoritative across both Testaments\. *3\) Verbal Inspiration*: Extends to Scripture's wording\. It applies to the loss of original manuscripts while God ensures truths remain accessible\. Human interpretation must acknowledge this divine inerrancy, even with lost autographs\. __B\. Forms of Inspiration\. __*1\) Lyrical Inspiration*: Reflects authors' personalities while remaining distinct from non\-regenerate works\. *2\) Chokmatical Inspiration*: Similar to pagan wisdom literature, didactical poetry, and prose, but presupposes Absolute Wisdom\. *3\) Prophetical Inspiration*: Authors are more passive \(or even antithetical\) to *auctor primarius*\. *4\) Inspiration of Christ*: Not dependent on means used by other prophets; *inspiratio *unionis\. *5\) Apostolic Inspiration*: Tied to the apostolic office, emphasizing internal Spirit\-work rather than external phenomena\.

__C\. Scriptural Inspiration and Phenomena Outside of Scripture\. __*1\) Biblical Criticism*: Critiques often use non\-theistic frameworks at odds with theistic presuppositions\. *2\) Historical Science and Evolution*: Apologetics addresses evolutionary claims by emphasizing Scripture’s authority\. *3\) Extrabiblical Religion and Morality*: These phenomena must be evaluated against the standards set by Scripture's inspired teachings\.

__Chapter 13: The Incomprehensibility of God \(Includes the Gordon Clark Controversy\)\.__

__Modern and Orthodox Views on God\. __Philosophers like Kant and theologians like Schleiermacher and Barth challenge the knowability of God, viewing Him more as a practical/limiting concept than a theoretical/constitutive one\. Orthodox theology, however, insists on the possibility of having theoretical knowledge of God due to divine revelation\. The question of how the eternal can reveal Himself to the finite reveals a tension: while some, like Aquinas, view revelation as inherently limited, others, like Van Til, emphasize the distinction between Creator and creature, arguing that human understanding is inherently revelatory of God\. __Gordon Clark Controversy\. __*1\) Clark's Position*: Yes, God’s knowledge is incomprehensible, and human knowledge is inexhaustible, but that does not mean that a proposition, such as “2 \+ 2 = 4,” has one meaning for man and a qualitatively different meaning for God\. *2\) Van Til's Critique*: Van Til Emphasized God's incomprehensibility and the Creator\-creature distinction and criticized Clark for conflating human and divine understanding\. Rather, he asserted that human knowledge is derivative and dependent on God's revelation; no content identity exists between divine and human knowledge, only analogical understanding\. __Incomprehensibility Explained\. __God is inherently incomprehensible, meaning He cannot be fully understood or known except as He reveals Himself\. This does not render God unknowable, but our understanding of Him is never exhaustive\. Human knowledge, while genuine, coincides with God's at no point because it is always contingent on God's prior revelation\. This means we only know in the light of God's self\-contained existence and relational covenant\. __Clark vs\. Van Til: Core Issues\. __The controversy with Clark highlighted deeper ramifications in theological epistemology concerning how divine revelation is understood\. Clark maintained that human knowledge could overlap in content with divine truth \(being identical\), while Van Til emphasized the analogical nature of human understanding\. This reflects the broader debate on the knowability of God, where God’s self\-revelation is central\. Van Til’s supporters brought a document, “The Complaint,” before the General Assembly of the OPC, which led to a partial vindication of Clark’s position\.

__Chapter 14: Apologetic Import of the Incomprehensibility of God \(Includes Buswell Controversy\)\.__

__Modern Man’s Rationalism and Irrationalism\. __Modern thought often places man as the ultimate point of reference, rationalizing existence purely from a human perspective\. Yet, this rationalism is coupled with an irrationalism rooted in the belief that reality cannot be fully comprehended or legislated by logic, leaving room for chance\. This dual approach underscores a rejection of the Creator\-creature distinction central to Reformed Theology\. In contrast, God is wholly self\-sufficient, infinitely knowable to Himself, and has created the world not by necessity but through His sovereign will\. __The Question of Sin and Divine Causality\.__ Debates arise over whether God is the author of sin\. Romanism, Arminianism, and thinkers like Buswell \(“not every act of the will of God is determined by the nature of God”\) introduce a degree of indeterminism, suggesting that humans can be ultimate causes of their free actions\. Buswell contends that if God's will is entirely determined by His nature, it compromises divine freedom and grace\. Conversely, if God's nature is dictated by His will, it reduces moral law to arbitrary power\. Van Til critiques Buswell for separating God's nature and will too sharply, arguing that such distinctions are beyond human comprehension and that God's will and nature are unified\. __Van Til's Critique of Buswell__\. Van Til criticizes Buswell's theological approach for diluting fundamental Christian doctrines to appease opponents of the faith, which ultimately undermines Christianity’s foundation\. By conceding human autonomy or ultimate power to some human actions, Buswell inadvertently introduces irrationality into Christianity and compromises the doctrine of God’s sovereignty by asserting ultimate determinative power to some human actions\. He also inserts rationality into Christianity by reducing God’s immutability to the consistency of relationship of activity in time\. In doing so, he risks conceding essential tenets of the faith without persuading skeptics\. __The Incomprehensibility of God as Apologetic Strength__\. The incomprehensibility of God is not equivalent to unknowability\. Rather, it acknowledges that while humans can know truths about God revealed to them, they never exhaust the depths of God’s nature\. Only through acknowledging God’s all\-encompassing plan can Christianity effectively counteract skepticism and irrationalism\. Van Til stresses that the Christian presupposition—that God’s plan governs all reality—is essential for offering a coherent response to both rationalism and irrationalism\. Solutions that insert irrationality or diminish God’s sovereignty to rationalize human autonomy weaken the faith’s ability to counter these philosophical challenges effectively\.

__Chapter 15: Innate and Acquired Knowledge of God\.__

__Cognitio Dei Insita and Cognitio Dei Acquisita\. __Philosophical views on knowledge contrast innate ideas, as seen in Descartes and Plato, where knowledge is intrinsic, with empiricists holding that the mind is a blank slate shaped by experience\. The orthodox position holds that innate knowledge pertains to involuntary, revelational thought content, while both innate and acquired knowledge precede God’s revelation\. __Interdependence of Innate and Acquired Knowledge\. __Innate and acquired knowledge are interdependent, reliant on the God\-consciousness within humanity, as posited by Calvin\. Nonbelievers may intellectually assent to arguments for Christianity without genuine acceptance\. Empirical evidence can be acknowledged by unbelievers, but this does not ensure faith or salvation\. __Van Til and Theistic Proofs\. __Van Til critiques Bavinck's theistic proofs as inconsistent, arguing that if they were effective, Christianity’s truth would be compromised, since they assume validity apart from divine revelation\. Van Til criticizes Barth for separating theology from other sciences, inadvertently suggesting that knowledge exists without God's revelation, thus endorsing natural theology indirectly\. 

__Chapter 16: The Names and Incommunicable Attributes of God\. __

__A\. The Names of God\. __God's names are expressive of His essence but not exhaustive\. They can be categorized into two main types: *Appellatives \(Nomina Propria\)*: These are the specific names by which God instructs us to address Him\. There is no new content on these names compared with works like Bavinck's writings\. *Attributes or Perfections*: These are qualities ascribed to any or all of the Trinity’s persons, illustrating aspects of God's essence\. __B\. The Attributes of God\.  __In discussing God's attributes, the relationship between distinctions and simplicity in the Godhead is explored: *Distinctions and Simplicity*: Each attribute of God is coterminous with His essence—for example, God is light, love, righteousness, and holiness\. These attributes help humans gain some understanding of His being but must not detract from God's simplicity\. *Abstract vs\. Concrete Understanding*: Relying on abstract thinking leads to an empty and negative conception of God\. Traditional method, combining the way of eminence \(emphasizing God's supreme qualities\) and the way of negation \(recognizing what God is not\), helps maintain a balanced understanding\. *Orthodox Conception*: This begins with viewing God as a concrete, self\-existent being\. God names creatures based on His essence, providing a framework for analogical understanding\. Human concepts of God become grounded through special revelation, particularly post\-fall, as expressed in the Old and New Testaments\. This revelation shapes our understanding of God's being\. *Critique of Barth and Romanists*: Barth's concept of knowing God through phenomenology without reliance on divine revelation leads to abstract knowledge\. Van Til argues that by doing so, Barth and Aquinas \(with his concept of *analogia entis*\) fail to allow God to fully reveal Himself, leaning on human\-conceived abstractions instead\. __C\. The Incommunicable Attributes of God\. __Our knowledge of God’s incommunicable attributes is derived analogically, often more negatively due to limited analogy in us compared to communicable attributes\. *1\) Aseity*: God is self\-existent, without cause, and nothing acts upon Him\. A true understanding of God's aseity arises from the concrete acknowledgment of God as the fullness of self\-contained being, rejecting abstract reductions like *analogia entis*\. *2\) Immutability*: God's unchanging nature follows from His aseity\. Unlike Aristotle's notion of an immovable mover, which results from philosophical emptiness, God actively remains Himself while controlling change in the universe\. *3\) Infinity*: Also a consequence of aseity, God's existence and attributes lack limits\. Negative abstractions are cautioned against, as they can empty concepts of time and space of meaning\. God’s infinite nature means He transcends limitations like time and space, which depend on God rather than existing as empty possibilities\. *4\) Unity*: God is indivisible and simple, not composed of parts\. Concepts like those from Aristotle and Plato, which imply division, are incompatible with the biblical assertion of God’s unity in texts like Deuteronomy 6:4\. God’s being and essence are completely unified, expressing absolute personality\.

__Chapter 17: The Trinity of God\. __

The Trinity comprises unity and plurality, revealed clearly in the New Testament but present in the Old Testament\. The essence of God is shared fully among the three persons of the Godhead\. __A\. The Teaching of the Trinity in the Old Testament\. __Differentiations within the Godhead appear through various Old Testament scriptures, such as in Genesis and Isaiah\. The Spirit of the Lord is depicted with distinct agency\. __B\. The Teaching of the Trinity in the New Testament\. __Key New Testament passages like Jesus’ baptism and the Great Commission affirm the Trinitarian nature of God\. __C\. Doctrinal Statement\. __The Westminster Confession articulates the Trinity as three persons of one substance, power, and eternity\. Hodge emphasizes the essential and relational properties distinguishing the persons\. __D\. The History of the Doctrine\. __Historically, the doctrine faced challenges like Arianism \(Christ as created\) and Sabellianism \(unity without diversity\)\. The Nicene Creed and councils affirmed Christ’s divine essence\. Modern antitrinitarianism, including Barth's theology, lacks room for the ontological Trinity, which is critical for countering philosophies and maintaining Christian orthodoxy\. Each person in the Trinity is coterminous with the divine essence, reflecting Christianity's unique identification of the principle of individuation within God's absolute personality, unlike rationalist or empiricist speculations\.
