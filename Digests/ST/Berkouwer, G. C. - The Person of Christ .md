__The Person of Christ – G\. C\. Berkouwer__

__1\. Introduction\.__

Berkouwer begins by highlighting the Christological conflict as a deeply religious and existential issue with determinative significance\. This conflict has manifested in various forms across different ages, often intensifying when established confessions are challenged or disputed, notably during the 4th, 5th, 19th, and 20th centuries\. The process of "Entmythologisierung," or demythologization, represents a modern form of this challenge, prompting the church to continually revisit and reflect upon its confessions\.

__2\. The Crisis in the Doctrine of the Two Natures\.__

John's assertion that denial of Christ's coming in the flesh is antichrist serves as a pivotal doctrine\. In the 19th century, this doctrine faced significant attacks as the Savior upheld by the confessions was increasingly seen as unreal or unimaginable\. This crisis had its roots in Socinianism and extended through thinkers like __Schleiermacher__, who did not adhere strictly to rationalism and valued feeling over cold logic\. Schleiermacher criticized the use of "nature" when describing Christ due to its finite connotations and challenged the conception of *two wills in Christ*\. He proposed that the Redeemer is similar to all men by virtue of human nature’s self\-identity but stands apart by the "constant vigor of his God\-consciousness\."

__Ritschl__, followed by __Harnack__, emphasized historical revelation over metaphysical and ontological concerns, criticizing the *church dogma* for making two subjects out of Christ\. In their view, dogma lost practical significance for personal piety, a point Schleiermacher also noted\. __Hegel__ offered a solution suggesting that Christ is in the *process of becoming God*, portraying divine being as undergoing evolution through human history—a process not even complete in Christ\. __Kenosis\-Christology__ further proposed the Divine becoming man through *self\-emptying*, setting aside relative attributes of God, though it failed to resolve the tension between divinity and humanity in Christ\.

The __historical\-critical__ approach prioritized the quest for the *historical Jesus* while disregarding Christ's divinity\. __Liberal theology__, countering this, insisted on adherence to the apostolic witness, viewing Gospels as faith testimonies rather than biographies\. Thus, *kerygma* came to the fore, with theologians like __Brunner__ echoing this stance\. __Ridderbos__ emphasized understanding Gospels as proclamations of Christ to future generations, focusing on the *message rather than historical* specifics\.

Berkouwer addresses how 19th\-century "scientific belief," including historical science, impacted Christology and gospel conceptions\. __Bultmann__ distinguished between the kerygma of the primitive church and the Hellenistic church, advocating for *myth removal*, particularly juxtaposing the historical event of the cross with the mythological mold of the resurrection, which he saw as faith rather than objective fact\.

Berkouwer critiques Bultmann's alignment with modernist, rationalist theologians who dismissed resurrection and incarnation possibilities, suggesting Bultmann’s views stem from a philosophical necessity for myth\-debunking and characterizing church declarations on Christ as mythical in nature\.

Berkouwer further explores __Scholten's__ view, acknowledging him as a progenitor of modern movements\. Scholten criticized Protestantism's failure to maintain *ancient councils and viewed Calvin as Nestorian*\. Scholten, in *Hegelian* fashion, held that *unity between divine and human* was not exclusive to Christ but should extend to the church as well\. __Roessingh__ strove for a synthesis between Idealism and Reformation, identifying tensions between autonomy and divine revelation through Christ, while __Heering__ viewed Christ as embodying God's Spirit, aligning with demythologizing tendencies\.

Dialectical theologians like __Barth and Brunner__ critiqued 19th\-century Christology, *defending ecumenical* church decisions\. __H\. Vos__ posed an existential challenge, asserting that if Christ does not speak the truth, one must consider whether he is a conscious deceiver or an unconscious victim of religious megalomania\.

__3\. Ecumenical Decisions\.__

__A\. Nicea, 325 A\.D\. __The Council of Nicea was convened to address the teachings of __Arius__, who posited that the Son had a beginning and there was a time when Christ did not exist\. This idea stemmed from a background in Adoptionism as advocated by Paul of Samosata\. Nicea introduced the term "homoousios" \(of the same substance\) to affirm that the Son was not created and shared the same essence as the Father, counteracting Arius’s claims despite previous rejection of the term at Antioch in 268\. While "homoousios" could evoke Gnostic associations of emanation, Nicea found it a useful term against Arian theology, emphasizing "light of light\."

__B\. Constantinople, 381 A\.D\. __Theological conflict continued following Nicea, with tensions persisting in the teachings of figures like Athanasius\. A significant issue arose with Apollinaris, who was concerned with the unity of Christ’s two natures\. __Apollinaris__ argued that the divine Logos could not unite with a complete human being without resulting in a third kind of being\. Thus, he proposed that the Logos replaced the human spirit, rather than assuming it\. The church, however, opposed Apollinaris's views, maintaining that Christ’s human nature was complete\. The Cappadocian Fathers warned against his teachings even before the council\. Despite some appreciation from Harnack for Apollinaris's intent, he acknowledged the church's opposition as vital for its doctrinal integrity\. Constantinople reaffirmed the doctrine of "vere deus, vere homo\."

__C\. Chalcedon, 451 A\.D\. __The Council of Chalcedon addressed the controversies surrounding __Nestorius__ and Eutyches, condemning both, as well as previously, at Ephesus in 431 for Nestorius\. The Antiochian school, against Apollinaris, supported the complete humanity of Christ and claimed a moral union akin to God's indwelling in man, though uniquely so in Christ\. Nestorius opposed the term "theotokos" for Mary, arguing she was only the mother of Christ’s human nature\. Accusations arose against Nestorius suggesting he espoused a two\-natures\-two\-persons doctrine, potentially misunderstood as heretical\. However, the church firmly opposed any separation of the two natures\. __Eutyches__ posited a blend of natures, leading to a singular nature in Christ, which conflicted with the Tome of Leo that emphasized each nature’s distinct attributes\. This led to the "Robber Synod" of 449 declaring Eutyches orthodox, a decision overturned by Chalcedon in 451, which defined orthodox Christology against both Eutychian confusion and Nestorian separation\. Later, Nestorianism would reemerge through 8th\-century Adoptionism, and Chalcedon itself faced criticism for allegedly compromising the unity of Christ's person\. Finally, __Constantinople in 680__ rejected __Monotheletism__, the belief in Christ having only one will, reaffirming Chalcedon's stance of preserving both natures and wills united in the person of Christ, a position also rejected earlier in 639\.

__4\. The Reformed Confessions\.__

The Reformed Confessions extend beyond merely aligning with ecumenical decisions; they engage in significant theological debates with both Lutherans and Anabaptists\. The __Heidelberg Catechism__, for example, echoes the language of ecumenical decisions and integrates Christological confessions with Trinitarian doctrine\. The __Belgic Confession__ similarly aligns with the Trinity and shows strong continuity with ancient church formulations, particularly against Arianism\. Article 18 underscores the incarnation as the fulfillment of prophecy, affirming that Christ assumed a human nature comprising both body and soul, countering the Anabaptist view that Christ brought human nature from heaven\. Instead, it asserts that Christ took on human flesh from his mother, Mary\. This article also addresses differences with Lutherans on the *communicatio idiomatum*—how the properties of each nature in Christ are interchanged\. The Belgic Confession stands firmly against Docetism, which denied Christ's true humanity\. Article 19 of the Belgic Confession addresses the union of Christ’s two natures, affirming that each nature retains its properties, preserving the mystery articulated at Chalcedon without attempting to rationalize it fully\.

Additionally, the __Confessio Gallicana__, __Confessio Helvetica__ __Posterior__, and the __Westminster Confession__ __of Faith__ conform significantly to the ecumenical decisions\. Despite its orthodoxy, the __Belgic Confession__ is subject to criticism, particularly for containing what has been termed the __extracalvinisticum__—a concept in Reformed theology referring to Christ's divine nature existing beyond his human nature\. Critics claim the Belgic Confession, while theologically robust, lacks complete systematic precision\. Berkouwer notes that while the Belgic Confession and others may struggle to articulate these mysteries flawlessly, they faithfully preserve the theological mystery essential to these doctrines\.

__5\. Chalcedon A Terminal Point?__

__Miskotte__ raises the question of whether Chalcedon represents a final doctrinal boundary\. Korff argues that Chalcedon aimed to preserve the mystery of Christ's nature without defining it, warning against further theological exploration that may result in heresy by either separating or mixing Christ’s natures\. He believes the truths affirmed at Chalcedon—Christ as truly God and man—should be seen as an endpoint\. __Kuyper__, however, emphasizes that theological clarity progressed during the Reformation, pointing to concepts like the __*extra\-calvinisticum*__, which Korff rejects\. Berkouwer critiques Korff for implying that logical development prioritizes reason over Scripture, thus losing the theological mystery, whereas Berkouwer advocates for a balanced approach that combines regressive and progressive thought, grounded in Scripture\.

Berkouwer distinguishes between Roman Catholicism and Reformed theology by questioning whether doctrinal progression is based on Scripture or the Church\. He argues Roman Catholicism equates Scripture with Tradition, whereas progression from Scripture need not diminish mystery\. *Chalcedon's* statements are understood not as constraints but as *guiding principles* within a broader scriptural context that remains richer\. Berkouwer notes that the *extra\-calvinisticum* originated with early theologians like Athanasius and Augustine, affirming Chalcedon's importance while promoting a deeper scriptural engagement\. He critiques Korff for focusing on Chalcedon's negatives while missing its affirmations, suggesting that true theological reflection should draw on the richness of Scripture beyond Chalcedon's decisions\.

__6\. The Person and Work of Christ\.__

Berkouwer addresses the perceived distinction between Christ's person and work\. __Korff__ supports the distinction, whereas __Ritschl__ maintains that theology should focus on salvation, not *ontological judgments*\. __Melanchthon__ emphasizes recognizing Christ through his benefits rather than his nature, opposing scholastic views but maintaining a dogmatic stance against antitrinitarian beliefs\. Luther prioritizes grace\-based salvation over speculative ontology but values dogmatics\. __Brunner__ aligns with Melanchthon by focusing on *Christ's work to understand his person*, following the principle that knowledge of Christ starts with his work\. __Berkouwer__ argues that the Bible presents *Christ's person and work as united*, asserting that understanding who Christ is is crucial to comprehending his work\. He critiques approaches like __Althaus’s__, which start with the *historical Jesus*, for neglecting the kerygmatic Christ\. The Reformers also advocate for the unity of Christ’s person and work, as illustrated in the Lord's Supper, where communion with Christ is central\. Bavinck states that Christ’s benefits are accessed through communion with his person\. *Separating person and work risks depersonalizing salvation and leading to speculative theology\.*

__7\. Promise and Fulfillment\. __

__The Significance of the Old Testament\. __Berkouwer highlights the importance of the Old Testament in church theology, viewing it as a crucial account of God's revelation and testimony about Jesus Christ rather than merely Jewish religion\. Van Ruler contends that the Old Testament is the primary Bible, with the New Testament as its interpretation, rejecting progressive revelation and proposing a cyclical view of biblical history centered on Christ's appearance\. __New Testament as Fulfillment of the Old Testament\. __The New Testament sees itself as fulfilling the Old Testament, a foundational belief for the church’s confession\. Christological interpretations of the Old Testament have faced criticism for forced readings, with scholars like Von Rad advocating respect for the Old Testament’s unique historical context while acknowledging Christ’s presence within it\. __Interpretative Dangers in Old Testament Reading\. __Berkouwer warns against the risks of historical criticism, which can interpret the Old Testament separately from the New Testament, and arbitrary allegorical interpretations\. Reformers such as Luther and Calvin critiqued these methods, supporting a unified understanding without dividing spiritual and literal meanings\. __Dilemma Between Historical\-Critical and Christological Exegesis\. __There is a challenge between historical\-critical approaches rejecting Christological readings and the perception of those readings as forced\. Berkouwer examines Vischer and Hellbardt, noting problems with separating scriptural testimony from historical reality, which may undervalue the promise\-fulfillment dynamic central to scriptures\. __The Essence of Christological Exegesis\. __Eichrodt, supported by Berkouwer, sees Christological exegesis as God's revelation entering history\. Berkouwer critiques the Zeugnis approach for leading to monotonous exegesis and avoiding comprehensive perspectives, arguing that focusing on existential truths behind scriptural truths detracts from God’s spoken reality\. __Allegorical Interpretation and Present Fulfillment\. __Berkouwer notes that Old Testament fulfillment in the New Testament does not preclude living promises today, pointing towards eschatological salvation within fulfilled promises\. He emphasizes that the Old Testament is not only predictive but intertwined with the ongoing history of God's relationship with the world\. __Unity of Christ in Old and New Testaments\. __In both testaments, Christ’s work and person are inseparable, underlining the essential unity of God’s word, as neither makes sense without the other\. Messianic expectations are rooted in divine revelation rather than human despair, highlighting divine grace as the source of hope\. __Old Covenant Redemption and Effectiveness of Christ's Work\. __Berkouwer raises concerns about Old Covenant believers accessing redemption without Christ's historical act\. Coccejus argued that true forgiveness was unavailable before Christ, similar to the Roman Catholic view of ongoing sacrifice in the mass\. Berkouwer maintains that Reformed theology asserts the comprehensive power and significance of Christ's suffering, securing salvation universally\.

__8\. The Deity of Christ\.__

__Diverse Denials and Church Affirmation__\. The deity of Christ has faced denial from various perspectives, with some emphasizing Jesus' unique humanity or exemplary morality, while others acknowledge him as the Son of God without equating him with God\. The church, however, has historically recognized Christ's deity as essential, insisting that it be grounded in Scriptural testimony\.

__World Council of Churches and Revelation vs\. Projection\.__ The World Council of Churches affirms Jesus as God and Savior, a statement that poses challenges for liberals due to differing interpretations of "as God\." The central question is whether Christ’s divinity is a divine revelation or a projection by believers\.

__Scriptural Affirmations of Christ's Divinity\.__ While the Scriptures do not provide a theoretical framework for Christ's deity, they consistently present him as divine through passages like John's Logos, Peter's confession in Matthew, and Thomas's declaration\. Although the Son may appear subordinate to the Father in certain passages \(e\.g\., John 17:5\), these affirm Christ's pre\-existence and his divine nature\. __Comprehensive Scriptural Attestation and Gospel Testimonies__\. The theological discourse should avoid dismissing terms like "speculation" because Christ's scriptural testimony reveals profound divine reality\. Although some contend that Christ’s pre\-existence is solely a Johannine concept, Berkouwer insists that all of Scripture attests to this, linking Christological and Trinitarian doctrines\. Christ's "I am" statements evoke Old Testament divine self\-revelation\. The Gospels assert Christ as God, not merely performing divine acts through adoption, underscoring faith confessions such as him being both David’s Son and Lord\. __Testimonies of the Epistles and Challenges of Subordination__\. The Epistles affirm Christ's pre\-existence, as seen in Philippians 2, where Christ shifts from divine glory to servanthood, and in 2 Corinthians, emphasizing his richness becoming poverty\. Colossians 1 depicts Christ as the creator and Hebrews 1 exalts his glory above angels\. Berkouwer critiques those who reduce Christ's pre\-existence to divine knowledge, arguing for a clear scriptural acknowledgment of his Incarnation\. Furthermore, passages used to assert subordination, like "the Father is greater than I," emphasize Christ's mission and suffering rather than diminish his divine nature\. __Christ’s Deity and Monotheism Concerns__\. Berkouwer argues that Christ’s deity poses no threat to monotheism, countering concerns from Unitarians, Jews, and Muslims\. Christ's mission amplifies the Father’s glory, aligning with God's declaration, “I am Jehovah, and my glory I will not give to another,” ensuring unity in divine self\-revelation\.

__9\. The Humanity of Christ\.__

__Denial of Christ’s Humanity and Church Response\.__ Though humanity cannot achieve redemption by itself and must rely solely on the Lord, the early Church emphasized Christ's humanity against those like the Docetists who denied it\. These groups, including various Gnostic sects and Marcionites, claimed that Christ's physical form was only an illusion\. __Docetism and Dualism Motivations\.__ The central claim of Docetism is that a genuine union between the divine and the physical is impossible, a view rooted in Gnostic dualism\. Marcion rejected nomism but selectively valued Pauline texts, excluding ones such as Galatians 4:4, which speaks of Christ being born of a woman\. Early Church fathers like Ignatius, Tertullian, and Irenaeus defended the true incarnation and humanity of Christ\. __Later Forms of Docetism\.__ Later heresies, such as Apollinarianism and Monophysitism, struggled with divine\-human unity\. They emphasized divinity over humanity, with doctrines like monotheletism denying a distinct human will in Christ, which the Church rejected\. __Gospel Accounts of Christ’s Humanity\. __The Gospels present strong evidence of Jesus' genuine humanity, incompatible with Docetism\. His resurrection appearances affirm that the risen Christ is the same as the crucified one\. Berkouwer notes no doubt concerning Christ's humanity before the crucifixion, highlighting his ordinary human development\. __Questions of Knowledge and Union\.__ The Church grappled with the extent of Christ's knowledge\. The statement in Mark about the unknown day or hour led to differing interpretations\. Thomas Aquinas suggested Christ’s knowledge was not communicable\. The Roman Catholic Church, in 1918, rejected limitations on Christ's knowledge due to the hypostatic union, implying Christ shared God's knowledge during his earthly life\. __Reformed Perspective and Tension in Union\.__ The Reformed tradition upheld the mystery of Chalcedon\. Berkouwer discusses the tension between divine vision \(visio\) and suffering \(passio\), questioning how Christ could be forsaken\. For Berkouwer, the person and work of Christ are inseparable, with Scripture affirming both his human and divine nature\. __Theological Interpretations and Modern Issues\.__ Modern interpretations often fail to balance Christ's divinity and humanity, leaning towards an Adoptionist view by over\-emphasizing humanity in kenosis\. The phrase "ecce homo" \(behold the man\), used by Pontius Pilate, is notably part of church confession\. Berkouwer cautions against giving prophetic interpretation to Pilate’s words, emphasizing restraint in drawing conclusions\. __Schilder and Divine Style of Passion\.__ Schilder highlights the divine orchestration of Christ’s passion, asserting that God uses human actions within his divine plan\. Berkouwer notes Scripture doesn't explicitly name this connection, with Caiaphas as a rare exception, urging careful consideration of theological limits\. __Conclusion on Humanity and Divinity\.__ Berkouwer emphasizes that Pilate's "ecce homo" is tied to Christ’s suffering and embodies the "man of sorrows," inseparable from the confession of his deity, underscoring the unity of Christ’s human and divine nature in both suffering and mission\.

__10\. The Sinlessness of Christ\.__

__Sinlessness as Holiness\.__ The question arises whether Christ was unable to sin due to his divine nature\. Rather than merely an absence of sin, his sinlessness is portrayed positively as holiness, strongly attested in Scripture with descriptions like "who knew no sin," "did no sin," and "holy, undefiled, sinless high priest\." __Christ’s Self\-Consciousness and Challenges to Sinlessness\.__ In John 8:46, Christ's awareness of his sinlessness is evident from his challenge, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" Some New Testament texts suggest otherwise: i\. "What callest thou me good?" This is interpreted by Berkouwer as criticizing superficial moral understanding; ii\) Jesus' baptism, associated with repentance, is presented by Christ as fulfilling righteousness; iii\) Christ's development, as seen in Hebrews 5:7\-8, reflects growth in his role, not moral improvement\. __Impossibility of Sin and the Nature of Temptation\.__ If Christ could not sin, his struggles and temptations would be devoid of meaning\. Scripture, however, affirms real temptation and struggle, as seen in Luke 4:13’s portrayal of Satan’s temporary retreat\. Many conclude that Christ’s sinlessness was not precluded by divine nature but was a conscious decision, acknowledging that temptation implies an ability to sin\. *This creates a dilemma: accepting Christ's capacity to sin, or denying conflict and temptation in his life\. *__Gethsemane and Christ’s Suffering\.__ The progression of Christ’s prayers in Gethsemane—from requesting to remove the cup to submitting to God's will—illustrates his journey through suffering\. Berkouwer ties this progression to the broader context of Christ’s role in reconciliation and sinless vicarious suffering\. __Reflections on Personal Union and Sinlessness\.__ Roman Catholic theology asserts Christ’s incapacity for sin, viewing his divine "I" as acting through his human will\. *Kuyper and Bavinck* differentiate between potentiality for sin in human nature and the lack of a human ego to realize such potentiality\. __Berkouwer’s Perspective on Christ’s Sinlessness\.__ Berkouwer argues against abstract notions, emphasizing that Christ's inability to sin is not an inherent metaphysical quality but intertwined with his Incarnation\. Christ’s freedom manifests through obedience to God, ensuring he could not fall, with his will aligned with his sinless state\. __Confessional Consensus on Christ’s Sinlessness\.__ The confessions of major Christian traditions, including Reformed, Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and Anglican, consistently uphold Christ’s sinlessness, affirming it as a central doctrine of faith across denominational lines\.

__11\. The Unity of the Person\.__

__Chalcedonian Foundation\.__ The Council of Chalcedon affirmed that the two natures of Christ exist without division, separation, mixture, or change, with each nature retaining its properties\. __Communicatio Idiomatum Conflict\.__ A significant theological conflict between Reformed and Lutheran traditions involved the concept of *communicatio idiomatum*, particularly regarding Christ's omnipresence in the Lord's Supper\. Lutherans emphasized a real presence and argued for the omnipresence of Christ's human nature\. Bavinck noted that, according to Lutheranism, the human nature became less significant, possibly introducing Docetic elements\. The Reformed tradition adhered to *finitum non capax infiniti*, asserting the finite cannot contain the infinite\. Berkouwer questions whether *communicatio idiomatum* implies a mixture of natures, though Luther referred to Chalcedon, allowing for mixture but avoiding confusion\. __Bavinck on Communication of Properties\.__ Bavinck argued that *communicatio idiomatum* involves communicating properties to the *one person of the Son*, rather than between natures, illustrating the complex interrelationship of divine and human properties\. Zwingli's *alloeosis* suggested verbal descriptions of Christ's actions might only pertain to one nature\. Luther opposed this, arguing that if only the human nature suffered, it risks negating Christ's divinity\. The Formula of Concord condemned several misunderstandings of the natures' interactions, supporting the idea that the divine nature penetrates the human, indicating *communicatio idiomatum* is not merely verbal\. __Colossians 2:9 and Verbal Communication\.__ While Luther failed to fully grasp Calvin's view, which he equated with Zwingli’s Nestorianism, Calvin emphasized a careful distinction of natures without division or confusion\. Reformed doctrine often faced accusations of Nestorianism due to *finitum non capax infiniti* and the extra\-calvinisticum, yet it maintained that Jesus Christ is one person with two natures\. __Worship of Christ and Ground for Worship\.__ The Reformed debate was not about whether to worship Christ, but the basis for such worship\. Bavinck rejected grounding worship on something creaturely \(against the Nestorian deification of Christ’s human nature\) but emphasizes faith as the ground for worship\. __Theotokos and Protestant Approaches\.__ Protestants rarely use the term “Theotokos,” distancing themselves from Roman Catholic Mariology while still rejecting Nestorian dualism\. Yet, they affirm Mary bore the person who is the eternal Son of God\. __Bavinck on Two\-Nature Christology\.__ Bavinck distinguished between properties, actions, and gifts of Christ's natures, which Berkouwer challenges, emphasizing that every action was performed by one person, Jesus Christ, \(the human nature never existed in abstraction from the divine\), underscoring the dynamic unity in Christ’s mission and being\. Dordt affirms that Christ died, truly holy man, and truly eternal Son of God\. __Analogy of Body and Soul\.__ This analogy illustrates the unity of dual natures in a single person, a concept used by theologians like Athanasius and Calvin\. Despite its limitations, it holds dogmatic significance in expressing the unity of Christ’s person\. Bavinck and Berkouwer recognize *imperfections in theological language* but stress ongoing efforts to align Christological dogma with biblical richness and honor Christ’s divine and human natures\.

__12\. The Impersonal Human Nature\.__

__Concept and Rationale\.__ The concept of Impersonal Human Nature \(*anhypostasis*\) posits that Christ's human nature finds its personality in the divine Logos\. With two natures in a single person, the natures cannot both be personal, meaning Christ's human nature cannot exist independently of the Logos\. __Defenders: Barth, Aalders, and Bavinck\.__ Barth, as early as 1927, argued that Christ's humanity is a predicate of his deity and lacks independent existence, opposing Ebionitism and Adoptionism\. Aalders supports this by suggesting the divine person commands, with the human existence rooted in the Logos\. Bavinck concurs, asserting that the union involves the Son with an impersonal human nature, maintaining genuine humanity without independent existence\. Other supporters include Miskotte, Gilg, and Relton\. __Opposition from Korff and Althaus\.__ Korff argues that the doctrine of *anhypostasy* \(“no hypostasis” or impersonal nature\) cannot be inferred from Chalcedon and hints at Docetism\. Althaus contends it violates Christ's true humanity, maintaining that one cannot separate nature from person—the orthodox doctrine should be an article of faith, not a theoretical paradox\. __Berkouwer's Central Issue\.__ Berkouwer identifies whether the doctrine undermines genuine human nature in Christ as the central issue, potentially leading to monophysitism\. In Reformed theology, *anhypostasy* is seen as the union with the Logos rather than truncating human nature\. __Vollenhoven's Rejection and Philosophical Basis\.__ Vollenhoven rejected the anhypostasis theory on philosophical grounds, associating it with monophysitism and Apollinarianism\. He supported distinctions made by the Cappadocians and Augustine, who differentiated the Person from a person, rejecting dual personal entities\. __Hepp's Counterargument and Confessional Implications\.__ Hepp argues that Vollenhoven conflicts with Reformed confessions, particularly Belgic Confession 19, which implies one person \(the Son\) and two natures and indirectly *anhypostasy*\. He asserts that Vollenhoven should regard the confession as monophysitic if anhypostasis is assumed\. Berkouwer suggests Hepp and Vollenhoven have differing views on personality\. __Berkouwer's Perspective on Church Doctrine\.__ According to Berkouwer, one cannot infer *anhypostasis* as church doctrine from Belgic Confession 19, but only that Christ did not unite with an *independent* human being\. It addresses the independence of the human nature, not a lack of essential humanity \(personality\) in Christ\. __Conclusion on Doctrine's Mystery\.__ The church does not formally teach *anhypostasis* but opposes the independence of the human nature\. The doctrine is not imposed by confessions or councils\. The church rejected Adoptionism and Docetism to maintain the mystery and unity of Christ's natures, which Berkouwer believes is understood through faith\.

__13\. Christ Incognito?__

__Mystery vs\. Obscuration\.__ The term "mystery," as applied to Christological doctrine, does not imply an obscuring of revelation facts or irrationality\. Some, like Heering, reject the doctrine of Incarnation in efforts to transcend mystery, yet Berkouwer asserts that incomprehensibility is revealed in Scripture\. This chapter explores the incomprehensibility of God’s revelation in Christ's hidden humanity, touching on the idea of the Christological incognito\. __Concealment in Christ's Humanity\.__ The humanity of Christ, according to this doctrine, conceals God rather than reveals Him, a notion seen in the revelational significance of Christ's two natures\. *Emil Brunner* claims revelation is also concealment, with God condescending into absolute humanity, making Christ unknowable and placing man before the decision between demanding faith or offense\. *Barth* similarly views revelation in the hiddenness of flesh, aligning Christ’s human nature as post\-Fall humanity\. __Böhl's Imputation and Dialectical Theology\.__ *Böhl* suggested Adam's guilt was imputed to Christ at the Incarnation, akin to Luther's view of Christ in the flesh\. *Kuyper* disagreed, noting a difference in Christ's imputation compared to ours\. Böhl's idea aligns with embryonic dialectical theology, seeing revelation as concealment\. __Significance of Christ’s Humanity in Revelation\.__ Dialectically, God reveals himself in concealment\. While Scripture mentions that the natural, unenlightened heart struggles to recognize Christ, Berkouwer emphasizes that this blindness is due to human folly and unbelief, not the form of revelation\. __Against the Incognito Theory\.__ Against Brunner’s suggestion that Christ could be mistaken for any man, there are authority figures \(e\.g\., demons\) in the Gospels who clearly recognize Jesus for who he is, undermining the incognito theory\. Prophecies and narratives identify his identity from birth through Transfiguration, highlighting belief and some glorification despite Christ's earthly humiliation\. Berkouwer argues that those valuing the gospels must see that the incognito theory does not accommodate these revelation aspects\. __Reformed Theology on Christ's Concealment\.__ In Reformed theology, Christ's concealment relates to his humiliation \(*occultatio*\), not kenosis\. For Calvin, God approaches in servitude not Majesty, concealing, not diminishing, his glory—seen in miracles and signs\. Christ is ultimately directed towards revelation, not hiddenness; the offense of the cross is human resistance to revelation\. __Use of *Occultatio* in Reformed Theology\.__ Berkouwer questions whether Reformed theology has applied "*occultatio*" correctly, concerned about implicit *kenosis*, especially with the *extra\-calvinisticum* and divine glory penetrating human nature\. If kenosis implies Christ set aside divine attributes, Reformed theology indeed rejects it\. __Dangers of Misinterpretation\.__ Theological interpretations risk *theopaschitism* on one end or complete humanization of the Son of God on the other\. Understanding the balance in these ideas is crucial to maintaining a sound interpretation of Christ's dual nature\.
