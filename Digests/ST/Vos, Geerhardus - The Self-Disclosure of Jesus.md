__The Self\-Disclosure of Jesus – Geerhardus Vos__

__Chapter I: The Strategic Importance of the Messianic Consciousness\.__

__Belief and Claims of Messiahship\. T__he question of whether Jesus believed or claimed to be the Messiah holds significant implications for liberal theology and Gospel criticism\. Jesus' vocational consciousness as the Messiah should not be reduced to psychological interpretations\. Understanding and accepting Jesus as the Savior require recognizing His self\-awareness of this role\. __Messianic Prophecies and Jewish Legalism\. __Messianic prophecies are intricately linked to Jewish legalism and the eschatological themes present in Jewish apocalypses\. These prophecies involve subjection to Christ's law and rule and the restoration of primordial harmony\. Jesus' understanding of His Messiahship should not be stripped of its supernatural elements\. __Soteric Element of Messiahship\. __The Messiahship of Jesus inherently includes a soteric component, inseparable from the concept of salvation\. This is supported by scriptural references such as Isaiah 9 and 11, Micah 5, Zechariah 9, Genesis 49, and Numbers 24\. Jesus' role involves a profound soteric interpretation beyond merely offering moral guidance\. __Messianic Consciousness and Religious Position\. __Jesus' Messianic Consciousness is deeply intertwined with His role as mediator between God and humanity, recognized as both Son of God and Son of Man\. This understanding significantly impacts thoughts on His consciousness and state of mind\. Some, like Albert Schweitzer and Johannes Weiss, argue that Jesus' messianic self\-awareness was projected into the future, aligning it with the historical Jesus\. As Schweitzer noted, "But He does not stay; He passes by our time and returns to his own\." 

__Chapter II: The Denial of Messianic Consciousness\.__

__Various Positions\. __The concept of Messianic Consciousness poses significant challenges for modern liberal Christianity\. Various positions on this issue exist:

1. The Denial of Messianic Consciousness \(Chapters II and III\)
2. The Agnostic Position \(Chapter IV\)
3. The Theory of Prospective Messiahship \(Chapter V\)
4. The Theory of Development of Jesus into the Messianic Consciousness \(Chapter VI\)
5. The Theory of Purely Formal Significance of the Messianic Consciousness \(Chapter VII\)

__Complete Denial and Claims to Disprove Messianic Consciousness in Jesus\. __Some argue that the Messianic Consciousness in Jesus can be entirely denied and disproven\. This stance is rooted in historical\-critical scholarship that attempts to separate the messianic and non\-messianic elements in the Gospels, asserting that only the non\-messianic elements are authentic \(cf\. the historical Jesus theory\)\. Geerhardus Vos critiques this dualistic approach to the Gospels\. Additionally, they argue that the term "Son of Man" in Aramaic was a common address\. Yet, Vos notes that a transition in meaning is plausible, as seen in the LXX and intertestamental scriptures\. Another reason for this denial is that the Jewish conception of the Messiah was as a patriotic figure, a role Jesus did not fulfill\. The deepest reason for this denial is the perceived incompatibility of Messianic Consciousness with the ethico\-religious character of Jesus, particularly focusing on psychological arguments about self\-denying altruism and humility\. Ethical idealism \(present focus\) is seen as incompatible with eschatological preoccupation \(future focus\)\.

__Chapter III: The Denial of the Messianic Consciousness \(Continued\)\.__

__Transformation of Messianic Consciousness\. __Position 4 suggests that the concept of Messianic Consciousness underwent a radical transformation in the Gospels, shifting from associations with Israel, power, and victory to themes of suffering, the cross, and a break from Israel\. The idea is that suffering and the cross are incompatible with traditional Messianic Consciousness\. However, Geerhardus Vos argues that without this consciousness, the disciples would not have believed in the resurrection\. If Jesus anticipated and accepted the paradox of the Messiah on the cross, it confirms His Messianic Consciousness\. __God\-Centered Messianic Consciousness\. __According to Vos, the dominating characteristic of Jesus' Messianic Consciousness is its absolute God\-centeredness, contrasting with the man\-centered hedonism associated with Jewish Messianic expectations\. Jesus' conflict with Israel stemmed from issues of sin, not His Messianic Consciousness, underscoring that Christ created Israel, not the reverse\. Vos challenges the alleged incongruity between the historicity of Jesus' Messianic Consciousness and His ethical idealism, arguing that ethical idealism is a partisan view held by Liberal Theologians\. Jesus' ethical teachings derive their unique character from His Messianic Consciousness\. The charge of unethicalness, particularly concerning the principle of justice and retributive punishment, merely indicates the rejection of Jesus as "primus inter pares\."

__Chapter IV: The Agnostic Position: Wrede\.__

__Wrede’s “*Das Messiasgeheimnis in den Evangelien*\.” __Wrede's critique of the Gospel of Mark centers on the concept of "The Messianic Secret\." He challenges the notion that Mark is superior to Luke and Matthew in modern Gospel criticism and explores the implications for the Messianic view\. Wrede argues that Jesus' Messianic character appears self\-contradictory, confused, and unintelligible\. He highlights the paradox of performing miracles while instructing others to remain silent about them\. According to Wrede, Mark, like Luke and Matthew, is ambiguous about Jesus' Messiahship, featuring secrecy phenomena throughout\. __Secrecy and Messianic Identity\. __Wrede posits that the oldest view in the Church suggests Jesus was not the Messiah during His life but became one through the resurrection\. He notes a rival belief that claims Messianic Consciousness existed before the resurrection, suggesting Mark is hesitant to dismiss either opinion\. Geerhardus Vos argues that this explanation oversimplifies the secrecy phenomenon by attributing it to a singular cause\. He proposes different reasons for the secrecy in the first half of Mark\. While humility and the desire not to stimulate merely miracle\-based belief motivated secrecy, performing miracles was part of Jesus' Messianic mission\. Vos notes a tension between Jesus' desire to heal and His wish to remain discreet\. The aspect of secrecy also carries a predestinarian element, meaning not everyone is intended to witness or believe in the Messianic kingdom\. The progression of the Kingdom and Messiah reveals that, like the future outward manifestation of the Kingdom's visible glory, the Messiah will also eventually be openly revealed to the world\. __Alternative Views on Messianic Secrecy\. __Another perspective on the secrecy suggests it stems from the disciples' reception of Jesus' revelations about His Messiahship, not from Jesus' intentions\. Wrede argues that Jesus' self\-revelation is a fiction of the evangelist and, therefore, unhistorical\. Vos contends that the remarkable lack of understanding attributed to the disciples is challenging but distinct from Messianic Consciousness\. He presents three counterpoints:1\) the disciples did sometimes comprehend Jesus' Messiahship, as illustrated by Peter's confession; 2\) Mark does not imply that secrecy was lifted after the resurrection; and 3\) persistent misunderstanding by the disciples would be difficult to retrospectively fabricate and accept as a fictional device serving a dogmatic agenda\.

__Chapter V: The Theory of Prospective Messiahship\.__

__Messiahship Not on Earth\. __This theory is supported by extreme and thoroughgoing eschatologists who argue that Jesus' Messiahship is not associated with His earthly life\. According to this view, Jesus placed no significance on the present world; instead, the apocalyptic climax of the age is considered the true apocalypse of the Messiah\. This perspective denies the "already and not yet" nature of the Kingdom and proposes a mutual parallelism between the Kingdom and Messiahship\. __Vos on the Present and Future Nature of Messiahship\. __Vos challenges this perspective by affirming the "already and not yet" nature found in Scripture\. While the eschatological aspect is present, so too is the presence of the Kingdom in Jesus' teachings\. Jesus discusses both His role as the Son of Man and the reality of the Kingdom, affirming a dual focus on the present and future manifestations of the Messianic Kingdom\. __Conflict with Gospel Accounts\. __The assumption that Jesus regarded His earthly activity as non\-Messianic and merely preparatory for a future Messianic role contradicts clear statements in the Gospels\. For instance, during His baptism, Jesus receives a Messianic appointment and commission to public ministry\. Furthermore, at the resurrection, Jesus declares, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and on earth," underscoring His Messianic authority both during His earthly life and beyond\.

__Chapter VI: The Theory of Development of Jesus into the Messianic Consciousness\.__

__Development During Active Ministry\. __The theory suggests that Jesus experienced a development into Messianic Consciousness during His active ministry, undergoing two potential states of mind: 1\) that at the start of His ministry, His state might have been entirely void of any engagement with the Messianic question; 2\) that initially, He might have been convinced He was not the Messiah\. __Vos's Perspective\. __Vos argues that the first possibility is impossible due to the eschatological atmosphere of the time, notably embodied by figures like John the Baptist, which would have compelled Jesus to affirm or deny His role\. Regarding the second possibility, there is no evidence of Jesus' self\-correction from believing He was not the Messiah to realizing He was\. Rather, the Gospels depict Jesus as having a clear awareness of His mission, evidenced by His self\-comparison to the bridegroom and His solicitation of Peter's confession\. __Lack of Motivating Factors for Development\. __Vos contends that no historical or psychological factors satisfactorily explain a development in Jesus' Messianic Consciousness\. Although there is a marked distinction between the period before Caesarea Philippi and afterward—where before, Jesus did not hesitate to speak or act as the Messiah, and after, He explicitly instructed the disciples about His Messianic role—this variation was about preparing the disciples for His suffering and death, not an inward development\. 

__Chapter VII: The Theory of Purely Formal Significance of the Messianic Consciousness\.__

This theory suggests that Messianic Consciousness was an incidental vehicle for Jesus' self\-expression, separate from His deepest self\-understanding, which He merely adopted for His mission\. *First*, it argues that Jesus emphasized the Kingdom rather than His Messianic role, using an argument from silence\.* Second*, the theory proposes that Jesus felt His role as Messiah to be burdensome\. *Third*, it suggests that Jesus' Messianic Consciousness arose from a more profound and fundamental consciousness of sonship\. __Vos’s Response\. __Vos addresses the comparative importance of Jesus' roles and identities\. *First*, compared with His divine and eternal sonship, Messiahship is seen as secondary and relative\. *Second*, within the context of redemption, Messiahship is primary and essential\. *Third*, contrary to the view placing Jesus' ethical and religious sonship as more significant, Vos contends that Messiahship occupies a higher rank\. Jesus' entire human nature and spiritual experiences were not ends in themselves but served the purpose of His Messianic calling; thus, Messiahship was far more than a mere form of self\-expression\. For Christians who value Jesus' human nature alongside His Deity, Messiahship is elevated above ethical and religious sonship in its significance for salvation\.

__Chapter VIII: "The Christ\."__

__The use of the word "Messiah"__ in the Old Testament is notable for never occurring as a standalone title; it is always accompanied by a genitive or suffix\. It only becomes a standalone title after the Old Testament period\. In the Gospels, however, "Messiah" appears consistently as a title, raising the question of whether the Old Testament actually refers to an eschatological King\. Geerhardus Vos argues that the concept of the king of Israel and the eschatological king are not mutually exclusive, reflecting both national and individual dimensions\. __Anointing and Associated Roles\. __In terms of the original meaning, the act of "anointing" places strong emphasis on the appointment aspect, where anointing serves as a declarative act, symbolizing holiness and the bestowal of the Holy Spirit\. In the Old Testament, anointing duties are not limited to kings alone but extend to priests and some prophets, indicating that anointing rituals for priests and prophets are not derivative of royal anointing\. Ultimately, in Jesus, the roles of king and priest converge\. 

__Chapter IX: "The Lord\."__

__References to Jesus as Lord\. __The term "Lord" is used selectively when speaking about Jesus\. The evangelists must have followed the common language of their time, yet there is a notable scarcity of references to Jesus as "the Lord" by the Evangelists themselves\. Various Gospel characters refer to Jesus as Lord, including Elizabeth, the shepherds who witnessed His birth, His disciples, and Mary\. __Title Usage in the Third Person__\. Sometimes "Lord" is used as a title in the third person, signifying Messianic authority and sovereignty, as in "Christ the Lord\." After the resurrection, this title reflects reverence for a new and unique dignity in Jesus\. In other instances, "Lord" functions as an adjectival attribute with a qualifying genitive\. __Kyrios as Vocative: Kyrie\. __The vocative "Kyrie" is used in several ways\. *First*, it may be a common form of address, expressing politeness when addressing Jesus\. *Second*, some suggest that the Evangelists anachronistically applied this term to Jesus' lifetime\. Geerhardus Vos challenges the latter, arguing that it contradicts what is known about the writing habits of the evangelists\. The polite use of "Kyrie" is likely only employed by those who already view Jesus as the Messiah, such as the disciples and those seeking supernatural help\. Vos finds a middle ground between equating early and later uses of "Kyrie" and distinguishing between politeness and religious usage: "We conclude, then, that the Kyrie address of the time of Jesus' walk on earth is a real precursor of the standard designation of the Saviour from the Apostolic age onwards until the present time\." __Bousset's Theory\. __Wilhelm__ __Bousset claims that Jesus never bore the title Kyrios during His lifetime or in the early Jerusalem mother church and that He received the title in a pre\-Pauline Hellenistic Christian cult\. He suggests that Paul integrated this name into his Christology under the influence of his Pneuma concept\. __Vos's Critique of Bousset\. __Vos raises several objections to Bousset’s theory: 1\) there is no evidence of a connection to a cult; 2\) the concept of a middle stage between the mother church and Pauline Christianity is speculative and vague; 3\) Bousset underestimates the accounts in Acts and the Gospels; 4\) he overlooks what the Gospels reveal about Jesus' self\-awareness; 5\) Bousset relies too heavily on the Gospels for insight into the terminology used within the early Jerusalem Church; 6\) he makes too much of an association between Kyrios and Pneuma in Paul’s writings\. Lastly, Vos criticizes Bousset's inadequate treatment of the issue, which stems from his treatment of Messianic Consciousness as only a formal concept, despite not denying its historicity\.

__Chapter X: The Son of God\.__

__Four Senses of the Title\. __The title "Son of God" characterizes the Godward relation of the Messiah and appears in four distinct senses within the New Testament\. These senses include: 1\) a purely moral and religious interpretation, akin to "Child of God," 2\) an official or Messianic understanding related to His role rather than His essential nature, 3\) a nativistic aspect concerning God's supernatural paternity, and 4\) a Trinitarian sense indicating eternal sonship\. While some old liberal traditions recognize only the first two senses, all four are applied to Jesus in the New Testament\. __Distinctions and Evidence\. __A careful distinction between what Jesus proclaimed about Himself and what others said about Him emerges from the analysis of both Synoptical and Johannine evidence\. Particularly within the Synoptic Gospels, Matthew 11:27 and Luke 10:22 underscore the divine handing over of all things to Jesus, the Father's exclusive knowledge of the Son, and the Son's revealing capability, showing mutual divine recognition\. Possible echoes from Isaiah and Jeremiah or Jesus Sirach support the notion that this passage emphasizes the essential nature of the Father\-Son relationship and uses chiastic parallelism to highlight their mutual revelation\. The phrase, "come to me all\.\.\." in verse 28 resonates with Old Testament references typically reserved for YHWH, affirming a unique relationship between God and Jesus\. Geerhardus Vos supports a present\-tense interpretation of the verbs, aligning with Irenaeus and thereby challenging both liberal and Gnostic past\-tense readings\. __Affirmations and Parables\. __Further affirmation of Jesus' sonship is evident in the episode concerning the payment of the half\-shekel \(Matthew 17:24\-27\), where the debate about whether freedom applies only to Jesus or also to Peter suggests shared sonship\. This shared aspect likely extends to both, affirming their filial bond\. __Understanding of Messiahship\. __The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen \(Matthew 21:33\-46/Mark 12:1\-12/Luke 20:9\-18\) focuses on the notion of rejecting and killing the son but does not necessarily function as a Messianic title here\. However, Psalm 110 \("If David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"\) elevates the understanding of Messiahship to a higher, supra\-political plane\. Vos asserts that the Messiah must be God's Son to embody the characteristics ascribed in the Psalm, with Sonship suggesting Messiahship while pointing back to a deeper divine relationship\. __Hierarchy of Revelation\. __Addressing the saying, "Concerning that day or the hour no one knoweth, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, except the Father," Vos identifies a hierarchy of revelation\. Humans receive certain information, angels more so, and the Son, in His Messianic office, the most comprehensive view\. Yet, the specific knowledge of "that day" remains with the Father, highlighting a unique dynamic in divine revelation\.

__Chapter XI: The Son of God \(Continued\): Ascription of the Title to Jesus by Others\.__

__Acknowledgment by Supernatural Forces\. __Demons recognize Jesus' Messiahship and refer to Him as "the Holy One of God," indicating a supernatural and intuitive knowledge rather than an inferential understanding\. Their prostration signifies submission to a higher supernatural power\. Satan also addresses Jesus as "the Son of God," with acknowledgments such as "we know thee who thou art," highlighting Jesus' supernatural personhood more than His supernatural endowment by the Spirit\. __Reaction of the Sanhedrin\. __The Sanhedrin accuses Jesus of blasphemy\. According to the Talmud, claiming Messiahship was not typically considered blasphemous, though it could be punishable by death in certain contexts\. Vos suggests that the charge of blasphemy must relate to Jesus' claim to be the Son of God\. The Sadducees, who did not emphasize the Messiah in their theology, specifically reacted to Jesus affirming His identity as both Christ and the Son of God\. __Peter’s Testimony\. __In the Gospels, the disciples, particularly Peter, refer to Jesus with phrases like "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God" or "Thou art the Christ of God\." The absence of the article in "the Son of God" indicates that the phrase wasn't intended merely as a Messianic title, but as a descriptor of Jesus' unique nature, linking to both Messianic and filial dimensions\. __Significance of Peter's Confession\. __Peter's acknowledgment is regarded as the result of supernatural revelation\. The contrast between the "Son of Man" and the "Son of the Living God" elevates Jesus' sonship beyond the human realm\. The phrase "living God" emphasizes sonship that transcends Messiahship\. Furthermore, Jesus assigns Peter a higher, supernatural status by bestowing upon him the new name Kephas\. __Annunciation and Divine Sonship\. __In Luke, the annunciation states that "the child shall be called the Son of the Most High," signifying divine paternity through the Holy Spirit\. The terms "called" and "this one shall be great" differentiate between Messianic Sonship and nativistic sonship\. __Witness of Baptism and Transfiguration\. __The baptism and transfiguration provide the highest affirmations of divine sonship, as expressed in "This is my beloved Son\." __Narrative and Theological Implications\. __Mark begins with "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God\." In the Synoptic Gospels, there's little reference to an isolated intra\-divine sonship, with focus instead on other aspects of sonship\. Vos asserts that these four aspects—Trinitarian, Messianic, Nativity, and Ethico\-Religious Sonship—are not successive stages in early Church Christology but are coherent expressions of Jesus' singular divine sonship\. __Sequences of Being and Revelation\. __In terms of being, the sequence is Trinitarian Sonship, then Messianic, Nativity, and Ethico\-Religious Sonship\. Revelation follows a different sequence: Messianic Sonship \(as in the Psalms\), then Nativity Sonship \(illustrated in the Gospels\), followed potentially by Trinitarian and Ethico\-Religious Sonship\. Together, these sequences depict a comprehensive understanding of Jesus' divine sonship\.

__Chapter XII: The Son of God \(Continued\): The Sonship of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel\.__

__Key Terminology in the Prologue\. __The terms Logos, Son, and Monogenes appear prominently in the prologue of the Gospel of John\. Some scholars, like Ritschl and Von Harnack, argue these names are merely temporal, distinguishing between what they see as a metaphysical prologue and an ethically colored Gospel\. __Messianic and Ontological Sonship\. __Various references throughout the Gospel underscore the Messianic sonship of Jesus, such as in John 13:3, where the Father gives all things into the hands of the Son, and John 5:19, 20, which describe the Son acting in alignment with the Father's actions, emphasizing their mutual knowledge\. Vos argues that ontological and Messianic sonship are closely intertwined, as indicated by passages like John 10:30, "I and my Father are one\." This opposes Lütgert's assertion that Jesus became the Son through receiving the Spirit, given the frequent references to Jesus' pre\-existence\. __Significance of Monogenes\. __Understanding the name Monogenes and the pre\-existence of Jesus is crucial to fully appreciate His Trinitarian sonship\. Von Harnack distinguishes between the metaphysical Christology of the Prologue and the ethico\-religious focus of the Gospel, while Vos contends that Christ's obedience is essential to His ontological sonship\. Believers are called "tekna," not "huioi," setting Jesus apart from others and challenging Harnack’s view that Jesus' sonship is solely ethical\-religious\. __Complexity of Nativistic Sonship\. __The question of nativistic sonship in John presents exegetical and theological challenges\. Understanding Monogenes pertains to whether it signifies coming in the flesh or pre\-existent nativity\. The passage, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God," implies a direct description of the virgin birth\. __Interpretation of Monogenes\. __The term Monogenes might mean "only" or implied as "monos" in the LXX, which could diminish the significance of "\-genes\." However, "mono" need not be strictly numerical and could indicate "highly beloved," similar to "agapeton" in the LXX\. Vos suggests that John may emphasize the "\-genes" portion, implying "begetting" \(gennasthai\) or "being born" \(gignesthai\), arguing for a translation as "Only Begotten Son," tying it to the incarnation and potentially to Trinitarian pre\-existence, though this isn't definitively settled\. __Eternal Pre\-Existence and Divine Sonship\. __Jesus is depicted as the Bread from heaven, implying pre\-existence there\. Instances of Monogenes as eternal generation appear in John 1:18, the transfer of life from Father to Son in John 5:26, and other passages like John 3:16, 18, and 1 John 4:9\. Monogenes is unique to Jesus and not ascribed to believers, reinforcing His divine and eternal origin, as highlighted in John 3:12 regarding being born from heaven\.

__Chapter XIII: The Son of Man\.__

__Critical Approaches to "Son of Man\."__ The religionsgeschichtliche school often links biblical material with Oriental mythology or Hellenistic syncretism, suggesting an ancient pagan "Son of Man" figure, or Urmensch\. This concept is tied to figures like Babylonian Marduk and Assyrian Sennacherib, emphasizing aspects like incarnation and ascent into heaven\. Hellenistic literature, through Philo and Gnostic speculation, uses the term to refer to mankind as a whole\. However, Geerhardus Vos argues there's no evidence of a real connection between these pagan conceptions and the biblical figure in Daniel or the Gospels, as their meanings and functions differ significantly\. __Occurrences in the Gospels\.__ Most of the 80 instances of "Son of Man" in the Gospels appear after Caesarea Philippi, during the closing period of Jesus' life, suggesting attempts to restrict its use to apocalyptic contexts\. Scholars try to eliminate early instances through three methods: discovering a generic use of the phrase, assuming editorial insertions, or rearranging chronology\. Pre\-Caesarea occurrences need not imply eschatology, though they sometimes relate to judgment\. Vos sees these early mentions as foreshadowing the glory and parousia anticipated in later ministry stages\. __The Parousia and Suffering\.__ The phrase "Son of Man" spans both Jesus' humanity and His divine role in parousia\. This is emphasized in contexts close to Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection, such as in Mark's ransom passage\. Although Jesus is the Son of Man, He foretells suffering and death\. Manuscripts sometimes interchange "Son of Man" and "Son of God," particularly in Jesus' self\-designation, underscoring His transcendence and preexistence as seen in John’s Gospel\. __The Evangelists' Focus on Human Nature\.__ The evangelists emphasize Jesus' human nature, evident in Mark 2:27\-28, where the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, and in John 6:27, 51, 62, indicating preexistence and future parousia\. The term "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' identification with humanity\. __Context in Paul and Hebrews\.__ Paul and the book of Hebrews refer to Psalm 8, not Daniel or Ezekiel, diverging from the traditional Jewish context\. Jesus uses "Son of Man" sometimes to veil His Messiahship, though Vos asserts this secrecy wasn't specifically tied to this title alone\. __Use and Exclusivity of the Term\.__ Early Christians, as seen in non\-Gospel New Testament texts, largely avoided using "Son of Man\." Vos attributes this to the term being exclusively Jesus' self\-designation, reflecting His preference to use a name distanced from potential Jewish misinterpretations of the Messianic role\.

__Chapter XIV: The Saviour\.__

__Understanding “Saviour” in the Gospels and the Dual Meaning in Greek\. __Several aspects of Jesus's mission are described in the Gospels, with "Savior" being the most characteristic and comprehensive term\. This term is expressed in Greek as "soter," "soteria," and "sozein\." The Greek "sozein" has two meanings: to deliver and to heal, the latter often used in the context of Jesus's healing miracles\. In ancient church thought, influenced by Stoicism, Jesus was seen as a physician of souls\. Vos clarifies that "sozein" in the Gospels, while connoting healing, never describes it from a purely medical viewpoint\. Instead, the healing acts serve a higher purpose—a transference from death to life—making "sozein" a religious term distinct from its Hellenic usage\. For example, Mark 5:23 speaks of saving and thus living\. Additionally, no perceptible difference exists between disease removal and demon expulsion, as both belong to the Kingdom's redemptive movement\. 

__Healing and Deliverance in Jesus’s Ministry\. __In some cases, "sozein" applies where no disease is involved, indicating that the two uses—healing the diseased and deliverance from death—are interconnected in Jesus's mind\. This conclusion is supported by translations such as the Septuagint and the Syriac Peshitta, which use "sozein" in the sense of giving life, shown by the Peshitta’s rendering with "achjah" \("to cause to live"\)\.__ Spiritual Sense of Salvation\. __In the spiritual sense, "sozein" is illustrated in passages like Matthew 16:25\-27/Mark 8:35\-38/Luke 9:24\-26, where saving one's life is associated with losing or finding it for Jesus's sake\. Here, salvation aligns with life\. Other passages \(e\.g\., Matthew 10:22; 24:13/Mark 13:13\) suggest endurance leads to salvation, escaping judgment to gain eternal life\. In John's Gospel, salvation equates to having eternal life, and "sozesthai" \(to be saved\) is opposed to "apollusthai" \(to be lost\), with salvation meaning receiving life over falling prey to death\.  __Objective and Subjective Aspects of Life\. __The Bible presents two aspects of life: the older objective aspect represents the sphere of blessedness under God's favor, while the subjective aspect—the spiritual possession—arises from this objective dimension's spiritualizing\. This transition is dominant in John's Gospel\. Consequently, being saved involves a negative element \(escaping judgment\) and a positive one \(entering blessedness in the kingdom\)\.__Verb and Noun Forms of Salvation\. __The distinction between verb and noun forms of salvation is noteworthy\. "Soteria" often expresses a resultant state more concretely than "diasozesthai," which connects with joy from deliverance\. In Paul's writings, "soteria" is seen in the past, present, and future for believers, as seen in Romans 5:9 \("we shall be saved"\)\. __Theory of Pagan Influence and Response\. __The terms "Soter" and "soteria" were prevalent in pagan circles, especially mystery religions\. Vos finds a pagan derivation implausible and unnecessary due to its religious roots in the Old Testament\. Harnack suggests a derivation from the cult of the emperor, drawing on verses like Philippians 3:20\. Vos acknowledges the term's sudden emergence in pastoral epistles but attributes it to continuity with Old Testament and New Testament usage\. Although the Gnostics favored "Soter" over "Kyrios," Vos contends "Soter" marks Jesus as the ultimate Uplifter, incompatible with modernized historical interpretations that diverge from the Gospel depiction\.

__Chapter XV: The Messianic Death\.__

__Gospel Presentation of Jesus's Death\.__ The Gospels present the death of our Lord as the core and climax of  His earthly life, supported by the chronology documented within them, where His passion serves as a finale, with no further actions or teachings post\-mortem\. This notion is contested by modernists who question the Gospel writers' reliability\. __Modern Theories and the Death of the Messiah\.__ A modern theory suggests that Jesus's death was simply that of a martyr, lacking a specific theory of atonement\. However, Jesus's consciousness of His Messiahship is inherently tied to His knowledge of His impending death\. He viewed the prospect of death through a Messianic lens, making any conception of Messiahship without the aspect of death inconceivable except abstractly\. Thus, His death was neither a surprise nor an unwelcome event in His mission\. __Biblical References to Jesus's Death\.__ Multiple references to Jesus's death can be found in the Gospels\. For example, in passages like Matthew 9:15, Mark 2:20, and Luke 5:35, He refers to the time when the bridegroom is taken away, interpreted by Vos as foretelling His Messianic death\. These references arise later in His ministry, specifically after the episode at Caesarea Philippi, because Jesus only began instructing His disciples on Messiahship at this point\. Therefore, teachings on His death naturally followed His Messianic teachings to correct any interpretations of Messiahship that excluded His sacrificial death\. __Predictions of Passion and Death\.__ Vos asserts that Jesus's conviction of His Messianic calling and an awareness of His impending Messianic death were pre\-existing within Him and were revealed only to His disciples\. This is evidenced by three notable predictions about His passion and death, found in Matthew 16:21\-28, Mark 8:31\-9:1, Luke 9:22\-27; Matthew 17:22, Mark 9:30\-32, Luke 9:43\-45; and Matthew 20:17\-19, Mark 10:32\-34, Luke 18:31\-34\. In these passages, Jesus emphasizes that His coming death is integral to His Messianic mission, using the term "dei" \(it must\), denoting the necessity of fulfilling Scripture and an intrinsic soteric purpose\. This necessity is not driven by blind fate but by God's rational purpose\. __Jesus's Death as Vicarious Atonement\.__ Jesus did not face death as an inescapable consequence or a mere example for others\. Instead, He proclaimed giving His life specifically as a ransom for many, indicating vicarious atonement\. This was contrasted with the notion of what one might give in exchange for his life, reminiscent of Psalm 49:7\-9 and Job 33:23\-26, where the abstract idea of a vicarious ransom is noted but seen as impossible concretely—save for the death of Christ\. Jesus's teachings allude to Isaiah 53, especially in Mark 10:45: "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many," aligning with the suffering servant motif of Isaiah\. __Lord's Supper and Sacrificial Context\.__ In the Synoptics and Pauline letters, the concept of Jesus's death is integral to the Lord's Supper narrative\. This narrative presents Jesus giving His flesh and blood, broken and poured out, indicating a sacrificial act\. The cup of blessing ties to the Passover tradition, symbolizing vicarious atonement and forming the basis for a new covenant \(diatheke\), akin to the Old Testament berith, involving feasting and sacrificial inauguration\. The Lord's Supper embodies this, with its institution, proclamation, and remembrance of Jesus's death as a testament\. __John's Gospel and the Sacrificial Mission\.__ While the vicarious atonement is less explicit in John's Gospel, it is evident in passages where Jesus voluntarily lays down His life for friends \(John 15:13; 10:18\)\. Additionally, the Gospel features a priestly perspective, particularly in the High Priestly prayer of John 17, underscoring the theological depth of His sacrificial mission\.
