__Images of the Spirit – Meredith Kline__

__Chapter One: The Glory\-Spirit and His Human Image__

Kline distinguishes between the question of man's essence and the theological inquiry into the image of God in humanity\. The discussion is centered around the role of the Glory\-Spirit, a recurring divine presence throughout biblical narratives\.

__The Glory\-Spirit at the Creation\. __The Spirit is seen hovering over the waters during creation, guiding Israel through the wilderness \(with Moses referring to the wilderness as *tohu* or formlessness\), and manifesting as the Creator Spirit in Psalm 104, characterized by a theophanic cloud\-and\-wind appearance\. The Spirit's involvement includes events like the Flood and the crossing of the Reed Sea, and the Son's participation at creation is noted in Hebrews 1:2, linking the Genesis narrative to apocalyptic visions in Revelation\.

__The Glory\-Spirit as Archetype\. __Presently involved in creation, the Glory\-Spirit serves as a marker for the telos of creation, an Alpha\-archetype leading to the Omega\-Sabbath\. The heavens, in their grandeur, are a copy of God's archetypal Glory, much as humanity is God’s image via the Spirit's inbreathing\. This connection is elucidated in the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ, shedding light on the apocalypse of Elohim in Genesis 1, portrays our view of the Spirit in Genesis 1 as the theophanic Glory, the divine archetype for the creation of man in the image of God\.

__Toward a Reconstruction of the Image\-of\-God Concept\. __Kline explores varying dimensions of the Image\-of\-God concept: *Official\-Functional Aspect*\. God's kingship within the Glory with angels reflecting this image, suggesting a dominion aspect for humanity passed on from Adam to his offspring\. *Ethical Aspect*\. The attributes of holiness, righteousness, and truth are associated with this image\. *Formal\-Physical Aspect*\. The image is the bodily reflection of the theophanic and incarnate Glory \(if Christ is meant by this, it is very similar to Barth’s Christology\)\. Kline argues against Barth’s relational view \(that the image is reflected especially in the relationship between man and woman\) by drawing attention to 1 Corinthians 11:7, which describes a differentiated glory between man and woman\. The image is retained after the fall in such a way as to be guilty; the “naked image\.”

__Chapter Two: A Priestly Model of the Image of God\.__

Kline considers the transformation promised in Pauline letters, where believers are urged to 'put on the new man' – akin to Christ and resurrection glory – reminiscent of being clothed with a heavenly tabernacle\-house, as noted in 2 Corinthians 5:1\-4\. 

__The Tabernacle – A Replica of the Glory\-Spirit\. __In producing the tabernacle as a symbolic image of his Glory\-Spirit, the Creator Lord so designed it that it also recapitulated the macrocosmic and microcosmic versions of the Glory\-temple, which he fashioned in the original creation\. And as God crowned the finished Genesis creation with his majestic Glory over Eden, so, when the tabernacle stood complete at Sinai, the Glory\-cloud covered and filled it, sealing it as an authentic likeness of the Spirit\-temple \(Exod\. 40:34ff\.\), the Alpha and Omega of all creation\.

__Aaron's Robes \- A Replica of the Glory\-Tabernacle\. __Aaron's priestly vestments are modeled after the tabernacle, and by extension, the Glory\-Spirit\. The garments reflect multilayered coverings similar to the theophanic cloud, further symbolizing the divine representation in priesthood\.

__Glory\-Investiture in the New Testament\. __The church\-bride of Revelation 21 is portrayed as a priest figure, arrayed in holy tabernacle\-vestments of glory\. Thus, the Book of Revelation, in making its symbolic statement that the church glorified is a church renewed in the image of God revealed in Christ, equates this image renewal with a priestly investiture in the Glory of God\. 

__Image\-Investiture and Covenant\. __The parable of human marriage\-covenant \[Ezekiel 16\] was fully exploited in the revelation of redemptive re\-creation and covenant\. The church\-bride, derived from Christ, the second Adam, as glory of his Glory and spirit of his Spirit, is a re\-creation in his image\. As a likeness of derivation, like that of the woman in relation to the man \(and the son in relation to his father\), the glory\-image of the church\-bride is possessed under the authority of her husband\-Lord\. Christ takes his church, his image\-wife, in covenant of marriage to bear his glory and his name, to be the fulness of him who fills all in all\.
