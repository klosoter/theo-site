__Nature and Scripture – Cornelius van Til \(The Infallible Word, 263\-283, 295\-301\)__

__1\. The Natural Theology of the Confession__

Scripture addresses its own necessity, authority, sufficiency, and perspicuity, and similarly regards nature\. In the covenantal framework \(covenant of works\), Scripture is the written expression of God's covenantal relationship of grace\. God reveals Himself through both nature and grace\. He is depicted as an infinite being characterized by attributes like glory, blessedness, and abundant truthfulness, among others\. This God reveals Himself voluntarily\.

__1\.1 The Philosophy of History__\. Van Til suggests that natural revelation loses its fruitfulness without the complement of supernatural revelation\. Covenantally, revelation is conditional and subject to breaking, implying that revelation in nature and Scripture are mutually insufficient yet mutually enriching\. The concept of unity here suggests an intertwined dependence\.

__1\.2 The Necessity of Natural Revelation\. __Scripture became essential due to Adam's covenant disobedience\. The tree of knowledge underscores the necessity of natural revelation; it had to appear natural to fulfill its extraordinary role\. Post\-fall, nature became cursed, and the natural state is seen through the lens of redemption necessity\. Common grace serves special grace\.

__1\.3 The Authority of Natural Revelation__\. The "tree revelation" commands obedience\. Humans have God\-given faculties to explore nature, where they encounter God's voice akin to His command\. Through analogical thinking, humans are to align with divine thoughts\. All reality, including human consciousness and natural laws, reveals God's authority\. Sin, however, attempts to suppress this divine revelation, yet it remains\.

__1\.4 The Sufficiency of Natural Revelation\. __Natural revelation was never intended to operate independently of supernatural revelation\. After the Fall, it serves specific purposes like rendering humanity without excuse and highlighting nature's curse\. It suffices for its intended purpose of distinguishing those who serve God from those who do not\.

__1\.5 The Perspicuity of Natural Revelation\. __The clarity of God's revelation in nature relies on being part of His total and voluntary self\-revelation\. Nature reveals God's singular, comprehensive plan but not exhaustively\. The psalmist affirms the heavens' undeniable declaration of God's glory\. However, human sinfulness requires the Holy Spirit's gift for proper interpretation, as the "old man" seeks to interpret nature without acknowledging supernatural revelation\.

__2 The Natural Theology of Greek Origin__\. Van Til contrasts the natural theology of Plato and Aristotle, highlighting their approaches to being, knowledge, and divinity\.

__2\.1 The Natural Theology of Plato__\. Plato distinguishes between the world of being \(wholly known\) and the world of non\-being \(wholly unknown\), emphasizing that sensory perception is deceptive, and true knowledge comes through intellect\. Nature is revelatory not only of God but of man, representing humanity's rational attempt to impose abstract unity on the world of non\-being\.

__2\.2 The Natural Theology of Aristotle__\. Aristotle posits that universals are found within particulars, appreciating the interplay of pure form and pure matter\. He underscores the "correlativity of abstract rationality and pure Chance," differing from Plato\. To Aristotle, if God exists, He is potential or non\-rational, describable only in negative terms and ultimately unknowable\.

__3\. The Natural Theology of Thomas Aquinas\. __Aquinas advocates for analogical reasoning, avoiding univocal or equivocal extremes\. God's essence is approached through "remotion\." Rationality and contingency must remain interlinked, resulting in a phenomenological understanding of being\.

__4\. The Natural Theology of Pre\-Kantian Modern Philosophy\. __

*Rationalism \(Leibniz\)*\. Employs univocal reasoning like pure mathematics, leading to an understanding of God that strips Him of divinity\. *Skepticism \(Hume\)*\.  Utilizes equivocal reasoning, reducing concepts to mere replicas of sensations with psychological laws rather than logical consistency\.

__5\. The Natural Theology of Pre\-Kantian Apologists\. __Figures like Butler and Paley mixed positive \(univocal\) and negative \(equivocal\) arguments\. Their views posited God as partly known through imposed unity but ultimately beyond human comprehension\.

__6\. The Natural Theology of Kant\. __Kant critiques both rationalists and skeptics\. Against rationalists, he rejects exhaustive knowledge \(definition mongers\); against skeptics, he points out their inconsistency\. Kant finds universals among particulars but asserts the "Unconditioned" is beyond rational human relation, making God neither provable nor disprovable\. His phenomenal world relies on conventional law and brute fact\.

__7\. The Natural Theology of Post\-Kantian Phenomenalism\. __Modern transcendentalism, as seen in dialectical theology combining Kant and Calvin \(unsuccessfully by Barth & Brunner\), emphasizes anti\-metaphysical stances and autonomous reasoning\. They argue God is both wholly unknown and identical with His revelation\. Van Til suggests only two positions exist: the confession, as per Reformed theology, and rational sufficiency, likened to figures like Plato and Kant, negating the historical process of differentiation\.

__8\. Conclusion\. __Van Til argues that the natural theology of the Confession, which rejects autonomous reason, restores reason and validates its proper use by recognizing the Sovereign God of grace as fundamental to understanding nature\. Without this self\-contained God, there would be no order or rational employment\.
