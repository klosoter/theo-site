__By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation – Richard B\. Gaffin Jr\.__

__1\. Order of Salvation and the Theology of Paul__

__The Study of Paul Today\.__ In recent years, the New Perspective on Paul has invited us to reassess his teachings within the framework of Second Temple Judaism\. This reassessment shifts the traditional focus from the Reformed view, which holds justification as central to his theology, suggesting instead that Paul did not abandon the concept of salvation by works but extended it to include all nations collectively\. This perspective refocuses Paul's message on covenantal and corporate concerns, emphasizing salvation\-historical dynamics involving Israel and the nations, and tends to sideline the importance of individual salvation through faith in the order of salvation\. In contrast, the Reformation perspective remains firm in interpreting Paul as emphasizing the individual's path to salvation\. __Paul as a Theologian – Some Foundations\.__ When engaging with Paul as a theologian, we must frame our understanding through biblical theology and redemptive\-historical interpretation\. His writings emerge from the covenantal history of verbal revelation—both natural and special—that reflects God's role as creator and redeemer\. Revelation unfolds as a historical and diverse process, with Christ representing the endpoint of these "last days" \(Hebres\)\. Through Paul, we encounter a focus on the climactic redemptive acts of Christ\. His letters, rooted in the canonical texts of the New Testament—including thirteen letters and parts of Acts—are God's words delivered through him, not simply Paul’s own thoughts\. __The Problem of Interpreting Paul\.__ Historically, interpreting Paul’s writings presents challenges\. As Peter notes, while Paul’s letters contain complex and difficult\-to\-understand elements, not every aspect of his teachings eludes comprehension\. The occasional nature of his writings means they address specific, personal contexts rather than presenting dogmatic statements, which can lead to varied interpretations\. Yet, it is crucial to remember that while some aspects are challenging, much of Paul’s teaching is accessible and forms a coherent theology\. __Paul as a Theologian\.__ Paul, as an apostle, operates with the authority of Christ, and his theological insights are considered to be God\-breathed\. Paul communicates at a historical moment when redemption has reached its culmination in Christ's death and resurrection\. Our role as theologians today is not so different, as we share this same redemptive context\. The Westminster Confession of Faith aptly describes how Scripture includes teachings that, by good and necessary consequence, are derived from its core\. __Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology\.__ Our exploration in biblical theology is deeply related to systematic theology\. Systematic theology depends on careful biblical theology to present a unified teaching of the Bible across its various topics\. It facilitates a dialogue between these two disciplines, ensuring that Paul’s theology is appreciated within the broader context of the entire New Testament\. Our commitment is to ensure that this dialogue enriches our understanding and reflects the unified message of Scripture as a whole\.

__2\. The Order of Salvation and the "Center" of Paul's Theology\.__

__Does Paul Have an *Ordo Salutis*?__ In examining Paul's theology, the question arises whether Paul is interested in presenting an *ordo salutis*\. Evidence suggests that he is, as seen in the straightforward question, "What must I do to be saved?" to which the answer is, "Believe and you will be saved\." This indicates that, without personal application, redemption remains incomplete\. Redemption, to be true redemption, must result in genuine personal salvation\. __The "Center" of Paul's Theology\.__ Contrary to the idea of a central organizing doctrine or *Zentraldogma*, Paul's theology does not rest on a single theme\. However, analyzing key passages, we find a central concern with the lordship and work of Christ\. For instance, "Jesus is Lord" serves as a theological cornerstone, alongside affirmations such as "I resolved to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified\." Additionally, texts like Romans 4:25 highlight Christ's atoning death and resurrection as core to Paul's theological framework\. __1 Corinthians 15:3\-4\.__ Paul describes the gospel as being "of first importance," reflecting the key truths that "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures" and "was raised on the third day\." These events are not mere facts; they are scripturally rooted and fulfill a redemptive\-historical role\. This positions Christ's death and resurrection, his suffering and glory, as central in Paul's theology, emphasizing the connectedness of *historia salutis* with the application of salvation\. The scriptural fulfillment underscores their consummative eschatological significance\. __The Reality of Sin\.__ Sin in Paul's theology is fundamentally theocentric and anti\-relational, representing an autonomous revolt against and a wilfull rejection of God\. It leads to guilt, enslavement, and corruption, emphasizing sin's universal nature, as all have sinned and elicited God's wrath\. This dual profile of guilt and corruption is addressed through Christ's death and resurrection, bringing justification and sanctification without confusing the two\. __Union with Christ\.__ Paul's understanding of salvation pivots on the concept of union with Christ, rooted in Old Testament covenant language\. This union encompasses solidarity, spanning predestination, historical redemption, and present experience\. Describing believers as being "in Christ" captures an individual as well as a cosmic dimension, integrating representative, legal, and mystical aspects\. This union affects the application of redemption in justification and sanctification, facilitated by the Holy Spirit\. __Union and Justification\.__ Union with Christ encompasses both renovative \(Christ in me\) and forensic \(Christ for me\) dimensions, presenting a relational bond that manifests through justification and sanctification\. In this unified experience, "Christ in us" aligns with "Christ for us," indicating that both dimensions coexist harmoniously within the believer's life\. __The Role of Faith\.__ Faith is central to establishing the believer's union with Christ, acting as the bond from the believer’s perspective\. It calls sinners into fellowship with Christ, effectively dealing with sin, guilt, and corruption\. While individual salvation is emphasized, this does not overshadow the corporate and cosmic dimensions of salvation manifest in the body of believers and creation's longing for redemption\. __The Center of Paul's Theology and the Order of Salvation\.__ The essence of Paul's theology is union with the exalted Christ, initiated by Spirit\-created faith\. Consequently, concepts like justification and sanctification are consequences of this union\. Paul's message and focus lie not in isolated acts like imputation but in the comprehensive relationship established by faith\. __Justification in the Order of Salvation\.__ According to Gaffin, Paul's approach to justification is predominantly soteriological, aligning with Reformed views that prioritize individual salvation over corporate\-salvation theories like those emphasized by the New Perspective on Paul\. Justification is multifaceted, best seen in the parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5\. This highlights justification's role within the redemptive\-historical narrative, underscoring its forensic nature and rootedness in union with Christ\. Here, justification is neither a mere stand\-alone act nor based on the believer themselves but is deeply integrated into the believer’s union with Christ, forming the foundation of their righteousness\.

__3\. The Order of Salvation and Eschatology\-I\. __

__Eschatology and Anthropology\.__ In examining eschatology and anthropology, Paul's writings illustrate an aspectival distinction in believers between the "outer man" and the "inner man," as seen in 2 Corinthians 4:16\. This distinction is not dualistic but highlights differing aspects of human existence\. The outer self, representing our bodily existence, is subject to decay, while the inner self, the core of our being, experiences renewal\. This reflects the already\-not\-yet structure of our union with Christ, where benefits are partly realized inwardly but await future fulfillment outwardly\. In this framework, we "walk by faith, not by sight," aligning our current life with future promises\. __Union with Christ and the Resurrection\.__ The concept of union with Christ underscores the solidarity and continuity between His resurrection and ours\. Christ is the "firstfruits" of the resurrection, indicating both temporal priority and an integral connection\. His resurrection signifies the inception of our own, not merely a future guarantee, as they form parts of the same redemptive event\. Thus, those united with Christ already partake in spiritual resurrection, while a future bodily resurrection awaits, completing the eschatological promise\. __Indicative and Imperative\.__ Paul's theology interweaves the indicative, "You have been raised with Christ," with the imperative, "seek the things above\." This dynamic illustrates that believers are to pursue what is already theirs in Christ actively\. This relationship, where the imperative flows from the indicative, is both irreversible and inseparable\. Indicative without imperative risks antinomianism, while imperative without indicative leads to legalism\. Ridderbos suggests viewing both as objects of faith, with receptivity in the indicative and activity in the imperative, encouraging believers to become what they are in Christ\. __Historical and Theological Reflections\.__ Historically, the Reformed tradition has emphasized justification, often at the expense of fully appreciating the "already" aspects of resurrection and sanctification in a believer's life\. This has led to a tendency to see sanctification as merely a response to justification\. However, the scriptural emphasis on the union with Christ and the transformational reality of resurrection calls for an integrated understanding that sees both justification and sanctification as vital and concurrent aspects of salvation\. This integration acknowledges the ongoing transformation of the believer, aligning earthly experience with heavenly identity, as God works within to fulfill His purpose\.

__4\. The Order of Salvation and Eschatology\-II\.__

__Eschatology and Justification\.__ Returning to the forensic aspect of salvation in Paul, we explore how his teachings on justification intersect with the already\-not\-yet anthropology evident in union with Christ\. This aspectual distinction between the inner and outer self provides a framework for understanding the transformative and eschatological dimensions of justification\. __Initial Considerations\.__ Romans 8:1 states, "There is now no condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ\." This is viewed by the Reformers as an eschatological verdict brought into the present, contrasting with the Late Medieval perspective of uncertainty\. Traditionally, in the Reformed view, justification is seen as a completed act in the "already" with no delay toward finality; however, Gaffin suggests that Paul's theology also entertains future aspects of justification\. These future dimensions are considered in light of Paul's soteriology and eschatology, his understanding of death and resurrection, adoption, and the final judgment\. __The Perspective of the Westminster Standards\.__ The Westminster Standards acknowledge a future aspect of justification, positing that Christians will ultimately be acknowledged and acquitted in the final judgment\. This contributes to a confessional basis for a future element within justification that aligns with Reformed orthodoxy, distinguishing it from more modern interpretations such as those offered by the New Perspective on Paul\. __Justification as Future\.__ There is a presumptive argument for a future judgment tied to the resurrection and the final judgment—both reflective of Paul's distinct eschatological framework\. Union with Christ in His resurrection is seen as both a transformative and judicial act, with death and resurrection possessing forensic import\. While death is the penal consequence of sin, believers proactively experience its provisional removal by faith, yet await its full abrogation by sight\. Adoption language in Romans 8 encapsulates this dual reality of being declared justified by faith now, while anticipating public justification in the future\. __The Final Judgment\.__ Recounted in 2 Corinthians 5:10, believers will appear before Christ's judgment seat to account for actions taken in the outer self\. Future judgment incorporates works not as instrumental for salvation but as evidence of genuine faith—a theme resonant with the Westminster Confession\. Believers' bodily resurrection prior to judgment signals their conformity to Christ's image, making final judgment an acknowledgment of what resurrection has already commenced in them\. __Faith and Obedience\.__ Paul introduces a complex relationship between faith and works for the elect, distinguishing between what faith is and does\. This dynamic includes works as both antithetical and complementary to grace, illuminating the biblical concept of the "obedience of faith" where obedience is a fruit of faith, not its root\. __Paul and James\.__ Echoing Machen, Gaffin suggests that the faith critiqued by James differs from the faith commended by Paul\. James condemns a professed faith devoid of action, while Paul affirms faith that results in loving works—marking a unity in their messages when understood through the lens of obedience and genuine belief\. __Justification and the Present\.__ Paul assures that those justified are firmly secured in their status, shielded from falling away\. Romans 8:31\-34 underscores the forensic theme, positing Christ's death, resurrection, and intercession as ongoing supports for justification\. God as the justifier and Christ's active intercession assure believers of their justified standing, underscoring justification as an ongoing reality pivotal to Christian assurance and perseverance\.
