__Resurrection and Redemption – Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

__*Introduction\. *__First, Reformed theology, which is distinctively Pauline, has traditionally prioritized soteriology with a primary focus on justification\. In this context, the resurrection of Christ has often been understood mainly in terms of atonement, with limited attention given to it as the initial phase of the state of exaltation\. Second, the Biblical Theology approach is highlighted in Reformed circles through the works of Geerhardus Vos and Herman Ridderbos\. Vos's studies on Pauline eschatology and Ridderbos's work, "Paul: An Outline of His Theology," both conclude that the central theme in Paul's theology is not justification or the order of salvation, but rather the history of salvation\. They emphasize that history reached its eschatological realization in the death and, especially, the resurrection of Christ\.

__*Part One: Methodological Considerations*\. __In Part One of "Resurrection and Redemption," Gaffin considers Geerhardus Vos's methodology regarding the Apostle Paul\. Several key points emerge\. __First__, Vos views Paul as a thinker engaged in a common theological enterprise while safeguarding the authority of Scripture\. This approach contrasts with Abraham Kuyper’s rejection of Biblical Theology\. Kuyper believed that Scripture *serves as material* for theology but is not theology itself\. He argued that theology requires established dogmas and an institutionalized Church infrastructure, neither of which are explicitly present in Scripture\. For Kuyper, the proper progression is from *Scripture to the church, then to dogma, and finally to dogmatic theology*\. __Second__, comparing the perspectives of Kuyper and Vos, Kuyper saw Paul using stylized, symbolic\-aesthetic language characteristic of the East, while Vos perceived Paul as highly doctrinal and synthetic\. Kuyper emphasized discontinuity between various theological elements, whereas Vos recognized both continuity and discontinuity\. __Third__, while Kuyper’s perspective aligns more characteristically with traditional Reformed attitudes, Vos's approach appears more suitable for understanding Paul\. Vos underscores that redemption \(acts\) and revelation \(words\) go hand in hand, with revelation serving to authenticate and interpret redemption\. This is especially significant in Pauline interpretation, as we find ourselves in a situation similar to Paul's, reflecting on Christ's *historia salutis* but without the same apostolic authority\. Vos emphasizes that there is a common redemptive\-historical index that aids our understanding\. Vos’s method also includes a survey of the progression of redemptive history in the Old Testament and maintains that the New Testament shares this interpretative enterprise\. According to Vos, Scripture inherently contains theology, which contrasts with Kuyper’s view\. This validates Vos’s methodology in two key ways: it acknowledges the *common context and interpretative interest* shared with Paul, and it does justice to Paul as a theologian\. The conclusions and consequences of this approach are significant\. Viewing Paul as a theologian means that Scripture determines both the content and method of theology\. It also helps define the central problem of Pauline interpretation\. While recognizing that Paul's teachings are primarily accessible through his letters and some recorded sermons rather than doctrinal treatises, Vos asserts these writings still reflect a coherent theological structure\. Furthermore, understanding Paul as a theologian helps pinpoint the fundamental task of Pauline interpretation, which is to explicate the history of redemption\. Finally, Vos sees Paul as a mastermind whose primary interest lies in elucidating the history of redemption, thus guiding contemporary theological reflection on Christ’s work in a manner consistent with the Biblical and redemptive\-historical framework\.

__*Part Two: The Resurrection of Christ in Paul’s Soteriology: The Central Theme and Basic Structure*__

In Part Two of "Resurrection and Redemption," Gaffin delves into the central theme and structure of Paul's soteriology, focusing on the resurrection of Christ\. Gaffin highlights an often\-overlooked unity and coherence within Paul's teachings: the intimate connection between Christ's resurrection and the future resurrection of believers\. 

*The Resurrection of Christ and the Future Resurrection of Believers\. *Gaffin emphasizes that in 1 Corinthians 15:20ffv, Christ is described as the "firstfruit" of those who have died\. This term, drawn from the offerings, signifies not just a temporal precedence, but an organic connection\. Christ's resurrection represents the beginning, not just a guarantee, of the resurrection of believers\. This interconnectedness is also seen in Colossians 1:18, where Christ is called the "firstborn from the dead\." In both 1 Corinthians 15:12\-19 and II Corinthians 4:14, the inseparable unity between Christ’s and believers’ resurrection is evident—one cannot occur without the other, making them episodes of the *same event*\. 

*The Resurrection of Christ and the Past Resurrection of the Believer\. *Paul also discusses the believers’ resurrection with Christ in the past tense, as seen in Ephesians 2:5\-6 and Colossians 2:12\-13\. This past resurrection signifies a transformation from being objects of wrath to recipients of God’s mercy and love\. Such resurrection is not merely a metaphor but signifies an actual transition in the believer's life history\. Romans 6:3\-11 further ties believers’ new life to their union with Christ’s death and resurrection, underscoring that life post\-resurrection is a key element for Paul\. This experiential and existential union with Christ includes every stage of the order of salvation\. 

*The Union Involved\. *The union believers have with Christ’s resurrection is both historical and experiential\. John Murray argues that the historical resurrection of Christ conditions the ongoing experiential reality in believers’ lives\. Gaffin supports this view, emphasizing the representative and inclusive nature of Christ's actions and destiny for believers\. This talk about *corporate personality* \(Ridderbos\) is only valid under the following conditions: the recognition of \(1\) all aspects \(predestinarian, redemptive\-historical, and experiential\); \(2\) the primacy and constitutive part of Christ in all aspects; \(3\) the *representative* significance of Christ in this relationship\. 

*Summary and Conclusions\. *Paul’s theology demands a distinction between "redemption accomplished" and "redemption applied," seen through an organic bond\. "Raised with Christ" is not merely metaphorical but a realistic description of the initiation of the Christian experience\. There are two structural guidelines to consider: \(1\) the resurrection of Jesus, the believer's initial soteric experience, and the future bodily resurrection of believers, and \(2\) the organic tie between these\.

*The Activity of the Father and the Passivity of the Son\. *The resurrection emphasizes the distinct roles within the Trinity\. Scripture portrays God the Father as the one who raises Jesus, with Christ in a passive role\. There is a deep solidarity with believers: the firstfruit and firstborn on the one hand, and those who sleep and are dead on the other\. Christ’s resurrection is equally representative and vicarious as his death\.

*The Agency of the Spirit\. *Romans 8:11 links the Holy Spirit closely with the resurrection of Christ, indicating that the Spirit who raised Christ will also raise believers\. This connection situates both present and future life in the realm of the Spirit’s activity, showing the Spirit’s instrumental role in resurrection and new life\.

*The Spirit, Glory, Power, and Life\. *Gaffin explores the intimate association of the Spirit with glory, power, and life\. He suggests that the Spirit embodies these attributes, which define eschatological transformation\. Unlike views by Käsemann and Bultmann, who saw the Spirit as impersonal, Gaffin affirms the Spirit’s personhood, illustrated by the Spirit’s emotional capacity \(he can be grieved\) and triadic relationship \(Pauline blessings\) with the Father and the Son\.

__*Part Three: The Resurrection of Christ in Paul’s Soteriology: The Developmentn of the Theme*__*\.* Gaffin delves into how Paul relates the resurrection of Jesus to the realization of redemption in the individual believer's life\. Gaffin specifically examines how the resurrection fits within the order of salvation\.

*The Resurrection of Christ\. *1 Corinthians 15:45f\.: Paul contrasts Adam and Christ, with Adam as a "living being" and Christ as a "life\-giving spirit\." This distinction highlights two contrasting orders of existence: psychical \(earthly\) and pneumatic \(heavenly\)\. The term "life\-giving spirit" refers to the activity of the Holy Spirit, pointing to Christ's resurrection as the foundation for others to share in resurrection life\. Thus, Christ’s transformation in resurrection has both personal and cosmic significance, initiating the age\-to\-come\. 2 Corinthians 3:17: "The Lord is the Spirit" emphasizes that Christ’s resurrection involves a historical relationship with the Holy Spirit\. This is not an ontological identity but a union forged through the resurrection, highlighting the transformative aspect of Christ's work\. Romans 1:3\-4: Paul contrasts Christ’s humiliation and exaltation, suggesting that Jesus was declared the Son of God in power through his resurrection\. This passage does not so much reflect an antithesis between economic and ontological aspects of Christ’s life but rather successive phases—earthly existence followed by exaltation\. Acts 13:33: This verse parallels Romans 1:3\-4 and connects Jesus' resurrection to his authentication \(or adoption\) as the Son of God\. The resurrection becomes the decisive moment in which Christ is publicly declared and inaugurated as the Son of God\.

*Resurrection as the Redemption of Christ*\. Paul sees Christ's resurrection as essential for the redemption narrative\. The resurrection is viewed as the salvation of Jesus as the last Adam, moving from death to the active application of redemption benefits\. Paul's soteriology insists on treating resurrection as a pivotal aspect of Christ’s own redemptive experience\.

*Key Soteriological Themes in Resurrection*\. Adoption: Christ is adopted as the Son of God through the resurrection, emphasizing a declarative aspect\. This mirrors believers' future adoption at their resurrection\. Justification: 1 Timothy 3:16 describes Christ as justified in the Spirit, with the resurrection as the culminating point of this justification\. Romans 4:25 aligns Jesus’ death with our sins and his resurrection with our justification, underscoring that justification is incomplete without the resurrection\. Sanctification:

Romans 6:1ff\. portrays sanctification as a definitive act initiated at the start of Christian life through union with Christ’s resurrection\. Christ's own resurrection signifies his sanctification, transforming from the fallen *sarx* \(fleshly order\) to living to God\. Glorification: 1 Corinthians 15:42 and Romans 8:29 highlight Christ as the firstfruit of glorification, with believers conformed to his resurrected image\. 

*Raised with Christ*\. Three temporally distinct yet organically related events form this union: \(1\) Christ’s own resurrection; \(2\) The resurrection of believers at the inception of their Christian life; and \(3\) The future bodily resurrection of believers\. Paul insists that believers are adopted, justified, sanctified, and glorified with Christ, against the Reformed consensus, which equates being raised with Ghrist as a dogmatic conception of regeneration\. This experiential union in Christ's resurrection is central to Paul’s soteriology, where the aspects of the *ordo salutis *merge into a single transformative event\. The future bodily resurrection must always be seen in connection with the believer's current raised life in Christ\. This underscores that the application of redemption incorporates both present and future aspects of salvation\.

__*Conclusion*__*\. *

Gaffin emphasizes the centrality of the historical accomplishment of redemption in Paul's theology\. He argues that the *ordo salutis* is rooted in being raised with Christ, conceptualized as one act with multiple aspects\. This interpretation, based solely on Paul's writings, is warranted because Paul is a theologian whose biblical basis for the central elements of the order of salvation, particularly in Romans 8:29\-30, stands almost exclusively on Pauline foundations\. Gaffin highlights key differences between Paul's soteriology and traditional Reformed views\. Traditional theology lacks an eschatological perspective, isolating eschatology to glorification alone, whereas for Paul, soteriology itself is eschatological\. Furthermore, traditional theology treats the order of salvation as a series of separate acts, whereas Paul sees them as different aspects of a single, unified act of being united with Christ\. The concept of "regeneration" \(palingenesia\) in traditional theology is critiqued for its limited linguistic and contextual presence in the New Testament, appearing only in Titus 3:5 and Matthew 19:28, where it is used eschatologically\. Therefore, "regeneration" is not a defining feature of Pauline soteriology\. In Pauline terms, the Spirit is the sole source and communicator of life in the soteric sense, correlating Christ as the life\-giver and the sinner as the life\-receiver through a single act of union with Christ\. Gaffin acknowledges this study's limitations, noting the need for it to extend more broadly into Biblical Theology and integrate with Systematic Theology for a comprehensive understanding of Paul's thought\.
