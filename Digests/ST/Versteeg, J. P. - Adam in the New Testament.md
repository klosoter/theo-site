__Adam in the New Testament – J\. P\. Versteeg__

__Translator's Foreword\. __In the introduction, the translator highlights the influence of H\.M\. Kuitert on theological discussions that integrate an evolutionary perspective, noting significant changes in the understanding of sin, guilt, and salvation\. This perspective denies Christ's death as substitutionary atonement\.

__Peter Enns Controversy\. __Enns asserts that evolution is pivotal for interpreting Scripture\. His approach challenges traditional concepts like the Fall and the idyllic state of paradise\. Sin is redefined from human fallibility to an inherent human condition\. He remains silent on the concept of sin as rebellion against God, reducing it to simply falling short, and excluding the notion of living *coram deo*\. Enns proposes that God drove the evolutionary process, resulting in humans with an intrinsic inclination to sin, which he implies diminishes our guilt and attributes it to God instead\. He further suggests that the need for a savior does not depend on a historical Adam, viewing Christ's death not as a penal substitution but merely as necessary for His resurrection, which Enns considers to be historical\. Gaffin questions how this aligns with the resurrection in glory, which negates biological death, a concept seemingly incompatible with evolutionary theory\. Concerns arise that this approach challenges traditional eschatology and protology\.

__1\. Teaching Model \(*Leermodel*\)\.__

Harry Kuitert's concept of the Teaching Model, rooted in his idea of Time\-Boundedness, suggests that figures like Adam and constructs such as the Firmament are expressions of their historical context\. He argues that we interpret and speak of God through the lens of contemporary scientific knowledge\. Kuitert views Adam in Romans 5 as a figure used to illuminate the meaning and scope of Christ's work\. Adam serves as a pedagogical example or teaching model, not requiring historical existence\. Kuitert suggests that Paul's narrative, including distinctions between Eve and Adam's transgressions, is more illustrative than concerned with historical accuracy\. Adam functions solely as an illustration, with no inherent significance beyond what this imagery aims to communicate\. For Kuitert, typology is an end in itself, rather than a means and a tool\.

__2\. The Data of Romans 5:12\-21\. __

__Adam as a Type of Christ\. __In Romans 5:12\-21, Adam is depicted as a type, or "*tupos*," of Christ, signifying an impression or pattern that foreshadows Christ's role\. This typology marks a transition from old to new, from promise to fulfillment\. Unlike allegory, a type is rooted in a specific moment within the history of redemption and points forward to another moment\. According to E\. E\. Ellis, New Testament typology involves three key aspects: i\) the type is integral to God's saving activity; ii\) God's redemptive plan governs the relationship between the type and antitype; iii\) this relationship spans different dispensations, eschewing any cyclical thinking\. Salvation history unfolds in a progressive spiral movement rather than a direct line\.

__The One\. __Paul, in Romans 5, contrasts "one man" with "one man" — Adam and Christ — each serving as a head of the old and new humanity, respectively\. Both are uniquely significant to their followers, with all being affected by one representative\. Adam is not merely symbolic; he functions as the counterpart to Christ as the head of humanity\. __Karl Barth's__ perspective positions Christ as primary or "above" and Adam as secondary or "below\." In Barth's view, Christ serves as the head of humanity, while Adam's role is largely one of appearance, suggesting a disparity based on status or hierarchy—Christ being superior and Adam being one among many individuals\. Rudolf Bultmann extends this line of thought to conclude that if Adam is reduced to an idea rather than a historical figure, then Christ, too, could be conceptualized merely as an idea\. However, Versteeg contrasts this view by emphasizing Paul's focus on the specific actions of Adam and Christ\. For Paul, the critical point is not their hierarchical status but their respective acts: Christ's obedience brings life, and Adam's disobedience results in death\. The disparity lies not in their hierarchical positions or ontological status but in the outcomes of their actions—obedience leading to life and disobedience leading to death—underscoring the representational and historical significance of their roles in salvation history\. Paul's portrayal suggests *representation* in Romans, where Adam’s historical role is central\. Kuitert views Adam as the initial transgressor with a corporate personality, but the emphasis on representation in Romans confirms Adam's determinative presence from Adam to Moses, implying historicity\. Thus, Adam cannot be reduced to a mere teaching model, as his role is foundational to the theological discourse in Romans\.

__3\. Other New Testament Data\.__

__Luke 3:38\. __In the genealogy of Jesus presented in Luke 3:38, Adam is listed as an ancestor, reflecting the meticulous care with which Jewish genealogies were maintained\. This inclusion suggests that Luke considered Adam to be a historical person, as the genealogical record was meant to trace physical lineage accurately\.

__1 Corinthians 15:22, 45\. __In 1 Corinthians 15:22, 45, Paul portrays Adam and Christ as representative heads, with Adam signifying the "earthly" and Christ the "heavenly\." The representation here moves beyond a simple teaching model, as it is fundamentally tied to their actions and roles\. The phrase "in Adam" is paralleled and understood through "in Christ," emphasizing that neither is to be interpreted in a purely local or mystical sense; rather, they are defined by what each accomplished—Adam's act bringing death and Christ's bringing life\.

__1 Timothy 2:13\-14\. __The passage in 1 Timothy 2:13\-14 states that "Adam was created first, then Eve," and that "Adam was not deceived, but the woman was\." While this might appear to reflect a teaching model, it operates with an underlying assumption of historical truth, supporting the notion of Adam as a real historical figure\.

__Jude 14\. __Jude references Enoch as a historical figure, describing him as "the seventh from Adam\." This explicit mention suggests that Adam is regarded as historical within Jude's context, as Enoch's placement in history relies on the historicity of Adam\.

__4\. Rabbinic References to Adam\.__

In rabbinic traditions, Adam is often used as a teaching model\. Kuitert argues that Paul similarly treats Adam as a non\-historical teaching figure\. However, questions arise about whether Paul truly relies on rabbinic theology for this perspective\. In Paul's writings, the first man, Adam, is mentioned explicitly, whereas the concept of a "second man" or "last man" is unique to Paul's Christology and does not feature prominently in rabbinic thought\. This suggests that Paul is not simply borrowing from rabbinic tradition but rather presenting a distinct theological narrative\. The teaching model approach struggles to account for Paul's portrayal, where Adam signifies a historical figure who contrasts with subsequent humanity\. Moreover, in rabbinic theology, Adam is seen as the head of humanity, with his actions having determinative consequences for all people\. His sin is understood to have introduced the "evil impulse" into humanity, a view that aligns with seeing Adam's role as fundamentally historical and impactful, rather than purely illustrative\.

__5\. A Distance Between Intention and Significance? __

Alan Richardson suggests that while modern readers may consider Adam merely an idea, Paul undoubtedly viewed Adam as a historical individual\. This reveals a gap between Paul's original intent and contemporary interpretations, differing from Kuitert's insistence that Paul did not depend on a historical Adam\. The representation of Adam as a type of Christ within a redemptive\-historical framework underscores the need for both figures to have concrete historical existence\. Adam prefigures Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment\. Without a historical Adam, there would be no antitype for Christ to fulfill\. In 1 Corinthians 15, where the resurrection of Christ is presented as non\-negotiable, the attachment to the Adam\-Christ framework insists on the historicity of Adam as essential for the theological narrative of redemption and fulfillment\.
