__Man: The Image of God – Gerrit C\. Berkouwer__

__Chapter 3: The Meaning of the Image\.__

Berkouwer reviews theological views on humanity being created in the image of God\. Historically, theologians like Luther and Calvin broke from earlier distinctions between "image" and "likeness" found in Genesis 1:26\. Modern scholars largely agree that these terms together refer to humanity's resemblance to God, though interpretations of this likeness vary widely\.

__Likeness to God\.__ Humanity’s uniqueness is often debated in terms of dominion, as argued by Socinians, but Ridderbos suggests dominion is a separate endowment following creation\. Barth’s concept of *analogia relationis* ties the divine image to human relationships, particularly between man and woman\. He perceives this as a relational, I\-thou dynamic, though some critiques argue Barth extrapolates too rapidly from individual to communal dimensions\.

__Anthropomorphism and Theological Reflection\.__ Theological reflection excludes humanity's physical body from the image of God, since God does not possess a corporeal form\. Theologians like Calvin and Ursinus resist anthropomorphism, viewing references to God in human terms as metaphoric\. The unique image should reflect man's role as an image bearer in communion with God, a divine characteristic underscored in the second commandment against idols—where humanity seeks to *construct *an “image of God,” although he, himself, in communion with God, should *be* that image in all of his being\.

__Theological Eminence\.__ Bavinck articulates that humans, unlike angels, embody God's image and that pure spirit is not superior to embodied existence\. Kuyper also contends that angels are not the image of God\. Calvin highlights attributes of knowledge, righteousness, and holiness as the essence of the image, leading to conformity to Christ's full image\. Bavinck also argues that the image is even clearer in Christ, who is the image in a unique sense\. Conformity to Christ is soteriological\-pneumatological and consists of a backward by conformity to Christ, rather than a reversal of the original *status gratia*\. 

__Karl Barth__ places Jesus Christ at the center of theological anthropology, advocating an *ontic* perspective\. In Barth’s framework, Jesus is not merely an exemplar of human nature but is foundational to understanding what it means to be human\. For Barth, Jesus embodies the true and original human form, fully revealing humanity's intended essence, as man is completely body and completely soul,  reflecting Christ’s dual nature\. In contrast, both __Bavinck and Calvin__ emphasize a *noetic* approach, where the understanding of human essence is deeply tied to the revelation provided in Christ\. They propose that our knowledge of humanity is not merely derived through empirical observation but is realized through divine revelation that comes to its fullest expression in Jesus\. This perspective places significant emphasis on the relational aspects of knowing, grounded in the theological consequences of the Incarnation, particularly regarding guilt and the fall\. __Eschatological Mystery and Future Revelation\.__ Paul suggests that humanity reaches true nature in the eschatological conformity to Christ \(especially his holiness\), the true *analogia entis*\. This remains an eschatological mystery\.

__Chapter 4\. The Corruption and the Image\.__

Berkouwer distinguishes between the broader sense of the image of God, which is retained, and the narrower sense, which is lost due to sin’s consequences\. Theologically, this leads to debates on dualism and total corruption, emphasizing the nature, not the essence, of humanity's fall into sin, leaving traces or remnants\. __Traces and Total Corruption\.__ The concept of remnants suggests that while the divine image is fundamentally compromised, it’s not entirely eradicated\. The Reformation era, often accused of pessimism, but the Belgic Confession and the Canons of Dordt highlights that enough small remnants or traces remained to render man guilty – the Heidelberg Catechism only mentions total corrupiton\. __Historical Positions\.__ Luther, Flacius, and the Augustana confession strongly emphasized total corruption\. Strigel held a synergist position, while Matthias Flacius took a monergistic stance, arguing that man has become the *image of the devil*, with sin having become man’s essence rather than an accident\. __Theological Implications\.__ The controversy around Flacius \(who wanted to warn against the concept of *privation*\), accused of Manichaeism for asserting sin’s substantive nature, emphasized the need to differentiate human nature from sin itself, allowing for Christ’s incarnation\. Berkouwer highlights that discussions on humanity should always relate to God to avoid abstraction\. __Modern Perspectives\.__ Theologians like Thielicke critique ontological terminology, arguing that personalistic categories, embracing nature, grace, and relational dynamics, better describe fallen humanity\. Scripture teaches total corruption but a limited curse, derived from God’s mercy in Christ, not from a limited corruption\.

__Chapter 8\. Creationism and Traducianism\.__

The church and theology have always been interested in the origin of man \(as a human race\), particularly as they relate to embracing monogenism—an idea supported until more recent developments in biological sciences\. __*Humani Generis* and Catholic Doctrine\.__ The 1950 Catholic encyclical Humani Generis affirms a literal\-historical interpretation of Genesis and supports monogenism, maintaining that the soul is immediately created by God\. This stance aligns with creationism, emphasizing that polygenism conflicts with the doctrine of original sin, which relies on a single Adam\. It has a cautious submission to modern science but with clear boundaries \(the soul and original sin\)\. __Protestant Views on the Soul\.__ Within Protestant circles, discussions focus on how the soul originates concerning the inheritance of original sin\. Creationism posits a vertical, divine act for each soul's creation, while Traducianism suggests that individual souls emanate from ancestral human substance, requiring no new divine act\. __Augustine and Church Tradition\.__ Augustine avoided taking a firm stance between these views, and historical church condemnation of pre\-existentialism left the debate open, with Lutherans often leaning towards Traducianism while Calvinists and Catholics favor creationism\. Bavinck notes that while Lutherans view the *imago Dei* as lost post\-fall, making soul origin less significant, Calvinists consider the divine image as eternal, thus supporting creationism due to a belief in humanity's unique individuality\. __Bavinck and Kuyper's Perspectives\.__ Bavinck argues that even after the fall, the essential divine image persists in humanity, thus supporting creationism as reflective of humanity's unique, individual personality\. He critiques Traducianism for neglecting the unity of man except within original sin's context\. Kuyper, emphasizing human unity and organic interconnection, advocates a concept he describes as psycho\-creationism, where the soul and body are relationally connected, and sin's inheritance is spiritual\. Kuyper does not avoid the tension these views create, acknowledging that direct acts of creation suggest closer divine proximity than indirect acts like mediation\. __The Broader Theological Implication\.__ Berkhof critiques the dichotomy between Creationism and Traducianism as unproductive, asserting that both should be seen as unified acts of God\. He warns against the false framing of these views as mutually exclusive, noting that Scripture does not decisively solve this debate, nor should it intend to\. __Scriptural References\.__ While scriptures like Genesis 2:7, Ecclesiastes 12:7, and Hebrews 12:9 support concepts of direct divine creation, others like Genesis 2:21 and 1 Corinthians 11:8 are cited in discussions supporting Traducianism\. Nonetheless, these texts do not definitively address the origin of the soul in substantive terms but rather engage broader spiritual and theological themes\. __Final Thoughts on the Debate\.__ The discourse remains unresolved, marked by elements of dualism in both theories\. This unresolved status underscores that humanity's relationship with God is ultimately a mystery, rooted in divine revelation in Jesus Christ rather than solely in theological or scientific inquiry\. __Conclusion__\. Calvinist, Catholic, and Greek traditions typically support creationism, advocating for the soul as a direct creation by God, highlighting individuality and the *imago Dei*\. In contrast, Lutheran theology favors traducianism, viewing the soul as inherited from parents, aligning with the concept of original sin’s transmission\. __Critique and Dualism\. __A critique of creationism doesn’t automatically lead to accepting traducianism\. Traducianism tries to avoid dualism by blending creation with generation but still faces dualistic challenges regarding the spiritual aspect of human existence\. Both creationism and traducianism view humans as composites of body and soul and grapple with dualism\. Since Scripture does not clarify soul origination, understanding the mystery of man transcends theological or scientific explanation and is best approached through divine revelation in Jesus Christ\.
