__Resurrection and Redemption – Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

__Reformed Theology's Narrow Pauline Focus\. __Reformed theology is distinctively Pauline, prominently focusing on soteriology, particularly justification\. However, the resurrection of Christ often finds itself narrowly understood within the framework of atonement, with early phases of Christ's exalted state receiving limited attention\. This reflects a broader trend where key theological constructs remain somewhat narrowed to just one facet of Christ's redemptive work\.

__Biblical Theology on Paul\.__ In Reformed circles, Biblical Theology offers a broader approach, informed significantly by Vos’s analysis of Pauline eschatology and Ridderbos’s comprehensive mapping of Pauline theology\. Their collective conclusions suggest that the central theme of Paul's writings is not the justification or the sequence of salvation \(ordo salutis\) but rather the historia salutis—the redemptive history\. This approach sees the eschatological fulfillment reaching its pinnacle in the death and, most importantly, the resurrection of Christ\. Thus, a shift in focus from individual doctrines to a broader historical context marks a distinctive approach within much Reformed and Pauline scholarship\.

__Part One: Methodological Considerations__

__Vos’s Approach versus Kuyper’s View\.__ Vos, in his exploration of Paul's writings, posits Paul as a thinker with a coherent system, focusing on a Biblical Theology perspective that maintains scriptural authority while offering a comprehensive account of eschatological developments\. Against this stands Kuyper’s objections to Biblical Theology, rooted in his view that such methodologies are overly rationalistic and detached from the experiential reality of faith\. Kuyper argues that scripture should serve as raw material for theological work rather than being theology itself, which requires the structures of dogma and institutionalized church teachings\.

__Contrasting Perspectives\.__ Contrasting Kuyper’s view, Vos portrays Paul not merely as a figure employing symbolic and aesthetic language typical of the Eastern tradition, as Kuyper might argue, but as a deeply doctrinal and synthetic thinker\. Kuyper’s approach reflects a typically Reformed attitude that finds a discontinuity between themselves and Paul, while Vos's approach recognizes both continuity and development between Paul's theology and ours, as we share a common redemptive\-historical index\. __Integrating Redemption and Revelation\.__ In Vos's analysis, redemption \(acts\) and revelation \(words\) go hand in hand, where revelation acts as both authentication and interpretation of redemption\. Paul's interpretive work positions us in a shared context, reflecting collectively on the *historia salutis*—Christ’s redemptive history\. Biblical Theology of the Old Testament is a survey of progressive revelation while Biblical Theology of the New Testament is a common interpretive enterprise with the New Testament writers\. __Vindicating Vos’s Perspective\.__ Vos's methodological insights correctly underscore a common context and interpretative interst with Paul and does justice to him as a theologian\. __Consequences of Viewing Paul as a Theologian\.__ 1\. *Scripture Determination*\. As a theologian, Paul exemplifies that scripture determines the content and method for theology\. *2\. Defining the Problem*\. Paul as a theologian helps identify the problem of Pauline interpretation, namely, that he is only accessible through letters and some sermons, which are not doctrinal writings\. *3\. Fundamental Task*\. Paul's theological role helps pinpoint the fundamental task of Pauline interpretation, showcasing his intellectual mastery\. *4\. Interest in Redemption History\.* Above all, Paul’s focus lies in explicating the history of redemption, revealing his overarching theological concern\.

__Part Two: The Resurrection of Christ in Paul's Soteriology: The Central Theme and Basic Structure\.__

__Unity Through Resurrection\.__ Paul's soteriology might seem lacking in structure and unity, yet the central theme that unifies it lies in the connection between the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of believers\. This unity shapes Paul’s entire theology\.

__The Resurrection of Christ and the Future Resurrection of Believers\.__

- *1 Corinthians 15:20ff*\. Paul describes Christ as the "firstfruit," using an offering metaphor to emphasize representative connection rather than mere temporal precedence\. Christ’s resurrection represents the initial phase of believers’ resurrection, highlighting an organic bond\.
- *Colossians 1:18\.* The term "firstborn of the dead" suggests both uniqueness and solidarity\. Christ is positioned as the beginning of the resurrection, signifying more than just chronological order\. It underscores a profound relationship between Christ and believers\.
- *1 Corinthians 15:12\-19\.* Paul stresses the unity between Christ's resurrection and believers’\. Faith in one implies faith in the other, presenting them as episodes of a singular, interconnected event\.
- *2 Corinthians 4:14*\. The passage maintains this unity, focusing on a temporal distinction—Christ raised, believers to follow\.

__The Resurrection of Christ and the Past Resurrection of the Believer\.__

- *Ephesians 2:5, 6\.* Raised with Christ is experiential, marking a transition from divine wrath to mercy through solidarity in resurrection, not merely metaphorical\.
- *Colossians 2:12, 13; 3:1\.* Similar to Ephesians, the believer's resurrection with Christ is experienced through faith, highlighting faith’s instrumental role rather than mere intellectual assent\.
- *Romans 6:3ff\.* Baptism symbolizes union with Christ’s death, leading to a life reflecting his resurrection\. Believers' lives post\-resurrection embody this transformation, illustrating an existential union with Christ\.
- *Galatians 2:19, 20\.* Paul presents co\-crucifixion and co\-resurrection as experiential, reflecting Christ living within the believer\.

__The Union Involved\.__ This union poses the question of timing—historical at Christ's resurrection, yet experiential in believers’ lives\. Gaffin and Ridderbos discuss this as corporate personality, emphasizing predestinarian, redemptive\-historical, and experiential dimensions while maintaining distinct personal identities for Christ and believers\. Paul distinguishes between redemption accomplished and applied, based on an organic bond rather than metaphorical language\. "Raised with Christ" depicts a genuine event starting individual Christian experience\. __Conclusion\.__ Structural guidelines include considering Christ's resurrection from the tomb, the believer’s initial soteric experience in his life history, and future bodily resurrection of the believer, emphasizing a crucial organic connection without fostering dualism between the inner and the outer resurrection of the believer\.

__The Activity of the Father and the Passivity of the Son\.__ Within the resurrection, God is active as Father; Jesus is passive\. This counters any notion of self\-resurrection, reinforced by the firstfruits analogy highlighting the representative and vicarious of Christ’s resurrection as well\. __The Agency of the Spirit\. __The Spirit is intricately linked to Christ’s resurrection, with passages like Romans 8:11 underscoring spiritual solidarity between believers and Christ, where present and resurrection life are both Spirit\-driven\. __The Spirit, Glory, Power, and Life\. __The Spirit is intimately associated with glory, power, and life—the inner and outer symbols of eschatological transformation\. These attributes point to the Spirit as the producer of divine transformation\. __The Person of the Spirit\.__ Against views like Käsemann’s and Bultmann’s that describe the Spirit impersonally, Gaffin supports understanding the Spirit as a person, citing emotional and intercessory capabilities mentioned in Scripture that are consistent with personhood\. This trinitarian dimension in Paul's teachings on resurrection involves distinct contributions from Father, Son, and Spirit\.

__Part Three: The Resurrection of Christ in Paul's Soteriology: The Development of the Theme\.__

Paul's Interplay of Resurrection and Redemption\. This section delves into Paul's explanation of how the resurrection of Jesus impacts the redemption realized in individual believers\. This involves examining its role within the *ordo salutis, emphasizing* Christ's identity as Messiah and second Adam, and its application in believers being raised with Christ\.

__The Resurrection of Christ\.__

__*1 Corinthians 15:45\.*__* *__Christ as Life\-giving Spirit__*\.* Paul utilizes the contrast between Adam and Christ, describing Adam as a living being and Christ as a life\-giving spirit\. This distinction illustrates two aeons—psychical and spiritual—representing broader orders of life\. The verse ties the natural to the spiritual, with the Holy Spirit as an essential player in Christ becoming the life\-giving Spirit, a transformation linked specifically to the resurrection\. __Union with Christ Through Resurrection\.__ Paul's emphasis is that Christ's identity and transformation upon resurrection are foundational for sharing resurrection life\. The transformational aspect of the resurrection is not merely personal for Christ but cosmic, initiating the age\-to\-come with eschatological significance\.

__*2 Corinthians 3:17*\. The Historical Link\.__ The Lord’s identification with the pneuma \(Spirit\) reflects a historical transition rather than eternal ontological identity, bridging redemption’s historical character with the Spirit's transformative power\. 

__*Romans 1:3, 4 and Acts 13:33* Phases of Christ's History__\. The transition from humiliation to exaltation in Christ’s resurrection encapsulates distinct historical phases, affirming Christ's Sonship authenticated through resurrection\. Gaffin highlights that this resurrection doesn't contrast economic and ontological relationships but illuminates Christ's solidarity and the Gospel's essence\. __Resurrection As the Redemption of Christ\.__ The resurrection is the salvation of Jesus as the last Adam\. “*A soteriology structured so that it moves directly from the death of Christ to the application to others of the benefits purchased by that death, substantially short\-circuits Paul's own point of view\. For him the accomplishment of redemption is only first definitively realized in the application to Christ himself \(by the Father through the Spirit\) at the resurrection of the benefits purchased by his own obedience unto death*” \(p\. 117\)\.

__Principal Soteriological Categories\. __

__Adoption through Resurrection__\. Scriptures like Romans 1:3–4 depict Christ as adopted in his resurrection; this declarative event signifies exaltation\. True to the Adamic unity, the resurrection embodies believers' adoption, where Christ's experiences mirror theirs\. __Justification and Resurrection\.__ In 1 Timothy 3:16 and Romans 4:25, Christ’s resurrection is tied to justification, shifting from condemnation in death to justification in life\. Paul asserts that justification is incomplete without resurrection, emphasizing unbroken solidarity in both condemnation and justification\. __Sanctification\.__ Romans 6:1ff posits sanctification as occurring at Christian life’s inception, marking a definitive act where resurrection equals Christ’s sanctification, breaking from pre\-resurrected, fallen worldly order\. __Glorification\.__ Passages like 1 Corinthians 15 and Philippians 3:21 discuss conforming to Christ’s resurrected image, marking glorification as integral to resurrection’s transformative promise\. __Conclusion\.__ Paul's principal soteriological categories—justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification—are each articulated through Christ's resurrection, portraying distinct aspects yet unified in the act of being raised\. 

__Raised With Christ\.__

__Three Unified Events of Resurrection\.__ Theologically, the events of Christ’s resurrection, the believers' spiritual resurrection at conversion, and the future bodily resurrection are temporally distinct yet organically connected\. __Experiential Union over Dogmatic Conception\.__ Contrasting a Reformed consensus that equates having been raised with Christ with regeneration, Gaffin argues that Paul's soteriology centers on union with the resurrected Christ by faith\. This union incorporates various elements of salvation—justification, sanctification, adoption—into a singular realized experience\. This implies a holistic approach to redemption that underscores a unified transformative act rather than discrete steps\. __Organic Inseparability of Resurrection\.__ The inseparability of future bodily resurrection from spiritual resurrection underscores that redemption's application is both a present and a future reality, affirming that being raised with Christ affects every dimension of Christian experience\.

__Conclusion\.__

__Historical Accomplishment and Ordo Salutis\.__ Paul emphasizes the historical accomplishment of redemption, which he views as central to his theology\. This is evidenced in the ordo salutis being deeply rooted in being "having been raised with him," encapsulating multiple aspects within a single transformative act\. __Justification for Being Based on Paul Only\.__ This view centers on Paul only, which is justified because Paul was a theologian with a robust biblical basis for key *ordo salutis* elements\. This perspective is primarily grounded in Pauline texts like Romans 8:29\-30\. __Soteriology in Paul vs\. Traditional Ordo Salutis\.__ Traditional theology often lacks the eschatological perspective integral to Pauline soteriology, seeing eschatology as isolated to glorification\. In contrast, Paul integrates eschatology into the core of his soteriology, portraying the *ordo salutis* not as separate acts but as facets of one encompassing act\. This presents challenges for traditional viewpoints, as it questions whether union with Christ should precede or follow other soteric acts, potentially disrupting the *ordo salutis*\.

Reevaluation of Regeneration\. The traditional understanding of the ordo salutis often begins with the notion of regeneration, though Paul interprets palingenesia differently\. Linguistically, "regeneration" presents challenges, appearing only in Titus and Matthew, and thus doesn't distinctly characterize Pauline soteriology\. Nonetheless, the Spirit remains the sole source and communicator of soteric life\.

Life\-Giving and Receiving Correlation\. There exists a strong correlation between Christ as the life\-giver and sinners as life\-receivers, unified in a single act through union with Christ\. This expresses the comprehensive nature of Paul's theology\.

Limitations and Further Study\. This study acknowledges its limitations and recognizes the need for broader exploration within Biblical Theology contexts while also contributing to future developments in Systematic Theology\.
