__Part I: Redemption Accomplished__

__I\. The Necessity of the Atonement\. __God's love, highlighted in John 3:16, is free, sovereign, and eternal, underlying the doctrine of election before the world's foundation\. This love is intrinsically linked to the necessity of the atonement\. Although election itself was not necessary, being a matter of divine good pleasure, it was grounded in God's love\. The necessity of the atonement arises from questions regarding why the incarnation and atonement were required to restore humanity instead of a mere divine fiat\. There are *two forms of necessity*: hypothetical necessity, questioning if forgiveness could occur without atonement, and consequent absolute necessity, which stems from God's decree to save through free and sovereign grace\. Atonement becomes a necessary outcome of the decree of election, consistent with the divine nature\. While certain actions, such as lying, are inherently impossible for God, the real inquiry is whether Scripture implies that it is impossible for God to save sinners without a vicarious sacrifice\. Biblical passages suggest several points: 

1. Passages like Hebrews 2:10, 17 indicate that the requirements of divine purpose are fulfilled through Christ's sufferings\. 
2. Other scriptures imply that the alternative to atonement is eternal perdition, as seen in John 3:14\-16\.
3. The efficacy of Christ's work hinges on His unique nature, emphasizing the necessity due to sin’s magnitude\. Hebrews 9:23 underscores that while Levitical sacrifices modeled heavenly ones, only Christ’s true sacrifice holds absolute necessity\.
4. Salvation entails not only forgiveness but also justification, which requires righteousness\. Only through Christ's righteousness—achieved through His obedience, incarnation, death, and resurrection—can sinners be justified\.
5. The cross stands as the supreme symbol of God's love\.
6. Sin inherently contradicts God, necessitating His reaction against it through expiation and propitiation, achieved in the sacrifice of the Lord\.

__II\. The Nature of the Atonement\.__

__Obedience\. __In exploring the nature of atonement, obedience plays a key role\. Scriptural references, such as John 6:38 and Romans 5, highlight the contrast between Adam's disobedience and Christ's obedience\. Christ's obedience is multifaceted, encompassing both passive and active elements\. Passive obedience involves Christ willingly yielding his spirit in death\. The distinction between active and passive obedience is not easily attributed to specific actions but serves to highlight Christ's comprehensive obedience, both under penal sanctions and in fulfilling the law\. He learned obedience through suffering, not merely by existence, death, or crucifixion, but by willingly undergoing the crucifixion, thus becoming the perfect Savior equipped through trials, temptations, and suffering\. 

__Specific Categories of the Nature of Atonement\. __

__1\. Sacrifice\. __The concept of sacrifice in the atonement is rooted in Old Testament interpretations, where sacrifices were expiatory, symbolizing the transfer of sin and liability to the offering\. Christ's sacrifice is expiatory, fulfilling Old Testament sacrifices with perfection and efficacy\. New Testament writers apply Old Testament sacrificial terminology to Christ, portraying him as the high priest and sin offering\. Unlike the disproportion between heavenly sacrifices and Levitical ones, Christ's sacrifice is proportional and superior, as he is both the priest and the offering\. Christ's sacrifice, marked by uniqueness, transcendence, and perfection, surpasses Old Testament rituals\. He remains the priest, embodying the efficacy of his sacrifice and interceding for his people\.

__2\. Propitiation\. __Propitiation is integral to Old Testament rituals and carries forward into Christ's sacrifice, involving the covering of sin, resulting in cleansing and forgiveness\. It presupposes divine wrath, aiming to remove it without contradicting God's love and mercy\. Propitiation does not change God's wrath into love; instead, it highlights the marvel of divine love\. God's wrath is a necessary response to sin, addressed through substitutionary atonement in Christ\.

__3\. Reconciliation\. __Reconciliation addresses alienation from God, focusing on restoring divine favor\. Scripture emphasizes God's enmity toward us due to sin, which reconciliation seeks to resolve\. Reconciliation is initiated by God, who reconciles us to himself\. It involves an appeal for harmonious relations by removing grounds of disharmony, akin to reconciling with a brother\. Reconciliation is not about removing enmity but reinstating divine favor\. Romans 5 illustrates reconciliation as an accomplished fact through Christ's death, while 2 Corinthians emphasizes it as God's work, completed through Christ made sin for us, leading to becoming the righteousness of God\.

__4\. Redemption\. __Redemption, distinct from mere deliverance, involves purchase and ransom\. Christ's work, as described in Mark 10:45, is a ransom, substitutionary in nature\. Redemption implies bondage to the law and sin, from which we are delivered\. Christ's redemption frees us from the law's curse and sin's power, addressing both guilt and power dynamics\. This leads to justification, forgiveness, and deliverance from sin's enslavement\. The redemptive power of Christ's death triumphs over sin, raising believers to new life and freeing them from sin's dominion, countering Anselm's notion of ransom to the devil by emphasizing Christ's victory over the devil's power\.

__III\. The Perfection of the Atonement\.__

__Theological Perspectives on Satisfaction\. __The Romish position holds that Christ's satisfaction does not absolve the faithful from making satisfaction for sins committed after baptism, necessitating satisfaction either in this life or purgatory\. In contrast, Protestants assert that Christ's satisfaction is perfect and final, requiring no further atonement\. __Aspects of Perfect Atonement\. __*1\) Historic Objectivity\. *The atonement, accomplished once for all time, predates any human response or recognition, remaining objective and independent of us\. It is a historical event, distinct from being suprahistorical or contemporary, and occurred in the fullness of time, encompassing both the incarnation and redemption\. *2\) The Finality\. *Contrary to the Romish doctrine of the Mass, Christ's sacrifice is a final and unrepeatable event\. While Christ continues his priestly role in heaven, he embodies the efficacy of his earthly sacrifice, interceding as the eternal High Priest\. It is essential to distinguish between the sacrifice and the ongoing priestly ministry\. *3\) The Uniqueness\. *The uniqueness of the atonement lies in the vicarious sacrifice solely performed by the incarnate Son of God\. Unlike the Father, Spirit, angels, or humans, only the Son's sacrifice redeemed us by his blood, reflecting the free counsel and pleasure of God's will\. *4\) The Intrinsic Efficacy\. *The atonement fully satisfies divine justice, extended by God's grace and Christ's self\-giving\. It is a manifestation of the Father's love and grace, and not a mere token payment\. Christ's sacrifice liquidated our debts, securing redemption\. Jesus addressed all requirements arising from our sin and procured all benefits necessary for the liberty and glory of God's children\.

__IV\. The Extent of the Atonement\.__

__For Whom Did Christ Die? __Scripture references phrases like "all men," "all," or "world," yet these do not explicitly determine the extent of the atonement\. Such terms can hold a restricted meaning, not necessarily implying all individuals inclusively\. While the reprobate benefit from Christ's dominion given through his death and resurrection, the key question remains: "On whose behalf did Christ offer himself a sacrifice?" This addresses the question of for whose benefit propitiation, reconciliation, and vicarious atonement were intended\. Christ reconciled us to God effectually and infallibly by his blood, he did not merely enable the possibility of reconciliation\. __Limited Atonement\. __The doctrine of limited atonement posits that if some perish despite an unlimited atonement, it would lack efficacy\. Thus, atonement is limited to the elect, those inheriting eternal life\. This is consistent with the Gospel's full and free offer of Christ, which is not a potential salvation but salvation itself, though limited to the elect\. __Biblical Arguments\. __

*1\) Romans 8:31\-39\. *Paul's usage of "for us all" is contextualized by verses discussing predestination and the elect, underscoring the security of God's love for his elect in Christ\. 

*2\) Union with Christ\. *2 Corinthians 5:14 states that those for whom Christ died have also died in Christ, rising to new life, which aligns with Romans 6:8\. This implies atonement is specific to those who die to sin and live anew, indicating a non\-universal atonement\. 

__I\. The Order of Application__

The order of application of redemption is carefully detailed in scripture, emphasizing God's nature as a God of order\. Redemption is not a single, indivisible act but a structured series of acts and processes\. This idea is supported by several key biblical references\. __John 3:3__ indicates that *regeneration* must occur before the application of redemption, establishing it as an essential initial step\. In __John 1:12__, *adoption* is shown to presuppose the reception of Christ, implicating *faith* as a necessary prerequisite\. __Ephesians 1:13__ suggests that hearing and believing are required before the sealing of the Spirit, reinforcing the sequence whereby faith comes first\. __Romans 8:30__ presents a clear progression of *calling*, *justification*, and *glorification*, pointing to a logically arranged sequence within the broader context of verses 28 to 30\. Furthermore, the relationship between faith and justification is highlighted\. God's justification of believers implies that faith must precede justification\. The sequence thus updates to *calling*, *regeneration*, *faith*, *justification*, and *glorification*\. *Repentance*, being closely linked to faith, contributes to the concept of *conversion*, further refining the sequence to calling, regeneration, *faith/repentance/conversion*, and justification\. *Adoption* logically follows justification, as it signifies the believer's acceptance by God and their status as heirs, arising only after justification\. *Sanctification*, a process beginning with regeneration and grounded in justification, draws grace from union with Christ and naturally follows after adoption\. *Perseverance*, closely related to sanctification, follows as a subsequent phase, culminating in *glorification*\. This running sequence—calling, regeneration, faith/repentance/conversion, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification—captures the intended logical order in the application of redemption as supported by scriptural references and theological understanding\.

__II\. Effectual Calling\. __Effectual calling represents the specific call unto salvation, distinct from the universal call of the Gospel, often referred to as "ineffectual calling\." The author of this effectual calling is God, carried out by his grace, with God the Father identified as the particular agent in calling individuals, as noted in Romans 8:30\. This calling is efficacious and immutable, described as a high, holy, and heavenly calling\. It follows a pattern of determined purpose, eternal and in Christ\. God’s act of effectual calling is also prioritized as the initial act of applying redemption, by which individuals are united to Christ, invoking a response of regeneration\. 

__III\. Regeneration\. __Regeneration addresses the question of how spiritually dead individuals can respond to God's call to fellowship, avoiding a one\-sided view\. The Gospel of God's grace resolves this by effecting a radical change, as seen with Nicodemus in John 3\. Regeneration wholly depends on the Holy Spirit’s action, as illustrated by the elements of being born of water and Spirit in John 3:5 and the Old Testament references such as Ezekiel 36:25\-26\. Regeneration happens prior to ceasing sin and is foundational in the order of redemption, leading to all subsequent steps\. It signifies the beginning of God's grace within believers, resulting in conversion and the exercise of faith and repentance\. 

__IV\. Faith and Repentance\. __While regeneration is solely God’s act, faith represents an activity of the individual by God's grace\. The call of the Gospel is universal, with exhortation and appeal extended to all, supported by the all\-sufficiency of the savior presented\. Faith is not merely the belief that one is saved but involves knowledge, conviction, and trust as described in the Heidelberg Catechism\. Repentance complements faith, involving a change of mind regarding God, self, sin, and righteousness\. It signifies the response of turning from sin toward God\. 

__V\. Justification\. __The question of how a sinful man becomes just with God emphasizes "become" because justification does not make one inherently righteous, which is a process that begins in regeneration and results in sanctification, perfected in glorification\. Instead, justification declares the sinner righteous in a forensic, legal sense, due to the imputed righteousness of Christ\. This righteousness is neither earned by works nor is faith itself the righteousness; rather, it comes through Christ’s sacrificial work\. Justification is conditional upon faith, with God justifying those who believe in Jesus\. 

__VI\. Adoption\. __Adoption is the act by which the redeemed become sons and daughters of God, joining His family\. It is not separable from justification and regeneration, as it is also a judicial act\. Adopted individuals receive the Spirit and are transferred from an alien family into God's family, with God becoming their Father, as affirmed in New Testament references\. 

__VII\. Sanctification\. __Sanctification involves the dethroning of sin, achieved once by union with Christ and the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit\. It is a distinct process where the remaining presence of sin in the believer’s life does not hold dominion but presents a conflict\. The Holy Spirit’s operation in sanctification is mysterious yet indispensable, emphasizing complete dependence on the Spirit of Christ, and symbolizes an ongoing transformation\. 

__VIII\. Perseverance\. __Perseverance ensures that not all who profess faith are secure eternally; true perseverance is evidenced by enduring faith and resistance to sin’s dominion, even though believers can still sin\. Security in salvation is tied to perseverance, as indicated by scripture, with believers being kept through faith until the final consummation\. Those effectively called and justified cannot ultimately fall from grace, consistent with the promise of eternal life given by Jesus\. 

__IX\. Union with Christ\. __Union with Christ is foundational to all steps in applying redemption, representing the believer's position "in Christ\." It provides the basis for salvation through the eternal election of the Father\. Believers are united with Christ in death, resurrection, and exaltation, leading to their recreation, fellowship, and eventual glorification\. This union is spiritual and mystical, involving the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and is revealed through scripture for the purpose of obedience to faith\. Union with Christ also implies unity with the Father and the Holy Spirit\. 

__X\. Glorification\. __Glorification completes the process initiated with effectual calling, focusing not merely on the blessedness after death, but on the destruction of death itself\. It embodies the complete and final redemption of the person, conforming believers to the image of the glorified Redeemer and culminating in the resurrection and renewal of creation alongside Christ's return\. Glorification has cosmic dimensions, correlating the deliverance of creation with the redemption of God’s people, directed toward a new reality where righteousness dwells and God is all in all\.
