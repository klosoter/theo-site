__Gereformeerde Dogmatiek \(Antropologie\) – Herman Bavinck__

__36\. De Oorsprong van de Mens \(The Origin of Man\)__

The creation of humanity marks the apex of the creative process, where the spiritual and material worlds intersect\. According to the Genesis accounts, humans are distinctively made in God’s image through deliberate creation, tasked with dominion over nature, unlike animals created by divine command\. __Cosmology and Anthropology\.__ Humanity is positioned as the culmination of creation, serving as the final purpose and the zenith of nature’s process\. In this context, cosmology addresses humanity's place within the universe, while anthropology focuses on man's unique creation and his beginning in history\. __Myths and Darwinism\.__ Myths portray human origins through figures like demigods, but modern theories like Darwinian evolution dominate contemporary discourse\. Darwinism, emphasizing natural selection and gradual evolution, contends that species, including humans, evolve over time\. However, the reductionist materialism and naturalism of Darwinism face criticism for ignoring the spiritual and unique aspects of human origin\.

__279\.__ __The Critique of Darwinism\.__ Darwinism remains a popular overarching framework but struggles to convincingly explain human origins or the distinct characteristics of humans compared to animals\. Even scientists contest the theory of common descent due to its failure to provide conclusive evidence for species transitions or adequately account for the complexity of human attributes like consciousness, language, and morality\. __Issues with Darwinism\.__ Darwinism doesn't comprehensively address the development of complex organisms or distinguish clearly between humans and animals\. The absence of evidence for gradual transitions between species, alongside inconclusive paleontology and non\-beneficial mutations, weakens Darwinism’s explanatory power regarding human origins\.

__280\. Challenges to the Theory\.__ There is significant opposition to Darwinism due to its inability to provide positive empirical evidence for its claims about human origin\. Critics point out that it cannot explain phenomena like language, social structures, consciousness, religion, and morality, which are integral to human identity\.

__281\. Age and Unity of Humankind\.__ The scientific and theological communities lack consensus on the timeline and unity of human existence\. Scripturally, Adam is depicted as the first human and the progenitor of all, contrasting with speculative theories like pre\-Adamism, which often harbor problematic implications, such as justifying racial hierarchy\.

__282\. Adam's Role and Pre\-Adamism\.__ Adam’s role as humanity's sole ancestor reinforces the unity and connectedness of the human race\. Pre\-Adamism, a theory suggesting multiple or parallel origins, often carries racist undertones and is seen as contradictory to the biblical narrative of human origin\.

__283\. __Origin of Mankind: According to Genesis, humanity originated in Eden, situated near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, presenting a specific geographic origin in biblical terms\. However, scientific discourse from Bavinck’s era offered a range of speculative origins without reaching consensus\.

__37\. Het Wezen van de Mens \(The Nature of Man\)\.__

__284\-5\. Image of God\.__ Humans, created as/in the image of God, reflect divine attributes like righteousness and holiness\. This concept encompasses the whole of humanity, with Jesus as the absolute Image of God, while humans are relative images, being ectypes to God’s archetype\. __Content of the Image\.__ The image includes both physical and non\-physical elements—body, rational nature, will, and moral attributes—highlighting a holistic similarity to God\.

__286\. Incompatibility with Evolution\.__ The evolutionary concept of endless progression challenges the biblical doctrine of the image of God, undermining the theological status of humanity's divinely endowed characteristics \(*status integritatis* and *imago Dei*\)\. Scripture describes humanity as created psychically and physically mature, affirming humanity’s original righteousness and goodness\.

Certainly, here's a more detailed and coherent summary of these sections from Bavinck's work, incorporating the original theological jargon:

__287\. Roman Supernaturalism\. __The Roman Catholic understanding of humanity derives from the concept of *status gloriae*, emphasizing deification as a fundamental aim\. This involves the idea of the *donum superadditum*, an additional gift that elevates human nature beyond its natural state\. In this view, concupiscence, or the tension between flesh and spirit, is seen as a natural condition of humanity's current state\.

__288\.__ In Roman Catholic doctrine, the *status gloriae* and *status gratiae* leads to the blending of the soul with God, anticipating heavenly glory\. Scripturally, however, the benefits of Christ are accessible to believers here on earth in what the Reformed perspective would describe as an "earthly *status gloriae*," without needing additional supernatural or superadded gifts pre\-fall\. The Roman view introduces three concepts of humanity's righteousness\. *Justitia naturalis*: Natural righteousness, where humans are subject to concupiscence but retain the capacity for good\. *Justitia praeternaturalis*: Higher state, with the *donum integritatis* granting elevation above concupiscence\. *Justitia supernaturalis*: Supernatural righteousness, involving the *donum superadditum*\. These imply a gradation between divine and human characteristics, suggesting the necessity of the Incarnation even pre\-fall, without sin, because deification requires God to have become man\.

__289\. Reformed Rejection of this Roman Doctrine\. __Reformed theology rejects these Roman categories as they imply a weakening of the doctrine of original sin\. Within Reformed traditions: *Hervormden* emphasize partial retention or loss of the divine image; *Lutherans* assert a total loss of the image of God, primarily considering its ethical component; and *Calvinists* differentiate between *qualitates naturales* \(natural qualities\) and *dona supernaturalia* \(supernatural gifts\), highlighting distinctions between image \(beeld\) and likeness \(gelijkenis\)\. The *imago Dei* is understood in both broad and narrow senses, explored further through the concept of the *foedus operum* \(covenant of works\), which addresses the development and ultimate purpose of humanity\.

__290\. Reformers\. __Reformers equate *justitia originalis* \(original righteousness\) with *justitia naturalis *in the pre\-Fall condition, viewing it as an integral part of the Image of God\. The fall leads to a partial loss of true humanness, but not a complete forfeiture of human identity\. In contrast *Rome* views the lost righteousness as *supernaturalis*, indicating that humans remain fully human after this loss\. *Lutherans* maintain that the Image of God, equated with *justitia originalis*, was completely lost post\-fall\. This nuanced understanding emphasizes the partial retention of humanity's divine image and the implications for human nature in both Reformed and Lutheran perspectives, contrasting with Roman Catholic views\.

__291\. Image Affirmation\.__ The incarnation of Christ reinforces humanity's status as the image of God\. It signifies that humans, not angels, uniquely reflect the Triune God – the archetype of man – through: soul, heart, body and knowledge, righteousness, and holiness\. “The whole man is the image and likeness of God, therefore, to be human is to be the image of God\.”

__38\. De Bestemming van den Mensch \(The Destiny of Man\)\.__

__294\. Adam vs\. Christ in 1 Corinthians 15\.__ Adam, created from earth/material, is contrasted to Christ who is spiritual\. Therefore, Adam had not reached the highest state yet, as he was neither spiritual nor eternal\. Bavinck concludes that pre\-Fall Adam had not yet reached the glorified state\.

__295\. Testing and Implications\.__ Adam's pre\-fall state allowed for sinlessness and mortality avoidance \("*posse non peccare et posse non mori*"\), contrasting with the glorified state \("*non posse peccare et non posse mori*"\)\. Augustine's "*pactum*" and the Reformers' "*foedus operum*" \(covenant of works\) highlight these dynamics\.

__296\. Covenant of Works \(*foedus operum*\)\.__ This theology underscores the infinite distance between God and man, emphasizing human dependency on divine grace over merited works \(cf\. Rome\)\. It combines divine sovereignty and faithfulness with human freedom and responsibility\.

__297\. Pre\-Fall Glorification\.__ Pre\-fall humanity was not fully glorified, disputing Lutheran views that Adam was the pinnacle of humanity\.

__298\. Adam, Representation and Mankind\.__ Adam was not alone, and Eve represented the possibility of posterity; the image of God was too rich for one man\. Similarly, the church is likened to a bride, and Paul symbolizes Adam as representative of the whole of mankind\. 

__299\. Procreation and Theories of Soul Origin\.__ The origin of the human soul remains debated, with views like Greek and Jewish pre\-existentialism, traducianism, and creationism\. Traducianism suggests souls are inherited from parents, while creationism posits divine creation of each soul\. There's no consensus\. __Bavinck's Perspective__*\.* Bavinck notes that both traducianism and creationism have merit but struggle to explain the soul’s origin or sin’s transmission\. Traducianism fails to explain the origin of the soul without veering into materialism or pre\-existence and the “tradition” of sin\. Creationism remains respectfully silent on these issues, but does not explain them either\.

__300\. Perspectives on Creationism and Traducianism\. __Greek, Roman, and Reformed traditions favor creationism, supporting the idea of individual and God\-given ethical accountability\. In contrast, Lutherans often support traducianism, suggesting the soul derives from parental lineage\. In traducianism, the *imago Dei* is the *justitia originalis*, and Adam is only the physical father of mankind\. Bavinck critiques that this view fails to see that Adam was the ethical, representative head of mankind\. Additionally, this view does not care about the destination of man as it considered the pre\-Fall Adam to have reached the highest state possible\. According to Bavinck, creationism upholds individuality, communal human identity, and the connection to Adam as both a representative head and ancestor\. It balances these aspects within divine creation, contributing to understanding humanity's nature\.
