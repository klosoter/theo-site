__The Structure of Biblical Authority – Meredith Kline__

__Part I: Canon and Covenant\.	__

__Introduction\. __Meredith Kline delves into the formation of the Old Testament canon, emphasizing that it was not merely the result of conciliar decisions but a divine process where God’s authoritative word was systematically inscribed through inspiration\. Historically, scholarship often focuses on the later recognition of the canon’s boundaries rather than the true, millennium\-long formation process\. Orthodox scholarship maintains an apologetic role against critical perspectives that dismiss early canonical development\.

__One: Formal Origins of Biblical Canon\.__

__Ancient Near Eastern Canonical Documents\. __Kline draws a formal analogy between treaty documents from the Ancient Near East \(ANE\) and biblical covenants, noting similarities in practices such as duplicates, safeguarding them, and reading them periodically\. These documents’ authority was enforced through inscriptional curses against alteration, a concept Kline refers to as “canonical sanction,” which validates speaking of their canonicity\.

__Adoption of the Canonical Treaty Form\. __In the ANE, canonical documents were standard for international treaties\. Yahweh adopted this legal\-literary form for His covenants with Israel, transforming them, through divine inspiration, into what the church acknowledges as canon\. These suzerainty covenants merged divine authority with ANE treaty forms, establishing Israel’s scriptural canon\. 

__Anachronistic Modern Canon Theories\. __Criticisms from modern scholars, such as von Rad and Fohrer, challenge the early relationship between the Sinai covenant and Israel’s literature\. Kline argues that if covenant concepts shaped Israel’s pre\-prophetic literature, canonical Scripture cannot be viewed as a late innovation\. Discrepancies arise when scholars, like Noth, distinguish validity from canonicity, leading to misunderstandings about the covenant’s role in Israel’s religious life and broader redemptive history\. These theories often recycle outdated Wellhausenian approaches, missing the authentic historical trajectory of canon formation\.

__Conclusion\. __Kline asserts that the treaty establishing Israel’s theocracy was both the inception and core of the OT canon\. The canon is inherently linked to the covenant, which informs the doctrine of canon with historical authenticity\. 

__Two: Covenantal Bible__

__Covenantal Old Testament\. __The OT is repeatedly referred to as the “book of the covenant” \(Maccabees, 2 Cor\. 3:14\)\. Kline underscores two crucial claims: \(1\) *Divine Authorship*: While acknowledging the human dimensions of the OT, Kline insists that God is ultimately its principal author, issuing it from His throne, thereby imparting a functional unity across its varied literary forms\. \(2\) *Earthly Derivation*: The OT emerged from the Israelite community under Yahweh’s covenant rule, with all parts serving and bearing the covenant’s mark\.

__Law\. __Key legal texts, such as the Decalogue and Deuteronomy, adopt the treaty form, stipulations, and context of a covenant \(e\.g\., Ex\. 21\-23: “the book of the covenant”\)\. These laws were integrated with covenantal rites like cultic sacrifices and other suzerain\-vassal obligations, emphasizing public treaty reading, military assistance, and ceremonial observances\.

__History\. __Pentateuchal history intertwines with legal stipulations, setting a backdrop for particular obligations\. Subsequent biblical history extends foundational Mosaic treaties, highlighting Yahweh’s covenant relationship with Israel, His faithfulness, Israel’s covenant\-breaking, and resultant curses\. These histories often reaffirm and renew the covenant post\-judgment, linking closely with prophetic literature\.

__Prophecy\. __Prophets served as Yahweh’s messengers, performing a distinctive diplomatic function outlined in the Deuteronomic treaty\. They represent Yahweh in covenant administration, employing covenantal language and themes \(e\.g\., covenant lawsuits, witness of heaven and earth, admonition\-promise\-accusation\-threat\)\.

__Praise\. __Debate exists on the Psalter’s relationship to Israel’s cult, though many psalms were used in temple worship, which was central to the covenant\. Psalms act as spiritual sacrifices to the suzerain, involving covenant ratification \(“Amen”\) and recounting Yahweh’s mighty acts\.

__Wisdom\. __Wisdom literature, beginning with the fear of Yahweh, functions to elucidate the covenant, adding personal knowledge of God’s dealings with individuals to His covenantal requirements\. Wisdom is linked to covenantal institutions like Solomon’s court and is shaped by prophetic literary techniques and themes \(e\.g\., lawsuits, theodicy in Lamentations\)\. It shares concerns with extrabiblical literature on treaties by transmitting precepts through generational instruction\.

__Covenantal New Testament\. __Kline includes this section for a holistic biblical view\. The NT reflects the pattern of renewing covenants through new treaty documents, following organically connected redemptive history via successive covenant renewals\. NT authors may not have consciously known the international treaty model but understood it through the OT form\. Literary Forms: *Gospels and Acts *parallels OT historical narratives, focusing on the treaty of the Messianic Lord to establish a new covenant order\. *Epistles* reflect elements of prophetic literature, wisdom, worship, and law, adapted creatively from OT structures\. *Apocalypse* relates to prophetic literature\. In sum, both OT and NT uniquely adapt and extend the formal structure of ancient treaties under divine inspiration to form the canonical Scriptures governing God’s covenantal relationship with His people\.

__Three: Canon and Covenant Community__

__Architectural Model for Biblical Canon\. __The origins of Scripture, beginning in Exodus, demonstrate a structured approach to Israel’s covenant relationship with God\. *Noahic Stage*: Involved a familial covenant rather than a kingdom\-oriented treaty\. *Mosaic Stage*: Transitioned to a national covenant, establishing Israel as Yahweh’s kingdom\. Scriptural revelation through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob promised a covenantal kingdom, fully realized in Israel, where Yahweh’s triumphant kingship is dramatically displayed\.

__Architectural Aspect\. T__he Bible frames the covenant kingdom’s structuring, likened to “house\-building,” prevalent in Ancient Near Eastern tradition when kings triumphed\. *Exodus* thematically and literarily depicts house\-building and victory\. *Victorious Kingship* leads to palace and temple building \(e\.g\., Exodus 15, Psalms, David’s victories\)\. Extra\-biblical parallels include Thutmosis III’s hymn leading to temple construction for Amon\-Re\. *NT Perspective* Christ’s victory manifests in the body of believers, with Christ as the cornerstone and the Holy Spirit indwelling within the church\.

__Biblical Canon as Architectural Model\.__ *Visions* span from Moses’ tabernacle, David’s temple plans, Ezekiel’s eschatological temple, to John’s revelation of the eternal temple\-city \(Revelation 21\-22\)\. Each symbolizes divine house\-building post\-victory over evil\. *Wisdom’s* role in house\-building is evident through figures like Bezalel \(Mosaic Temple\) and Huram\-abi \(Solomonic Temple\)\. *Creation* itself, described in Genesis, follows the triumph\-to\-house\-building pattern\. 

__Community Correlative to Biblical Canon\. __The canonical Scripture is depicted as structuring the covenant community in two significant ways\. *Authoritative Word\. *Scripture serves as an authoritative word, likened to an architectonic model building God’s kingdom\-house\. The OT’s canonical covenant outlines stipulations that shape the covenant community both historically and theologically\. *Community Rule*\. The canonical covenant functions formally to establish community rules\. *Word of Power*\. God’s word functions creatively and powerfully, exemplified in creation’s fiat, shaping the covenant community through divine authority\. *Constructing Community*\. The covenant\-canon creates a covenant\-community\. It is integral to the community, not derived from it\. The covenant document functions as an oath of allegiance, inherently carrying canonical authority\. *Witness Against*\. The theme of the covenant as a witness against Israel \(Deut\. 31:26\) mirrors extra\-biblical treaty practices, reinforcing the inherent authoritative nature of the canonical covenant documents\. By blending these elements, Kline presents the canon as both the blueprint and the dynamic force behind God’s covenant community, affirming its divinely inspired structure and power\.

__Four: Canonical Polities, Old and New\.__

__Old Canon in the New Covenant\. __In the Ancient Near East, treaties could be modified due to evolving circumstances, reflecting eternal and changing aspects\. Similarly, biblical covenants exhibit a progressive history and revelation, not strictly evolutionary or dispensational\. Biblical Scripture, therefore, is not a perpetually closed system but allows for divine revisions initiated by God\. The Old and New Testament canons, while distinct, share an organic spiritual\-historical relationship underpinned by the same principles of redemptive grace, the goal of God’s kingdom, and the blessings accomplished by Christ\. There remains continuity, such as the transition from the Davidic dynasty to Christ and the theocratic monarchy of Israel mirrored in the Church\. However, the cultural\-cultic kingdom of Israel differs from the cultic practices of the Church in the present NT phase\. Kline asserts that the distinction between OT Scriptures and the Christian canon does not deny biblical infallibility\. Everything in the OT remains normative and truthful, but the sine qua non of biblical canonicity lies in life\-norms that are community\-specific, which have been replaced in the NT by a new polity for the church\.

__Intracanonical Polity Phases\. __Distinct stages within the OT reflect the covenant community’s evolving context\. The Pentateuch’s laws address phases from the wilderness period to the transitionary settlement phase under Joshua and the Judges, culminating in the Davidic monarchy\. Pre\-Sinaitic relationships \(e\.g\., Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic\) offer different polities within the overall covenant framework, integrating both culture and cult\. The NT exhibits a reverse movement, detaching the concept of God’s sanctuary from Jerusalem and expanding God’s covenant to the nations\. Certain NT procedural details—like the mission directives of the 12 and the 70, the Jerusalem council’s dietary rulings, and the acknowledgment of the Jerusalem temple—do not apply to the broader new covenant order\. 

__Conclusion\. __Faith\-norms remain permanent across both Old and New Testament revelations, while life\-norms adapt to fit the evolving covenantal contexts, shaping the structure and practices of the covenant community through different historical and theological phases\.

__Part II: Collateral Studies__

__One: The Two Tables of the Covenant\. __Kline explores the significance of the two tables of the covenant in the context of suzerainty treaties from the Ancient Near Eas\. In such treaties, the two tables were typically identical copies, a practice mirrored in the biblical covenant\.

__Suzerainty Treaty Context\. __The preamble of the suzerainty treaties \(identification of suzerain\) corresponds to the opening of the Decalogue \(“I am the Lord”\)\. Parallels, such as the exclusion of foreign alliances \(“thou shalt have no other gods before me”\), reinforce the idea that the Decalogue functions as a covenant rather than merely a legal code\. 

__Purpose and Structure of the Tables\. __The two tables should not be viewed as a divided legal code but as duplicate copies of the entire treaty\. Extrabiblical treaties often involved writing the entire text on one table, sometimes on both sides\. This duplication was a common ANE practice where one copy would be kept in the vassal’s sanctuary and the other in the suzerain’s sanctuary\.

__Context in Israel\. __In Israel’s context, both copies of the covenant were placed in the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle, signifying Yahweh’s unique role as both covenant Suzerain and God of Israel\. The instructions for this placement are found later in the legislative instructions for the Ark and sanctuary \(Exodus 25:10\-22\), as well as mandates for public reading \(Deuteronomy 21:9\-13\)\. Israel’s copy served as a documentary witness to and against the people\.

__Yahweh’s Role\. __Yahweh’s copy demonstrates His position as the actual enforcer of the covenant\. Unlike human suzerains who sought tribute, God’s interest lay in mercy and relational fidelity, extending benefits to a thousand generations\. This is akin to Genesis 15, where Yahweh swears covenant fidelity, ensuring promises are fulfilled and demanding total allegiance from Abraham\.

__Soteric Covenants\. __God’s covenants are marked by His sovereign grace, guaranteeing the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes in Christ\. These covenants come with divine assurances, effecting the realization of the covenants’ blessing and sanctions\.

__Two Copies and Ethical Implications\. __The two copies signify the personal and relational nature of biblical ethics, contrasting with the idea of a mere legal code\. This bilateral covenant emphasizes an I\-Thou relationship, avoiding a simplistic division of commandments into those concerning God \(1\-4\) and those concerning fellow humans \(5\-10\)\. The great commandment to love God and one’s neighbor encompasses all Ten Commandments, underscoring the indivisibility of these ethical imperatives\.

In essence, the two tables represent the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing relational faithfulness over legalistic adherence and reflecting the deep interconnectedness of divine and human obligations\.

__Two: Dynastic Covenant__

__Higher Criticism and Deuteronomy\. __Higher criticism challenges the structural unity and integrity of Deuteronomy\. Kline counters this by arguing that Deuteronomy is a covenant renewal document embodying the classical legal form of Mosaic\-era suzerainty treaties\.

__Outline of Deuteronomy\. __Kline offers the following structure for Deuteronomy, aligning it with suzerainty treaties:

- Preamble \(1:1\-5\)
- Historical Prologue \(1:6\-4:49\)
- Stipulations \(Chapters 5\-26\)
- Curses and Blessings or Covenant Ratification \(Chapters 27\-30\)
- Succession Arrangements or Covenant Continuity \(Chapters 31\-34\)

This documentary pattern supports the idea that Deuteronomy is a text for a covenant ceremony, even if understood as a series of addresses\.

__Deuteronomy’s Structure and Treaty Elements\.__

Deuteronomy parallels ancient treaties, featuring God as the Suzerain:

- Preamble and Historical Prologue: Identifies Yahweh and outlines covenant history\.
- Stipulations: 
	- General commands in chapters 5\-11 emphasize undivided allegiance and conquest mandates\.
	- Specific regulations in chapters 12\-26 have a hortatory character, indicating Deuteronomy is more than a legal code\. Repetition aligns with suzerain treaties and renewed covenants\.
- Curses and Blessings \(Chapters 27\-30\): 
	- Include sanctions, a call for decision, historical recounting of Yahweh’s acts, and reiteration of primary stipulations\.
	- The invocation of witnesses \(heaven and earth\) and the pronounced blessings and curses provide a framework for the prophetic eschatological message\.
- Succession Arrangements \(Chapters 31\-34\): 
	- Aligns with treaty elements like witness invocation and treaty text deposition in sanctuaries\.
	- Succession involves Moses transferring leadership to Joshua in two stages: Moab and Shechem, paralleling vassal oaths to the suzerain and successors\.

__The Davidic Covenant\. __The Davidic covenant also offers an absolute guarantee of blessing, intertwined with human responsibility and the potential for curses\. This mirrors the structure found in Deuteronomy\.

__Conclusion\. __Kline concludes that Deuteronomy, in its present form, unmistakably exhibits the ancient suzerainty treaty structure in its entirety\. Its preparation for specific historical occasions affirms its historicity, likening it to Hittite treaties\. Prohibitions against adding to or diminishing the text \(cf\. Deut\. 12:32 and Rev\. 22:18\-19\) argue against an evolutionary view and support the canonical integrity of Scripture\.

__Three: The Intrusion and the Decalogue__

__The Concept of Intrusion\. __Eschatology predates redemption, rooted in the creation pattern\. The breach of the creation covenant by the fall did not result in a blessing but rather a curse\. This delay of eschatology, alongside common grace, delineates the mutual exclusivity between the reprobate under common grace and the elect under consummation\. The covenant of Redemption introduces an intrusion, pointing to both pre\-fall conditions and future eschatological fulfillment\. Intrusion encompasses all that prevents the creation covenant’s full eschatological realization\. It embodies *already* realized eschatology at its core, while symbolically reflecting eschatology *yet* to be realized\. This core\-and\-shell dynamic is essential for understanding the Old Testament, indicating that the core \(realized eschatology\) is always present within the shell \(symbolic representation\)\.

__The Intrusion and Ethic\. __Biblical laws do not possess eternal validity; they are contextually bound to the existing world order\. Some laws have an expiration point at the boundary of our current state of existence\. For example, a biblical ethic might dictate different neighborly responsibilities in the present world as compared to the eschatological future where distinctions between the elect and the reprobate are more pronounced\.

__Intrusion of Judgment\. __*Imprecations in the Psalms\. *The Psalms contain imprecations reflecting curses not out of personal wrath but from concern for God’s honor and love for His kingdom\. The welfare of mankind is secondary to divine judgment, which will eventually fulfill these curses\. This distinction lies between common grace ethics and consummation ethics, with imprecations reflecting the latter\. *Conquest of Canaan\. *The extermination of the Canaanites appears to contradict commandments against murder and unprovoked aggression\. Under common grace, such acts would be considered unethical\. However, Kline argues they represent an anticipated eschatology, an ethical sphere intrusion that aligns with divine judgment\. *Other Judgments\. *Other instances of ethical intrusion include withholding truth from the reprobate and breaking commandments in contexts anticipating eschatological judgment\.

__Intrusion of Redemptive Blessing\. __*The Theocracy and the Nations\. *True theocracy is aligned with consummation, not common grace\. However, examples like God stirring King Cyrus of Persia to restore exiled nations and their cults reflect an intrusion of eschatological ethics\. Revelations 21:24 suggests that the kings of the earth will eventually bring their glory and honor to God’s kingdom, signaling this redemptive intrusion\. *The “Sacrifice” of Isaac\. *God’s command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac is an intrusion reflecting the ethics of the Cross, symbolizing profound redemptive sacrifice beyond common grace norms\. *The Marriage of Hosea\. *Hosea’s marriage to a prostitute, which seems contradictory to common grace ethics, signifies consummate ethics\. It typifies Christ’s relationship with sinners, emphasizing redemptive love and restoration\.

__Conclusion\. __Kline’s concept of intrusion reveals the deep interaction between eschatological expectations and current ethical behaviors prescribed in the Bible\. The Old and New Testament both contain elements of this intrusion, presenting a complex interplay between the already\-realized aspects of God’s kingdom and the not\-yet\-realized future consummation\.

__Four: The Old Testament Origins of the Gospel Genre__

__The Concept of Gospel Genre\. __Scholarly consensus is lacking on directly linking the canonical gospels with earlier literary traditions\. The gospels incorporate teaching discourse and historical narrative, documenting both the words and works of Jesus across a variety of literary forms, such as sapiential, legal, polemical, and apocalyptic content\. Form\-critical studies view the gospels primarily as church documents, while conservatives often treat them as biographical accounts of Jesus’ life\.

__The Book of Exodus and the Gospel Genre\. __Comparative literary analysis suggests that just as contemporary Judaism at Qumran adapted various OT literary forms, the gospels similarly could have adopted such forms\. The Book of Exodus provides a particularly salient parallel, referred to by Kline as the “Gospel of Moses\.” Both Exodus and the gospels encompass historical narratives and authoritative sayings \(legislation in Exodus and teachings in the gospels\)\. The structural similarity in both content and form is striking: \(1\) Inauguration of Covenants: Both documents focus extensively on the initiation of divine covenants—Sinaitic in Exodus and New Covenant in the gospels; \(2\) Covenant Mediator’s Life: The first halves detail the public careers of the covenant mediators, Moses and Jesus; and \(3\), distinctive Christological Perspectives: Each gospel’s unique portrayal of Christ enriches the genre, making it slightly fluid yet maintaining a core focus on covenantal themes\. 

Kline defines the genre as centering on the divine covenant’s inauguration, framed within the mediator’s life and the laws promulgated by the mediator\.

__Moses\-Exodus Typology in the Gospels__

The gospels leverage Moses\-Exodus typology to present Christ’s saving acts as a new exodus led by a new Moses:

- *“Exodos” Term*: Appears in transfiguration \(Luke\), paralleling important elements of the Israelites’ journey with Christ’s mission\.
- *Passover/Last Supper*: In both narratives, these events mark significant covenant inaugurations involving sacrificial themes\.
- *Redemption Themes*: Echoing the redemption from slavery, gospels like Luke emphasize themes of redemption extending to nativity and youth\.
- *Wilderness Experience*: From John the Baptist’s ministry to Jesus’ temptation and miracles, these episodes reflect wilderness themes\.
- *Mediators’ Roles*: Both Moses and Jesus are depicted as covenant mediators, with literary parallelism observed in birth narratives, public ministry, and leadership roles\.
- *Miracles and Ministry*: Jesus’ miracles and ministry parallel significant events from Moses’ life, highlighting roles in guidance, kingship, and prophetic duties\.
- *Treaty Form in Jesus’ Words*: Jesus’ utterances often follow treaty form elements, including I\-am statements, historical overviews, stipulations, eschatological messaging, and end\-time prophecies\.
- *Farewell Discourses*: Testamentary blessings, promises, and intercessions are mirrored in the farewell messages from both Moses and Jesus\.

While the presence of Exodus typology in the gospels underscores significant similarities, it does not necessarily classify them as a single literary genre\.

__Canonical Function of the Gospel Genre\. __Understanding the gospels’ canonical function, aligned with Exodus, suggests profound consequences for canonical interpretation\.

- *New Covenant Witness*: Just as Exodus serves as a canonical treaty document for Israel, the gospels function similarly for the Christian church, serving dual purposes of bearing witness to Jesus’ mission and providing a covenant ratification document\.
- *Four Witnesses*: The four gospels function as witnesses—both divine and human—to the church, echoing the dual authorship tradition\.
- *Christological Focus*: While affirming a Christ\-centered focus, the gospels frame Jesus within a broader covenantal perspective, revealing God’s name \(Yahweh\) and fulfilling the ultimate objective of covenantal relationship\.
- *Proclamation of the Kingdom*: The gospels herald the Messianic age in the OT and announce the inauguration of God’s new covenant in the NT\.
- *Divine Fulfillment*: The Gospels testify that God has fulfilled His ancient covenant oath, particularly highlighted in Genesis 15, by establishing a new covenant through Jesus Christ\.

The Holy Spirit serves as both divine witness and inspirer, paralleling the divine authorship of the gospels with theophanic manifestations\. The Spirit’s role is also evidenced in the Decalogue, illustrating the continuous divine presence and guidance\. Authored by the Spirit, the gospels constitute a divine witness to the historical inauguration of the new covenant, stipulating organizational norms, ethical guidelines, and eschatological truths for the church\.
