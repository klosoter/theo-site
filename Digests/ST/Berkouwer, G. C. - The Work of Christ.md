__The Work of Christ – G\. C\. Berkouwer__

__1\. Introduction\. __

__Christ’s Identity and Work\.__ Berkouwer emphasizes the profound connection between Christ's identity and his work, highlighting that the apostles preached what Christ accomplished rather than engaging in theoretical theological discourse\. The focus is on the salvific knowledge of God in Jesus Christ, illuminated by the Holy Spirit\. He warns against the dangers of human interpretation overshadowing divine revelation, citing historical heresies like Arianism and Docetism, which have influenced ideas about Christ's work\. __Scriptural and Theological Diversity\.__ Scripture and theological history offer diverse portrayals of Christ’s work, with New Testament writings presenting various aspects of Christ's death that together provide a comprehensive understanding of his mediatorial role\. Berkouwer cautions against theological narrowness and highlights the inexhaustibility of Christ's work, urging adherence to Scripture's authority to avoid fragmented interpretations\. __The Focus of Modern Theology\.__ Modern theology often prioritizes the meaning of Christ for contemporary times, potentially disregarding historical continuity\. Berkouwer critiques the shift from a Liberal Jesus to an eschatological figure who misinterpreted the Kingdom of God, warning against interpreting Jesus through the lens of modern secular perspectives\. Such views lead to questions about evolution and eschatological timing, and overlook the integral connection between Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection\. Berkouwer urges Christians to remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, as a counter to secularizing tendencies, emphasizing that faith involves integrating the entirety of Christ's redemptive acts\.

__2\. The Motive of the Incarnation\.__

__Person and Work Unified\.__ Berkouwer asserts it is impossible to separate Christ's person from his work, as every gift loses its power when isolated from Christ himself\. Preaching Christ inherently involves centering on his work\. He explores the motive of the incarnation, questioning whether it is contingent on humanity's fall into sin\. __Incarnation and the Fall\.__ While the incarnation is connected to deliverance, Berkouwer argues against the notion that there would have been no incarnation without the fall\. This perspective disconnects Christ from redemption, separating the becoming of "flesh" from becoming "man," a view endorsed by *Vermittlungstheologen* and figures like Osiander and Socinus, suggesting Christ would have become man even without sin\.__ Speculative Theories and Rejection\.__ This idea, found in the ancient church and among thinkers like Hegel, Martensen, and the Scotists, suggests Christ's coming was not solely determined by sin\. The Thomists, by contrast, reject this view for lacking scriptural and patristic support, emphasizing the cosmic significance doesn't imply incarnation without the fall\. Calvin and others align with Scripture, arguing that calling Christ the second Adam refutes the notion of incarnation absent the fall\. Berkouwer critiques the theory, which leads to deifying humanity and neglects the cross's centrality, arguing that the incarnation is about deliverance and restoration, always linked to salvation\. __Centrality of the Cross\.__ The theory ultimately overshadows the cross due to its dual motives for Christ\. Berkouwer stresses divine enmity expressed in the promise to the woman, highlighting the biblical narrative of reconciliation amidst rebellion\. At the Council of Nicea, Christ's descent was affirmed as for humanity's sake, underscoring that his coming signifies communion and not merely elevation\.

__3\. Humiliation and Exaltation__

__Scriptural Foundation over Dogmatic Construct\.__ The formal discussion of Christ's two states is often connected with the Lutheran idea of *communicatio idiomatum*, but Berkouwer emphasizes that it should be grounded in Scriptural testimony rather than viewed merely as a dogmatic construct\. __Schleiermacher’s Rejection and Additional Texts\.__ Schleiermacher rejected the possibility of divine humiliation, attributing its source solely to Philippians 2:6\-9 and viewing it as ascetic\. Berkouwer counters that many Scripture passages depict Christ’s humiliation leading to exaltation, emphasizing this is well\-supported\. __Biblical Progression\. __Paul and other biblical texts, including Acts, Philippians, and the Gospels, present a narrative of descent into death followed by exaltation, which is mirrored through various scriptural stories like Gethsemane and Golgotha, and creeds such as "*natus ex virgine, sub Pontio Pilato*\." __Historical Context and Bultmann’s View\.__ This biblical progression is found in the Old Testament as well, such as in Isaiah\. The 19th century faced challenges to this doctrine due to idealistic history interpretations\. Bultmann's demythologization reframes historical events like the resurrection as mythical, focusing solely on the cross's soteriological significance\. *To be crucified with Christ reveals the true understanding of one’s self\.* __Eschatology versus Historical Reality\.__ Berkouwer critiques Bultmann, stating that eschatology overshadowed historical elements, disconnecting salvation from history\. Bultmann’s emphasis on existential recognition replaces actual events of humiliation and exaltation\. __Doctrine as Gospel Summary\.__ Berkouwer sees humiliation and exaltation as the summary of the gospels rather than dry schemata\. The church of all ages has always shown interest in the causal connection between the two\. Berkouwer argues that Christ goes from humiliation to exaltation through obedience, earning merit to our benefit and in a non\-legalistic sense\. Calvin states that we are the objective of God’s work\.

__4\. Christ's Office\.__

__Christ's Office and Its Distinctions\.__ Berkouwer argues that discussing Christ's office is as legitimate as distinguishing between his natures and states\. Christ is truly man and truly God, existing in states of humiliation and exaltation, and fulfilling mediatorial work through his office\. Although the term "office" is used outside theology and can complicate understanding, it should be considered within the context of living faith under the Word and Spirit's guidance\. In fulfilling his office, Christ progresses from suffering to glory\. __Modernism’s Isolation of Offices\.__ Modern theology risks isolating Christ's offices by focusing narrowly on aspects like the prophetic office—prioritizing revelation and subjective truth—and the priestly office, sometimes leading to theopaschitism\. Similarly, emphasizing kingship solely as reconciliation through victory neglects the unity of Christ's roles\. __The Munus Triplex\.__ The concept of Christ's threefold office predates the Reformation, with Calvin developing it scripturally, emphasizing its unity in relation to salvation and humiliation\. The Heidelberg Catechism connects Christ’s office to the outcomes of his work\. "Office" implies a divine commission, where Christ serves as the anointed one, highlighting a unified office reflecting his identity as Savior\. __Christ as Prophet\.__ Christ reveals the Father, bearing witness through submission and obedience, empowered by the Holy Spirit\. He is the subject and object of prophecy, even predicting his suffering\. Despite mockery, his prophetic office encompasses calling sinners to repentance and proclaiming God’s kingdom, intertwined with his priestly and kingly roles\. __Christ as Priest\.__ In the priestly role, Christ gives his life as a ransom for many\. Bavinck questions which aspects belong to each office, noting their mutual influence in all facets of Christ’s work\. Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King involves the whole person, suggesting that each office is intrinsically related\. __Historical\-Soteriological Differentiation\.__ Berkouwer believes differentiating Christ’s offices historically and soteriologically is preferable\. This includes revealing God’s name and Kingdom, removing guilt, and building the Kingdom in the world\. His kingship is Messianic, established before his exaltation and fully realized in confession and actions seen in figures like Nathanael and Pilate\. __The Munus Triplex in Exaltation\.__ Christ fulfills his threefold office in exaltation, with the Church embodying a similar tri\-fold role as the people of the Messiah\. Berkouwer advises caution, reminding that Church offices should not compete with Christ's nor act as additional mediators, as seen in some Roman Catholic doctrines\. “Representation” is reserved for the doctrine of reconciliation, not for the Church’s exercise of its office\. The Lord's Supper should not repeat Christ's sacrifice as seen in the Old Testament, highlighting the singular, completed nature of Christ's sacrifice as emphasized in Hebrews\.

__5\. The Great Mystery\.__

__The Mystery of the Incarnation\.__ The incarnation is a profound mystery, as Paul suggests in describing the mystery of godliness: "He who was manifested in the flesh\." This is not a matter of objective human reasoning but is deeply rooted in God's revelation\. Attempts to make the miraculous more acceptable have led to concepts such as the Logos uniting with the man Jesus Christ or with an incomplete human nature\. However, Berkouwer emphasizes that Scripture is explicit about the incarnation, with no distinction between becoming "man" and becoming "flesh\." __Historical Context and Birth Records\.__ Paul speaks of a secret revealed since the world began, and the Gospels place the miracle within a concrete historical context, mentioning figures like Augustus and Mary and locations like Bethlehem\. The Bible is concerned with revelation rather than shrouding mysteries\. The reality of the historical event and the tangible flesh of Christ holds cosmic significance, as reflected in the church's early confession of the virgin birth as essential to faith\. __Challenges to the Virgin Birth\.__ Critics argue that the virgin birth is a recurrent motif in divine origin stories of great figures, suggesting it is a later theological development\. *Brunner* opposes the historicity of the virgin birth, pointing out its absence in Paul and John and positing dogmatic motives over historical kerygma\. He suggests the doctrine attempts to explain mystery biologically, attributing it to ascetic inclinations rather than scriptural emphasis\. __Barth's Perspective\.__ Barth disagrees with Brunner, viewing the virgin birth as a sign of God's sovereign act in Christ\. While the virgin birth signals significant theological truths, Barth notes it is symbolic and noetic \(the miracle indicates God’s\)  rather than ontological \(it’s not a foundation for Christ’s sinlessness\), with God eliminating man and choosing a woman, thereby judging man’s \(effectively humanity’s\) world, activity, and creativity\. __Berkouwer's Response\.__ Berkouwer counters Barth by asserting that the virgin birth's form is part of an inseparable whole that is both ontological and revelatory\. He emphasizes that the incarnation and resurrection should not be ranked as secondary and primary mysteries, as humans cannot measure the importance of divine mysteries\. The early church associated the authority of Scripture with the virgin birth's significance, whereas modern skepticism often reverses this, evaluating Scripture based on the sign's interpretation\. __Scriptural Simplicity and Prophetic Fulfillment\.__ Controversy often arises from the exegesis of Isaiah 7:14 and its translation\. Berkouwer notes that Matthew interprets this as fulfilled in Jesus, relating the mystery to Isaiah's prophecy\. While Immanuel signified God's saving activity in Isaiah, the fulfillment in Christ reveals the full light of this prophecy\. __Virgin Birth and Sinlessness\.__ Critics argue that virgin birth's role in assuring Christ's sinlessness implies a specific view of marriage\. Berkouwer explains that though virgin birth is not the cause of sinlessness, it is integral to understanding Christ's deity and pre\-existence, countering Docetism and Adoptionism\. Without a human father, original guilt or sin is absent, respecting the mystery of Scripture while affirming Christ’s unique entry into the world as holy, prepared for his messianic office\. __Unicity of the Birth of Christ\.__ While the Old Testament features miraculous births, Christ's birth is unique in its complete separation from human paternity, signifying his sanctification for divine service, free from original sin, and voluntarily assuming humanity's guilt\. This uniqueness underscores the separation and divine intent behind Christ's entry into the world\.

__6\. Christ's Suffering\.__

__Union with Death and Guilt\.__ Christ's suffering must not be separated from his death, as it is deeply connected to the guilt he bore for humanity\. Unlike others’ sufferings, Christ's is not marked by tragedy or nihilism but is a sacrifice, self\-surrender, and an act of reconciling suffering\. Although various figures like Judas, Pilate, Herod, and the Centurion acknowledge Christ's innocence, they do not all share in its redemptive blessing\. __Human Responsibility and Divine Sovereignty\.__ Humanity is responsible for Christ's suffering and death, stressing human guilt while acknowledging God's supreme control\. Scripture intertwines God’s action with human action, as illustrated in Isaiah 53, where human cooperation is used by God for the world's benefit yet retains full guilt\. __Christ’s Active Participation\.__ Despite being crucified and delivered unto death, Christ was fully aware and active in his suffering, willingly embracing it\. His suffering was progressive, as noted in the Heidelberg Catechism, increasingly isolating him even from his disciples and God\. __Necessity and Understanding of Suffering\.__ Scriptural assertions underscore that Christ "must suffer," which has often been misinterpreted by both foes and followers alike\. The Gospels do not intend to provide a clear and complete picture of Christ's suffering and death as it is not an isolated object of meditative\-sympathetic interests, but emphasize its meaning for us, containing a confession of guilt\.

 __Historical and Scriptural Validity\.__ The idea that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, asserts historical reality essential for understanding, underscored by the Apostolic Creed's mention of Pontius Pilate, emphasizing historical context against Docetism\. Berkouwer insists on the inseparability of divine and human actions in reconciliation, countering views that see it as apostolic invention\. __Significance of the Cross\.__ The Heidelberg Catechism and Paul highlight the cross's significance as a comfort and assurance, emphasizing Christ’s cursed crucifixion "for us," marking the intertwining of divine justice and human action, against notions of mere historical accident\. __Death and Descent into Hell\.__ Christ’s death and burial are seen through God's justice, not as a tragedy but as the fulfillment of prophecy, leading to eternal life\. Expressions like "buried with him" reflect on Christ's true death and burial as a mystery, emphasizing Christ's triumph over death and his unique burial situation\. __The Descent into Hell\.__ Berkouwer focuses on the meaning of Christ's descent into hell, not historical conclusions\. The Reformed perspective, as per the Heidelberg Catechism and Calvin, sees hellish agony reflecting genuine forsakenness to save humanity, marking a turning point from humiliation to exaltation\. Amos’s prophecy that God turns the shadow of death into morning highlights the transformational victory inherent in Christ's suffering\.

__8\. Christ's Ascension__

__Denial of Bodily Ascension\.__ Those who deny Christ's bodily resurrection typically also reject the ascension, exemplified by *Bultmann's* demythologization\. While neither Matthew nor John explicitly mentions the ascension, Mark's account is debated due to textual criticism\. __Scriptural Accounts and Interconnectedness\.__ Luke provides a historical account of the ascension, and John alludes to it with references to Jesus going to the Father and being somewhere the disciples cannot follow, which actualizes in the ascension\. At Pentecost, Peter links the resurrection with the ascension, depicting Christ’s sitting at God’s right hand as fulfilling Psalm 110\. *Bavinck* argues that the ascension, alongside the resurrection, has been an integral part of the faith of the Church from its inception\. For believers, the ascension logically follows the resurrection\. __Critics and Misinterpretations\.__ Critics claim that the original gospel lacked burial and empty tomb narratives and that the resurrection is conflated with the ascension\. They argue Christ moved from the cross directly to exaltation, citing John’s depiction of Jesus’ death as his transfiguration and selective mentions in Hebrews and Philippians\. __Harmony of Scripture\.__ Berkouwer emphasizes that the harmony of Scripture holds even if not all biblical authors mention each event\. He warns against dismissing inconvenient scriptural statements, as doing so treats Scripture as a disjointed collection, undermining its unity\. __Significance and Confession of Ascension\.__ The significance of the ascension is upheld in the Apostolic Creed and highlights redemptive historical progress, countering idealism that perceives everything as eternally static\. Scripture depicts separation and departure in the ascension, ending Christ’s earthly companionship but not communion\. Ascension transforms suffering into joy, sowing sorrow, and reaping joy\. __Presence Post\-Ascension\.__ *Calvin* notes that Jesus remains an "ever more present power" until the world ends, signifying a new mode of spiritual presence\. The *Heidelberg Catechism* emphasizes that Christ's ascension serves "our interest" by sending the Paraclete, making separation fruitful and full of blessing\. __Joy and Communion\.__ Berkouwer explains that the joy and communion of faith rely on separation, yet separation is not the central motif\. Van Ruler discusses themes of separation, concealment, and expectation, suggesting that while real fulfillment is eschatological, there is fulfillment during the period of the Spirit, who creates the *regnum Christi* in history\. __Ascension and Pentecost Connection\.__ Berkouwer underlines the close bond between the ascension and Pentecost\. The work of Christ continues as a historical force through the Holy Spirit, reinforcing the ongoing transformative power initiated by the ascension\.

__10\. Christ and the Future\.__

__Remaining Connection to the Future\.__ While the future is not yet realized, the confession of faith does not conclude with the *sessio Christi*\. The session of Christ "has its limits," indicating that from this position, he will eventually return\. The theological understanding of sessio and parousia must remain closely linked to fully grasp Christ's ongoing and future work\. __The Unity of Work and Person\.__ In the doctrine of parousia, Christ's work and person are closely and inseparably connected\. This future event will fully manifest Christ's purposes, encompassing elements of faith, sanctification, and hope\. __Orientation from Pentecost to Parousia\.__ Berkouwer poses the question of whether the Church's orientation should be towards the past, future, or merely the present\. The interplay of sessio and parousia reinforces their inseparable connection, guiding the outlook of the Church\. __Integration of Past and Future\.__ The Gospel message inherently bridges past redemption and future glory, just as the *sessio* integrates both timeframes\. God's actions in Jesus Christ are dynamic and consequential, weaving history and the ultimate future together\. The command to "do this in remembrance of me" until his return underscores this continuous trajectory\. __Challenge of Immediate Expectation\.__ Critical theologians such as *Schweitzer* have grappled with the New Testament's "immediate expectation" of the end times, presenting the issue of the "tarrying parousia\." __Berkouwer's Perspective on Expectation\.__ Berkouwer argues against a one\-sided focus on an immediate eschatological ending, highlighting the New Testament's balance of "not yet" and "already\." Christ's return is a new event intertwined with the present, through his intercession and perseverance, as well as linked to the past, reflecting his mediatorial work\. The constancy of Christ—"the same yesterday and today, and forever"—ensures continuity and fulfillment across time\.

__11\. Aspects of the Work of Christ\.__

__A\. Reconciliation | Scriptural Summary of Reconciliation\.__ Scripture summarizes Christ's work through reconciliation, which signifies *peace after enmity* and *community after separation*\. The theological terms "hilasmos" \(expiation\) and "katallage" \(reconciliation\) reflect the means and effect of taking away sins\. The debate has long focused on whether reconciliation placates God's wrath, a question that leads to the notion of *Umstimmung Gottes*, or God's change of mind from wrath to grace, which Berkouwer and traditional Reformed theology reject\. __Understanding Divine Wrath\.__ The Belgic Confession and the Synod of Dordt emphasize that believers are saved from God's wrath by divine initiative without internal contradiction\. *Ritschl* saw God's wrath as a misconception resolved by Christ, while critics like *Korff* challenge the notion of God needing to be placated, questioning literal interpretations that suggest God changes from wrathful to gracious\. __Theopassianism and Divine Suffering\.__ Theopassianism, to a certain extent articulated by theologians like Barth, presents God as suffering on the cross, countering perceptions of an aloof deity\. Calvin asserts that God's justice and mercy coexist in a mysterious harmony accomplished through Christ's work, transcending simple dialectics of wrath versus love\. __Reformed Position on Reconciliation\.__ Reformed theology emphasizes that God's love, not wrath, is primary in the salvific plan\. The gift offered to God is enacted through Christ's reconciliation, underscoring divine initiative\. Berkouwer critiques the subjective\-noetic view of atonment \(Christ’s suffering signifies God’s love, evoking ours in return\) as it does not explain the “why” of the cross\. __Balancing Divine Attributes\.__ Berkouwer underscores that acknowledging the mystery of reconciliation is not ignorance\. God's attributes, including love and justice, exist without hierarchy or conflict, ensuring that in Christ's cross, justice and love are manifested together\. Reconciliation emerges from God’s initiative, with Christ’s mediatorial work and God’s reconciliation inseparably linked\. __Mediator in Scriptural Context\.__ While Moses's mediatorship was insufficient, Christ as mediator embodies both humanity and divinity\. He reconciles and fulfills promises to Abraham without merely placating God’s wrath\. *Barth* introduces the idea of universal salvation \(unbelief cannot defeat God’s unambiguous “yes”\) as the superior power of reconciliation, though *Brunner* critiques it for denying the reality of God’s justice and judgment\. __Living in Reconciliation\.__ The call to "be reconciled to God" encourages living by faith out of existing reconciliation rather than action\-based salvation, which, according to Barth, diminishes urgency in preaching\. Berkouwer navigates two extremes: empowering human decision too much or trivializing unbelief \(Barth\), insisting that the connection between faith and reconciliation is a mystery embraced by faith\.

__B\. Sacrifice | Centrality in Hebrews and the Lord's Supper\.__ Christ's sacrifice is pivotal in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where He is portrayed as the High Priest, a theme reiterated in the Lord's Supper with the declaration of His blood being poured out for many\. __Scriptural Emphasis on Sacrifice\.__ While Behm argues that the sacrificial theme is absent from other New Testament writings and used metaphorically in Hebrews, Berkouwer asserts that Scripture consistently frames Christ's sacrifice as integral to reconciliation, not merely self\-surrender\. __Old and New Testament Continuity\.__ Berkouwer emphasizes that Christ's sacrifice fulfills rather than nullifies Old Testament sacrifices, countering false interpretations and reinforcing the meaning of true worship through His "once for all" sacrificial act\. __Connection to Reconciliation\.__ He links sacrifice with reconciliation, grounding it in God's covenantal action rather than human merit\. This sacrifice transcends time, connecting past Old Testament practices with the Church's future\. __Debate Over Substitution\.__ Brouwer challenges the substitutionary aspect of sacrifice, while Berkouwer defends it using scriptural references like Isaiah 53, underscoring its crucial role in understanding Christ's work and addressing theological concerns about justice and love\. __Unified Sacrificial Theology\.__ Berkouwer asserts that terms like "in our behalf" and "in our stead" form a unified sacrificial theology\. Sacrifice is intrinsic to God's activity in Christ, displaying profound love and justice, and should be preached as an “unsearchable but not a dark mystery\.”

__C\. Obedience | Scriptural Basis of Obedience\.__ Christ's work is often characterized as obedience, a concept supported by Scripture\. This involves "hearing" and "obeying" as Christ seeks and submits to God's will, ultimately leading to obedience unto death, a central aspect of His Messianic mission\. __Connection to Sacrifice and Reconciliation\.__ Christ’s mission, as stated in "I am come to do thy will, O God," aligns obedience with sacrifice and is inseparably linked to his suffering and death\. In Romans 5, Paul contrasts Adam's disobedience with Christ's obedience, noting that through Christ, many are made righteous, emphasizing reconciliation through divine obedience\. __Active vs\. Passive Obedience\.__ The theological distinction between Christ's passive and active obedience—bearing suffering versus keeping the law—is debated\. *Berkouwer questions* the necessity of this distinction, suggesting that Christ’s obedience should be viewed as a unified whole, as affirmed in Reformed theology and the Belgic Confession\. __Bavinck’s View and Reformed Tradition\.__ Bavinck asserts that Scripture does not support a strict division between active and passive obedience, emphasizing that fulfilling the law is inseparable from Christ's reconciling task\. The Synod of Dordt underscores the unity of these aspects, highlighting that Christ’s entire work embodies obedience without conflict between law fulfillment and mediatorial accomplishment\.

__D\. Victory | Essence of Victory in Christ’s Life\.__ Berkouwer questions whether victory is an essential aspect of Christ’s life, as suggested in Hebrews 13:20\. *Gustav Aulén* argues that the church has historically neglected Christ's struggle and victory, presenting three types of reconciliation: Latin \(legalistic\), ethical \(internal\), and the dramatic motif of Christ the Conqueror\. __Christus Victor Motif\.__ Aulén highlights Christus Victor as the classic interpretation, where Christ conquers evil powers such as sin, death, and Satan\. This motif was later supplanted by the Latin, Anselmian motif\. It emphasizes drama, warfare, and victory, as seen throughout Paul's epistles, the Gospels, John, and Revelation\. Love ultimately breaks through wrath, highlighting the power dynamics Christ came to overthrow\. __Engagement in Battle\.__ The Messiah is portrayed as being engaged in battle through temptations and exorcisms, ministering in power as He casts out demons\. His life is marked by triumph that complements rather than diminishes his suffering, underscoring the need for faith to rightly interpret his miracles\. __Battle and Service as One\.__ Berkouwer notes that Christ's battle and service are identical; through His service and sacrifice, He destroys the works of the devil\. The mystery of the cross—where He would not save Himself yet is hailed as King—demonstrates the profound depth of his victorious act\. __Christ’s Victorious Power\.__ Christ's victory over death is a recurring theme in the apostolic epistles, manifesting continuously within the apostles amidst apparent powerlessness\. His power is not the uncertain outcome of clashing forces but the unforeseen triumph of God's weakness\. __From Slavery to Liberty\.__ Christ’s sacrifice robs Satan of power, representing the transition from slavery to liberty, as the Heidelberg Catechism affirms\. Lamb and Lion coexist without paradox, representing comprehensive redemption\. __Critique of Christus Victor\.__ Berkouwer critiques Aulén’s emphasis on Christus Victor, acknowledging its depth in Pauline and Johannine writings but highlighting its neglect of guilt and substitution\. He warns that replacing juridical terms with purely dramatic motifs risks dismissing the full scope of Christ's work and its sacrificial dimensions as depicted in Hebrews\. __More Than Conquerors\.__ In Christ, believers are more than conquerors, finding victory through apparent defeats\. Berkouwer distinguishes between the Church militant \(struggling\) and the Church triumphant \(victorious\), with eschatological victory offering comfort to those engaged in spiritual battles, reinforcing perseverance in faith as depicted in Revelation 2:7\.
