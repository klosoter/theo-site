__The Millennium and Beyond \- Blaising, Gentry Jr\., and Strimple__

1. __Postmillennialism \- Kenneth L\. Gentry Jr\.__

__Historical Development of Postmillennialism\. __

__Ancient Postmillennialism\.__ The early Church Fathers did not have a fully developed view of millennialism, whether Amillennialism or Postmillennialism\. Ancient creeds could accommodate both Amillennialism and Postmillennialism, but Premillennialism demanded belief in two resurrections\. Notable figures in the early development of Postmillennialism included Eusebius of Caesarea, Origen, Athanasius, and Augustine, while Irenaeus contributed to Premillennialism\. __Reformed Postmillennialism\.__ This perspective grew in the Middle Ages and later among the Puritans\. Key proponents included John Owen, Francis Turretin, Jonathan Edwards, and John Calvin\. The Puritan form of Postmillennialism held that a millennium would only occur following the conversion of all Jews\. __Modern Postmillennialism\.__ Influential figures in this period include Jonathan Edwards, William Carey, Charles Hodge, and J\. Gresham Machen\. A key development during this time was Christian reconstructionism, which emphasizes theonomy, a judicial\-political outlook, and the application of Old Testament laws to society\. Postmillennialism remains optimistic about the gradual Christian transformation of society, opposing both catastrophic and apocalyptic views\.

__Theological Foundations of Postmillennialism\. __

__God's Creational Purpose\.__ This viewpoint posits that God's original purpose in creation was to bring glory to himself, and he is committed to restoring creation to fulfill this goal\. __God's Sovereign Power\.__ The central belief is that God controls all events according to his will, with Postmillennialism emphasizing God's power and sovereignty in fulfilling his decrees\. __God's Blessed Provision\.__ The provisions for the church include the presence of the risen Christ, the indwelling of the Spirit, the weapon of prayer, the defeat of Satan, and the promise of gospel victory, ensuring God's triumph through the gospel message\.

__Redemptive\-Historical Flow of Postmillennialism\.__

__Creation and Edenic Covenants\.__ Humans were given dominion over the earth but failed due to the Fall\. However, adherents assert that God's historical victory over Satan began with Christ's first advent and will continue toward definitive victory in history, with God not abandoning historical processes\. __Abrahamic Covenants\.__ God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham fosters optimism in Postmillennial eschatology, emphasizing gradual conversion over catastrophic intervention\. __New Covenant\.__ Understood in its historical context, the New Covenant anticipates the historical fulfillment of God's promises\.

__Exegetical Evidence For Postmillennialism\.__

- __Select Psalms and Psalm 2\.__ These passages support the victory of the Messiah encompassing all nations, depicting historical struggles followed by divine triumph\.
- __Isaiah 2:2\-4__\. This prophecy portrays a socio\-political transformation with global inclusion in divine worship\.
- __Matthew 13 Parables\.__ These parables illustrate the gradual growth and influence of God's kingdom in history, culminating in the widespread presence of righteous citizens\.
- __John 12:31\-32__ indicates the initiation of Christ's transformative and restorative work of judgment in the world\. 
- __Matthew 28:18\-20__ \(Great Commission\) emphasizes Christ's authority over all realms, calling for global discipleship and the broad application of kingdom principles\. 
- __1 Corinthians 15:20\-28\.__ Paul anticipates a future resurrection without an intervening millennium, expecting Christ's dominion to lead to his kingdom's final submission to the Father\. 
- __Revelation 20\.__ This is the only chapter in Scripture that references a millennial age, which Postmillennialism interprets symbolically, suggesting that the thousand years signifies Christ's already initiated kingdom and spiritual reign\.

__Conclusion\. __Postmillennialism envisions hope that begins with creation and progresses through God's redemptive work, affirmed by revelation\. It maintains that God's plan unfolds in history, fulfilling the prayer "on earth as it is in heaven\."

__Responses to Premillennialism\.__

1. __A Millennial Response – Robert B\. Strimple\. __

Strimple critiques Gentry’s Postmillennial perspective, noting that while Gentry does not advocate a liberal or evolutionist hope, his advocacy for a theonomic Postmillennialism does not align with the Westminster Confession\. Strimple argues that Gentry's vision of Christ's kingdom—where the majority are saved and exert control over various aspects of "world\-as\-a\-system"—implies a failure in Christ's reign until the end times\. Strimple emphasizes that biblical teaching, particularly that of Jesus and Paul, does not foresee a gloriously transformed world before the end times\. Instead, scripture highlights ongoing persecution, apostasy, and evil, which contradicts Preterist views stating that such tribulations were fulfilled in the first century\. Strimple also critiques Gentry's historical analysis, suggesting it inaccurately links theologians' hopes for the present age with Postmillennialism, as those ideas are not uniquely Postmillennial\. He asserts that while Postmillennialism might illustrate certain doctrines, it is not explicitly supported by Scripture, and the idea of a present realized kingdom is unsubstantiated\.

1. __A Premillennial Response – Craig A\. Blaising\. __

Blaising comments on Gentry’s historical definition of Postmillennialism, highlighting several aspects he finds problematic\. He argues that Gentry overlooks the New Testament's teaching that the fullness of the eschatological kingdom arrives through judgment, with Jesus' return serving as the Day of the Lord\. Blaising questions Gentry's use of "optimism" and suggests that the last 2000 years show no clear progression toward a kingdom, as Postmillennialism implies\. __Scripture\. __Blaising critiques Gentry's exegesis of Old Testament prophecies as being confined to the present age, disputing the notion of the gradual development of a Christian culture as implied in Matthew 28 and John 12\. Furthermore, he stresses that Revelation, though symbolic, should not be dismissed prematurely and requires a careful literary and contextual analysis\. Specifically, he notes that in Revelation, the binding of Satan is not portrayed as progressively increasing, and only the living, not the dead saints, are envisioned as reigning with Christ\.

1. __Amillennialism \- Robert B\. Strimple__

__Christ as the Theme of Old Testament Prophecy\.__ Amillennialism discusses how the New Testament provides insight into interpreting Old Testament prophecies, especially those suggesting a literal restoration of priesthood and temple as posed by Premillennialism\. It argues that Old Testament prophets depicted the glories of the Messianic age, inaugurated by Christ, in their contemporary terms\. These include the temple, Jerusalem, Zion, sacrifices, David, and Canaan\. Instead of "spiritualizing" these elements, the New Testament fulfills their intended meanings\. __The True Israel\.__ In Amillennialism, true Israel is equated with Christ, who is also seen as the suffering servant in the New Testament\. Christians are considered Abraham's seed and part of the people of God, but only because they are united with Christ, who is defined as the true Israel, thereby engrafting them into this spiritual Israel\. __Interpretation of Key Symbols\.__ Canaan is seen as a type of a fuller and richer inheritance, representing the spiritual inheritance for Abraham’s children in Christ\. The Holy City of Jerusalem symbolizes a heavenly city to come, where the distinction is not between literal and spiritual but between a copy and the real thing\. David's Kingdom is interpreted as eternal, not fulfilled in the present age but acknowledged by the New Testament as spiritually fulfilled\. Christ is seen as the true temple of God, representing all elements traditionally associated with the temple, thereby negating the need for a future physical temple\. __The Second Coming of Christ\.__ Amillennialism views the second coming of Christ as the grand finale of redemptive history, as taught by the New Testament\. This view holds that the promise of an everlasting kingdom and blessings is inconsistent with an earthly millennial kingdom post\-Christ's return\. The finale includes a transformative change, the resurrection and judgment of all, signaling the end, and the creation of new heavens and a new earth\.

__Scriptural Support for a Unified Eschatological Event\.__

__John 5:28\-29\.__ This passage highlights a *singular future time* when all, both living and dead, will hear Christ's voice, emphasizing a unified resurrection event\. The phrase "a time" refers to "the hour" when everyone will be raised, negating the idea of separate resurrections as supported by Paul in Acts 24:15, which endorses a single resurrection and coming\.

*Twofold Judgment* in __2 Thessalonians 1:5\-10\.__ In this passage, there is an emphasis on a simultaneous, twofold judgment where God will punish those who reject the gospel and provide relief to believers\. The passage outlines three key points: the judgment will be for his saints, it will involve visible revelation, and it will occur "on that day," underscoring the immediacy and unity of the eschatological event\.

*Present Suffering and Future Glory* in __Romans 8:17\-23\.__ Paul contrasts present suffering with future glory, aligning this age with the next\. He speaks of cosmic renewal, akin to childbirth pains, indicating transformation rather than annihilation\. The resurrection and glory of believers, along with creation’s renewal, are to occur with Christ’s return, not separated by any millennial interval\.

*Parousia and Cosmic Renewal* in __2 Peter 3:3\-14\.__ The passage equates the parousia with the day of the Lord, a single event featuring cosmic renewal involving the destruction of the existing order and the emergence of a new heaven and earth\. It emphasizes judgment for the ungodly occurring concurrently with this transformation, reinforcing the notion of one comprehensive divine act\.

*Resurrection and Christ's Reign* in __1 Corinthians 15:20\-26\.__ Paul speaks of the resurrection of the dead with Christ as the firstfruits, followed by those who belong to him at his coming\. This sequence leads directly to the end, when Christ will deliver the kingdom to the Father after subjugating all enemies, including death\. This passage does not detail a separate resurrection for the wicked, underscoring a comprehensive closure to the current order\.

__Two Passages Considered Crucial by Millennialists\. __

__Romans 11 and the Question of Israel's Future\.__

__Significance of Key Verses\.__ Romans 11 contains significant verses like "then all Israel will be saved" \(verse 26\) and "For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?" \(verse 15\), which have sparked debates about the future of national Israel\. According to Strimple, while these verses could suggest a future mass conversion of ethnic Israel before Christ's return, they do not necessarily validate any specific millennial position\. Strimple notes that Paul discusses the place of Jews within God's larger salvation plan rather than predicting their return to the Promised Land\. __Understanding Paul's Consistent Message\.__ The question arises: does Paul foresee a future conversion of national Israel? Strimple highlights that Paul consistently emphasizes throughout chapters 9 to 11 that God's elect, or the true Israel, is not synonymous with the entire nation\. The rejection of Israel is not absolute, as not all descendants of Israel are considered true Israel\. In Romans 11, Paul is clear that the situation with Israel is ongoing rather than final; neither verses 1 nor 5 suggest a future rejection, as they address the current period involving Paul and his contemporaries\. Paul states that the purpose of his ministry to Gentiles is to provoke jealousy among Jews, further indicating present implications\. __Present Emphasis in Romans 11\.__ Moreover, Romans 11:30\-31 concludes with a focus on the word "now," emphasizing the present time: "For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy\." This repetition underscores a current and continuous condition\. __Interpretation of "Fullness" and Its Implication\.__ Romans 11:25 does not suggest that after the "fullness of the Gentiles," the hardening of Israel will cease, as the Greek context implies a continuation of the state until the end\. Therefore, the idea of "life from the dead" in this context does not indicate a forthcoming golden age but rather challenges the idea of such occurring after the Gentiles' full inclusion, which signifies totality in every sense\.

__Revelation 20:1\-10 and Its Interpretation\.__

__Progressive Revelation According to George Ladd\.__ George Ladd argues that just because Revelation 20 is the sole biblical reference to a millennium does not make it unimportant or non\-literal\. He advocates for a progressive revelation approach, where the millennium's significance and interpretation are based on its unique placement in Revelation\. __Amillennialist Interpretation of Revelation\.__ Strimple highlights why Amillennialists reject millennial positions based on Revelation 20\. They aim for interpretations consistent with the broader scriptural text, prioritizing exegesis before theological constructs\. Often, the rest of Scripture has been approached with biases formed by incorrect interpretations of this passage\. Moreover, difficult and figurative passages should be explained through literal and clearer ones\. He critiques Ladd's approach for attempting to align all Scripture based on Revelation 20’s exegesis, which Amillennialists find problematic\.__ __

__Seven\-Point Outline of Revelation 20:1\-10\. __

1. __Connection to Old Testament Prophecies\.__ The passage does not directly link itself to Old Testament prophecies\.
2. __Order of Visions\.__ The sequence of visions in Revelation does not necessarily indicate their chronological fulfillment\. This is supported by comparisons with chapters 11 and 12, and potentially with chapters 19 and 20\.
3. __Separate Visions\.__ There are two distinct visions in Revelation 20—verses 1\-3 depict Satan's binding, and verses 7\-10 depict Satan's release—both connected by "a thousand years\."
4. __Meaning of Satan's Binding\.__ The whole New Testament reveals two major victories of Christ over Satan: at the cross and the second coming\. Revelation 20 preserves this dual victory without suggesting an additional one at the beginning or end of the millennium\.
5. __The Battle in 20:8\.__ The battle described in verse 20:8 is the same as those described elsewhere in Revelation, such as chapters 16 and 19\.
6. __Heavenly Reign with Christ\.__ There is no indication that reigning with Christ in verses 4\-6 refers to earthly events; instead, the language aligns with other heavenly visions\. Souls and thrones represent heavenly realms, and the "martyrs and saints" refer to all believers, as opposed to unbelievers who experience the second death\.
7. __Significance of a Thousand Years\.__ According to Vos, the thousand years symbolize the contrast between the glorious state of the martyrs and the earthly tribulation, ultimately pointing to the eternal life at consummation\. The "second death" for unbelievers and "second resurrection" for believers is a paradox, where death for others is seen as a form of resurrection for Christians, highlighting the eternal triumph over temporal existence\.

__Responses to Amillennialism\.__

1. __A Postmillennial Response to Robert B\. Strimple__ __–__ __Kenneth L\. Gentry__\. 

Gentry acknowledges that he agrees with much of Robert Strimple's case for Amillennialism but argues that the new heavens and new earth are a present reality since Christ's first coming\. Gentry suggests that if Strimple pursued his own exegesis further, he might find himself aligned with Postmillennialism\. Gentry believes Strimple prematurely ends his inquiry, missing a hopeful understanding for the church to influence the world significantly for Christ within this age\.

__Romans 11\. __Gentry notes that Paul makes no mention of a return of Jews to the Promised Land or of a millennial kingdom with Christ reigning in Jerusalem\. He revisits Strimple’s key arguments, offering his responses:

1. __Present vs\. Future\.__ Strimple suggests Paul's references are present, not future\. Gentry counters that’s incorrect, as the "until" observation implies a future perspective\. However, Gentry acknowledges that Paul's use of "now" primarily contrasts the past rather than pointing to the future\. Additionally, Gentry stresses that Paul's phrase "all Israel will be saved" is future\-oriented\.
2. __Logical vs\. Temporal Sequence\.__ Strimple argues the phrase "all Israel will be saved" shows logical rather than temporal sequence\. Gentry responds by asserting that Scripture supports interpreting this as a temporal sequence\.
3. __Meaning of "Until"\. __Strimple interprets "until" to imply a continuation of current conditions\. Gentry challenges this, suggesting it’s a theological assertion rather than an exegetical observation and that "until" can imply a temporal succession that introduces change\.
4. __Fullness and "All Israel\.”__ Strimple claims these refer to completion, not future national conversion\. Gentry fundamentally disagrees, citing Scriptural evidence that "all Israel" refers to the entire people of Israel, contrasting with Strimple’s claim about the reduced numbers before God\.
5. __No Age Following Fullness\.__ Strimple states that the fullness completion coincides with Resurrection Day, negating an age thereafter\. Gentry dismisses this, finding it irrelevant to the discourse on age following fullness completion\.
6. __A Premillennial Response to Robert B\. Strimple – Craig A\. Blaising\.__ 

Blaising differentiates classic Premillennialism from dispensationalism, which Strimple conflates\. He critiques Strimple for suggesting that the Old Testament is spiritualized in the New Testament, thus discounting Premillennialism, which holds earthly hopes\. He asserts that Paul envisions the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham on earth, arguing for both present and future earthly fulfillment without being nullified by heavenly interpretations\. Blaising contends that __Romans 9\-11__ addresses Israel's future salvation as a nation, in line with Old Testament prophecies of national fulfillment, challenging the notion that it pertains solely to a present Jewish remnant\. Regarding Revelation 21, Blaising suggests that Scripture does not preclude an intermediary period, allowing for complex temporal sequences like inaugurations, millennial reign, and final consummation\. Concerning__ Revelation 20__, Blaising disagrees with Strimple's understanding of Satan’s binding and the reign of saints\. He highlights several issues in Strimple's approach\. 1\) *Satan's Binding\.* Claimed to occur before the millennium and lifted after, challenging Strimple’s understanding of it spanning Christ’s resurrection to his second coming\. 2\) *Saints and Resurrection\.* Blaising finds Strimple’s view of saints reigning with Christ without clear Scriptural backing problematic\. Revelation 5:10 suggests a future earthly reign, and the concept of dead saints enthroned in heaven lacks biblical basis\. Blaising asserts that Strimple's method of framing resurrection \(first death, then final resurrection\) lacks Scriptural precedent\. __Summary\. __Blaising supports the notion that prophecies regarding the nation of Israel are destined for future fulfillment\. He argues that sequential temporal fulfillment, including inauguration, millennial, and final stages, is viable within prophetic interpretation, countering Strimple's twofold temporal sequence\.

1. __Premillennialism \- Craig A\. Blaising__

__Definition\.__ Premillennialism holds that Jesus will return to reign for 1,000 years—a period during which some believers will be raised to reign with him\. After this millennium, the rest of humanity will be raised, leading to final judgment and the establishment of eternal destinies for everyone\. While tribulationism—whether pre\-tribulation, mid\-tribulation, or post\-tribulation—is part of the broader discussion, it is not addressed here\. Notably, being "caught up with the Lord" is a consensus among evangelicals, despite differing views on timing\. __Two Models of Eternal Life\. __The __Spiritual Vision Model__\. This model envisions eternal life as a "beatific vision," where the ultimate state of blessing involves seeing God or comprehending full knowledge\. It posits the final state of resurrected life in heaven, influenced by Greek philosophy\. This approach emphasizes spirit\-matter dualism with heaven as the ultimate reality and identifies spirit with mind and intellect, seeing eternal perfection as the absence of change or contemplative life\. __New Creation Model__\. In contrast, this model foresees a future everlasting kingdom on earth characterized by bodily resurrection\. It envisions redeemed society maintaining social and political interactions, continuous with present earthly life but absent of sin and death\. The New Creation Model anticipates renewal of existing reality, where believers will still see God\. 

__Persistence of Spiritual Vision Model\.__ The Spiritual Vision Model has predominated from the third century through the early modern era, serving as the primary framework for theological interpretation\. It has informed assumptions without being strongly supported by rigorous exegesis that takes into account historical, grammatical, and literary contexts\. Despite being criticized, the model persisted due to its entrenched position within theological tradition\. __Millennial Possibilities in a Spiritual Vision Eschatology\.__ In spiritual vision eschatology, millennial perspectives declined as Revelation was interpreted allegorically, centering on the soul's ascent and spiritual battles\. However, with the Christianization of the Roman Empire, a form of millennialism emerged where the empire exemplified Christian rulership\. This spurred dual interpretations: spiritual and ecclesiastical, as seen in Augustine's linking of the church's struggle with Revelational visions, portraying the church as simultaneously militant and triumphant\.

__The Reformation and New Creation Eschatology\. __The Reformation posed significant challenges to the Spiritual Vision Model, emphasizing 1\) a new understanding of grace and its reception; 2\) the authority of the Bible interpreted in its literal sense; 3\) a focus on earthly historical reality with specific attention to unfolding biblical prophecy; 4\) The rise of modern science\. __The Reemergence of Premillennialism in Post\-Reformation Protestantism\.__ Premillennialism resurfaced in Protestant thought due to a renewed emphasis on the literal sense of Scripture and disillusionment with prior millennial claims by Western Christendom\. By the seventeenth century, Premillennialism gained momentum, integrating both Old and New Testament theology, including future hope for Israel\. Meanwhile, Postmillennialism faced challenges due to associations with militarism and historical upheaval\. The grammatical and literary interpretation of Revelation 19\-20 bolstered the dominance of Premillennialism, while the Spiritual Vision Model began to decline\.

__Varieties of Premillennialism\. __Premillennialism involves a core conflict between the Spiritual Vision Model, which views eternal life as spiritual ascent, and the New Creation Model, which anticipates a physical renewal\. __Dispensational Premillennialism\. __*John Nelson Darby*, from the Brethren movement, introduced a dualistic view of two salvation realms: mystical\-heavenly and earthly, reflecting aspects of the Spiritual Vision Model\. He proposed the millennium as an earthly period followed by a heavenly focus, encompassing beliefs in a pretribulational Rapture and a posttribulational return of Christ\. __Historic Premillennialism\. __Led by figures like *George E\. Ladd*, this viewpoint diverges from dispensationalism yet shares themes like a millennial kingdom and Satan's binding\. Variations exist on the final state, with views ranging from a reductionist Spiritual Vision Model\-like approach to a holistic New Creation Model\-like outlook, while Classical Dispensationalism incorporates elements of both\. __Premillennialism and Apocalypticism\. __Historicist Premillennialism interprets much of Daniel and Revelation as reflecting church history, with symbolic numerology\. Conversely, Classical Dispensationalism focuses on Jewish eschatologies and literal prophetic timelines, including a seven\-year tribulation and thousand\-year millennium, often speculating about future events in light of past global tensions like the Cold War\.

The Millennial Kingdom and New Creation Eschatology\.

__Holistic and Consistent Premillennialism\.__ Blaising argues for a biblically holistic and consistent approach to Premillennialism that integrates both Old and New Testament teachings\. __The Eschatological Kingdom in Old and New Testament Theology\.__ The Old Testament passages such as Daniel 2, Isaiah 2, and Micah 4 depict the eschatological kingdom as a total transformation of current conditions, including spiritual, national, and political blessings, and the future restoration of Israel under the rule of the Messiah\. These prophetic visions are carried forward in the New Testament, where the kingdom is seen as near, with believers connected to the ascended Christ and anticipating a future eschatological reality affirmed by Revelation's references to the new earth and new heavens\. __The Coming of the Eschatological Kingdom\.__ The New Testament describes the kingdom's arrival through a dual narrative: its inauguration by Christ’s Cross, Resurrection, and Ascension, and its future completion through judgment on the day of the Lord amid varying descriptions of gradual development or climactic change\. __A Millennial Phase of This Eschatological Kingdom?__ Blaising believes John’s revelation of the millennial kingdom aligns with New Testament teachings on the eschatological kingdom\. This phase, situated between Christ's coming and the final judgment, harmonizes with scriptural texts like Isaiah 65 and Zechariah 14, which depict a renewed world alongside lingering sin and death, pointing to an intermediate millennial kingdom before the ultimate kingdom is fully realized\. __Premillennialism in the Book of Revelation\.__ Blaising outlines the structural interpretation of Revelation, with distinct sections indicated by the phrase "in the Spirit," suggesting distinct revelations\. The Millennium falls within the narrative span of Christ’s second advent and preceding the new Jerusalem's establishment, offering a more coherent framework than traditional divisions\. __The Crux Interpretum: Revelation 20:4\-6__ details the Millennium, a period where resurrected saints and martyrs reign with Christ for a thousand years, suggesting a physical resurrection based on contextual and grammatical interpretation\. The use of "until" implies a significant change follows this period\. Though the number "thousand" could be symbolic, it still denotes a definitive time frame\. Blaising asserts that interpretations considering the literary structure recognize this interregnum, viewing it as subsequent to Christ’s return, despite opposition from Amillennial and Postmillennial perspectives\.

1. __A Postmillennial Response – Kenneth L\. Gentry Jr\.__

__Presentational Bias\.__ Gentry challenges the portrayal of Postmillennialism as characterized by anarchical militarism\. He argues that this depiction is misleading and does not accurately reflect the true nature of the belief\. __Historical Anomalies\.__ Gentry critiques the historical portrayal of Premillennialism, noting that figures like Irenaeus did not strictly adhere to this view\. Irenaeus, he points out, already showed neo\-Platonic tendencies by differentiating between more spiritual Christians destined for heaven and less spiritual ones for earth\. __Interpretative Failure\.__ Gentry questions the Premillennial interpretation of the new creation as renewed yet still affected by sin and death\. He suggests that a preteristic postmillennial perspective views the new heavens, earth, and Jerusalem as established through the founding of Christianity and God's judgment on Israel with the destruction of the Jewish order in A\.D\. 70\. According to this view, the new order began under Christ and his Apostles and was confirmed by the dismantling of the old covenant\. __Premillennialism's Dependence on Revelation\.__ Gentry argues that Premillennialism relies heavily on John's vision in Revelation\. He highlights Craig A\. Blaising's admission of this dependence, noting that Revelation is notoriously challenging to interpret, leading to varied perspectives\. Gentry counters Blaising's claim of theological bias when others disagree by suggesting Blaising himself shows bias\. Blaising prefers the New Creation Model over the Spiritual Vision Model, interpreting Revelation 20 literally\. Gentry questions the idea of a "literal sense" given Revelation's symbolic nature, a point John himself acknowledges\. __Silence on Pretribulational Rapture\. __In examining Premillennial beliefs, Gentry questions the absence of references to a pretribulational Rapture in Revelation 19\-20, a critical element of Premillennialism\. He challenges Blaising's two\-resurrection interpretation, wondering how those who are raptured, converted during the tribulation, or alive in the millennium fit into the schema if the first resurrection is for the elect and the second is only for unbelievers\. Gentry believes Blaising's interpretation does not align with the New Testament, leading to reinterpretations rather than harmonization\. __Gentry's Preteristic Interpretation\.__ Gentry views Revelation's primary purpose as prophesying the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in A\.D\. 70, aligning with Jesus's predictions of imminent judgment\. He interprets Revelation, particularly chapter 19, as illustrating this theme, advocating for a preteristic understanding\. __Premillennialism's Focus on Revelation\.__ Gentry discusses Blaising’s idea that Revelation is progressive revelation, offering an alternative view to earlier revelation\. He suggests that "coming to life" in Revelation 20:4 might signify a return to spiritual vitality rather than a physical resurrection, consistent with the notion of the collapse of Israel being the primary enemy of the early Christian martyrs\.

1. __An Amillennial Response – Robert B\. Strimple__

__Greek Dualism and Amillennialism\.__ Strimple argues against Blaising's claim that ancient Amillennialism was influenced by Greek dualism, asserting that Blaising fails to demonstrate this connection\. Strimple states that neither ancient nor modern post\-Reformation Amillennialism is informed by Greek dualism, and Amillennialism actually supports the New Creation Model\. __Critique of Premillennialism's Foundations\.__ Strimple challenges Blaising's assertion that the Spiritual Vision Model is incompatible with an earthly millennial reign of Christ, and that the New Creation Model triggered a rediscovery of Premillennialism\. He notes that the Reformers' use of "literal" interpretation did not mean "literal wherever possible," a misinterpretation only found among Radical Reformers who also held the "soul sleep" doctrine\. According to Strimple, Blaising heavily relies on Revelation 20 to support his views\. __The Eschatological Vision of the New Testament\.__ Strimple emphasizes that the entire New Testament presents Christ's return as the *culmination of redemptive history*, integrating the resurrection of believers and the unjust, judgment for all, the end, the new heavens and earth, and the establishment of the eternal state of the redeemed\. He contends that the Old Testament prophecies do not describe a millennium but the eternal kingdom of God, a concept fulfilled in Christ’s messianic kingdom according to authoritative post\-Pentecost apostolic interpretation\. __The Prophetic Structure of Revelation\.__ Strimple counters Blaising's view that the literary structure of Revelation demands a chronological understanding of chapters 19:11 to 20:10\. He argues that such a reading is unwarranted and lacks evidence, pointing out that the Babylon and New Jerusalem motifs represent the current age and the future age, respectively\. Strimple sees Revelation 20 as a recapitulation of the rest of the book, referring to a single battle progressively revealed throughout the text\. He argues that the thrones mentioned are heavenly, indicating that the thousand years refer to a heavenly scene, not an earthly millennium\. The ruling "with an iron scepter" signifies judgment rather than a millennial reign\. __Strimple's Key Assertions\.__ Strimple's primary arguments include the viewpoint that Revelation employs recapitulation, offering progressive revelation concerning the same eschatological event\. He maintains that Revelation refers to a single event, with the ruling of saints occurring in heaven rather than on earth during a millennium\.

__Summary Essay \- Darrell L\. Bock\.__

__Textual and Integrational Arguments\.__ Bock discusses the complex nature of millennial debates, noting they are rooted in hermeneutical issues that can appear circular\. Foundational questions about literal, allegorical, or symbolic interpretations significantly influence the reader's perception of eschatology\. __Categories of Disagreement\.__ Bock identifies three main categories of disagreement\.

1. __Integrative Hermeneutical Categories\.__ These include preunderstandings of various doctrines, the relationship between Old and New Testament texts, the function of typology, and the roles of Israel and Revelation in eschatological frameworks, as well as concepts of dualism and the millennial kingdom\.
2. __Textual Hermeneutical Issues\.__ The nature of the Book of Revelation as apocalyptic literature, its role as predictive or symbolic, and the handling of numerical symbolism\.
3. __Basic Structural Implications\.__ The final implications of one's hermeneutical stance, whether Amillennial, Premillennial, or Postmillennial, are informed by these categories rather than purely exegetical observations, which are themselves shaped by hermeneutical presuppositions\.

__Points of Agreement\.__ Despite differences, there are foundational agreements\. 1\) Scripture is the ultimate authority; 2\) A sense of fellowship is maintained amid disagreement; 3\) Each view anticipates Christ's eventual victory for God’s glory\.

__Hermeneutical Integration Issues\. __Interpretations of eschatological texts are deeply shaped by one's preunderstanding of God's plan, sovereignty, and the nature of apocalyptic literature\. Postmillennialism approaches the Book of Revelation as a symbolic reflection of first\-century events, while Amillennialism views it as a cyclical portrayal of church history\. Premillennialism, on the other hand, interprets Revelation as a symbolic representation of future events\. The relationship between Old Testament and New Testament texts further complicates interpretations\. Amillennialism and Postmillennialism apply Old Testament prophecies about Israel to the church, whereas Premillennialism holds differing views depending on its form\. __Role of Typology and Revelation\. __Typology plays a significant role in these interpretations, with differing views on whether typological fulfillment of Old Testament imagery is complete or allows for new realizations alongside existing ones\. Premillennialism often strikes a balance, considering both cyclical and sequential patterns in typological interpretation\. The role of Israel is seen variously, with Historical Premillennialism viewing the church as a continuation of Israel, while Dispensationalism expects a future mass conversion of Jews\. Regarding Revelation, Premillennialism sees it as a comprehensive guide to the end times, whereas Amillennialism and Postmillennialism prioritize harmony with the broader New Testament\. Additionally, a dualistic view within Dispensationalism elevates heaven above earth, affecting perspectives on earthly and heavenly realities, with the Millennial Kingdom viewed by Premillennialists as an interim earthly phase\. __Hermeneutical Textual Issues\. __When considering the apocalyptic nature of the Book of Revelation, debates arise over whether it should be viewed as hope literature or as a reflection of crisis\. Premillennialists tend to see it as predictive of future events, while Amillennialists and Postmillennialists find it more relevant to the current age\. The imagery in Revelation invites interpretations that span from symbolic to literal, addressing past, present, and future events, though their relevance to completion remains debated\. Numerical symbols contribute significantly to these interpretations but do not negate millennial perspectives\.  __Hermeneutical Textual Issues\. __Interpretations of the apocalyptic nature of Revelation vary, with Premillennialists viewing it as a futurist work predicting end times, while Amillennialists and Postmillennialists see it as reflecting the current age\. The imagery of the text, influenced by the Jewish apocalyptic genre, raises the possibility of intermediate rule with varying interpretations\. Two primary options exist\. 1\) The text uses symbolic imagery to represent certain realities, or 2\) the text depicts visions as accurately as possible, posing challenges like historical relevance \(e\.g\., Scorpions as B\-29s\) and ignoring symbolic imagery\. Numeric symbolism in Revelation contributes to interpretive challenges but does not rule out a Millennial concept, allowing for diverse eschatological perspectives\. __Structural Implications and Conclusion\. __The eschatological view one holds significantly impacts theological practice and church\-state relations\. Postmillennialism encourages an optimistic view of the church's capacity to assert God's sovereignty over societal structures\. In contrast, Amillennialism focuses on the enduring sovereignty of God amid human depravity, positioning the church as a guiding light but recognizing that immediate success is unlikely\. Finally, Premillennialism sees the church as pivotal in achieving ultimate victory, acknowledging a necessary separation of church and state, and views the Millennial Kingdom as a transitional period of transformation\.
