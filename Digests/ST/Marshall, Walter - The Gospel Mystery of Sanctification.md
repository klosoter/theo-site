__The Gospel Mystery of Sanctification \(1692\) – Walter Marshall__

__1\. That We May Acceptably Perform the Duties of Holiness and Righteousness Required in the Law\.__ In this opening chapter, Marshall underscores the spiritual and comprehensive nature of holiness, aligning it with love and obedience to natural and moral laws that conform to divine standards\. Holiness is not merely a means to an end but is vital despite our spiritual deadness and inherent corruption\. Acknowledging that we are under God's curse and that natural law alone is insufficient, sanctification is presented as the grace of God\. Through Scripture and Christ, God provides guidance, emphasizing humility and the necessity of divine assistance on the path to holiness\.

__2\. Several Endowments and Qualifications Are Necessary to Enable Us for the Immediate Practice of the Law\.__ Holy practice requires an inherent inclination and propensity towards the duties of the law, which is aligned with the image of God\. This restores us from the original corruption inclined towards sin\. To truly love God, understanding our reconciliation with Him is crucial, as is possessing the hope of eternal happiness, which motivates genuine moral action\. Strength to perform duties is granted by God, as sincere obedience transcends habit reform, requiring a deeper mortification of corrupt affections and replacing them with holy aspirations\.

__3\. The Way to Get Holy Endowments and Qualifications Necessary\.__ Marshall explains that the foundation for acquiring holy qualifications is union with Christ, a dynamic relationship characterized by both mutual indwelling and reliance\. Through Christ, believers inherit spiritual blessings, receive a renewed nature, and are set free from the guilt and power of sin\. This union, which mirrors the relationship of nourishment, growth, and construction from Christ as the vine, head, cornerstone, and bridegroom, is accomplished through His incarnation, death, resurrection, and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit\.

__4\. The Means by Which the Spirit of God Accomplishes Our Union with Christ\.__ The Gospel of grace and its proclamation produce faith in believers, a fundamental channel through which Christ and all His benefits—including holiness—are received\. This faith is not just intellectual assent but an all\-encompassing belief in Christ's promise of salvation\. Through this belief, we are united with Christ, putting on His righteousness and receiving the fullness of His grace\. True faith inclines the soul towards holiness and is energized by the Holy Spirit\.

__5\. We Cannot Attain to the Practice of True Holiness by Any of Our Endeavors\.__ Marshall challenges the sufficiency of human effort by highlighting the total corruption of the human heart\. Legalism, even when zealously pursued, falls short, as the qualities essential for true holiness are only attainable through union with Christ\. In our natural state, marked by sin, divine wrath, and spiritual deadness, it is impossible to achieve holiness\. True transformation requires the crucifixion of the old self with Christ, enabling a new life that is rooted in the image of God\.

__6\. Those that Endeavor to Perform Sincere Obedience to All the Commands of Christ\.__ Sincere obedience is possible only through grace, faith, and union with Christ, not through the works of the law\. This does not lead to antinomianism, as the law is not opposed by sincere gospel obedience\. Rather, the law directs those already saved to live holy lives\. According to Marshall, the Ten Commandments, which remain in effect through the covenant of grace with Abraham, guide believers' lives\. Works are not a means of salvation but a response to reconciliation with God, motivating believers to live out their faith\.

__7\. We Are Not to Imagine that Our Hearts and Lives Must Be Changed\.__ Change is not a prerequisite for receiving salvation; faith alone is required\. Regeneration, often called the new birth, comes through Christ's work, not human effort\. Genuine faith, demonstrated by good works, emerges after salvation, not before it\. This avoids the error of seeking assurance through our efforts, reminding believers that holiness arises from faith and not as a preliminary condition for it\.

__8\. Be Sure to Seek for Holiness of Heart and Life only in Its Due Order\. __Marshall advocates a specific order, the "Golden Chain," for pursuing holiness: beginning with faith, proceeding to justification, leading to sanctification, and culminating in glorification\. This sequence ensures that believers rely on Christ not only for justification but also for sanctification and eventual glorification\. Holiness flows naturally from the heart made right by faith, reflecting God's image within us\.

__9\. We Must First Receive the Comforts of the Gospel\.__ Before fulfilling the obligations of the law, believers must first receive the comforts provided through the Gospel\. God offers peace, hope, and joy as both a prelude and accompaniment to sanctification\. This assurance strengthens and motivates believers, ensuring that their obedience is grounded in confidence in God's promises rather than fear or despair\.

__10\. That We May Be Prepared by the Comforts of the Gospel\.__ Assurance of salvation through faith in Christ stems from understanding God's intention to give grace\. This assurance is not simply a personal persuasion but a confident knowledge of God's gracious promise, which continues to grow as believers are further renewed in Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit\. This assurance, reflected in the lives of biblical saints, underscores that faith naturally produces assurance over time\.

__11\. Endeavor Diligently to Perform the Great Work of Believing\.__ Marshall exhorts believers to diligently pursue faith in Christ, recognizing it as the means to experiencing union and fellowship with Him and the pursuit of holiness\. This faith must be pursued actively, relying on the transformative power of the Gospel and the conviction of God's promises, and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit rather than delayed\.

__12\. Make Diligent Use of Your Most Holy Faith\. __Faith, once possessed, must be actively engaged with to ensure continual growth and deepening of one's relationship with Christ\. This engagement fortifies the believer’s spiritual life and holiness, aligning actions and intentions with God’s will\.

__13\. Endeavor Diligently to Make the Right Use of All Means\.__ Believers are encouraged to utilize all available means to foster their spiritual growth and holiness\. This includes engaging with Scripture, prayer, and other spiritual disciplines that aid in progressing towards a holy life in union with Christ\.

__14\. That You May Seek Holiness and Righteousness only by Believing\.__ Holiness and righteousness must be sought through the lens of faith, ensuring that the believer remains connected to Christ as the source for all spiritual benefits\. This central focus on faith signifies its critical role in receiving grace and manifesting Christlike righteousness\.

__15\. The Doctrine of Justification Opened and Applied\. __An exploration of justification highlights its role as a vital element in the believer's relationship with God, serving as a means of applying the righteousness of Christ to the believer while maintaining a posture of reliance on faith for spiritual growth and sanctification\.
