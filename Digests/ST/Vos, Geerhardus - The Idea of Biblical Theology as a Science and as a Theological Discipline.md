__The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline \- Geerhardus Vos__

__Biblical Theology as a Unique Field__

Geerhardus Vos begins by defining theology broadly as the knowledge concerning God, which qualifies it as a science—a field of distinct knowledge distinguished by the Creator\-creature relationship\. Theology is unique because it involves a reversed relational dynamic where the object, God, is active and revealing Himself, especially emphasized due to sin\. Consequently, theology must start with God’s self\-revelation, which leads to Exegetical Theology\.

__Exegetical Theology and Biblical Theology__

Exegetical Theology deals with God as the one who reveals Himself and as the author of the Scriptures\. Within Exegetical Theology, Biblical Theology specifically focuses on God's revelation, discussing its forms and content from the standpoint of God’s revealing activity, unlike Systematic Theology, which treats revelation as material for human organization\.

__Features of Biblical Theology__

*1\. Historical Progress\.* Biblical Theology emphasizes the organic development of revelation rather than isolated acts\. This development occurs in two stages: universal and objective acts \(e\.g\., creation, Israel’s redemption, crucifixion\) and particular and subjective acts \(e\.g\., individual salvation\)\. Words and acts work together; without God's acts, the words are empty, and without His words, the acts are blind\.

*2\. Practical Aspect*\. Theology has a practical, not merely intellectual, purpose\. Unlike Greek knowing, which can be abstract, Shemitic knowing is personal and existential\. Revelation is deeply interwoven with people and history, operating within the context of a covenant rather than an academic construct\. This makes Biblical Theology a part of Exegetical Theology, which focuses on revelation’s historical continuity and organic development—an internal expansion rather than external accretion\.

__Organic Development of Revelation__

Revelation in Biblical Theology undergoes continuous, organic development marked by various covenants \(paradise, Abraham, Sinai, Jeremiah, Jesus\)\. The Old Testament's redemptive acts work towards realization in the Incarnation and Atonement\. After this realization, no further development occurs\. Revelation employs different types: prophetic, poetic, and legal, delivered through human instruments that exhibit their peculiarities\. Biblical Theology presents the organic progress of supernatural revelation in its historical continuity and diversity\.

__Misconceptions and Clarifications__

*Not Evolutionary*: The organic development in Biblical Theology is not evolutionary; it does not imply a gradual advance from imperfection to perfection, which would undermine its theistic character and assume metaphysical agnosticism\. *Objective Character: *Biblical Theology focuses on the objective character of revelation rather than being a sociological or subjective study of religion as proposed by figures like Ritschl and Schleiermacher\.

__Foundation in Scriptural Truthfulness__

Biblical Theology is rooted in the truthfulness of Scripture as a whole, seeing the Bible as both direct and inspired revelation\. It cannot be treated as merely a history of dogma or solely as theology\.

__Advantages of Biblical Theology__

*1\. Organized Revelationary Activity*\. Recognizing the Bible as an __organized__ revelationary activity of God rather than a product of chance\. *2\. Antidote to Critical Views*: Serving as an effective countermeasure against destructive critical views that seek to __disorganize__ biblical understanding\. *3\. Revitalization of Truth*: Bringing a fresh life and vivid historical understanding to old truths\. *4\. Importance to Systematic Theology*: Crucial for Systematic Theology, which relies on Biblical Theology as a foundational, inductive science\. Biblical Theology provides a historical constructive principle for arranging biblical facts, while Systematic Theology offers a logical/systematic principle for arranging these facts\.

In summary, Vos presents Biblical Theology as a scientific and theological discipline that not only has a unique role in understanding God’s progressive and organic revelation but also serves as a foundational framework for the broader field of Systematic Theology\.
