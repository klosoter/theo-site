__The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit – Geerhardus Vos__

__Eschatological Expectations in the New Testament__

Vos begins by explaining that New Testament Christians held strong eschatological expectations and interpreted their experiences through this lens\. For Paul, the resurrection of Christ marked the beginning of the general resurrection of the saints, a major eschatological event\. This perspective shaped his understanding of salvation, justification, and regeneration, which he viewed in terms of their eschatological fulfillment\.

__Eschatology as a Framework__

Vos contends that eschatology provides the framework to explain various theological aspects in the New Testament\. He challenges modern perspectives by showing that the early Christians, including Paul, believed in the nearness of the parousia \(Second Coming\), not as an outlier belief but as a byproduct of their eschatological mindset\.

__Paul’s Doctrine of the Holy Spirit__

Vos examines the close interdependence between Paul’s understanding of the Holy Spirit and his eschatology\. While Johannine theology often depicts the Holy Spirit as a representative of Christ during His absence, Vos asserts that Paul perceives the Spirit in an eschatological context\. Paul's view contrasts with the common interpretation, placing greater emphasis on the Holy Spirit’s role in the unfolding of eschatological events\.

__Old Testament Foundations__

Vos traces the eschatological significance of the Holy Spirit back to the Old Testament, noting several key points: Prophetic Signs: Joel's prophecy links the Spirit with supernatural, prophetic events, indicating eschatological fulfillment\. Messianic Equipment: Isaiah describes the Spirit as a permanent attribute of the coming Messiah, equipping Him for His role\. Future Renewal: The Spirit is seen in Isaiah and Ezekiel as inaugurating the new life for Israel, promising future restoration\. Supernatural Connection: The Spirit fosters a transcendental relationship between humanity and the divine, awakening a supernatural awareness\.

__Early Jewish and Christian Expectations__

Moving from the Old Testament to early Jewish and Christian thought, Vos highlights how these traditions continued the eschatological expectations associated with the Spirit\. Apocryphal and rabbinic writings echo the Old Testament themes, regarding the Spirit as not just an ethical influence but an eschatological agent, linking the Spirit to resurrection and messianic hopes\.

__The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles__

In the Gospels, the Holy Spirit remains somewhat in the background, but key events such as Jesus' baptism by the Spirit illustrate the Messiah's role in imparting the Spirit\. The Spirit is portrayed as bridging the heavenly and earthly realms\. Peter’s sermon in Acts connects the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost with Joel's prophecy about the "last days\."

__Pauline Theology of the Spirit__

Vos details Paul's unique contributions to the theology of the Spirit, emphasizing the Spirit's role in eschatological fulfillment\. Resurrection and the Spirit: Paul ties the resurrection directly to the Spirit's action\. Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit who raised Christ dwelling in believers, ensuring their future resurrection\. Eternal Life: Galatians 6:8 contrasts sowing to the flesh \(leading to corruption\) with sowing to the Spirit \(leading to eternal life\)\. This phraseology denotes a present experience with future significance\. Guarantee of Future Life: In 2 Corinthians 5:5, the Spirit is described as a pledge or guarantee of future life, intertwining present spiritual experiences with future eschatological fulfillment\. Resurrected State: For Paul, the "spiritual body" is the resurrected state, a future reality initiated by the Spirit\. Romans 1:4 connects the Spirit to Christ's resurrection\.

__Dual Worlds: Flesh and Spirit__

Vos explains Paul’s dualistic worldview, which divides reality into the lower \(flesh\) and higher \(spirit\) worlds\. Believers, by virtue of Christ’s resurrection, belong to the pneuma\-world inaugurated by Jesus\. This reality coexists with the present age, yet remains eschatologically oriented\.

Eschatological\-Soteriological Dimensions

Paul uses the possession of the Spirit to highlight justified and sanctified status\. The Spirit's indwelling signifies both present renewal and future transformation\. The Christian life, characterized by the Spirit, is framed by both justification and sanctification, underscoring an eschatological dimension to ethical conduct\.

__Practical Implications and Revelatory Experience__

Vos points out that both Jesus’ and Paul’s teachings translate the blessings anticipated from the eschatological future into present experiences\. For Paul, the Spirit is closely connected to life itself, acting as the believer's link to future eschatological reality\.

__Pauline Conclusion on the Spirit__

Vos concludes that Paul’s view of the Holy Spirit is inherently eschatological, impacting the full range of Christian life and imparting a new moral and religious vitality\. The Spirit is preeminently the Spirit of Christ, shaping the believer’s present life in anticipation of the future consummation\.

By integrating eschatological hope into present experience, Paul’s conception of the Holy Spirit underlines a supernatural interpretation of Christianity\. The Spirit belongs to the age to come but infuses the present Christian life with its redemptive and transformative power, indicating that Paul’s gospel elevates the temporal to eternal significance\. By doing so, Paul emphasizes that Christianity is deeply rooted in the supernatural, maintaining a thoroughgoing otherworldliness consistent with future eschatological promises\.
