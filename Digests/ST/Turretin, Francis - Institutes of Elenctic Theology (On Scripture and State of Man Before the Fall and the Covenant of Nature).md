__Institutes of Elenctic Theology \(Holy Scriptures and Pre\-Fall State and Covenant of Nature\)__

__Seventh Topic: The Holy Scriptures\.__

__First Question: The Word of God: Was Verbal Revelation Necessary? We Affirm\. __The Word of God is essential for theology, as human reason is insufficient\. It is seen as the seed of regeneration, the light guiding our path, and the foundation for our spiritual nourishment\. God's perfect goodness and humanity's fallen state make revelation necessary, preventing humanity from remaining in ignorance\. While natural revelation shows God's attributes and existence, it is insufficient for salvation post\-fall, emphasizing the necessity of the Word\.

__Second Question: The Necessity of Scripture: Was It Necessary for the Word of God to Be Committed to Writing? We Affirm\. __Scripture is vital for maintaining its authority against traditions that may claim supremacy\. While God used other means in the past, the written Word became necessary as humanity matured, serving to preserve, vindicate, and propagate God's teachings\. Scripture's written form ensures the continuity and accessibility of revelation, aligning with divine wisdom in communicating with humanity\.

__Third Question: Were the Sacred Scriptures Written only Occasionally and without Divine Command? We Deny\. __Scriptures were written at divine command, merging human opportunity with divine intention\. While not every writer had a specific command, they were guided by the Holy Spirit, ensuring adherence to divine purpose\. The apostles authored texts with individual authority to preserve doctrine consistently under divine influence and guidance\.

__Fourth Question: The Authority of the Holy Scriptures / Are the Holy Scriptures Truly Authentic and Divine? We Affirm\. __Scripture’s authority is intrinsic, deriving from its divine and infallible nature\. It is credible internally, consistent within itself, and externally affirmed by history and tradition\. Marks of divinity, such as the coherence of its teachings, transformative effects, and fulfillment of prophecy, substantiate its authenticity, making it a self\-authenticating source that stands independent of external human endorsements\.

__Fifth Question: Do Real Contradictions Occur in Scripture? Or Are There Any Inexplicable Passages Which Cannot Be Explained and Made to Harmonize? We Deny\. __There are no real contradictions within Scripture; perceived discrepancies are apparent due to human misinterpretation or minor transcription errors\. Scripture remains infallible, with divine nature ensuring its role as a reliable guide\. While copyist errors might occur, they do not undermine doctrinal integrity, supported by historical preservation efforts maintaining textual reliability\.

__Sixth Question: From What Source Does the Divine Authority of the Scriptures Become Known to Us? Does It Depend upon the Testimony of the Church either as to Itself or as to Us? We Deny\. __The authority of Scripture is inherent and not dependent on church testimony\. The church plays roles in guiding and preserving Scripture, but its authority comes from the Holy Spirit, which convicts believers of its truth\. Scripture’s divine nature is self\-evident, akin to sense perception, negating reliance on the church for validation, which might lead to a circular argument\.

__Seventh Question: The Canon\. Has Any Canonical Book Perished? We Deny\. __No canonical book has perished\. Divine providence ensures Scripture's preservation, countering claims that lost texts necessitate tradition for completeness\. Scripture affirms its own durability, supported by historical practices of both Jewish communities and early Christians in maintaining canonical integrity\. 

__Eighth Question: Are the Books of the Old Testament Still a Part of the Canon of Faith and Rule of Practice in the Church of the New Testament? We Affirm against the Anabaptists\. __The Old Testament retains its validity and necessity as part of the Christian canon\. It is crucial for a complete understanding of faith, supporting and corroborating New Testament teachings\. While Christ fulfilled Mosaic law, the Old Testament remains relevant, containing prophetic and doctrinal foundations essential for Christian faith\.

__Ninth Question: Apocryphal Books\. __Apocryphal books are excluded from the canon due to their lack of recognition within Jewish tradition and absence in canonical declarations by Christ\. They are considered valuable for edification but not for establishing doctrine\. Their secondary status, marked by human origin and inconsistencies, distinguishes them from divinely inspired Scripture, affirming their non\-canonical standing\.

__Eighth Topic: The State of Man Before the Fall and the Covenant of Nature__

__First Question: What Was the Liberty of Adam in His State of Innocence? __Adam's state of innocence included a happy condition characterized by the image of God—original righteousness, immortality, dominion, and liberty\. Liberty had four dimensions: independence \(belonging only to God\), freedom from coercion \(acting spontaneously\), rational freedom \(acting from choice\), and freedom from slavery \(not under the yoke of sin or misery\)\. Adam's liberty, consisting of freedom from coercion and physical necessity, was essential, whereas freedom from slavery was accidental; he possessed the ability not to sin but not the immutability of grace\. His liberty didn’t consist in being equally disposed to good or evil, which would contradict the nature of will and God’s law\. __Second Question: Did Adam Have the Power to Believe In Christ? __In dispute with Arminians, the question is not whether Adam believed in Christ but whether he had the potential if Christ were revealed\. Adam had the power to believe every word of God, including potential revelation of Christ\. He had the power to love God fully, and hypothetically, he could have believed in Christ if it were part of his revelation\. Mercy and repentance would not have been repugnant in his state; though he couldn’t believe in remission for non\-existent sins, he could have believed in the potential for remission following a fall\. __Third Question: Covenant of Nature – Whether God Made Any Covenant with Adam, and What Kind It Was\. __Unlike human covenants based on equality and independence, the covenant God made with Adam, termed the Covenant of Nature, was based on divine condescension to bind man to God’s laws\. This covenant, founded on man’s nature and integrity, involved stipulations and promises due to God’s goodness and man’s purpose for happiness\. It consisted of mutual obligations with promises of eternal reward for obedience and served as the premise for man's representation of the human race\. __Fourth Question: The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil\. Why Was It Called the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and Why Did God Give Adam a Law about Not Tasting It? __The tree was sacramental, representing a test of obedience, not because the fruit imparted knowledge\. It was a means to explore Adam’s obedience and make sin more conspicuous, allowing God to declare dominion and affirm human free will\. The command was simple, underscoring Adam’s responsibility and revealing human mutability, thus glorifying God through either mercy or justice\. __Fifth Question: The Tree of Life: Why Was It Called the Tree of Life? __The tree was sacramental rather than efficient, reminding of past life and sealing future blessedness\. It symbolized eternal life and the state of grace, prefiguring the heavenly reward\. It represented not only physical immortality but also eternal blessedness, acting as a signifier of Christ, who is the true Tree of Life\. __Sixth Question: Whether Adam Had the Promise of Eternal and Heavenly Life So That \(His Course of Obedience Being Finished\), He Would Have Been Carried to Heaven\. We Affirm\. __The orthodox view affirms that Adam had the promise of celestial and eternal life contingent on obedience, against the Socinian belief in strictly earthly rewards\. The law of works inherently promised eternal life, reflected in Christ’s acquisition of eternal existence\. Eternal punishment implies a counterbalance of eternal life, necessitating enjoying God eternally\. The covenant of nature depended on natural obedience but anticipated heavenly blessings, as the final spiritual state must transcend the earthly existence\.
