__42\. Wezen en Werking der Zonde \(The Essence and Operation of Sin\) – Herman Bavinck__

__328\. Original Sin and the First Sin\. __Bavinck discusses original sin not just as a hereditary trait but as an existential reality applied to all of Adam's descendants, with his sin imputed to humanity at large\. The first sin, as different theological traditions interpret it, ranges from lust in angels to pride \(superbia\) in humanity according to Roman thought, while Protestants see doubt and unbelief leading to both pride and lust\. Additionally, Tertullian, supported by Bavinck, viewed it as a comprehensive transgression against all commandments, emphasizing the sin’s voluntary and free nature despite the presence of temptation\.

__329\. Terminology of Sin\. __Various terms from Hebrew, Greek, and Latin describe the aspects of sin, highlighting its complexity\. Words like 'Chatat' \(missing the mark\) and 'Awen' \(crookedness\) in Hebrew underscore the multifaceted nature of sin, while Greek and Latin terms depict it as deviation, injustice, and lawlessness\. Contrary to some claims that early Israel lacked a developed concept of sin, Bavinck points to scriptural references like Genesis 18 and 38, which already speak of sin as knowingly breaking God's law, emphasizing that divine, not societal, standards define sin's essence\.

__330\. The Essence of Sin\. __The essence of sin has been sought in wrath \(Böhme\), an evil dualistic power \(Mani\), and matter \(Plato, Jews, Flacius\)\. According to Christian Theology, the essence of sin is not a substance; it is a deviation from the good, viewed as *amissio*, *corruptio*, or *privatio boni*—defying the idea of God as its author\. Bavinck critiques terms like "privation" as insufficient, noting that sin functions as an *active*, corrupting power beyond mere absence of good\. Sin’s destructive nature is emphasized, contradicting notions of it as a mere deficiency or negative state\. In bypassing pure metaphysical descriptions, sin is inherently an ethical\-spiritual deficiency\.

__331\. Ethical and Mysterious Aspects of Sin\. __Sin, while lacking physical or metaphysical substance, is ethically contrary to goodness\. It does not possess ontological power but leads to the loss of the *imago Dei* and the dissolution of the covenant of works\. While the human nature remains intact \(having lost ethical righteousness\), sin’s privative state emphasizes lack of goodness\. God's law remains the only measure for sin, beyond human constructs like culture or autonomous reasoning\. Sin can only live in rational creature \(the will\), and concupiscence is also sin \(against Rome\)\.

__332\. Human and Demonic Sin\. __

Sin manifests differently between humans and demons although it’s always *anomia*\. Christ's assumption of human nature underscores redemption’s limitation to humans, not angels\. Sin is not a weakness \(cf\. Arminians and Pelagius\), as Satan, an originally a strong and good angelic being, illustrates\. 

__333\. Diversity in Human Sin\. __Variations in sin involve intentionality and responsibility, with serious implications for how sins are perceived in religious frameworks\. Sins against God are seen as weightier than those against fellow humans or creation\. Catholic distinctions between mortal and venial sins account for such nuances, but Bavinck asserts that all sins merit eternal consequences\.

__334\. Sin Against the Holy Spirit\. __The so\-called unforgivable sin is not ordinary unbelief, but a deliberate and intentional blasphemy against the Holy Spirit—regarded as consciously attributing God's work to demonic forces\. This sin is against the law *and *the gospel reflecting a complete reversal of truth, deliberately, on purpose, ascribing God’s work to the Devil\. 

Original sin is not mere heredity; it is a universal reality in all people, everywhere\. The original sin should not be reduced to one kind of trespass; it was a conscious, willful disobedience that, in principle, transgressed all of God’s commandments\. Adam’s sin was a reversal of all created relationships and a rebellion against God that was decisive for the whole world\.

Though sin is appallingly many\-sided, with untold moral dimensions, at its heart, it is a religious revolt against God and thus appropriately summarized as lawlessness\. Contrary to some interpretations of the Old Testament, going back to the early church, sin is never an arbitrary matter, merely a whimsical displeasure of a jealous God\. Sin is knowingly breaking God’s command and flows from a heart that rebels against God\. God’s law may incorporate human customs but is always more than custom\. Especially the second table of the law is reflected in the laws of the nations, but for Israel all moral and ceremonial commands are framed by the command to serve the Lord God of Israel, the Creator and Redeemer of his people\. Jesus does not repudiate Old Testament law but fulfills it and with his Spirit writes God’s law on our hearts\.

On the basis of this biblical teaching, Christian theology has always rejected all substantive notions of sin\. Sin as a no\-thing can only be a privation or corruption of the good\. The idea of sin as privation, however, is incomplete; sin is also an active, corrupting, destructive power\. Christian theology also rejects all pantheistic notions of sin as pure negation, as a state of “not yet,” as a necessary component in the development of being, or as an illusion of thought\. Sin is a privation of the moral perfection human persons ought to possess and includes active transgression\. Having no existence on its own, sin is ethical\-spiritual in nature, though it always comes to expression in concrete terms\. It is a deformity, a departure from God’s perfect law by rational creatures who can know God’s will\. Because in its existence it has no real right to exist, sin is a riddle, a mystery\.

There is variety and degree in sin, beginning with the distinction between human and diabolical sin\. The Bible speaks of a kingdom of evil, a host of darkness ultimately opposed to Christ and his kingdom, the deceivers and accusers of God’s children\. Though Satan is the archenemy of God and his people and irredeemable, there is no Supreme Evil corresponding to God as the Supreme Good\. Even among devils, sin is form and not substance\. Sin is not; it wants to be\. 

There is also diversity in human sin\. Human intention is very important in assessing degrees of culpability\. Inadvertent sins done out of ignorance are not the same as those done “high\-handedly\.” Sins against the first table of the law are more serious than those against the second\. Circumstances and degree always need to be taken into account\.

 Sin also develops in an order dynamic; there is a law of sin that proceeds from suggestion to enjoyment to consent to execution and involves both our sensuality and our self\-seeking\. Neither sensuality nor self\-seeking can be explained one from the other; both are involved in our sins as embodied spiritual persons\. In all the variety of forms that sin can take, we need to consider the traditional Roman Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sins\. Rooted in the practice of penance, the distinction was intended to honor the diversity and degree of sin discussed above\. However, the Reformers rejected the distinction\. While not denying the variety and degree of sin, the Reformers insisted that sins must never be individualistically and atomistically abstracted from the person who commits the sin\. It is the sinful person who needs forgiveness and liberation from all sin\. Thus, only the so\-called sin against the Holy Spirit is considered by Reformed thought to be a “mortal” sin\. This biblical category applies only to the case where someone denies the conviction of his own heart and consciously and willfully blasphemes the Holy Spirit by putting God in Satan’s place and Satan in God’s place\. This is a demonic posture; it is pure conscious hatred of God and his work\. For this there can be no forgiveness
