__The Doctrine of Sin in Reformed and Neo\-Orthodox Thought \- Ian Campbell__

__Section 1: The Biblical Doctrine of Sin\.__

__Introduction\.__ The biblical doctrine of sin is intricate due to the varied vocabulary and evolving emphasis in each epoch of revelation, as noted by Geerhardus Vos\. With terms like 'chata' in the Old Testament and 'hamartia' in the New Testament, sin involves deviation, guilt, and rebellion, emphasizing scripture's complexity and human character\.

__1\. The Old Testament\.__

__Sin in the Mosaic Epoch__\. This period spans from creation to the establishment of Israel as a theocratic nation, highlighting the entrance of sin and the delivery of God's law, which is pivotal\. *The Genesis Narratives*\. Genesis chapter 3 implies human perfection, Satan’s fall, and a probationary command from God—whether covenantal is debated\. Calvin identifies unbelief as the root of humanity's fall, affecting all relational aspects of existence\. The protoevangelium introduces the temporary nature of sin, promising its defeat\. *The Flood*\. Represented as a universal judgment, the biblical flood, unlike other mythological accounts, claims historical authenticity\. It highlights sin's universality and necessitates divine judgment, with Noah’s salvation symbolizing covenantal grace\. *Revelation of the Law*\. The Sinaitic Law, rooted in a covenantal relationship, outlines sinfulness through its commandments, demonstrating sin as an objective breach rather than a subjective state—highlighting the role of the law role in revealing sin and underscoring grace\. __Histories and Prophets__\. Subsequent Old Testament narratives build on earlier chapters, illustrating sin as transgression against God’s commandments, evident in figures like Saul\. Prophets address national sins, linking them to covenant violations and pointing to restoration through eschatology\. __Poetic Literature\.__ These books reflect the personal nature of sin, delineating both individual acts and inherent corruption, with the Psalms highlighting repentance and divine healing\.

__2\. The New Testament\.__

__The Doctrine of Sin in the Teaching of Our Lord\.__ Despite differing Gospel accounts, Jesus consistently acknowledges sin's reality, considering all humanity sinful, treating sin with gravity, and demonstrating authority to forgive, chiefly through His vicarious death\. __The Doctrine of Sin in the Pauline Corpus\.__ Paul’s perspective on sin is tied to Christ’s work\. Sin manifests in multiple forms: an immense debt, deviation from law, lawlessness, internal and external influences, and suppression of truth\. Paul emphasizes humanity's exposure to divine wrath and the consequences of sin, clarifying that sin's origin does not excuse its presence\. __The Doctrine of Sin in the Rest of the New Testament\.__ Other New Testament writings address the nature of sin and consequences\. *Hebrews* links sin to atonement, highlighting Christ’s reconciliation\. *James* underscores sin’s progression from temptation to death\. *Peter* connects atonement with redemption and eschatological outcomes\.* Jude* mirrors Peter’s themes\. *The Johannine Epistles* present sin as lawlessness and demonic influence\. *Revelation* portrays sin as the Beast, emphasizing God's judgment and the ultimate defeat of sin in a new sinless kingdom\. __Conclusion__\. 1\. Creation began good\. 2\. Sin entered humanity\. 3\. God responded immediately\. 4\. Grace accompanied judgment\. 5\. The Law called a people unto God\. 6\. Prophets enforced the demands of God's law\. 7\. Psalms emphasize individual responsibility\. 8\. Christ’s advent is pivotal in destroying sin\. 9\. New Testament epistles expand on Gospel truths\. 10\. Revelation depicts the final resolution of the story of sin\.

__Section 2: The Reformed Doctrine of Sin\.__

__3\. John Calvin and the Problem of Sin\.__

John Calvin emphasized two themes: knowledge of God and knowledge of self, with sin integral to the latter\. Original sin \(*peccatum originale*\) is seen as radical unbelief, not merely a moral flaw\. __Consequences of the Fall\.__ Calvin identifies two consequences: the effacement of God’s image in humanity, losing wisdom and virtue, and humanity’s corruption through Adam as both progenitor and root\. Original sin is described as hereditary corruption, affecting the entire soul and leading to sinful acts\. __Original Sin and Free Will\.__ Calvin asserts that the human intellect and will are bound to earthly concerns due to sin\. While humans can choose sin, they cannot overcome it without divine help\. He maintains that humanity retains some capabilities in secular realms but requires divine assistance for spiritual growth\. __Reprobation and Responsibility\.__ Calvin affirms God’s absolute sovereignty, with salvation dependent on divine mercy and judgment\. He emphasizes that the real wonder is that anyone is saved at all, seeing predestination and election as awe\-inspiring mysteries similar to the Trinity\. __Conclusion__: Calvin asserts total human corruption and the inherited guilt from Adam as foundational to Reformed theology, underscoring the pervasive nature of sin and the necessity of divine grace for redemption\.

__4\. The Hamartiology of Martin Luther\. __

Martin Luther's understanding of sin was central to the Reformation, deeply influencing his theological positions and ecclesiastical reforms\. His writings present a comprehensive view of human depravity and the power of divine grace\. __*Preface to the New Testament\.*__ Luther describes Christ as the prophesied "seed of the woman" who overcomes the devil, sin, death, and hell\. This highlights the necessity of Christ for redemption, as humans are powerless against these forces without Him\. __*Preface to the Romans\.*__ Luther parallels Calvin in identifying unbelief as the core of sin, with the heart being the source of sinful motivations\. This framing underscores sin’s deep\-rooted nature in humanity, driving disobedience and separation from God\. __*Commentary on Galatians*\.__ Luther contrasts grace with the law, arguing that grace liberates from sin and brings inner peace, whereas the law, while requiring obedience, is incapable of salvation\. He critiques works righteousness, emphasizing that the law exposes sin but cannot save, while grace provides true reconciliation with God\. __*The Bondage of the Will\.*__ Aligning with Augustine, Luther asserts that humanity is inherently corrupt and lacks spiritual purity\. True freedom is God’s alone; humans have no innate spiritual free will\. The law’s role is to highlight human incapacity, emphasizing the need for divine grace to overcome sin\. Luther’s theology across these works highlights the necessity of Christ’s intervention to conquer sin, laying the groundwork for the Reformation by challenging notions of human goodness and spiritual autonomy\.

__6\. Sin and the Puritan Tradition\.__

In line with Reformation thought, the Puritan tradition emphasized the pervasive impact of sin and the necessity of grace\. __Thomas Goodwin\.__ He focused on the imputation of Adam’s sin, leading to a total corruption inherited by all through natural descent\. Goodwin argued that the unregenerate, despite showing conscience, lack the grace to overcome their corruption\. Original sin consists of Adam's guilt and inbred corruption, requiring repentance rather than just baptism for absolution\. __Richard Sibbes\.__ Sibbes viewed sin as a comprehensive breach of divine law affecting all behavior\. He detailed sin’s tripartite nature: Adam’s sin, a deprived nature, and actual sins\. Through grace, true understanding of sin is achieved, and Christ's sacrifice satisfies divine justice\. __John Owen\.__ Owen described sin as bringing spiritual death, incapacitating true obedience to God\. Sin, present from life’s beginning, grows as one ages\. Only God’s intervention can restrain this evil, and grace is essential for overcoming sin’s rule in the heart\. Puritan insights into sin and grace influenced the Westminster Assembly’s confessional work and shaped early American theology through leaders like Jonathan Edwards, highlighting human depravity and divine grace in redemption\.

__7\. Sin in the Theology of Charles Hodge\.__

Charles Hodge, a key figure at Princeton, articulated Reformed hamartiology by defining sin in relation to a personal God and man's responsibility\. In his "Systematic Theology," Hodge presents original sin as a universal and innate corruption passed down from Adam, resulting in actual sins\. Regeneration introduces a spiritual life that coexists with inherent corruption, leading to the inner conflict between sin and grace in believers\. Hodge describes sin as inherently evil, violating God's law by embodying guilt and pollution\. Through Adam, sin is imputed to humanity, bringing about corruption and inability to align with divine righteousness\. In his view, the *natural and federal union* between Adam and his descendants underlies the transmission of sin, marking a loss of original righteousness and leading to moral depravity, which persists even in the regenerated soul, rendering humans spiritually incapacitated\.

__8\. The Twentieth Century: John Murray and G\. C\. Berkouwer\.__

__John Murray__ focused on the concept of the imputation of Adam's sin, delving into the theological implications of sin in his works\. __G\.C\. Berkouwer__ extensively explored the nature of sin in volumes like "The Origin and Knowledge of Sin" and "The Essence and Spread of Sin\." He characterizes sin as a unique riddle, impossible to fully explain, yet central to understanding God's sovereignty over sin's effects\. Berkouwer argues that both the law and gospel illuminate sin, advocating for a unified approach to repentance\. Berkouwer stresses sin's inherent opposition to God, examining its gradation based on intent and motive without aligning with Roman Catholic traditions\. Post\-Christ, rebellion is seen as a conscious act against divine enlightenment\. He maintains that divine wrath and mercy coexist, with God's mercy not tolerating sin\. Berkouwer rejects both realism and federalism, instead supporting "common guilt in Adam" in line with Bavinck\. He concludes that the end of sin only occurs after the resurrection in union with Christ, though he does not delve into the fate of the godless\.

__9\. The Doctrine of Sin in the Theology of Karl Barth\.__

Karl Barth is a pivotal figure whose genius significantly shapes modern theology, making an engagement with his views indispensable\. Despite his influence by existentialism, especially from Søren Kierkegaard, Barth places a unique emphasis on dialectics and paradox in theology\.

__Barth's Presuppositions\.__ While Barth acknowledges existential categories, he doesn't deem them sufficient for theological interpretation\. He is influenced by Kierkegaard's emphasis on subjectivity, stressing that human subjects project ideals of the absolute\. Barth sees existence as preceding revelation, with God's acts taking precedence in interpreting divine mysteries\.

__Doctrine of Revelation\.__ Barth asserts God's priority over humanity, viewing revelation as action, with God remaining hidden even as He reveals Himself\. He situates Jesus Christ at the center of revelation, portraying Him as fully revealing God while paradoxically maintaining Him as "unknown\." Revelation, according to Barth, lacks objective authority and is contingent on individual faith experiences\. __Doctrine of Scripture\.__ For Barth, Scripture is a witness to the Word rather than the Word itself \("the Word of God is in the Bible, but in it only potentially"\)\. It becomes God's Word when it is experienced \(in an existential encounter – a crisis moment\) by believers, rendering the Bible subjective rather than objectively authoritative\. This subjectivism challenges traditional views that uphold Scripture as the unmediated Word of God\. __Doctrine of Sin in Commentary on Romans\.__ Barth defines sin as a revolt against God that births idolatry and elevates humanity above the divine\. Sin represents a sovereign worldly power, marked by forgetting God, characterized by idolatry and independence\. Restoration resides beyond human capacity, as Barth views humanity and sin as existentially rather than historically constituted\. __Problematic Aspects\.__ Barth’s view that sin is an integral/constitutive part of human nature disrupts the integrity of Christ, who, according to Barth, possesses a discontinuous human nature relative to humanity\. This is also problematic for the concept of restoration as it would require an actual existential and ontological change replacing creatureliness\. Campbell: “Therefore, Neo\-Orthodoxy is reductionist by nature\. Barth's treatment of the Fall of man, categorising it as he does in that world where things exist supra\-historically but by no means actually, reduces sin to the existential place, and man's sinfulness to a stage in his development\.” How can man be held responsible for something he did not actually do? __Reconciliation and Christ's Atonement\.__ Barth’s view emphasizes Christ’s hiddenness in atonement, portraying His messiahship as subjective and faith\-based\. Barth maintains God's "wholly otherness," preventing full union with humanity and leaves sin largely unaltered by the Cross\. His emphasis on subjectivism in atonement urges a focus on mystical rather than historical redemption\. __Evaluation\.__ Barth's hamartiology reflects a methodology mired in subjectivism, dominated by presuppositions and lacking historical grounding\. His views facilitate potential universalism, as sin is significant but not truly defeating\. Barth's approach challenges traditional doctrines about the Word of God by prioritizing experiential interpretation over objective theological standards\. It fails to establish concrete definitions or standards for sin outside his unique Christological framework\.

__10\. The Doctrine of Sin in the Theology of Rudolf Bultmann\.__

__The Nature of Christianity\.__ Bultmann viewed early Christianity as syncretic, incorporating elements from various ideologies and religions\. He contended that the historical Jesus is not essential to Christianity, as the early church misinterpreted His role\. __Rudolf Bultmann and Demythologizing\.__ Bultmann proposed demythologizing the New Testament to recover the core Christian doctrines of the early believers\. He sought to strip away mythological elements, perceiving the scriptural worldview as incompatible with the scientific outlook of modern man\. For Bultmann, true understanding of the Gospels involves discovering how man's existence is depicted in the Bible and then finding personal meaning\. __Doctrine of Sin in The Commentary on John\.__ Bultmann considered John an ecclesiastical redactor\. He believed Jesus's encounter \(in krisis\) with Nicodemus, illustrating Christ as a revealer, demands a personal, existential response vital through which man authenticates his existence in the world\. Sin only exists in such an encounter, and is totally defined in terms of man’s own existence, with sin veiling man’s true selfhood, requiring an existential response to recognize and overcome sin\. “What must I do to be saved?” for Bultmann is “Make your existential decision before the Revealing God\.” __Doctrine of Sin in Theology of the New Testament\. __ Bultmann interpreted Paul's anthropology according to existentialism\. He argued that Paul's notion of 'soma' \(body\) is not purely physical but is about man's relational existence with God\. He reduced sin to missing one's true existence and self\-originating life\. Bultmann saw Paul's views on original sin and Christ's death as influenced by Gnostic myth\.__ The Doctrine of Sin in the Theology of the New Testament\. __*Anthropology*\. Bultmann interprets the Pauline writings as seeing humanity fundamentally in relation to God\. The term __“soma,”__ influenced by Heidegger, is not just physical but reflects an existential connection with God\. Therefore, sin is missing one's true existence, while salvation is realizing it\. Sin involves assuming life is self\-derived rather than from the Creator\. __“Sarx”__ \(flesh\) is viewed not as merely human but as sinful, representing a focus on transient, worldly matters\. Bultmann sees Paul's notions of original sin and Christ's death as shaped by Gnostic myth\. He reinterprets these ideas, viewing the death and resurrection of Christ as crisis\-encounters rather than theological events\. He identifies a divergence between Paul and John, both affected by Gnostic elements \(Paul is also Judaistic\)\. John portrays Jesus as primarily a Revealer, minimizing the concept of atoning sacrifice\. Bultmann considers sin "existence governed by unreality," with belief in Christ becoming a subjective crisis\-encounter for transformation\. Critics argue that “Bultmann’s Faith is irrational, its sole authority is Bultmann himself\.” __Doctrine of Sin in Bultmann's Other Writings\.__ Bultmann approached sin purely existentially, arguing that sin is both personal and communal, affecting relationships with others\. He considered the Gospel as a text for reinterpretation by scholars rather than a direct message for sinners\. At the same time, Jesus is lost in a fog of historical uncertainty and unreliability – anything goes\. Rather, sin and forgiveness are not only personal and existential but also communal \(between man and man or man and God\)\. __Summary and Conclusion\.__ Bultmann's theology necessitates a dramatic reinterpretation of the Bible, substituting traditional doctrines with existential philosophy\. He focuses on personal existence but diminishes human accountability to God, emphasizing an existential rather than Christ\-centered salvation\. Bultmann’s approach fundamentally downplays the biblical teachings on sin and redemption, reflecting a shift away from historical orthodoxy\.

__11\. The Doctrine of Sin in the Theology of Emil Brunner__

__Revelation and Scripture\.__ Brunner emphasizes revelation as crucial for knowledge and salvation, occurring through personal encounters with Christ, who redeems by being the Redeemer and reveals by being the Revealer\. Brunner argues for demythologizing Scripture, asserting that theology must recognize the primacy of scientific understanding\. He believes sin has little impact on fields like mathematics and logic, distant from religious concerns\. Yet, truth is only realized subjectively in existential encounters with God\. __*Starting Point: The Imago Dei*\.__ The Image of God \(Imago Dei\) is central to Brunner’s understanding of sin\. For him, the image is relational and linked to human responsibility\. He claims that the ability to sin manifests the Imago Dei, as only those created in God's image can truly sin—a point debated by Barth\. __Doctrine of Sin in *Dogmatics*\.__ Brunner views sin as highlighting humanity's need for redemption, enforcing two key principles: understanding sin through revelation and focusing on the New Testament as authoritative\. He minimizes the influence of Genesis chapters like Genesis 3, labeling the Fall a non\-event in the Biblical understanding of sin, seeing Romans 5 in an existential context rather than descriptive of sin's nature\. __*Man in Revolt:*__* *__*Christian Anthropology*\.__ In "Man in Revolt," Brunner emphasizes that sin arises because of the Imago Dei, defining sin as acting contrary to divine destiny\. He maintains that sin is an action, not a state, yet acknowledges human interconnectedness in mutual responsibility\. He controversially rejects the imputation of guilt and inherited corruption associated with original sin, dismissing determinism\. __Descent into Irrationality\.__ Brunner characterizes sin as irrational, shaping an understanding of humanity as both sinful and irrational\. This poses questions on how scientific inquiry justifies demythologizing when truth is existential and irrational by nature\. __Summary\.__ Brunner’s theology is thoroughly existential, framing truth as realized through personal encounters and defining sin as inauthentic existence\. Despite emphasizing the Imago Dei and universal sinfulness, he abandons traditional Protestant orthodoxy, rejecting scriptural authority in discussing sin\. His perspective diminishes the law's role to highlight God's freedom, suggesting they are mutually exclusive and leading to an inconsistency in valuing both divine grace and divine commands\.
