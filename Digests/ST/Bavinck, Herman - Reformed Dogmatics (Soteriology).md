__1\. Calling and Regeneration__

__Call of God\.__ The Triune God produces all things in creation and new creation by his Word and Spirit\. All things thus speak to us of God\. God’s call as law comes to all people in nature, in history, and in a variety of experiences\. While insufficient unto salvation, this call upholds human existence in society and culture, despite the ubiquity of sin\. Though the restricted call unto salvation comes through the word of the gospel, it may not be separated from nature and history\. The Logos who became incarnate is the same as he by whom all things were made\. Grace does not abolish nature but restores it\. Still, the special call of the gospel does not proceed from law and invite us to obedience, but it flows forth from grace and invites us to faith\. __External/Universal Call\.__ The call to faith must be universally preached; this is Christ’s command\. The outcome must be left in God’s hands; we are simply to obey\. The gospel is to be preached to human beings, not as elect or reprobate, but as sinners, all of whom need redemption\. Of course, not to each individual person can it be said, “Christ died in your place\.” But neither do those who preach a hypothetical universalism do that since they only believe in the possibility of universal salvation, conditional upon human acceptance\. And this no one knows for sure\. God’s offer is sincere in that he only tells us what we must do—believe\. Since it is clear from history that the outcome of God’s call does not universally lead to faith, we cannot avoid the intellectual problem\. It is not solved through weakening the call by expanding it for the purpose of greater inclusiveness\. Acknowledging in humility the mystery of God’s will, we recognize that God’s own glory is its final purpose and believe that his Word never returns to him empty\. __Particular Call of Grace\.__ The call of law also prepares the way for the gospel, not in the Arminian sense of an evolution from preparatory grace to saving grace through human willing, but as the created natural foundation for salvation\. God does link his work of grace to our natural lives; creation, redemption, and sanctification are the work of the Triune God in the divine economy of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\. God is sovereign and his grace is rich and varied\. Following Augustine, Reformed theology distinguishes an external or revealed call from the savingly efficacious internal call of the Holy Spirit\. This distinction honors the universality of sin, the need to have the word of proclamation take root in a sinner’s heart by a special work of God, and ascribes all of our salvation to God’s mercy and activity\. This change is so dramatic that it is properly called “rebirth” or “regeneration\.” __Rebirth in Ancient\. __Religion/OT/NT\. The notion of rebirth is found in other religions of the Ancient East, notably in mystery religions such as Mithraism\. Attempts to explain the Christian understanding of regeneration by means of the dying and rising gods of the mystery religions are not very persuasive\. Even considering the paucity of our knowledge about the mystery religions, their ideas and practices come from a different religious environment and worldview\. The New Testament here rather builds on the Old Testament, where the whole people of Israel as well as individual persons are told that they need new hearts, a new birth only God can accomplish \(Ps\. 51:1–3\)\. From the baptism of John through the preaching of Jesus and into the apostolic proclamation, the one consistent message is the need for μετανοια, for a radical turnabout, if one wishes to enter the kingdom of heaven\. One must be “born from above” \(John 3:6–8\)\. By faith, Christ or his Spirit is the author and origin of a new life in those who are called \(Gal\. 3:2; 4:6\) so that they are now a “new creation” \(2 Cor\. 5:17\)\. While there is a difference between the Old Testament and New Testament in language and manner of presentation, the basic truth is the same\. Whether rebirth is called “circumcision of the heart,” the giving of a new heart and a new spirit, a drawing from the Father, or a birth from God, it is always in the strict sense a work of God by which a person is inwardly changed and renewed\. This change is signified and sealed in baptism\. __Regeneration and Baptism in Pre\-Reformation Church\.__ In the missionary context of the early church, the rebirth signified by baptism was a momentous and life\-changing event for the believer\. Moving beyond this context, as the church began baptizing infants and children, the connection between baptism and regeneration had to be modified\. In Western Catholicism, regeneration was increasingly understood in terms of the infusion of sacramental grace at the time of baptism\. In the Eastern church, a similar result was achieved but thought of in terms of implanting a new seed of immortality\. A new quality was infused into the soul, and baptism itself became essential for salvation\. Remaining in the state of grace depends on the mediation of the church and its sacraments\. __In Reformed Churches\.__ It is this sacramental system that the Reformation protested, restoring a direct relationship between God and the soul through the Holy Spirit\. The Word of Scripture took priority over church and sacrament\. This brought its own difficulties as the Anabaptists rejected church and sacraments as means of grace and made personal faith and confession the condition for baptism\. In response, Lutherans again made regeneration dependent on baptism and, by implication, on the church, thus creating a dualism between primary regeneration, which precedes faith, and subsequent secondary renewal, which arises from faith\. Reformed theologians wrestled mightily with this issue but found no solution satisfactory to everyone when it came to grounds for baptizing the children of believers\. The attempt to ground it in a notion of prebaptismal regeneration satisfied some but ran aground on the reality that some who are baptized do not come to full faith as adults\. Maintaining the continuity of the spiritual life proved difficult, and due to the Enlightenment, the notion of rebirth fell into disfavor and was replaced by humanistic notions of moral development, improvement, and nurture\.  __In Modernism\.__ It was Schleiermacher who restored the idea of regeneration to theology, making it the center of his understanding of the Christian faith\. For him, regeneration is the new consciousness of God’s grace and human dependence on God gained by sharing in the consciousness of Christ\. In the Mediating Theology, sin played a more significant role, but at bottom the new life in Christ was a participation in a new personality; there was no objective atonement for sin or Justification, only a subjective appropriation of new consciousness\. Faith’s content is here reduced to mystical experience\. __Difficulties: Human Will and God's Sovereignty\.__ This locus of theology, namely, soteriology, is as beset with difficulties as are the doctrines of the Trinity and of the two natures of Christ\. While it is understandable that missionary proclamation begins with repentance and faith and only after that speaks of regeneration, upon reflection on Scripture and experience we come to realize that, properly speaking, regeneration must precede faith\. If salvation rests in God’s will and not in the human will, that order is inviolable\. Augustine must be chosen over Pelagius\. However, there are ethical/ practical considerations too\. Could overemphasis on regeneration lead some to feel uncertain about their regeneration and thus be paralyzed in their response to the gospel call—waiting for God to regenerate them? Similarly, what about children of believers? Does the church baptize children of believers on the ground of presumed regeneration? Or, as in Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism, does baptism somehow impart a seed of regeneration? The Reformed tradition distinguishes regeneration and faith, baptizes infants on the basis of covenant promises, but also acknowledges that the Holy Spirit could work sovereignly in the hearts of children apart from the preaching of the Word\. __Rebirth/Regeneration vs Reincarnation\.__ Because notions of rebirth are found outside of Scripture in the world’s religions, it is important to be clear about the distinguishing features of the biblical view\. Unlike Buddhism or Hinduism, rebirth does not mean reincarnation\. While rebirth does apply to the Christian understanding of conversion, it is not sufficient to compare the biblical view with initiation into Greek mystery religions or even with Jewish proselytism\. It is more than a change of consciousness, an enlightenment of the mind, or even a reformation of conduct, though it includes all of these\. Nor should we be satisfied with the gnostic notion of redemption as the deliverance of the inner self from the “flesh” or matter\. Neither rationalism nor mysticism provides us with a correct view of regeneration\. __Definition\.__ It is helpful to recognize a broader and more narrow use of the term “regeneration\.” In the broadest and fullest sense, regeneration refers to the total transformation of a person; in the restricted sense, it has in view the implantation of new life that then leads to conversion and further sanctification\. The active word of God here—calling—must also be differentiated from the passive reception or fruit of God’s initiating work\. God’s call has both an external and internal component\. The external proclaimed Word addresses human consciousness persuasively; human response requires an inner work of the Holy Spirit\. In Reformed thought, God’s inner call logically precedes the outward call, though Word and Spirit must never be separated\. The Reformed tradition also acknowledges the reality of the faith community’s involvement in the external call upon its own children as a gracious work of God the Holy Spirit\. __Immediate and Irresistible\. __This operation of the Holy Spirit is both immediate and irresistible\. The point made by Reformed theology here against the Pelagians, Arminians, and theologians of Saumur is that God’s operation on the human person is independent of the will as well as the intellect\. There is no room here to speak of cooperation or of God merely enlightening the mind, which then informs and changes the will\. Though the term “irresistible” was used by opponents of the Reformed faith and does not sufficiently capture the Reformed view, its meaning is clear: When God freely chooses to renew a person’s will, no one can withstand God\. God’s inner call is efficacious\. __Remonstrant Objection\.__ While the Augustinian and Reformed view can and does make room for human beings as created, rational, moral agents, the Pelagian and Remonstrant view cannot account for Scripture’s teaching about the radical need for grace\. If grace is resistible, God is deprived of his sovereignty; if the human will is capable on its own of assenting to God, then regeneration is unnecessary; and if, as the Pelagian and Remonstrant position teaches, some prevenient grace is necessary to prompt human willing, then the notion of an indifferent will remains a fiction\. The only gain here is an apparent but not real one, as becomes apparent with the case of children who die in infancy\. Either they are saved by sovereign grace alone without any choosing on their part, or such grace is insufficient and all infants who die before choosing are lost\. The Pelagian and Arminian position is not at all merciful\. __Purpose: Becoming Spiritual \- Re\-formation Not Re\-Creation\.__ The purpose of regeneration is to make us spiritual people, those who live and walk by the Spirit\. This life is a life of intimate communion with God in Christ\. Though believers are made new creatures in Christ, this does not mean that their created nature is qualitatively transformed\. Believers remain fully human, fully created image\-bearers of God as in the beginning\. As in creation itself, no new substance enters into the world with redemption; the creature is liberated from sin’s futility and bondage\. Sin is not of the essence of creation but its deformity; Christ is not a second Creator but creation’s Redeemer\. Salvation is the restoration of creation and the reformation of life\. Redemption is not coercive; it delivers people from the compulsion and power of sin\. The new life comes from God and is born in his love\. 

__2\. Faith and Conversion\.__

__Knowledge of Faith\.__ The new life in Christ, just like all natural life, must be nourished and strengthened\. This is possible only in communion with Christ in the Holy Spirit and through the word of Scripture\. Enlightened by the Spirit, believers gain a new knowledge of faith\. The gospel is the food of faith and must be known to be nourishment\. Salvation that is not known and enjoyed is no salvation\. God saves by causing himself to be known and enjoyed in Christ\. __Faith, Assurance, Rome, and Reformation\.__ Biblically speaking, faith is trust\-filled surrender to God and his word of promise\. In the New Testament, this trust involves acceptance of the apostolic witness concerning Christ and personal trust in Christ as Savior and risen, exalted Lord\. In church history, however, as in the case of Rome, faith was often reduced to intellectual assent\. Personal assurance was decidedly secondary and often lost altogether\. For Calvin, faith was personal confidence in God’s benevolence toward us “revealed to our minds and sealed on our hearts” by the Holy Spirit\. The Reformation, however, did make it clear that knowledge was not to be set aside\. Knowledge and trust, intellect and will, were both included in the understanding of faith\. In spite of this, Reformation Christians also struggled with the problem of assurance\. The churches were often torn between those who emphasized the mind and those who sought assurance in the mysticism of the heart or in the good works of practical Christianity\. __Faith and Regeneration: Which is Prior?__ We can make headway here only when we acknowledge that reconciliation as well as expiation, or atonement, is objective\. Reconciliation, forgiveness, and holiness have been completely secured by Christ and are fully ours in communion with him\. To underscore the surety of the divine initiative, Reformed theology came to consider the strict sense of regeneration, as the implanting of new life, to be the logically first step in the order of salvation\. Reformed churches do not baptize children of believers on the basis of a presumed regeneration but do hold a judgment of charity with respect to them, not considering them as pagans the way Anabaptists and Methodists, for example, do\. __Faith as Knowledge and Trust\.__ Since there is no active faith apart from the Word of God, there must be a connection between knowledge \(assent\) and faith\. Though the relationship between knowledge and faith is complex and varies from person to person, logically speaking historical knowledge precedes faith though it can never on its own produce faith\. Saving faith is a sure knowledge that produces assurance and certainty\. Knowledge and trust go together; faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things unseen \(Heb\. 11:1\)\. __Renewal of the Will \(Conversion\)\.__ The new life implanted in regeneration yields, in relation to the intellect, faith and knowledge and wisdom; in relation to the will, conversion and repentance\. This includes but may not be reduced to psychological categories such as a “personality change\.” It is rather deeply rooted in the heart and includes turning away from sin and positively toward God and his law\. Not superficial regret but godly sorrow that leads to salvation is called for\. Worldly sorrow, based on short\-term regret, only leads to death\. __Ongoing Conversion and Perfectionism?__ In some cases, we do need to speak of the conversion of believers when they fall into gross sin and for a period of time\. This fact has caused much consternation in the church\. At times perfectionist movements, such as those of Montanus and Novatian, attempted to impose a hard line of rigorous moralism on church members by refusing those who lapse into sin their return to the church\. Over time excessive rigor was replaced by a more humane system of penance, an approach that led to the corrupt practice of indulgence\. This practice, along with the elaborate casuistry brought about by the distinction between contrition and attrition \(imperfect contrition\) in the Roman Catholic sacramental system, tended in popular piety to create the impression of being saved by doing good deeds of penance\. __Reformed: Mortification and Vivification\.__ By contrast, the Reformation rejected the complicated Roman sacramental system and understood conversion to be a twofold action of dying to self and rising to Christ in a life of obedience\. All of this was a gift of grace, the application of Christ’s finished work to the believer\. Renewed by the regenerating grace of God, the believer is called to make turning from sin, dying to self, and striving to greater holiness a daily as well as a once\-for\-all matter\. True conversion is a religious\-ethical matter that involves the whole person in a turn from sin and to God\. __Varieties of Conversion\.__ Conversion as a lifelong turning to God takes form in different people in a variety of ways\. It is a mistake to prescribe only one normative pattern\. Some may experience a serious religious crisis; others find themselves more gradually and quietly growing in grace and knowledge\. Some from earliest moments of self\-consciousness know that they are a child of God; others go through deathbed conversions\. It is a mistake to force people into a single mode or to hurry the work of the Spirit in a person’s life\. The Bible only requires that sorrow for sin be genuine and that a person wholeheartedly seek God’s favor\. One does not need to know the exact hour of one’s conversion; one must seek genuine amendment of life\. __Confession, Absolution, and Keys\.__ Absolution is a free gift of grace based on the meritorious work of Christ\. It is not the prerogative of the church or of a priest through confession; only God can forgive sins\. Similarly, though Christians do sin after their baptism and in this world experience tribulation, the suffering of believers must never be reckoned as punishment\. Christ has accomplished it all; the church can only announce this good news\. Its “power of the keys” consists in its administering the Word of God\.

__3\. Justification\.__

__Forgiveness is not Natural \(Causal Necessity Is\)\.__ Of all God’s benefits given in the covenant of grace, first place belongs to Justification, to forgiveness of sins\. All joy and peace, all certainty of communion with God, rests on this forgiveness, a benefit no mind can fully comprehend or believe\. Forgiveness is not easy and often conflicts with our sense of justice\. Here Christianity distinguishes itself by tying justice and love together at the cross\. In traditional Eastern religions as well as in Western thought, the ironclad law of causal necessity reigns\. Nature knows no forgiveness\. __Forgiveness in Scripture\.__ Scripture, using many varied metaphors, depicts God as gracious\. Forgiveness is God’s gift; it cannot be earned\. The Old Testament, notably in the Psalms, portrays God’s nature as merciful; the New Testament proclaims the One who came to seek and save the lost, to lift the burdens of the heavyhearted\. Proclaimed throughout the New Testament in various ways, forgiveness is underscored in its forensic dimension as Justification especially by the apostle Paul\. Reflecting on his life experience as a Pharisee under the law, Paul accents the righteousness of Christ imputed to believers by faith alone\. This Justification produces liberty, frees believers for service, and assures them of eternal life\. __The Problem of Nomism\.__ Already in Paul’s own day, this doctrine was misunderstood as antinomianism\. In response, the church moved toward seeing the Christian life in terms of obeying God’s commandments\. Penance and good works became the preferred way of dealing with sins committed after baptism\. Grace was seen as a divine infusion into the believer via the sacraments\. Habitual grace then remains the ground of a believer’s Justification but, logically, God forgives people because he has made them holy\. Rome fails clearly to distinguish between Justification and sanctification\. __Reformation Renewal: Extrinsic, Forensic Justification\.__ Luther’s great discovery about the “righteousness of God” was that it did not apply to God’s righteousness in himself but rather to the righteousness applied to believers through faith in Christ\. God’s righteousness does not condemn us but justifies us\. We are clothed in Christ’s righteousness\. We are not justified by good works, but for good works, by grace\. Faith thus believes that we are sinners and that for Christ’s sake we are justified\. God’s declaration of righteousness is not a mere sentence God pronounces to himself but brings with it the act of making us righteous in Christ\. Believers are to take God at his word, recognizing nonetheless that their healing is a lifelong process\. The Christian life is a life of faith; trusting in God’s promises, we may neither despair nor be falsely secure\. __Faith and Justification\.__ From the start, the Reformation was both a religious and an ethical movement\. Though time and polemics brought about changes in emphases as well as greater clarity, Luther’s mature thought is true to what was germinally present in his early Lectures on Romans\. Thanks especially to the polemics with Rome, Lutherans increasingly ascribed to Justification an exclusively juridical meaning\. In Lutheran circles there was a shift away from predestination, with the result that human achievement and good works began to have a role in faith\. As a result, for Pietism and rationalism alike, Justification increasingly became a subjective matter, an experience of forgiveness and renewal\. __Objective and Subjective; Active and Passive\.__ In the Reformed tradition, however, though neither the objectivity of Christ’s satisfaction nor the benefit to believers was ever minimized, the emphasis was placed on righteousness as God’s gift rather than as a benefit we accept by faith\. The comfort of believers was important but even more so the glory of God\. Calvin kept sanctification in the fore as much as Justification; whom Christ justifies he also sanctifies, unto the glory of God\. And that is also the believer’s glory: Though Calvin kept Justification closely connected to election and satisfaction on the one hand, and sanctification and glorification on the other, those who followed him did not\. Rationalism, whether in Socinian, Remonstrant, Cartesian, or Amyraldian form, emphasized the human subject’s faith and obedience, creating a new form of nomism or legalism\. Pietism and Methodism, for all their differences with the preceding, also represented a turn toward human subjectivity and the experience of faith\. In response, some Reformed theologians emphasized the objectivity of Justification and placed it in the divine decree of love\. This risked encouraging antinomianism by downplaying the importance of human response\. Reformed theologians tried to avoid extremes and began to carefully distinguish active and passive Justification\. This distinction was intended as a logical distinction only, not a temporal one\. To this day, the two different emphases—the objectivity of divine promise and the subjectivity of faith’s response—both remain in the Reformed churches\. __Justification Is Forensic, Not Ethical / Faith Is Necessary but No Ground\.__ Justification is the doctrine on which the church stands or falls\. Either we must do something to be saved, or our salvation is purely a gift of grace\. God does not set aside the law that properly judges us; only because Christ bore the wrath of God are we reckoned righteous in him\. Ethical consequences flow forth from Justification, but they must not be imported into the very definition itself\. To reverse the order would be to make Justification dependent on sanctification—a hopeless measure since even our best works are imperfect and fail to measure up to God’s standard\. Though righteousness is through or from faith, faith is never the ground for our righteousness\. Faith in itself does not save us; we are saved by faith in Christ\. The faith that justifies is precisely the faith that has Christ as its object and content\. This affords great comfort to believers\. If our weak faith is the ground for our Justification, we will live in fear and anxiety\. Instead of turning inward, we must turn toward Christ and his finished work, the sure ground of our hope\. __Objections to Imputation\.__ Against the objections raised against imputed righteousness \(such as by Roman Catholic theology\), it must be noted that the objection is really against the apostle Paul, who says in Rom\. 4:5 and 5:16 that God justifies the ungodly\. The best human analogy is adoption\. Imputation is not a fiction; it is a real change of status with real benefits\. The righteousness legally imputed to us must still become ethically effective in sanctification\. Our being made righteous rests in God’s decree and in the pactum salutis\. The covenant of grace precedes both our birth and our coming to believe\. Our righteousness is “alien” in only a certain sense; it is the righteousness of the “head,” which is therefore also that of the members\. __Justification in Time or Eternity?__ If our Justification is grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ, when exactly does this occur? In eternity or in time? The former view has been held by antinomians as well as antineonomians\. For the former, eternal Justification was the sum and substance of Christian truth—our faith only involves acknowledging what God has done in eternity\. There is no Justification in time\. The latter, urgently seeking to keep the pure gospel of grace from being mixed with law, saw eternal Justification as the beginning and foundation of Justification in time\. Though it is important to insist that God’s decree of election is eternal, speaking of Justification as taking place in eternity is not advisable\. This usage is not scriptural and does not eliminate the problem of needing to explain its execution and outward realization in time\. Reformed theology wisely distinguishes between the eternal decree and its execution in time\. __Active and Passive Justification\.__ We are on firm scriptural ground, however, when we tie Justification to the death and resurrection of Christ\. Our Justification has been obtained by Christ; it is objectively accomplished\. To clarify matters, Reformed theologians distinguished an active Justification from a passive Justification; Justification is acquired and applied\. Again, this is not a temporal distinction but a logical one; concretely, the two coincide and always go together\. The distinction seeks to preserve the dual conviction that faith is both necessary for Justification and that such a faith is itself the fruit of God’s regenerating work through the Holy Spirit\. This distinction helps us to avoid nomism, to strengthen believers’ assurance by turning them away from introspective self\-examination and toward Christ himself, and to recognize that faith is simultaneously a receptive organ and an active power\. Faith is the very act of accepting Christ and all his benefits\. This faith is active along with works and is brought to completion by works\. Paul and James are not at odds\. __The Elements of Justification\.__ Reformed theologians have not always agreed on the various elements of Justification and how they are related to each other\. It is best to define Justification as the imputation of Christ’s obedience as a whole to the believer and to consider its two parts to consist in forgiveness of sins and the right to eternal life\. Forgiveness includes past, present, and future sins\. The fear of antinomianism must not hinder us from making this claim but does call us to be vigilant in continuing to pray for forgiveness daily\. This is necessary for believers to remain assured; confession and prayer are the means by which God the Holy Spirit arouses and reinforces our consciousness of forgiveness\. Although understanding of Justification is sometimes limited to forgiveness, what must not be overlooked is our adoption as children and the right to eternal life\. This adoption is both juridical \(Paul\) and ethical \(John\)\. We are God’s children; our legal status is provided in Christ and guaranteed by the Holy Spirit as a pledge until the day of full redemption\. This doctrine should provide the greatest comfort and assurance to believers, and it equips them for great works\.

__4\. Sanctification and Perseverance\.__

__Holiness as Gift and Reward\.__ From the beginning God’s plan of redemption included sanctification and glorification\. Israel was called to be a holy people; purity of heart and act was the goal, beyond mere proper cultic conformity\. Having been forgiven, the disciple of Jesus is called to follow him, deny self, and take up a cross\. Jesus uses the idea of reward as an incentive to spur us on to faithfulness; nonetheless, all rewards are a free gift of grace\. God’s children in Christ, for his sake, are holy; therefore they are commanded to become holy\. We are God’s workmanship\. __Rigorism and a Double Morality\.__ The postapostolic church continued to insist on holiness of life but had to contend with the reality of post\-baptismal sin, even grave sin\. Distinctions began to be made among sins, with less serious ones addressed by legalistic works of penance as the way to forgiveness\. A twofold morality—one for ordinary believers and the other for “saints”—contributed to the growth of the eremetic and monastic life\. Regular precepts were supplemented by “counsels of perfection,” namely, the three virtues of chastity, poverty, and obedience\. The latter were deemed especially meritorious, and the church followed a semi\-Pelagian line\. The good works of the saints add to the “treasury of merit” that the church, through indulgences, can dispense to the faithful\. __Justification and Its Discontents\.__ The Reformation repudiated this entire scheme and took its position on the doctrine of Justification by faith alone\. Better said, it is through faith that the believer receives Christ the Savior, who justifies the sinner\. Though the theologians of the Reformation, especially the Reformed, understood this faith as a living faith rooted in the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, Reformation sectarians and mystics wanted more\. Among Pietists and Methodists, Justification had to be followed by sanctification unto perfection, a constant communion with God in love and obedience\. Though this emphasis can lead to eccentricities and to ascetic legalism, it has also, to its credit, produced great works of mission and philanthropy\. __Sanctification Is also in Christ\.__ Christ is our holiness in the same sense in which he is our righteousness\. Logically, Justification, which clears our guilt, precedes sanctification, which cleanses us from our pollution\. Furthermore, Justification is a juridical act, completed in an instant, while sanctification is an ethical process that continues throughout our lives\. Though Justification and sanctification are distinct, they must never be separated\. They are united in the power and work of the Holy Spirit\. Sanctification as well as Justification is a gift, purely of grace\. __Passive and Active Sanctification\.__ God’s people are holy and called to be holy, set apart by God to be conformed to his Son and to live to his glory\. The gift is also a call to active continued repentance on the part of the Christian\. We are to die to sin and “present our members as instruments of righteousness\.” We are grafted into Christ the vine and also told that we must bear fruit\. This duality has been misunderstood by nomists and antinomians alike\. The former insist that good works are necessary conditions for salvation; the latter are indifferent to repentance, prayer for forgiveness, and good works, since Christ’s perfect sacrifice made them superfluous\. Lutherans had special difficulty with this tension and engaged in bitter debates over it\. Reformed theologians had less difficulty, speaking of good works as necessary not in the sense of merit but in the sense of presence\. The presence of good works is a sign of God’s work of grace in a believer\. __Good works__ in the strict sense are those done out of true faith, in conformity with God’s law, and to his glory\. The virtues of the pagans are not good works\. It is out of faith working through love that believers seek to do God’s will as expressed in the Ten Commandments\. Both nomists and antinomians forget that the law of God is rich and full and cannot be reduced to “precept upon precept, line upon line\.” The commandments must be understood in their augmentation and application by the prophets and by our Lord\. In addition, sanctification is both gift and task\. The renewing power of the Holy Spirit puts us to work, and in our life of obedience there is also freedom for individual believers to apply the deeper life of love to their own circumstances and contexts\. Both the adiaphora and the counsels of perfection must be seen within the unity and universality of the moral law\. A legalistic double morality often leads to perfectionism and works righteousness\. __Perfectionism is a heresy\.__ It is important to maintain the Reformational understanding of Rom\. 7 that sees the tension of sin and grace continuing in the life of the regenerate\. We face a clear choice: If our works are imperfect and incomplete, all meritoriousness of our works disappears\. This is the Reformation’s answer to Rome\. On the other hand, all notions of possible perfection in this life require a weakening of the law’s demands and adaptation to existing practice\. In both cases the organic unity of God’s moral law is lost and therefore also the unity of the work of Christ\. The Methodist separation of sanctification from Justification as an isolated benefit obtained by a special act of faith \(the “double cure”\) misconstrues the life of faith\. Faith in Christ is a unitary act that actively appropriates the whole Christ and his benefits\. In Christ, we are forgiven and holy; we grow more and more into Christ our head until we reach the fullness of our life in him and see him face to face\. That is our reward, itself a gift of grace\. __Preservation of the saints__ is also both gift and task\. The New Testament repeatedly admonishes believers to remain faithful, to stay true to their Savior and Lord\. At the same time Scripture clearly teaches that the covenant of grace does not depend on human obedience but on God’s faithfulness\. God has bound himself to the covenant with a solemn oath; he cannot and will not abandon his people\. Faith will never disappoint us\.
