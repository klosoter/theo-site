__Introduction\.__

In "The Trinity: On the Nature and Mystery of the One God," Thomas Joseph White explores the intricate dynamics between three kinds of knowledge in Aquinas’s thought: theology, philosophy, and the mystical life of union with God\. *Theologically*, this involves the revealed knowledge of God; *philosophically*, it concerns the inferential natural knowledge of the first cause; *mystically*, it touches on affective experiences through the Holy Spirit\. White proposes that theological reflection centers on an object of knowledge that is revealed, supernatural, and inaccessible to unaided natural reason\. He suggests that these three types of knowledge mutually influence one another, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the divine\. Although theological in its primary focus, White's book incorporates philosophical arguments and aims at a mystical union with God\. The first part of the book addresses the scriptural and patristic principles of Trinitarian doctrine, aligning with Aquinas' principles of faith as outlined in the Nicene Creed\. White predominantly agrees with Aquinas's reflections on God and the Trinity, while discussing these within the context of modern systematic theology as part of the *ressourcement movement*\. In parts two and three, he delves into Aquinas’ concepts of "*de Deo ut uno*" \(God as one\) and "*de Deo ut trino*" \(God as three\)\.

__Part 1\. Principles and Disputations: On the Development of Trinitarian Doctrine\.__

The first part of White's book emphasizes the scriptural and traditional foundations of Trinitarian doctrine, exploring common Trinitarian teachings derived from Scripture and their interpretation by the early Church\. Key themes include the unity of being and essence and the distinction among the three persons of the Trinity\. In this context, essential terms refer to the shared essence and attributes common to all three persons of the Trinity, while personal terms are used to designate each person's unique activities and distinctions\.

__Chapter__ __1\. The Mystery of God: Religious and Philosophical Origins\.__

__Pre\-Philosophical Dispositions for the Mystery of God\. __White discusses the pre\-philosophical dispositions that underscore the mystery of God, noting that they are deeply linked to the essence of humanity\. These include 1\) the experience of order in the world, 2\) the awareness of time and finitude \(or fundamental mutability\), 3\) the striving for happiness, and 4\) contemplation of a first cause\. __Human Religiosity is a Sign of the Mystery of God\. __In considering human religiosity, White highlights the desire for the good and the challenges posed by questions of providence and theodicy\. The unresolved nature of these questions points toward a deeper mystery beyond human comprehension\. __The Mystery of God is also a Problem in the Religious Traditions\. __White identifies a problem within various religious traditions: the diversity of gods and claims, leading to questions about the true meaning of "god" and the need for revelation or mystical experience\. Notions of goodness, providence, and evil are not inherently self\-evident, highlighting the need for revelation or mystical experience\. __Revelation, Philosophy, and the Mystery of God\. __White concludes that the interplay between revelation, philosophy, and the mystery of God is inherently complex\. While human religiosity compels inquiry into the divine, it is also fundamentally flawed\. The Catholic perspective offers a solution through the integration of grace with nature leading to revelation, which is not passive but actively invites continued exploration of God, employing human reason as a vital tool in this search\.

__Chapter 2\. The Problem of God in Modernity\.__

__The Modern Crisis of Belief in the Mystery of God\. __In the modern era, many perceive religion as unreasonable, leading to a crisis of belief in the mystery of God\. This crisis is rooted in philosophical skepticism and a departure from classical ontology\. Early Christian apologists viewed Christianity as the true philosophy and rightful heir to Greek philosophy\. However, the Latin Averroists, and later Enlightenment thinkers, argued that philosophy did not need religion and was the ultimate form of knowledge\. This perspective was reinforced by nominalism, which denied universals and particulars, acknowledging only the facticity of beings\. It questioned causality and humanity's ability to know God naturally\. These ideas aimed to appeal to revelation and the Church but instead fostered modern philosophical skepticism\. Two developments emerged after nominalist skepticism: Martin Luther emphasized *faith*, while modern science focused on *empirically* observable knowledge, concentrating on causes without considering essence or purpose\. __Modern Secularism\. __This focus contributed to modern secularism, which emphasizes observational science, individual free thought, and a disconnection from the Church, and a break from classical notions of nature, causality, teleology, and transcendentals\. Philosophers such as Descartes and Locke tried to use intellect to know something of God, while Hobbes and Hume leaned toward atheism, and Kant maintained that intellect is bound by agnosticism\. Both Hegel and Schelling sought to reinterpret Christianity\. Following this, an atheistic genealogy developed with Feuerbach viewing God as a projection of human ideals, Marx considering religion as an opiate for the masses, Nietzsche viewing it as an expression of a frustrated will to power, and Freud regarding it as a result of immaturity and misguided security\. __Cultural and Political Secularization\. __Secularization advanced culturally and politically, beginning with Luther, Henry VIII, and the French Revolution, evolving through the 19th\-century social revolutions into non\-confessional constitutional states\. The 20th century saw the rise of radical atheistic ideologies such as fascism and communism\. In the modern global context, with the rise of democratic liberalism and universal rights, religion is often merely tolerated and contained\. __The Church's Response to Modern Agnosticism and Atheism\. __In response to modern challenges, the Church emphasized classical Catholic thought and transcendental dimensions of reality—being, unity, truth, goodness, and beauty—through scholastic traditions\. It opposed colonialism by advocating for universal human rights and countered Enlightenment philosophy by balancing grace with nature\. Documents such as Aeterni Patris, Humani Generis, Gaudium et Spes, and Fides et Ratio addressed challenges posed by secularization\. At the core of Catholic tradition is an openness to the full study of being\. Sin and disordered desire, exacerbated by social structures of sin, can inhibit knowledge of God\. White outlines two conditions for an authentic search for God: a cultural interest \(faith\) in the pursuit of God, as embodied by the Catholic Church, and the philosophical heritage of Catholic Christianity\.

__Chapter 3\. The Revelation of the One God in Israel\.__

__Divine Names, and the Theology of Divine Attributes\. __White explores the question of whether there is a uniform discourse about God and if all names indeed refer to the same deity\. With a *thematic unity of the canonical text*, the Church recognizes a unified witness inspired by the Holy Spirit, regardless of redaction and form questions\. Various names for God, such as Elohim, Adonai, and Yahweh, carry different relational and personal connotations\. Other names encompass attributes of unity, transcendence, omnipresence, eternity, mercy, wisdom, and more, marking God’s distinct identity\. __Biblical Ontology as the Invitation to a Christian Philosophy of God\. __White describes how biblical ontology serves as an invitation to pursue a Christian philosophy of God, both existentially and soteriologically\. God is known through effects that are described metaphorically and analogically, guiding believers to an ontological understanding that distinguishes God from idols and other gods\. The concept of *analogia fidei* involves reflecting on the mysteries of faith, while *analogia entis* involves reflecting on creation through both philosophical reason and biblical revelation\. Evidence for these concepts is found in the Old Testament, particularly in the wisdom literature and texts like Isaiah 45:14\-25, which contains a metaphysical interpretation with universal significance for all nations\. __Trinitarian Adumbrations: God's Word, Wisdom, and Spirit\. __Within the scriptural text, there are implicit indications of Trinitarian processions, with the personification of Wisdom in Proverbs, Sirach, and Wisdom, the active role of the Word in creation, and the Spirit of the Lord\. These elements suggest immaterial processions where the Father reveals Himself through the economy of the Word and Spirit\. God created all things in his Wisdom and gives knowledge through the Spirit, both of whom do only what God can do – they are identical in nature\. 

__Chapter 4\. Foundations for Trinitarian Faith in the Life of Jesus Christ\.__

__Trinitarian Doctrine and Historical Interpretation of the New Testament\. __White explores how the Church tradition and the New Testament witness together shape the understanding of the Trinity\. The mystery of the Trinity is grasped through faith and is passed down and solidified in the teachings and preaching of the Catholic Church\. Jesus' theological identity as the Son of God is underscored in the New Testament, even when interpreted through historical\-critical methods\. This recognition necessitates both faith and sacred tradition\. The Catholic Church employs the historical\-critical method to demonstrate the organic development of doctrine, addressing the challenges of theological pluralism in the New Testament\. This approach reveals the connections between Jesus' life and its interpretation by the succeeding generation\. __Eschatological Ultimacy\. __Jesus' message is fundamentally eschatological, with an apocalyptic tone emphasizing the restoration of Israel through his ministry\. He claims his suffering and death herald eschatological events, with his disciples participating in the judgment of nations leading to a final tribulation\. His ministry showcases signs such as exorcisms, demonstrating power; physical healings, indicating fulfillment; and prophecies that point toward the abolishment of certain ceremonial practices of the Torah\. __Kingdom of God and the Messianism of Jesus\. __Jesus explicitly claimed to be the Christ or Messiah, asserting authority and heralding a new Kingdom—a renewal of the Old Testament kingdom concepts\. __Sonship in an Exclusive Note\. __Eschatology and messianism implicitly suggest Jesus' identity as the Son of God\. The title "Son of God" mostly served a functional, messianic role, yet the term "Son" in relation to the "Father" emphasizes Jesus' filial consciousness, reflecting his sense of divine filiation\. This notion is highlighted in significant events like his baptism, epiphany, and transfiguration\. __Pre\-Existence and Lordship\.__ Phrases like "I have come" and "I came to\.\.\." illustrate Jesus' transcendent personality and point to his Lordship\. Titles and phrases such as "The Lord," "I am," and the baptismal formula invoking the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit underscore this identity\. The nativity narratives in Luke and Matthew further emphasize his transcendent identity and implicitly suggest his pre\-existence, portraying him as the Son of God in Luke and "God with us" in Matthew\. __Resurrection, Divine Epiphany, and Worship\. __Paul's writings affirm that the resurrection indicates Jesus' bodily resurrection and confirms his Sonship, both divine and human\. The Gospels each offer their perspectives: Mark includes a centurion’s acknowledgment of Jesus as the Son of God; Matthew depicts the cosmos as affected by Jesus' death and resurrection; and Luke portrays Jesus saying, "Father, in your hands\.\.\." and being recognized as "Christ" and "Lord" post\-resurrection\. __Spirit of the Father, Spirit of Jesus\. __The Synoptic Gospels highlight the relationship between the Spirit and Jesus\. In Mark, it is said, "Christ will baptize with the Holy Spirit," highlighting the gift coming from the Son, while the declaration "You are my beloved Son" and the descending Spirit scene point to the Father’s involvement\. This thematic element is consistent in Matthew, whereas Luke's emphasis lies particularly on the "Spirit of the Father\." __Conclusion\. __The Synoptic authors assume the Shema of Israel, affirming monotheism while introducing the new revelation that the Father sends the Son and Spirit\. This revelation is marked by Jesus's unity with the Father and Spirit, while also indicating a real personal distinction and mutual relationality, suggesting a mutual indwelling among the divine persons\.

__Chapter 5\. Pauline Trinitarian Theology\.__

__Three Features of Israelite Monotheism\. __Paul's writings reflect significant doctrinal ideas from Second Temple Judaism, characterized fundamentally as monotheistic\. Key features include the belief in one God as the creator of all things, both visible and invisible, including angels, and as sovereign over the universe\. This God is to be worshipped exclusively, and is also perceived as the eschatological savior of humanity\. These attributes are preserved and affirmed in the earliest Christological expressions of faith\. __Philippians 2:5\-11 and "Christological Monotheism\." __In the hymn found in Philippians 2:5\-11, a form of "Christological Monotheism" is presented where Jesus is equated with God, yet remains personally distinct\. This hymn asserts Jesus' pre\-existence and ascribes all the monotheistic attributes of God to Christ, similar to the assertions found in Colossians 1:15\-20 and 1 Timothy 3:16\. The pattern of pre\-existence, incarnation, suffering, subsequent exaltation, and widespread recognition of Christ closely aligns with themes later articulated in the Nicene Creed\. Similar affirmations can be found in Hebrews 1:1\-14\. __Three Persons Who Act in Divine Ways\. __Paul articulates the distinct personal agency of "Father, Son, and Spirit" while attributing to each titles and activities traditionally associated with the God of Israel, grace, and salvation\. *First*, divine names are applied universally to all three persons, as seen in phrases like "God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ" and in the benediction "The Grace of the Lord Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all\." *Second*, the Father holds a position of principality, as the origin and source of the Son and Spirit with relational priority\. *Third*, the Son and Spirit possess the capacity to act with divine power, demonstrated in passages such as 1 Corinthians 12:4\-6, which highlights the Spirit, Lord, and God as working different gifts, services, and activities\. *Fourth*, the Son is involved in the sending of the Spirit, as seen in designations such as "Spirit of his Son" and "Christ's Spirit\." *Fifth*, the phrase "Christ the power of God and the Wisdom of God" underscores Christ's divinity and associability with two prominent divine attributes\. Augustine's doctrine of appropriations further elucidates this understanding\.

__Chapter 6\. Johannine Trinitarian Theology\.__

__The Prologue of John's Gospel\. __In the opening of John's Gospel, two central mysteries are articulated: the mystery of the Logos and the mystery of the only\-begotten Son\. Jesus is introduced as the Eternal Logos with the declaration, "In the beginning was the Word\." This is explored through a psychological analogy, where the Logos is seen as the *mental* concept, the audible spoken word, and the capacity for reason\. This implies that the Son is the immaterial wisdom or reason of God the Father\. Further, creation occurs through the Logos, encapsulated in the profound statement, "The Word was made Flesh\." Jesus is also presented as the Only\-Begotten Son, who is eternally engendered and described as the only\-begotten God or Son in the Father’s bosom, making Him known\. The Son resides eternally in the Father’s bosom, reflecting mutual immanence and indwelling, and reveals the Father’s identity within Himself\. __The Cross and the Name of God: "I Am\." __John’s Gospel presents realized eschatology in the crucifixion, portraying it as the exaltation of the Servant through three key references: the lifting up of the Bronze Serpent \(3:14\-15\), the glorification of the Son of Man \(12:23\), and the exaltation from the earth \(12:32\)\. The cross is intricately tied to the divine name "I Am," with pivotal verses like 8:24, declaring the necessity of belief in "I am" to avoid sin; 8:28, linking the recognition of "I am" to the Son of Man's crucifixion; the affirmation of Jesus' pre\-existence in 8:58, and the unity of Jesus with the Father in 10:30, "I and the Father are one\." __Processions of the Son and the Paraclete\. __The Gospel articulates the procession of the Son from the Father, illustrated in John 8:42, where Jesus states, "I proceeded and came forth from God," and in 16:27\-30, where belief in Jesus’ origin from the Father is affirmed\. The term "ekporeuomai," meaning "to proceed," underscores this dynamic\. The Holy Spirit's procession is explained in terms of coming from both the Father and the Son\. John 14:25\-26 notes the Father sending the Paraclete in Jesus' name, while 15:26 speaks of the Counselor sent by Jesus from the Father, and 16:7 affirms Jesus sending the Counselor\. The term "pempo," meaning "to send," supports this description\. The passage provides a __defense for the "filioque" clause__, advocating that both the Son and the Spirit come forth eternally from the Father, forming a unified procession that maintains the Spirit's double origin without altering relational dynamics\. The Son is eternally one with the Father, meaning that if the Father sends the Spirit, the Son’s involvement is inherent\. The Paraclete's work continues the mission of the Father and the Son, extending Christ’s mission over time\. As the Spirit of Truth, and given that the Son is Truth, the Spirit’s procession from the Son is affirmed, further solidifying the coherence of Johannine Trinitarian theology\.

__Chapter 7\. Nicene Trinitarian Theology\.__

White explores the continuity of trinitarian theology from the New Testament through to Nicaea, and onto Augustine, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, and Thomas Aquinas\. The Nicene framework introduces a threefold distinction: "person" or "hypostasis," which denotes three personal subjects that are distinct from one another yet constitute a singular personal subject; "essence" or "nature," referring to the divine nature shared by the three persons; and "substance," which speaks to the individual being or reality—one God, one essence, one in substance\. Additionally, the Nicene formulation emphasizes the singular nature of God and distinguishes between *processions*, which are eternal, and *missions*, which are temporal\. __Two Tendencies in Pre\-Nicene Theology of God\. __The development of trinitarian understanding in pre\-Nicene times exhibited two tendencies: *monological* thought and the concept of the *economic* Trinity\. Monological theology emphasized the Logos and Spirit as distinct within God’s inner life and affirmed their distinctness\. In contrast, the economic Trinity focused on the relational distinctions between the Son and Spirit and the Father primarily in terms of their roles in salvation history\. Justin Martyr and Irenaeus of Lyons respectively exemplify these tendencies\. Justin Martyr’s monological approach presents the pre\-existent Son as distinct from the Father, positioned against Greco\-Roman polytheism and Jewish objections, marking Christ as eternal reason and the Spirit as revelatory\. Irenaeus, confronting Gnostic ideas, upheld the real distinction of persons within God, where the Father is the source, and the Son and Spirit act as the hands in creation and sanctification\. He recognized the compatibility of pre\-existence with relational dynamics in the economy\. __Third\-Century Background to Arianism\. __The third\-century theological landscape, marked by Monarchic Modalism and Subordinationism, set the stage for Arian controversies\. *Monarchic modalism* viewed divine persons as modes rather than distinct entities, conflating God’s presence in various manifestations with modal attributions\. Pre\-Nicene theologians contended against this by differentiating between persons and substances and affirming unity without negating distinctions, as emphasized by Tertullian\. Origen's *subordinationism* suggested an intrinsic hierarchy among Father, Son, and Spirit, reflecting Greek philosophical influences and proposing that distinction among persons implies differences in substances\. His teachings led to complications, grappling with the assumption that defining persons necessitates defining beings within God\. __Arianism as a Response to Intellectual Challenges\. __Arianism represented a stark departure from earlier teachings by denying the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit, considering them creatures akin to angels, and fundamentally distinct from the Father\. It rejected the shared substance across the trinitarian persons, positing instead a real distinction devoid of essential equality\. __The Council of Nicaea in 325 A\.D\. __The Council of Nicaea affirmed the real distinction of trinitarian persons without sanctioning inequality\. It articulated the eternal procession of the Son from the Father beyond created realms and introduced "homoousios," affirming the Son’s being as equal to the Father’s\. __Athanasius of Alexandria\. __Athanasius was pivotal in refining trinitarian theology, arguing that differentiations among persons do not necessitate differences in essence\. He employed intellectual analogies to convey immaterial generation, thereby safeguarding against notions of distinct substances\. Two significant models emerge in his teachings: the monological Creator engaging through Logos, and the real personal distinctions visible in the economy, rooted in eternal realities\. Athanasius’ work adeptly avoids both modalism and subordinationism\. He contends that the Father eternally begets the Son, employing a psychological analogy where the Son represents divine reason\. This reasoning amplifies divine creation and unity found in the singular *operum ad extra* of the one God\. Internally, distinctions occur naturally through generation, filiation, and procession, without compromising divine unity ad intra\. Through these theologies, Athanasius upheld both the unity and diversity within the Godhead, shaping foundational Christian orthodoxy\.

__Chapter 8\. The Advent of Orthodoxy: Cappadocian Trinitarian Theology\.__

Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus were instrumental in the development of Cappadocian Trinitarian theology, each contributing significantly to the articulation of key doctrinal points in response to contemporary theological challenges such as Neo\-Arianism\. This nuanced theology is particularly evident in its *apophatic* approach, which emphasizes knowing God through His effects\. The apophatic tradition positions God’s nature as incomprehensible and immaterial, asserting the simplicity and ineffability of the divine essence, opposing the Neo\-Arian attempt to equate the terms "unbegotten" with "uncaused" and "begotten" with "created\." __Apophaticism\. __The Cappadocian Fathers, through apophaticism, argue against Neo\-Arianism by emphasizing God's incomprehensibility and simplicity\. Gregory of Nyssa underscores that while human reason can affirm God's existence, the divine essence remains ineffable and non\-composite\. Yet, *kataphatic* discourse allows for positive elements, acknowledging aspects of God as revealed through divine acts and Scriptures, albeit always imperfect and analogical\. __Kataphatic and Apophatic Interplay in Nazianzus\. __For Gregory of Nazianzus, true knowledge of God comes through divine revelation, particularly evident in the incarnation, which allows insight into divine begetting\. However, all discourse about God remains fundamentally analogical and imperfect, indicating the complex interplay between apophatic and kataphatic theology\. __Eternal Processions, Distinctions of Persons, and Relations of Origin\. __The Cappadocian Fathers insist on the consubstantiality of the Trinity while adopting Origen's terminology of "hypostasis\." They clarify the relationship between "homoousios" \(consubstantial\) and "hypostasis" \(person\), identifying three distinct persons who exist in one being and substance\. These persons are defined by their relational origin: the Father as unbegotten, the Son as begotten, and the Spirit as proceeding\. __Common Terms and Proper Terms\. __Gregory of Nyssa employs human analogy to illustrate one nature in many persons, recognizing that this analogy falls short since, unlike human persons, the divine persons are one God\. The Father, Son, and Spirit share one essence yet are distinguished by personal properties: unbegottenness, begottenness, and procession, respectively\. Despite these distinctions, all that God is is fully present in each person substantially and essentially\. __Arguments for the Divinity of the Holy Spirit\. __The Cappadocians present several arguments affirming the Holy Spirit's divinity\. They argue that the Holy Spirit's role in the divinization of humans is a function only a divine being can fulfill\. Moreover, the Spirit's eternal procession from the Father implies that it is proper to the Godhead, thus affirming His divinity\. Lastly, the practice of Christian worship and the Trinitarian formula in baptism underscore the Spirit's divine status\. __Procession of the Spirit from the Father in Relation to the Son? __The Cappadocian view holds that the Father causes both the Son and, through the Son, the Spirit, creating relational dynamics without formally adopting a "filioque" approach as seen later in Augustine's work\. __The Unity of God's Action *Ad Extra\. *__In relation to creation, every action is executed by the Trinity with one will and power, inherent to the one God\. Nonetheless, these actions are manifested by each person in a manner consistent with their relational identities, ensuring unity in diversity within divine operations\.

__Chapter 9\. Augustine’s Trinitarian Theology\.__

Augustine’s work, "De Trinitate," had a profound impact on Thomas Aquinas’s "Summa Theologiae" and served as a significant defense against Arian and Modalist views, upholding Nicene orthodoxy in innovative ways\. Augustine's theological insights explore the depths of Trinitarian doctrine, distinguishing between temporal missions and eternal processions\. __From Temporal Missions to Eternal Processions\. __In the first four books of "De Trinitate," Augustine differentiates between temporal missions and eternal processions\. This distinction is crucial in countering views that subordinate elements of the economic Trinity or deny the consubstantiality or eternity of the Spirit or the Son\. In Book 1, Augustine argues that Scripture does not support subordinationist interpretations; rather, references either pertain to the incarnation or describe the Son's "fromness" from the Father, extending from eternity\. Books 2 and 3 clarify that Old Testament theophanies were not divine missions\. Theophanies are considered true missions only when they reveal the eternal processions, as exemplified by the incarnation and Pentecost\. __The Procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son\. __Augustine asserts the procession of the Spirit from both the Father and the Son, emphasizing that this occurs not only in time but also from eternity\. He describes the Holy Spirit as an "inexpressible communion or fellowship of Father and Son\." This argument suggests that if the *filioque* applies in the economic Trinity, then it is also pertinent to the eternal intra\-Trinitarian relationship\. __The Spirit as Gift and Love\. __Augustine portrays the Spirit as both an eternal Gift and Love, possessing a mutual character that implies reciprocal giving and receiving\. Unlike the Son, the Spirit is not begotten but given\. __Substantial and Relational Predication of God\. __In Book 5, Augustine discusses how all substantial predications apply equally to each person of the Godhead\. In contrast, relational predications, such as begottenness and unbegottenness, pertain only to individual persons\. __The Doctrine of Appropriations\. __In Books 6 and 7, Augustine develops the doctrine of appropriations, asserting that all persons of the Trinity possess the fullness of deity without gradation, and all acts ad extra are unified\. When Augustine refers to "Christ as the Wisdom and Power of God," he clarifies that this does not imply the Father lacks wisdom or obtains it from the Son\. Rather, "wisdom is appropriated of the Son because it is through the Son that the Father reveals Himself, through his Word\." __Psychological Models of the Trinity\. __In Book 8, Augustine explores psychological models of the Trinity by considering vestiges of the divine in humanity, created in God's image\. He proposes analogies: lover, beloved, and love, which risk overlooking essential unity among persons; mind, self\-knowledge, and self\-love, which can lead to indistinct personhood and lean towards emanations; and memory, understanding, and will, which may obscure the real distinction of persons\. Such models attempt to articulate Trinitarian relationships but require careful balance to retain both unity and distinction within the Godhead\. 

__Chapter 10\. Trinitarian Analogy: Dionysius the Areopagite and the Fourth Lateran Council\. __

The theological discourse on common versus proper names involves Dionysius the Areopagite's emphasis on the *apophatic* character of common names and the Fourth Lateran Council's assertion of the analogical nature of proper names\. __The Apophaticism of Dionysius the Areopagite\. __Dionysius the Areopagite significantly influenced medieval thinkers such as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas with his apophatic theology, presenting God as utterly transcendent beyond all finite beings\. Dionysius argued that God cannot be "contained somehow within the extension of the scale of perfections as another finite being within the scale\." His approach employs the *triplex via*, or threefold way, to denote God based on creaturely perfections: 

1. Via Causalitatis: This approach acknowledges that God possesses the perfections of His creatures, as He causes goodness and therefore is good\.
2. Via Negationis: Here, Dionysius posits that God utterly transcends all creaturely perfections and human knowledge; thus, statements like "God is good" ultimately has no meaning that humans can understand\.
3. Via Eminentiae: It suggests that God's super\-essential perfections surpass all creaturely perfections and are not unintelligible but rather supra\-intelligible\.

Dionysius’s framework sets the stage for the medieval refinement of analogical discourse about God, bridging creaturely understanding and divine transcendence\. __Fourth Lateran Council \(1215\)\. __The Fourth Lateran Council addressed theological errors attributed to Joachim of Fiore, who assigned relational properties to the essence of the Godhead, risking distinct essences among the persons and challenging divine unity\. The Council affirmed that there is no quarternity—a fourth thing—within God; rather, there is one essence common to all persons in the Trinity\. This position emphasizes that the persons, not their essence, are the principle of procession\. __Analogy and Similarity\. __The Council further articulated that every semblance between creatures and God implies a "greater dissimilitude," cautioning against understanding the unity of the trinitarian persons in anthropomorphic terms\. Such understandings must be qualified apophatically\. Consequently, analogical thinking is applied to comprehend the Godhead, the relations among the divine persons, and notional acts such as begetting and spiration, facilitating a theological perspective that respects both divine unity and the mystery of divine distinctions\.

__Part 2\. On the Mystery of the Divine Nature: St\. Thomas Aquinas’s De Deo Uno Treatise\. __

Before delving into the three persons within the divine nature, it is essential to establish a theology of divine nature itself\. This foundational understanding is necessary to explore the Trinitarian persons in subsequent discussions\.

__Chapter 11\. Analogia Entis within Analogia Fidei: Arguments for God’s Existence\.__

In his "Summa Theologiae," Thomas Aquinas dedicates questions 1 through 26 to the attributes of divine nature, while questions 27 to 43 address the mystery of the Trinitarian persons\. Aquinas employs philosophy to articulate aspects of divine nature, illustrating the relationship between theological and philosophical reasoning\. __The Theological Context of the Five Ways\. __Aquinas highlights that philosophical reasoning serves the mystery of faith, retaining its own integrity and demanding rigorous exploration\. While theology and philosophy are united, they are not identical, as they offer different kinds of knowledge\. Aquinas emphasizes that his approach is not purely natural theology, as it considers grace and nature together\. Revelation requires the support of natural reason, and natural reason OFTEN needs grace to fully serve the faith\. __Aquinas' Epistemological Presuppositions\. __Aquinas begins with fundamental assumptions about the existence of substances and accidents, causality in its formal, efficient, and final forms, and the principle of identity\. He asserts that real substances of diverse natural kinds with inherent ontological properties exist around us, forming the basis for philosophical exploration\. __*Propter Quid* vs\. *Quia* Demonstrations of God's Existence\. __Aquinas distinguishes between "*propter quid*" and "*quia*" demonstrations\. The "*propter quid*" approach moves from cause to effect, illustrated by the understanding that "all men can laugh," which leads to "Socrates is a man, so Socrates can laugh\." In terms of God, we do not fully comprehend His essence, highlighting the challenge with Anselm's ontological argument\. The "*quia*" approach, however, moves from effect to cause\. *While we may not fully know God’s essence, His existence can be discerned from His effects\.* Aquinas finds God philosophically accessible as the ultimate cause of movement and change, being, perfection, and purpose\. This implies the necessity of an ontologically independent cause for all that exists, emphasizing God’s necessity, transcendence, and incomprehensibility\.

- The Argument from *Ontological Change*\. Aquinas' first argument for God's existence is based on ontological change, asserting the necessity of a first mover\.
- The Argument from the *Derivation of Being*\. This argument rests on efficient causality, positing that existing things must have a cause, as nothing can be the efficient cause of itself\.
- The Argument From *Contingent Possibility and Necessity*\. Aquinas argues that all things are materially corruptible and, therefore, contingent\. Given infinite time, contingent beings would lead to non\-being, necessitating the existence of a non\-material, truly necessary being\.
- The Argument from *Degrees of Perfection*\. Aquinas observes gradations of perfections and transcendental characteristics in all existing things\. He concludes there must be a transcendent exemplar that possesses these perfections most intensely and causes them in others, identifying God as infinite in perfections\.
- The Argument from *Teleological Order*\. In an approach not to be confused with the mechanistic argument of William Paley, Aquinas argues that all things exhibit intrinsic tendencies and natural inclinations, resulting in a natural order that requires a primary intelligence, which he identifies as God\.

__Chapter 12\. Naming God Analogically\.__

Having established God's existence, the question remains: what can we know about God? According to Aquinas, our understanding of God is derived solely through His effects\. This approach navigates the balance between divine transcendence and immanence using the concept of the *triplex via*, as a means of approaching the divine names\. __Transcendence, Immanence, and the Triplex Via "Toward" the Divine Names\. __God's immanence is experienced through His effects, yet reason about God is not deductive \(*propter quid*\) but inferential \(*quia*\)\. Aquinas reinterprets Dionysius’s "triplex via" to articulate this understanding\. *Via Causalitatis* suggests that creatures resemble their cause, providing an analogical and transcendent glimpse into God's nature\. This requires an explanation because it assumes some similarity between cause and effect\. *Via Negationis* or *Remotionis* involves stripping away all creaturely imperfections from our understanding of God\. Finally, *Via Eminentiae* asserts that attributes ascribed to God exist in an all\-surpassing, preeminent, and excellent manner\. __Negative and Positive Perfections and the Interplay between Them\. __Aquinas accords epistemic priority to positive over negative knowledge, positing that even negative knowledge implies an understanding of positive attributes\. This understanding moves from *via causalitatis* through *via negationis* to *via eminentiae*, allowing an intricate perception of divine attributes\. __The Mode of Signification Versus the Things Signified\. __Though human language derives from creaturely modes of signification, it remains capable of analogically predicating God\. Scripture employs human language to unfold divine mystery, requiring "epistemic humility" as our grasp of God's goodness is indirect and obscured\. __Analogical Predication for Creatures and for God\.__* *Aquinas extends Aristotle's idea that properties can only be denoted analogically, not univocally\. Univocal predication applies consistently to substances or accidents—like essence, quantity, quality, and so on—in concrete instances\. Transcendental properties are necessarily seen analogically \(for example, being, reality, unity, truth, and goodness\) to substances or accidents, also applying to created realities\. God is not the subject of consideration but the cause; He transcends categorical modes and resembles, and does not resemble, created beings in some way\. This differentiation hinges on the inherent assumption of some similarity between cause and effect\. __Univocity Theory and Equivocity Theory\. __The univocal theory, as critiqued, cannot respect divine transcendence because categories are distinct \(a good quality is not a good quantity\), and no single category holds a monopoly \(e\.g\., only cats have being\)\. The equivocity theory proposed by Maimonides suggests that only negative predication can apply to God, which Aquinas finds problematic as it limits meaningful discourse about God\. He asserts that if all God\-language is equivocal, no distinctions can be made about God, leading to absurd conclusions\. __Modern Analogues and Trinitarian Consequences\. __Richard Swinburne's adherence to Scotus's univocal predication theory risks anthropomorphism, assuming sameness that can obscure the unity of divine persons\. Others argue that analogical thinking becomes overly ambitious, failing to acknowledge human limitations\. Thinkers like Heidegger, Kant, and Jean\-Luc Marion point to an apophatic excess that fears human projection, which can inadvertently diminish the acknowledgment of divine transcendence\.

__Chapter 13\. Divine Simplicity__

The concept of divine simplicity posits that God is not composed of parts, a premise that has faced various objections, particularly the claim that it is more Hellenistic than Biblical\. However, scriptural doctrines like the Decalogue, which forbids imaging God, support this notion, as does monotheism, which affirms God's independence and aseity, indicating no composition of essence and existence\. God’s eternal perfection suggests no progression, a view echoed by Aquinas, who describes God as lacking distinction between potency and act, or substance and accidental property\. Irenaeus further emphasizes God’s immateriality and non\-composite nature\. Critics also argue that divine simplicity makes God seem unrelatable and immutable, but two key corollaries stand: God does not derive His existence from anything else, and there is only one divine essence\. __Aquinas on Divine Simplicity: From Composition and Multiplicity to Simplicity and Unity\. __For Aquinas, divine simplicity negates various compositions: form and matter, individual and essence, existence and essence, and substance and accidents\. Using the threefold via:

1. Via Causalitatis: God, as the non\-dependent cause of all creation, is not complex, for complexity implies dependency\.
2. Via Negationis: Simplicity is a negative definition, denying any composition\.
3. Via Eminentiae: God is absolutely simple, an affirmative assertion\.

__Corporeal Potentiality in God? __Aquinas argues for God’s immateriality: material entities move and are caused, but God, as the first mover, is immutable and beyond potentiality\. Furthermore, because God is the most noble reality, existing as intellect and soul rather than body, He is not composed of form and matter, aligning with both Aristotelian thought and scriptural realism\. __Distinction of Individual and Essence/Nature in God? __Aquinas contends that God's nature is not shared among multiple beings; rather, it aligns with His essence, reinforcing divine uniqueness\. __Composition of Essence and Existence in God? __Aquinas sees essence as potentiality and existence as actuality\. Since nothing acts upon God externally, *His essence is His existence\.* God gives existence but is not part of any other being, necessitating that He is existence in His essence\. __Composition of Genus and Difference in God? __God cannot fall into a genus, as He is pure act without potential realization distinct from others\. __Composition of Substance and Accidents in God? __For Aquinas, God does not possess qualities but *is* those qualities, like wisdom and love, inherently due to His pure act nature\. __God is Altogether Simple\. __In declaring God "*omnino simplex*," Aquinas asserts that God is not material, not a species within a genus, and not an evolving individual\. God’s simplicity reflects the true nature of God as He is\. __Does God Enter into Composition with Created Things? __Aquinas rejects pantheism; even in the Incarnation, the divine nature remains singular and not confused with humanity\. __Can God Know and Love Us if His Nature Is Simple? __Aquinas argues that God can know and love creation because He is the cause of its existence, grounded in His perfect goodness\. God’s nature is not temporal or developmental and does not grow through relational experiences\. If God changes by relating to creatures, it impacts the understanding of the Trinity’s unity, suggesting that relational change would prevent the Trinity from remaining fully constituted prior to, and through, creation\.

__Chapter 14\. Divine Perfection and Goodness\. __

__Divine Perfection\. *Whether God Is Perfect? *__In examining divine perfection, Aquinas contrasts it with the imperfection inherent in matter, characterized by potentiality and change\. Greater perfection is associated with greater complexity and actualization, encompassing quality, a progressively manifested state of being, and the transition from potency to act\. God, however, is not material but is pure act\. Through the triplex via, God is understood as the cause of all perfections while inherently lacking imperfections\. God is described as eminently perfect, perfectly actual, transcendent, and completely incomprehensible\. __*Are The Perfections of All Things in God?*__Aquinas distinguishes between univocal and equivocal efficient causes, and between pure and mixed perfections\. Univocal causes like one horse producing another denote the same species\. Equivocal causes involve transmitting properties to effects with different natures, like the sun's effects on living things, which does not involve transmitting its own nature\. God, as a transcendent efficient cause, does not share a common nature or genus with His creation and is known only analogically\. Mixed perfections, associated with material conditions, do not pertain to God\. Pure perfections, which include being, unity, truth, goodness, knowledge, love, justice, and mercy, face no intrinsic limitations and are embodied absolutely in God\. __*Can Any Creature Be Like God? *__Creatures cannot resemble God univocally because there is no shared genus\. Instead, any resemblance is equivocal, existing only through analogy\. God does not partake in created qualities but is their ultimate cause\. __Divine Goodness\. *Does Goodness Differ from Being? *__A thing is metaphysically good because it possesses existence, properties, and perfections\. While Plato posits goodness as supra\-existent, Aristotle links it to being, actuality, teleology, and perfection\. Aquinas views goodness as desirability, wherein beings have inherent inclinations that enable them to achieve stable forms of perfection over time, making the good communicable to others\. Both Aristotle and Aquinas describe different modes of being in act and potentiality within substances\. Goodness is invariably tied to actuality\. __*Does Goodness Have the Aspect of a Final Cause? *__Goodness functions as a final cause\. Efficient and formal causes are exemplified in a horse's reproduction: its horse nature \(formal\), generative capability \(efficient\), and species propagation \(final\)\. Aristotle: “a thing is most perfect when it can reproduce its like\.” __*The Goodness of God\. *__Aquinas argues that all things seek perfection under the influence of agents, such as a teacher nurturing knowledge in students\. God is the first efficient cause of all things and also their final cause, drawing them towards perfection and embodying perfect and transcendent goodness within His pure actuality\. __*God's Goodness in Relation to Creatures\. *__God's goodness is analogically distinct from that of creatures\. The goodness found in human friendship implies the existence of another person, accidental qualities, and relational reality\. In contrast, God's goodness is essential and intrinsic, not reliant on others\. Aquinas agrees with Plato that God is the separate, first exemplary, efficient, and final cause of all created goodness, yet asserts that created things are only analogically good\.

__Chapter 15\. Divine Infinity and Omnipresence\.__

__The Modern Primacy of the Infinite\. __In modern philosophical thought, especially with Descartes, the concept of God is equated with the concept of an infinite being, emphasizing a positive feature rather than an apophatic one\. Descartes saw the difference between divine and human freedom as essentially one of degree or magnitude, making it univocal\. Conversely, Aquinas argues that while God is indeed infinite, this is not God's primary truth\. For Aquinas, infinity is primarily a negative attribute, tied to divine simplicity and perfection, as God exists as pure actuality without limits\. __Negative Character of God's Infinity\. __Aquinas adopts a __*privative view*__ of infinitude, where the world's pure potentiality of matter is fraught with imperfection and finite in its possibilities and actualizations\. Neo\-Platonically, God's __*infinity is negative*__, emphasizing what God is not, rather than what He is\. God lacks limitation or matter, with existence \(esse\) constituting a plentitude of perfection\. __Divine Omnipresence\. *Is God in All Things? *__God's omnipresence is affirmed as He is the author of all existence\. God is intimately present in all creation, transcending it, while the world is not exterior to God\. Despite His immanence, God remains utterly distinct from all created things\. __*God Is Everywhere: Presence by Essence, Wisdom, and Power\. *__God is present *in all things created* by His essence and power, acting as the efficient cause and Creator\. His presence is also personal, characterized by knowledge and love, suggesting actual contact and proximity through causality\. In *rational creatures*, God is the object toward which they naturally tend, achieved through a mystical union by spiritual grace\. This presents a seamless integration of God's presence across all creation, highlighting both His transcendence and immanence\.

__Chapter 16\. Divine Immutability and Impassibility\.__

__Some Objections to Divine Immutability in Contemporary Theology\. __Contemporary theology raises several objections to the classical understanding of divine immutability, influenced by three historical conditions: the 1\) Enlightenment, 2\) the ideas of Hegel and Schelling with their views on God's historical unfolding, and 3\) post\-WWII theodicy discussions suggesting that God suffers too\. The idea of divine passibility poses questions for the Trinity, like how this affects the relations and identity of the three persons in one changeless nature and whether the Son, in His divinity, suffered—and if so, whether this implies suffering for all three persons\. Various theological responses propose that change over time relates to the Trinity's relationship, with thinkers like Robert Jenson suggesting that God is an event, and *Jurgen Moltmann* claiming that the death of Jesus affects the very being of God\. These ideas appeal to many because love is seen as requiring solidarity with suffering, implying that an impassible God would be incapable of love, and that God must experience evil \(even into His very being\) to fully deliver humanity from it\. __Aquinas on Divine Immutability\. __Aquinas draws on biblical references \(Malachi 3:6, James 1:17\) to affirm the moral consistency of God\. He constructs his argument for divine immutability through three fundamental points\. First, as pure act without potentiality, God is not subject to change\. Second, as God is simple and His properties are His essence, there is no alteration or change in His immutable essence\. Third, God’s infinity ensures no greater perfection is possible, thus precluding any change\. Furthermore, God is not conditioned by anything else but is the condition for everything else, underscoring His radical distinction from the created world and its history, and removing Him from being a changing subject within that order\. __Three Addenda\. __Aquinas adds that God does not possess a body and thus lacks physical passions\. The relations between God and creatures are non\-reciprocal; hence, God's impassibility is maintained even in the Christ event\. While God suffered in Christ, this suffering applies solely to the Son through His human nature, aligning with the doctrine of communicatio idiomatum\. These theological positions safeguard the concept of salvation as an eternal, immutable union with God\. __Does the Notion of a Passible Deity Detract From True Understanding of God? __Aquinas cautions against misattributing created modes of being, such as human pathos and suffering, to the divine nature, arguing these should not affect God's essence\. Although the economy of salvation involves God's relational engagement, there should be no confusion or blending of natures in Christ that would project creaturely limitations back onto the divine\. This approach upholds the integrity of divine immutability and impassibility while respecting the mystery of the Incarnation\.

__Chapter 17\. Divine Eternity and Unity\.__

Divine Eternity is characterized by the absence of mutability and temporality, while Divine Unity signifies the absence of division and composition\. __Divine Eternity as a Negative Attribute Derived from Immutability\. __Aquinas presents divine eternity as a negative attribute flowing from God’s immutability\. Based on the concept of pure act, God is immutable and does not undergo developmental changes over time\. Aristotle defines time as a measure of successive change or movement, a concept applicable only to the human intellect, which can measure time through cognitive apprehension of the unified natures and properties of diverse existent realities subject to temporal alteration—like the knowledge of the sun and earth and their temporal manifestations\. The human intellect, which tends to grasp realities above time, permits a conceptual understanding of the present\. __Using the triplex via__, Aquinas approaches divine eternity by asserting, causally, that God causes all living things and exists as alive immaterially\. Negatively, God is not subject to gradual development\. Eminentially, God's existence embodies a positive plenitude of life\. Boethius encapsulates this by describing eternity as the "simultaneously\-whole and perfect possession of unending life\." As such, God is unqualified life and pure act\. In discussing the __relationship between God's eternity and temporal history,__ Aquinas asserts that God transcends time rather than existing within perpetual time\. As the cause of temporality, God's eternity encompasses and informs time\. God comprehends time as its eternal Author through divine essence, knowing Himself and His creations as their cause\. Therefore, the eternal God acts within history beyond temporal sequences of before and after, uniquely endowed to know future contingent free actions\. __Divine Unity\. __Divine Unity, a property of being, is examined through its negative aspect—indivisibility—and ontological aspects as transcendental unity, equating to being itself\. Unlike numerical unity, which pertains to quantifiable genus distinctions and grades of unity like cars, trees, humans, and angels, divine unity is unaffected by compound unities in material \(e\.g\., cars\) or metaphysical forms \(such as act and potency, existence and essence\)\. God's simplicity leads to divine unity, where infinite perfection results in indivisible oneness\. The order and unity observed in the cosmos indicate God's role as the sole author, confirming God as supremely one and possessing unity in the highest degree conceivable\. This discussion aligns divine simplicity with ultimate unity, revealing an intrinsically inseparable nature of God's indivisibility and eternal existence\.

__Chapter 18\. Divine Knowledge and Love\. __

In exploring divine knowledge and love, we delve into their immanent nature within the spectrum of life, encompassing vegetative, animal, and intellectual or voluntary aspects\. God, as spirit, is understood analogically in comparison with the spiritual life and operations of creatures\. __God's Perfect Immaterial Knowledge\. __For God, knowledge inherently exists because of His immaterial nature\. In humans, immaterial knowledge \(like conceptual understanding\) exists in a finite capacity; in God, it is present in a higher and infinitely perfect form, understood analogically\. While human knowledge often results in external effects, in God, knowledge is an immanent act, reflecting pure actuality\. __Divine Knowledge as Analogically Distinct From Human Knowledge\. __The object of Divine knowledge is uniquely defined\. God does not know objects by considering their pre\-existing states but knows the fullness of His own being, along with all other things, within Himself as their cause\. For God, intellect and its object are one and the same\. This contrasts with human understanding, which relies on abstract concepts; God possesses no concepts, as His essence itself is the medium of understanding\. Unlike humans, for whom intellectual understanding is a property, God is the intellect itself\. His act of understanding does not transition from potentiality to act; instead, God is entirely His own act of understanding—subsistent and not a mere property\. __God's Knowledge of Created Realities\. __Consequently, God's knowledge of created realities occurs through His self\-knowledge and is causative rather than reactive\. God knows all future things as their cause, presenting challenges regarding human free will and the presence of evil\. God wills and foresees freedom as a transcendent cause\. With moral evil, God's knowledge is permissive rather than causative—He creates free moral agents and facilitates the potential for evil without directly willing or causing it\. Evil opposes a creature's innate tendency toward the good, imposing responsibility since the agent could have chosen otherwise\. __On Divine Willing\. __In God, willing is intimately connected with knowledge, as being itself is directed toward perfection, and intellectual beings possess an appetite for the good, equated with will\. __The Analogical Consideration of Divine Willing as Distinct From Human Willing\. __God's willing is subsistent, without distinction between will and intellect, as found in humans\. God's existence is equated with His will and intellect, making God subsistent love, embodying His own act of willing and loving Himself\. God's love of His own goodness derives from that same goodness and recognizes creaturely goodness as stemming from Him\. Creation emerges as a free gift, born from God's gratuitous love for His creatures\. While human love is based on the goodness of others and serves to better the lover, God's love does not improve Him, as God cannot improve Himself\. His love is productive of being, with His goodness as the source of existence rather than its effect\.

__Chapter 19\. Divine Omnipotence\.__

Divine omnipotence is rooted in both Biblical tradition and philosophical reasoning, particularly through the concept of creation ex nihilo, the belief in God's ability to create from nothing\. __Divine Power is an Active Not a Passive Power\. __In discussing divine power, a distinction is made between active and passive power\. Active power refers to the capacity to act upon another, performing perfective actions, whereas passive power involves the potentiality to be transformed or changed by another's actions or effects, such as wood being carved into a statue\. God possesses only active power, emphasizing His role as the originator and sustainer of all actions and perfections\. __God's Infinite Power and Omnipotence\. __The power of an agent correlates with the degree of its actuality\. As God is infinitely actual, He possesses infinite power, enabling God to achieve all possible things, not limited to what is currently actual\. God's omnipotence encompasses all potentialities permitted by logic and coherence within His nature\. __Limitations on Divine Omnipotence? __Divine omnipotence is bounded by logic and divine wisdom\. It is impossible for God to will anything contrary to His wisdom or the goodness perceived by His intellect\. This nature of divine omnipotence does not encompass contradictions, such as a "spherical pyramid," as these do not belong to the realm of possibility\. God has absolute power, demonstrated in creation ex nihilo, but this does not imply a boundless capacity to create a perfect world, as such perfection is subject to divine discretion aligned with wisdom\. __Omnipotence and the Rational Character of Christian Mystery\. __Divine mysteries such as the incarnation, resurrection, and trinity reveal how God's omnipotence is intertwined with Christian theology\. Though God is the foundation of the natural order, He can, through His transcendent wisdom, love, and power, act beyond the natural world's confines\. Such actions remain rationally plausible and fitting within Christian doctrine, aligning with the declarations of the Vatican Council, which emphasizes the reasonableness and coherence of divine mysteries like miracles and the foundational events of incarnation and resurrection\. This perspective underscores that faith and reason are not opposed but rather harmonized in understanding divine action\.

__Chapter 20\. Knowledge of the Triune God\.__

__Natural Knowledge of God and the Mystery of God in Himself\. __The understanding of God through quia demonstrations moves from observing effects to identifying causes, providing rationally certain but analogical knowledge of God's attributes\. This, however, does not equate to intimate knowledge\. Faith, considered a higher form of personal and intimate knowledge, remains imperfect and obscure\. The question arises whether natural or philosophical knowledge of the Trinity is possible, or if it must be revealed, and how this relates to epistemological claims about God's oneness as claimed by monotheistic traditions like Islam and Judaism\. Medieval theology saw disputes on this topic, with figures such as Richard of St\. Victor, Bonaventure, and Duns Scotus suggesting yes, while Aquinas argued no, highlighting unity as discernable by reason and the Trinity accessible only through revelation\. __Richard of St\. Victor\. __Richard of St\. Victor proposed a five\-step argument for understanding the Trinity: 

1. God, the supreme and most perfect good, implies personal love or charity\.
2. Charity requires an object of love, for self\-love alone cannot constitute perfection\.
3. God's love is perfect only if directed towards a supremely worthy divine object\.
4. Perfect love involves selfless concern for another, suggesting love between two persons might seem insular, thus implying three persons within the divine\.

__Aquinas on Rational Knowledge of the Trinity\. __Aquinas critiques Richard, positing that knowledge of God is primarily as the principle of all things, moving from effect to cause\. This creative power, he argues, is common to the Trinity and pertains to unity, not diversity\. Where Richard sees distinct attributes, Aquinas sees them as identical with God's essence\. Thus, he argues there is no knowledge of the Trinity derived from God's attributes, which are unified\. __Corollaries stemming from Aquinas's views include:__

1. Nature cannot produce what only grace provides, such as knowledge of the Trinity\.
2. It is reasonable to remain open to divine revelation\.
3. There are no warranted objections to Trinitarian faith from non\-Trinitarian monotheistic traditions\.

__Aquinas counters Richard's assumptions in steps 3 and 5 by claiming:__

- We cannot infer God must produce an infinite effect simply through effect\-cause reasoning\.
- God’s perfect love and infinite goodness do not require relational partnerships\.
- The idea that two persons’ love is selfish while three is not, could extend indefinitely, undermining Richard’s argument\.

__Is There a Trinitarian Apologetics Based on Reason or Communion of Love? __While Richard’s argument risks anthropomorphizing and misrepresenting God’s perfection, it raises questions about understanding God's nature as wisdom and love\. Aquinas believes grace and faith aid reason, allowing a recovery of suppressed natural truth within the criterion of revelation\. The Christian vision of God emphasizes a communion of persons, offering a distinctive view of God as love\. In __dialogue with non\-Trinitarians,__ Aquinas suggests__:__

1. Examining philosophical arguments and mutual claims\.
2. With Jews, emphasizing unity yet demonstrating progressive revelation, and with Muslims, reiterating monotheism and acknowledging the need for supernatural revelation, a notion also echoed in the Koran\.

__Part 3\. The Immanent Communion of Persons: St\. Thomas Aquinas’s De Deo Trino Treatise\.__

In exploring the Thomistic tradition's understanding of the Trinity, this part delves into the immanent life of the Trinity, emphasizing Aquinas's relationist account\. This account understands the Trinitarian distinctions primarily through relationships and the origins of persons via their eternal processions, employing a psychological analogy and viewing personhood as analogical, bridging between equivocal and univocal understandings\.

__Chapter 21\. A Prologue to Thomistic Trinitarian Theology\.__

__Three Medieval Approaches\. *The Emanationist Account: Early Franciscan Theology\. *__The emanationist account, found in early Franciscan thought, involves the natural knowledge of personal processions, guided by __Richard of St\. Victor's__ emphasis on love\. Bonaventure applies the Dionysian principle that goodness entails diffusion, leading to divine processions\. Scotus developed this further, suggesting that goodness, love, and other attributes are ontologically distinct and contribute to the emanation of distinct persons, illustrated in the love\-beloved\-love framework\. However, as grace is necessary for understanding these processions truly, his approach lacks *propter quid* certitude\. Their psychological analogy struggles with determining whether eternal processions lead to relations \(emanationist\) or vice versa \(relationist\), with potential anthropomorphic implications about God's personhood, as depicted by Boethius and Richard of St\. Victor\.

__Relationist Approach in Early Dominican Theology\. __Aquinas's relationist account, embraced by figures such as Hervaeus Natalis and Jean Capreolus, argues there is no natural knowledge of personal processions, as divine attributes are identical and do not provide relational distinctions without revelation\. Aquinas asserts that relation qualifies procession—illustrating that the Father begets the Son—describing relations not as mere accidents but as subsistent relations \(the Father IS his paternity\)\. This preserves analogy as a proper analogy, distinguishing it from mere metaphorical use\. In employing the psychological analogy, Aquinas resists univocity \(as in Scotus\), positing each person as love, wise, etc\., equally\.

__Nominal Minimalism: Ockham\. __Ockham’s nominalist minimalism suggests minimal natural knowledge of God \(there are only compelling arguments for *at least one* immaterial reality\), emphasizing the need for grace to truly know God\. Divine simplicity and psychological analogy lack sufficient foundation in his view, with persons semantically informed by revelation and church authority rather than ontological reality\. Ockham’s doctrine gravitates toward equivocity, framing the Trinity in terms of propositional belief rather than relational analogy, with full understanding deferred to the afterlife\.

__Some Conceptual Advantages of Thomistic Trinitarian Theology\. __

1. Aquinas offers a relational account of the inner Trinitarian life of God, affirming the equality and identical nature of persons within God\. Each person is a subsistent relation in all that he is\.
2. The positive use of psychological analogy helps elucidate divine personhood\.
3. “Natural” attributes are ascribed to each person within the Godhead in a personal manner, such as the Son being omnipotent in a filial mode\. In the economy, three persons act as one while manifesting distinct personal modalities\.
4. Preserved analogy defines personhood as an individual with a rational nature\.

__Modern Theological Comparisons\.__

- Kant posits the noumenal as unknown, dismissing analogy in his atheological framework\.
- Hegel views the Trinity as symbolic of ontological dynamics in human history, with the divine nature unfolding through human culture and history, epitomized in the Incarnation\.
- Barth identifies personal distinctions uniquely in the immanent life of God categorized as revealer, revealed, and revelation\.
- Rahner, along with Balthasar and Moltmann, aligns economic and immanent Trinity without using psychological analogy\.

White concludes that, in modern theology, the immanent life of God is known in Christ economically, which is similar to univocal and kataphatic Trinitarian predicaiton with Barth and Rahner being *nominal minimalist* and Balthasar and Moltmann being *emanationist*\. White affirms:

1. God can be known truly and imperfectly through analogy and revelation\.
2. Analogy is crucial in discussing the immanent life of God\.
3. Divine persons are best understood as subsistent relations through analogy\.
4. Analogical conceptions of personhood, nature, and relation inform significant theological events like the Incarnation and Pentecost\.
5. The Trinity is vividly revealed in Christ's life, necessitating clear distinctions between Christ's natures\.

__Chapter 22\. Immanent Processions in God\.__

To analogically discuss processions and real distinctions within the Trinity, theological discourse relies on the psychological analogy and the concept of missions\. These missions, occurring within the context of eternal processions, are contingent expressions of divine activity\.

__Is There Procession within God?__ Arius and Sabellius viewed the distinction of persons as necessitating a diversity of essence, mistakenly presuming procession implies exterior action\. In contrast, God, being immaterial, engages in intellectual processions\. These can be understood through the intellectual and love life of creatures, which, when comprehended abstractly, proceed as immaterial intelligence and concepts from our intellect, representing a relational procession similar to love\. __Is There Generation in God? __In natural and physical contexts, two kinds of generation occur: one being coming out of another, representing a transition from potentiality to actuality, and the reproduction of species according to natural kind\. God's procession is notably different—it is not physical, involves no potentiality, and is not egotistical\. However, it is similar in that it represents something substantial, maintaining one divine nature\. __Is There a Procession of Love in God? __In the Gospel of John, the Son is portrayed as the Word, indicative of an intelligent procession\. The eternal procession of the Spirit, distinct from the Son's procession, is also described in John's Gospel \(John 15:16 and 14:16\), being immanent and immaterial\. It is understood only through analogy to spiritual love—lover, loved, love\. The __order of divine processions__ is that we love what we know\. "The Father eternally knows Himself and therefore generates the Son \(Logos\)\. The Father eternally loves the Son, and the Son loves the Father, whence proceeds the Holy Spirit as the spirated love of the Father and the Son\." This process is not generative but operates through an inclination of divine love\. In __conclusion__, "The Father eternally knows and loves Himself in the simplicity and perfection of His pure actuality; in doing so, He generates the Word as the fruit of His self\-understanding\. Similarly, the Father and the Son fully know and love one another in their divine simplicity, thereby spirating the Holy Spirit\." The economy of the Trinity is thus revealed through these eternal processions\.

__Chapter 23\. Trinitarian Relations and Notional Names of Persons\.__

__Are There Truly Relations of Origin in God? __In exploring whether there are real relations of origin in God, we must understand God as being inherently relational, without possessing accidental properties\. __Are There Real Relations in God? __Differentiating between real and logical \(or mental\) relations is crucial: 

1. *Real relations* involve two realities ontologically connected through shared properties; 
2. *Logical relations* are mental constructs for understanding, such as mathematical truths like 2 \+ 2 = 4; and 
3. *Mixed relations* entail one thing being relative to another, but not reciprocally; for example, creation is relative to God the Creator, who remains ontologically independent of creation\. 

__Real Relations in Aristotle and Aquinas\. __According to Aristotle and Aquinas, in the context of genera, substances \(individual objects\) and accidents \(properties\), real relations necessitate two distinct terms existing "toward" one another, based on a shared foundation within the same order\. However, these foundations in divine processions rely on action such as eternal generation and spiration, not quantity or quality\. Traditional issues arise when we consider relations as accidents, seen as imperfect and changeable\. __Relations and Essence Are Identical in God\. __Various errors in understanding divine relations are noted, such as by Gilbert of Poitiers, who deemed relations extrinsic to God's essence, and Joachim of Fiore, who equated begetting and spiration with God's essence, which could imply a complex divine nature\. Aquinas, drawing on the teachings of Albert the Great and Dionysian \(apophatic and superlative dimensions\) theology, affirmed that: 

1. Real relations exist among the divine persons\.
2. There is no foundational basis for relationality in God because there are no accidents within God—relations are God’s essence, expressing “substantial being\-toward\-another\.”

This relational understanding is highlighted through the Dionysian ways:

- Via Causalitatis: Analogous to human relationships, focusing on "towardness\."
- Via Negationis: Relations are not accidental\.
- Via Eminentiae: Emphasizing the transcendent difference of divine relations\.

__Notions for the Persons and Essential Terms\. __Essential terms pertain to the divine essence, whereas notional terms uniquely describe the distinctiveness of each person according to their origins: The Father is identified by innascibility/unbegottenness, paternity, and common spiration; The Son is distinguished by filiation and common spiration; The Spirit is defined by procession\. __Essential and Notional Acts\. __The term "ad extra" refers to the essential actions common to all persons of the Trinity, emphasizing unity\. Notional acts are proper to the distinct persons and their processions, highlighting diversity\. This framework asserts that unity and diversity, though different, are not contradictory but rather mutually convergent and compatible within divine action\.

__Chapter 24\. The Divine Persons\.__

__Metaphysical Challenge\. __Understanding what constitutes a person is a metaphysical challenge both in creatures and within the Trinity\. It requires analogical thinking to comprehend how there can be three distinct persons in one God\. __What is a Person? __*Boethius* defines a person as "*an individual substance of a rational nature*," emphasizing individual substance as a concrete individual with a given nature and rationality\. Aquinas builds on this by introducing the concept of subsistence, which refers to something that exists in itself and not in another\. He describes the individual essence as the concrete realization of a being of a given kind, known as hypostasis—the subject underlying all properties\. For example, Paul as a subsistent person exists uniquely in himself, possessing all qualities, quantities, and relations\. The principle of individuation is grounded in matter and concrete being/mode\. In the Trinity, esse \(existence\) equals essence and is expressed relationally \(esse ad\), where persons only exist in relation to each other\. The hypostatic singularity of persons arises from their relational manner of being God, with each existing in their own modal relation\. __Analogy of Personhood in God\. __Divine personhood is understood analogically, superlatively, and perfectly\. Our understanding remains imperfect, highlighting the disparity between the reality signified \(res significata\) and the mode of signification \(modus significandi\)\. __Persons as Subsistent Relations\. __In God, personhood signifies both relations of origin and essence\. Relations in the divine are substantial, not accidental; for instance, the Father IS paternity\. God's eternal life embodies these relational dynamics among Trinitarian persons\. __The Law of Redoubling\. __The Law of Redoubling considers twofold aspects: subsistent relations and divine essence\. The divine nature subsists in relational modes, with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit each personifying simplicity, perfection, and goodness, while the relations qualify their modes of being \(e\.g\., the Father is *paternally* simple\)\. __Conclusion\. __In theological discourse, personalists like Moltmann and Balthasar emphasize dynamic engagement of persons in history, while Barth and Rahner lean toward modalism, regarding hypostasis as distinct modes of being\. Thomas Aquinas's approach avoids nominalist apophaticism, underscores the economy's foundation in God, and affirms processions revealed by missions\. Personhood is applied analogically yet remains transcendent and ineffable, illustrating three modes of subsistence within one God, which has implications for perichoresis and appropriations\.

__Chapter 25\. God the Father\.__

__The Father as Eternal Fontal Principle in the Trinity\. __The Father is regarded as the eternal fontal principle from whom the Son and Spirit proceed within the life of the Trinity\. Aquinas describes the Father’s innascibility in a purely negative sense, highlighting what He is not—specifically, not begotten from another\. This characterizes the Father as the principle without a principle, emphasizing His relative identity and unique role \(the final causality\) within the Trinitarian relations\. __The Father as the Principle in the Trinity\. __In this context, the Father is understood as the principle, meaning that from which something else proceeds\. The term "cause" is avoided to prevent any implication that the Son and Spirit are created beings\. __Divine Paternity and Filiation\. __The Father’s identity is expressed personally by His eternal role as Father, encompassing infinite plentitude\. Creatures relate to the Father, expressing a form of paternity\. This is articulated through various relational aspects: sonship as a relation to the Father, vestiges of sonship in nonrational creatures, the imago Dei in rational creatures, adoptive sonship through grace, and participation in divine glory as a likeness of the Son\. Creatures also depend on the Son, through whom all things are made\. __The Innascibility of the Father\. __While Bonaventure views innascibility positively, prior to generation and spiration, Aquinas insists it is a negative attribute, identifying not being from another\. This highlights the Father’s relative identity and unique principle role as one who is unbegotten\. __From the Father to the Father\. __The concept of final causality, depicted in the *exitus* and *reditus* \(going out and returning\), illustrates how all creation ultimately returns to God\. The Son’s love for the Father and the Spirit’s love for the Father and Son underscore the Father as their ultimate finality, reflected in the echo of creation’s journey\. __Thomistic Relationalism and the Divine Economy\. __Aquinas notes two consequences of this relational view: 

1. Created things emerge from the Father through the Word and Spirit, remaining utterly relative\.
2. All creation returns through the Father, via the Son and Spirit, emphasizing conformity to Christ \(exemplar\), participating in the Spirit’s life \(immanent\), and returning to the Father \(extrinsic\)\.

__Dissimilitude to Human Persons\. __In God, immateriality contrasts with human materiality, distinguishing divine unity of substance from human distinct substances\. God’s relations are subsistent, not accidental, and these modes of being do not imply inequality but distinction in perfection\. __Human Biological Paternity and Maternity: Metaphorical Similitudes? __The analogy between divine and human parenthood involves immateriality and transcendence, avoiding direct anthropological parallels\. Errors arise when parenthood is seen univocally \(as merely biological\) or equivocally \(as mere metaphor\)\. Divine generation shares some likeness with human parenthood through common nature, procession, knowledge, and love—though in humans these are accidental\.

__Chapter 26\. God the Son\.__

__The Son as Word\. __The concept of the Son as the Word involves understanding an interior concept that proceeds from the mind in an immaterial fashion\. This includes two aspects: the spoken word \(word of voice or incarnated word\) and the intellect \(word of heart or eternal generation\)\. The word of voice helps us to understand the word of heart, while the word of mind encompasses the abstraction of essence as an interior concept\. These distinctions involve: 

1. In a species, the mind grasps intelligibly through abstraction \(mind\)\.
2. The inner concept proceeds from the mind \(heart\)\.
3. The material expression through outer imaginations and vocal sounds \(voice\)\.

__Purification of the Analogy of Filiation in God\. __The analogy of the Word and *verbum* is clarified through *via negationis* leading to *via eminentiae*\. Four principal dissimilitudes include:

1\. Accidental versus substantial: The Word is not accidental but homoousios \(of the same essence\)\.

2\. Mental intentions versus very truth: The essence of God is truth\.

3\. Personal thought aspect: Intellectual procession differentiates God's Word\.

4\. Potentiality versus perfect actuality: The Word embodies perfect actuality\.

__"Word" as the Proper Name of the Son\. __The Word represents an emanation of the intellect, central to understanding Sonship\. It is immaterial, countering conceptions like those in Islam, and is created by the Father, not inherent to Him\. The Word without "Sonship" risks losing the real distinction, potentially leading to modalism, viewing the Word as merely accidental\. __"Word" Indicates a Relation to Creatures\. __As God is Truth, He acquires no knowledge through exterior beings, knowing Himself eternally\. The Son is the eternal expression of God’s self\-knowledge, through which all creation is realized\. The Word serves as both exemplary and efficient cause of all creatures, receiving from the Father the infinite plenitude of divine existence and being, further establishing the principle of divine action and relationship with the created order\.

__Chapter 27\. God the Holy Spirit\.__

__Preliminaries on the Spirit's Procession\. __The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as Love, characterized by relational, not essential, spiration\. This notional act of spiration signifies the Spirit’s distinct processional identity\. The Spirit is immaterial, and the process is analogized by *love* directed through the *will* toward the *beloved*, facilitated through the medium of knowledge \(the Word\)\. __The Father and Son as One Principle of the Holy Spirit\. __The Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, with the Son receiving the power of spiration from the Father\. Together, they form a joint principle of one spiration, reflecting the eternal relationship within the Trinity\. __The Holy Spirit as Love\. __Love is the essential term, while the notion of Love requires a clear analogy: "Inclination Toward": The Father’s love expressed via spiration\. "Impressio": The mutual expression of love within the Trinity\. These relationships reveal the Father’s love for the Son and the reciprocal love of the Son for the Father, together with the Spirit as Love\. __Filioque: Historical Considerations\. __The Filioque was added to the Creed in 381 but gained prominence in the 6th century\. It is affirmed by early Church Fathers such as Tertullian, Hilary, Ambrose, Augustine, Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, and others, marking its significance in the context of countering Arianism\. __Filioque: Theological Dimensions\. __Scriptural reasoning supporting Filioque includes references to the Spirit of the Son, the Son’s role in sending the Spirit, and the Spirit imparting what He has received from Jesus\. This underscores the economic relationship and unity between the Spirit and the Son\. __Aquinas's Arguments for the Filioque\. __The differentiation of persons within the Trinity relies on relational distinctions\. Without acknowledging these distinctions, the nature of the Trinity becomes unclear\. Aquinas argues that since there can be no distinction in quantity, quality, or substance, it must be relational\. The analogy of love, whereby love proceeds through knowledge \(the Word\), supports this\. *Ad extra* activities imply *ad intra* relations, preventing new, unwarranted relations\. __Modern Ecumenical Attempts at a Comprehensive Settlement\. __Figures like Gregory of Cyprus and Gregory Palamas \(13th\-14th century\) viewed the Augustinian Filioque skeptically\. Concerns included: 

1. Attributing a hypostatic property of the Father \(power\) as transmittable to the Son about the Spirit\.
2. The notion that the Spirit, having power, could self\-generate, reducing Him to a creature\.

They proposed that Filioque should only apply economically\. In response, proponents argue that spiration occurs due to divine essence, not that the essence itself spirates\. The Spirit, therefore, does not generate but remains a relational principle rather than an aspect of shared essence\.

__Chapter 28\. Perichoresis and Trinitarian Communion\.__

*Perichoresis*, or *circumincessio*, a term coined by Gregory of Nazianzus, refers to the mutual inherence of the divine and human natures in Christ, and the mutual indwelling of the persons of the Trinity\. This concept highlights their relationality and shared essence, where the persons simultaneously indwell one another equally\. In his human actions, Christ operates as Lord in unity with the Father and the Spirit, revealing their presence\. __Equality of the Trinitarian Persons in God\. __*Homoousios* underscores the co\-eternal and indwelling nature of the divine persons, who share the same essence\. While temporal succession might involve an agent acting in time and progressively acquiring power, such progression does not apply to intra\-divine processions\. These processions occur by nature, not choice, and involve no development or change in perfection\. The communion of divine persons is not affected by external actions\. Each person subsists in their relational mode, such as the Father being God in a paternal mode, aligning omnipotence with paternity, and acting in distinctive modes\. __Mutual Indwelling of the Persons\. __There are three foundations of mutual indwelling:

1. Unity of Essence: Everything in the Father is present in the Son, suggesting complete presence in each other's being\.
2. Mutual Reciprocity: The relational character of processions implies eternal interdependence, such as the Father not existing without the Son\. This personal communion stems from notional acts and signifies perfect, wholly immanent unity\.
3. Origin: Processions emanate from and within the Father, with principles residing also in the Son and Spirit, denoting spiritual and immaterial presence\. Each person is wholly present in the other through shared essence, relational virtue, and origin\.

__Chapter 29\. Appropriation, Creation, and the Unity of Divine Action\.__

__Defining the Question: What is the Practice of Trinitarian Appropriation? __Trinitarian appropriation involves ascribing essential names and actions to particular persons within the Trinity, a practice found in the New Testament, such as calling Christ the power and wisdom of God\. __Lombard__ outlines four examples of appropriation: 

- Pertaining to eternity, species, and use \(from Augustine\)\.
- Pertaining to unity, equality, and connective bond \(from Augustine\)\.
- Pertaining to power, wisdom, and goodness \(from Abelard\)\.
- Pertaining to the Pauline formula, "from him, by him, and in him\."

__Aquinas on Appropriation of Essential Terms and Acts\. __Buildingn on this, Aquinas distinguishes essential versus personal properties: 

Father

Son

Spirit

Eternity

Unoriginated source of all

Source of all beauty

Source of goodness and joy

Unity

Unity

Equality

Union/concord

Causality

Power

Wisdom

Goodness

Pauline Formula 

Efficient cause

Exemplary cause

Final cause

__Does the Doctrine of Appropriations Render Obscure the Distinction of Persons? __Rahner questions if creation reveals anything about the inner Trinity, suggesting it may reduce the activity of the three persons to mere modalism of the essence\. He implies all non\-divine actions relate to the one God’s essential attributes\. White counters that the essence of God is integral to the persons: it is the Father through Son in Spirit who creates and sanctifies, etc\. Four propositions clarify:

1. Ad extra actions are attributable to all three persons\.
2. Each person acts in distinct personal modes based on eternal relations\.
3. Actions are understood in terms of common essence and personal modes\.
4. Ad extra actions reflect personal modes\.

Effects relate only to the divine essence, with revelation necessary for understanding the Trinity\. __Christological Consequences: The Humanity of Jesus Reveals His Filial Mode of Exerting the Divine Action\. __Christ, as a singular hypostatic entity with two natures, acts in his hypostatic mode as the Son of God\. His human actions, such as raising Lazarus, reveal:

1. The eternal power he receives from the Father\.
2. The beauty of the Word\.
3. The joy of the Spirit\.

His actions express power, wisdom, and goodness\. Through Him, by Him, and in Him, these truths are manifested, yet caution against viewing these economically with univocal rather than analogical similitude remains essential\.

__Chapter 30\. The Divine Missions\. __The notion of divine missions is key to understanding the revelation of the Trinity\. Aquinas sees the exploration of missions as essential for comprehending the image of God in humans and angels\. __Understanding the Term "Divine Mission\." __A divine mission involves a *habitual reciprocal relation*__ __between the sender and the sent\. This relation can be structured around a *request made to the sent* or an alignment with their origin\. It implies a *new presence* *and mode of being present*\. These missions retain the eternal relations within the Trinity, manifesting its mystery and engaging all divine persons\. Divine missions present a *new mode of presence* for the persons of the Trinity in creation\. The missions encompass both invisible aspects, such as the image of God and sanctification, and visible events like the Incarnation and Pentecost\. These involve sanctifying grace, a gift of uncreated grace through the Holy Spirit, operating efficiently, formally, and finally\. __Who Can Be Sent\. __Within the Trinity, only the Son and the Holy Spirit can be sent, given the Father’s unique role as not originating from another\. __Various Spiritual Dimensions of the Theology of Missions\. __All sanctifying grace stems from divine missions, bringing about "new missions" in the lives of individual Christians\. This revelation is ongoing, extending into heaven until the day of judgment\. Sacraments are vital instruments for conveying these divine missions to humanity, deepening their spiritual significance\.

__Part 4\. Trinitarian Economy: Creation and Christology\.__

__Chapter 31\. Is There Such a Thing as an Economic Trinity? On the Trinitarian Activity of Divine Revelation\. __Modern theologians like Karl Barth and Karl Rahner offer perspectives on God's presence in the economy, framing distinctions between the persons of the Trinity based on the activity of revelation\. Barth perceives the distinction of persons as anchored in the historical economy of revelation, while Rahner emphasizes God's relational aspect through historical experiences\. __Theological Reflection Under Modern Conditions\. __The Enlightenment introduced a strong emphasis on rationality, which figures like Kant critiqued\. *Kant* proposed a historical anthropology where knowledge is grounded in historical and cultural development rather than universal truths\. In this context, if God is to be found, it would be within history\. *Hegel* speaks of God as the foundational principle of reality, with history acting as the reconciliation of the divine and temporal\. His influence on modern theology is evident in concepts like *kenotic* Christology, where divinity self\-limits to engage with humanity fully\. *Hegel’s* ideas challenge the traditional understanding of divine essence, suggesting that God's persons are distinguished through their roles in historical processes\. *Barth* interprets the Trinity as a divine activity of self\-revelation, articulating distinct persons through functions such as revealer, revealed, and revelation\. Yet, Aquinas asserts that while the economic manifestations reflect the Trinity's work in the world, *they do not define* the immanent Trinity itself\. __The Immanent Trinity as an Economic Trinity\. __Rahner's *Grundaxiom* posits that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and vice versa\. This notion can be interpreted to mean that temporal missions reflect eternal processions or suggest that God’s life is fully expressed only among us\. Rahner asserts that God does not need to create, but if He does, it is typically in view of the Incarnation, making human nature central\. The result is a perception of God's self\-communication and the distinct relational properties of the persons being defined by their economic roles\. Consequently, psychological analogies are no longer necessary, and the term “persons” becomes overly anthropomorphic, instead of favoring "modes of subsistence\." __Thomistic Qualifications and Divine Revelation\. __Aquinas offers core principles that challenge modern interpretations:

1. Internal processions are encountered through missions\.
2. Understanding the economic Trinity requires understanding eternal communion\.
3. Persons act according to essence and also modally as individuals\.
4. All actions reflect the Trinity, personally and naturally\.
5. Christ acts as both God and man but in distinct natures and operations\.

Aquinas “critiques” Barth's *ad extra indivisa* stance, emphasizing that revelation is Trinitarian, deploying personal modes appropriated to each divine person\. Moreover, God remains ontologically self\-sufficient and independent from creation\. __The "Economic Trinity:" Why We Should Bid Farewell to the Notion\. __The concept of the economic Trinity, as discussed, presents several issues: 

1. Equating economic with immanent can negate the distinction, making the Trinity seem historical rather than eternal\.
2. Suggesting God’s identity is influenced by economic history risks associating God too closely with worldly processes, a concern expressed by theologians like Moltmann\.
3. Proposing dual modes might suggest dual Trinities or contradictory identities\.

Instead, emphasizing eternal processions and temporal missions maintains God's transcendence and ensures a concrete historical realism\. The processions manifest in history as an expression of God’s eternal mode, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how God's immanence engages with temporal reality\.

__Chapter 32\. The Trinity and Creation\.__

__Kenotic Trinitarian Creation in Modern Theology\. __In modern theology, Trinitarian creation is understood in light of “*ad extra indivisa*,” where God's actions are outwardly unified yet manifested through each person in distinct ways\. __The Kenosis of the Trinity as a Condition of Creation \(Sergius Bulgakov\)\. __

Bulgakov identifies three aspects of Trinitarian kenosis: 

1. God is characterized by the free self\-determination to create, altering His essence\.
2. This act is kenotic, as Divine Sophia becomes united with creaturely Sophia, meaning the world exists both in time and with an eternal foundation\.
3. The kenosis of the Son occurs in the Incarnation, ceasing divine properties temporarily, rooted in Sophia’s original kenosis, akin to the Father begetting the Son\.

__Creation as an Act of Trinitarian Self\-Limitation \(Jürgen Moltmann\)\. __Moltmann suggests that God's creation is an act of self\-limitation:

- God is inclined by nature to create, freely as expression of internal self\-determination\.
- While distinct from creation, God is not utterly transcendent and develops relationally with it\.
- God delimits Himself by allowing freedom to suspend attributes other than freedom\.
- The Son is freely subject to non\-being \(death\) and freely not subject to nothingness \(resurrection\)\.

In __*ad extra divisa*__, the Father creates, the Son is the immanent archetype, and the Spirit communicates to creation from within, constituting real distinctions \(__not merely appropriations__\) in the divine economy\.

__Difficulties with Radical Economic Trinitarianism\. __Kenotic love, as a foundation for God's identity and creative act seen in the Incarnation, poses challenges:

1. It implies God's real relationality to creation affects His inner life\.
2. Freedom for love becomes the primary attribute, questioning the existence of an immanent Trinity or transcendent aseity\.

Paradoxically, only a transcendent God can bestow true freedom and being\. Bulgakov and Moltmann, while against the nominalist doctrine of divine sovereignty and a Divine voluntarism that makes the act of creation arbitrary\. They fall into the other extreme of nominalism by placing God and creation in competition and ontological mutual exclusion, necessitating God to self\-empty as God in his nature so that creatures may come into being and thrive\.

__Trinitarian Modes of Expression in Creation\. __Trinitarian derivation reveals its mystery in creation, known through revelation\. This involves: a\) the image of God in humans and angels, b\) immaterial knowledge, and c\) immaterial willing love\. Similitudes include:

- Ontological likeness to the Father: successive begetting\.
- Inner intelligibility/form: imitating the Son as enduring Logos\.
- Every material being asserts its nature in interactions: vestige of the eternal goodness of the Holy Spirit\.

*Immanent operative activity* pertains to living beings, grounded in their organic interiority and manifesting through nourishment, sensation, and interpersonal love\. Knowledge and love are expressed materially in culture and art, with a hierarchical vestige observed in vegetative, animal, human, and angelic levels\.

__Chapter 33\. The Trinity in the Incarnation and Life of Christ\.__

__Inverted Monophysitism and its Challenges\. __Inverted monophysitism, emerging from a post\-Hegelian context, seeks to find God solely through history, focusing on Christ's human nature\. It emphasizes God's self\-giving love in the Incarnation and suffering, portraying divinity as shaped by the kenotic act of becoming human\. Monophysitism: one nature \(divine\) after the union\. Inverted monophysitism: one nature \(human\) after the union\. This view suggests the Son is distinguished through his human operations and will\. __Three key features characterize this perspective:__

1. Kenotic love is central to the Son's relationality with the Father, extending eternally and temporally\.
2. The human activity of Christ exemplifies this relationality, with theologians diverging on its expression—Moltmann and Pannenberg deny the presence of the divine will, for Balthasar and Bulgakov, this will is present but quiescent, and Barth maintains that the human activity always mirrors the eternal divine obedience\. on eternal divine obedience mirroring human activity\.
3. Christ's human properties are attributable to the Son from eternity, with varied interpretations: Balthasar speaks of divine suffering and eternal distance, Bulgakov of eternal kenotic love, Moltmann of non\-being to being in resurrection, and Pannenberg of eternal subordination through obedience\.

__Problems with Inverted Monophysitism\. __This approach challenges the simplicity and *homoousios* of God, suggesting differentiated personal attributes like obedience as nonessential and accidental\. It implies an incompatible distinction between the Father \(transcendent\) and the Son \(historically becoming\), rejecting dyothelitism and raising concerns about "ontological rivalry\." In contrast, conciliar Christology affirms distinct yet non\-opposed natures, with the Son’s humanity expressing divine action\. __The Outpouring Love of the Trinitarian Persons\. __Modern theology often grounds kenosis \(self\-emptying\) in intra\-Trinitarian love, while Aquinas emphasizes pre\-existing capacities for self\-communication, both *ad intra* \(between persons\) and *ad extra* \(in creation or redemption\)\. Athanasius describes divine outpouring, where the Father eternally communicates to the Son, foundational for creation as an expression of grace\. This outpouring is analogical and not material, affirming continuous divine love\. Combining these views, the Father’s active power eternally communicates all He is to the Son, implying interpersonal love that extends *ad extra* in creation and redemption\. Temporal generation reflects this eternal expression of love\. __The Incarnation as an Expression of Trinitarian Life\. __In the Incarnation, God becomes human without leaving Himself or altering His divine nature\. The hypostatic union preserves united natures without confusion, as all divine actions involve the Father and Holy Spirit\. The Son acts personally and divinely through His humanity, expressing His filial identity as God, with Jesus's life reflecting Trinitarian form\. __The Human Knowledge and Action of Christ as Revelation of the Trinity\. __Christ possesses two wills and operations, performing miracles as a human through mind, heart, and actions, while fully expressing His divine nature\. His life involves maturation and growth, holding the plenitude of grace: 1\) his humanity is divine; 2\) he acts on behalf of humanity; and 3\) his intellect and will are oriented toward the Father’s will\. This divine\-human synthesis accomplishes an ongoing revelation of God\. __The Human Knowledge of Christ\. __Christ's understanding *naturally develops*, encompassing awareness of His Father, pre\-existence, and union with the Holy Spirit\. __The Human Action of Christ\. __Christ’s actions, such as obedience to the Father, reflect Trinitarian will, revealing His divine mission\. His emotional and physical suffering illustrates His filial identity and unveils the Trinity’s nature, with God ontologically present in historical and redemptive acts\. Ultimately, while not offering demonstrative proof, Christ’s existence and actions reveal the Trinity's nature, demonstrating how everything Christ embodies communicates the depth of God’s Triune reality\.

__Chapter 34\. The Revelation of the Trinity in the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ__

The Paschal mystery, encompassing Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, unveils the Trinity’s profound reality\. __The Garden of Gethsemane and the Acceptance of Passion\. __In Gethsemane, Christ's soul experiences agony before death, confronting a natural revulsion toward death but ultimately reaching resolution\. This human struggle involves both sensory and rational repulsion, accompanied by prophetic awareness of the suffering to come and the gravity of human sin\. In Christ, the unity and distinction of nature are evident: a\) he suffers in His humanity, and b\) he possesses the plentitude of divinity\. Christ’s human will is *fully subordinate* to the divine will, illustrating obedience to God’s intra\-Trinitarian will and aligning with the Holy Spirit\. __Suffering and Crucifixion: Atonement as Trinitarian Revelation\. __Christ's merit in His passion and death is multifaceted: a\) hypostatic/personal foundation; b\) human charity, sinlessness, and grace; and c\) the intensity of freely embraced suffering\. The crucifixion becomes a Trinitarian event: 

- God's manifestation occurs not on Sinai but through the crucifixion\.
- The Father wills the Son's mission for salvation\.
- Christ consents to this, showcasing the Son's eternal wisdom and the Spirit's fruitfulness\.

The Son’s self\-offering to the Father signifies the eternal Son\-Father relationship and highlights the Spirit’s temporal mission\. This relationship is epitomized on the Cross, where the Son, united with the Father, sends forth the Spirit\. __The Suffering Love of the Son\. __Christ endures spiritual, emotional, and physical suffering\. In his divine nature, he transcends suffering, ascribing potential suffering neither to divine relations nor to historical kenosis \(as proposed by Moltmann, Bulgakov, or Balthasar\)\. Charity acts as the motor of Christ’s suffering, representing eternal self\-communication: a\) the Father gives all to the Son, b\) the Son returns all to the Father in death, and 3\) the Son imparts the Spirit at Pentecost\. __Separation of Body and Soul, and Descent into Hell\. __Christ’s death signifies the separation of body and soul, yet he remains uncorrupted: he subsists both in his cadaver and his separated soul\. His cadaver illustrates solidarity in death and retains divine power\. His soul’s descent into hell illuminates the Passion for those in heaven, purgatory, and hell, revealing divine light and love \(?\)\. __Bodily Resurrection and Exaltation: The Economic Revelation of Jesus as Son and Lord\. __The resurrection manifests Jesus’s eternal Sonship\. His human body transforms into a glorified state, exhibiting impassibility, subtlety, agility, and clarity while his soul reaches perfect knowledge and love\. __The Trinity's role in resurrection is collective\. __The Father raises Jesus, the Son raises himself, and the Spirit raises Jesus\. This act manifests the Son as the Father’s only\-begotten and underscores His divine role in creation\. Consequently, Christ’s humanity is refined into eschatological mode, paralleled by the Son’s divine actuality\. __Jesus as Lord\.__ In His exaltation, Jesus’s human nature shares in the eternal authority\. His judgment exemplifies the theandric \(divine\-human\) act\. __The Sending of the Spirit\. __The Holy Spirit is sent at three pivotal moments: from the Cross \(water and blood\), when Jesus breathes his Spirit upon the disciples before Pentecost, and at Pentecost itself\. These sendings manifest the Spirit’s eternal mission from the Father and Son, as well as through Jesus’s human will\. The Spirit reveals the Father and Son and imparts Christ’s gifts to believers, continuing to disclose Himself to humanity\.

__Conclusion: On Being Trinitarian__

__On the Organic Development of Trinitarian Notions\. __The early Christian notions, shaped by the New Testament and church fathers, laid the groundwork for coherent Trinitarian thinking\. Key motifs include 1\) three distinct hypostases, 2\) distinctions of persons primarily through their relationships, 3\) the use of analogies from the human mind, and 4\) Augustine's distinction of processions and missions\. This development involves proper and common names, influenced by Dionysius the Areopagite’s ideas of causal resemblance, apophatic negation, and preeminent excellence\. The credibility of Trinitarian doctrine is rooted in scripture and patristic thought, and Aquinas’s work is deeply informed by these ideas, maintaining their relevance today\. __On the Essential Importance of a Trinitarian Theology of the Divine Nature\. __Following Augustine and the Cappadocians, Trinitarian theology responds to challenges from figures like Arius and Eunomius\. God is understood as a perfect, pure act, without development or ontological evil\. God is immutable, impassible, and eternal, possessing perfect life, knowledge, and love\. 

1. Understanding the divine nature is essential for grasping the Trinity\.
2. It's crucial to understand unity and equality within the Trinity\.
3. Distinctions arise solely through relationships\.
4. Psychological analogies are qualified by shared nature and essence\.
5. These concepts are vital to perichoresis\.
6. They clarify differences between mission and procession\.

__The Psychological Analogy and a Relationalist Account of the Trinity\. __The intratrinitarian life is known through economic actions\. Knowing and loving are the two primary immanent immaterial activities, forming the basis of psychological analogy\. Subsistent relations, framed by love and knowledge as relational dynamics, facilitate understanding of:

1. Truly distinct yet equal and consubstantial persons\.
2. Personal modes of subsistence\.
3. The concept of the filioque\.
4. Perichoresis \(mutual indwelling\)\.
5. Appropriation as a relational mode of subsistence\.
6. The unity between eternal communication and personal activity\.
7. Persons willing their own sending alongside the Father\.

__On the Distinction of Processions and Missions, and the Two Natures of Christ\. __There is no economic Trinity distinct from the immanent Trinity; rather, they are the same, reflecting no developmental process\. A clearer analogy contrasts the human and divine natures of Jesus, underscoring the coherence and unity within the Trinitarian framework\.
