__No Other God: Response to Open Theism \- John M\. Frame__

__Preface\. __Frame aims to dismantle Open Theism as unbiblical, drawing on material from his book *The Doctrine of God* with added insights\. While critical of Open Theism, he acknowledges its emphasis on God's "give\-and\-take" with the world, beyond mere anthropomorphism\.

__1\. What Is Open Theism? __*The Rhetoric and the Reality\. *Open Theism \(OT\) often offers motivational rhetoric rather than robust theological or philosophical foundations\. Pinnock presents a dichotomy: a distant, unchangeable God versus a loving, open one\. Frame argues most Christians see God as both sovereign and caring, neither aloof nor vulnerable, aligning with historical Christianity\. *The Openness of the Sovereign God\.* Frame agrees with certain "open" aspects, like God's receptiveness to prayer, but emphasizes God's sovereignty in opening and closing aspects of creation \(creation mandate, great commission\), citing Revelation 3:7\. His sovereign power opens us to him and him to us\. *Sovereign Vulnerability*\. While God doesn't suffer in his essence or alter his eternal plans, he does experience emotions in interactions with creatures, exemplified in Christ's incarnation\. *The Ambiguities of Open Theism\. *Open Theism advocates a libertarian view where humans have significant freedom and God adapts his plans accordingly\. Classical theology maintains God's unchanging nature, seeing dynamism in divine relationships rather than in his essential being\. Both views acknowledge dynamic relationships with God\. *The Open\-Theist View of Traditional Theism\. *Richard Rice outlines Traditional Theism \(TT\) focusing on God's sovereignty, timeless knowledge, and relative independence from human actions\. Frame identifies this as essentially Calvinistic, though Calvinists would quibble with some aspects, like finding equal glory in the destruction of the wicked\. *The Main Contentions of Open Theism\. *Rice summarizes OT with points like God’s paramount love, responsiveness, influence from creatures, and learning from unfolding events\. Frame adds that OT postulates libertarian freedom, where choices are uncaused and undetermined\. 

__2\. Where Does Open Theism Come From? __*The Antiquity of Open Theism\. *Despite OT’s modern presentation, its ideas have ancient roots in libertarianism, seen in Philo, some early church fathers, and philosophical figures like Epicurus and Aristotle\. Frame views OT as more aligned with Greek thought than TT\. *God and the Greeks\. *Both traditional theism \(divine unchangeability, impassibility, etc\.\) and OT \(libertarianism\) have Greek influences\. *Socinianism: The Missing Link in Open Theism's Genealogy\. *OT’s denial of God's exhaustive foreknowledge aligns historically with Socinianism, which rejected many key doctrines, including divine foreknowledge, arguing that God's omniscience is limited to what is knowable \(which does not include free decisions of creatures\)\. *More Recent Influences\. *Modern culture’s focus on human freedom complements the OT, with influences from philosophers like Hume and Kant and theologians like Moltmann, Pannenberg, Brunner, and Hendrikus Berkhof \(?\)\. *What Is New About Open Theism? *Open Theism’s novelty lies more in its evangelical presentation than its ideas\. While positioned within evangelical circles, OT differs by rejecting doctrines like exhaustive foreknowledge\.

__3\. How Do Open Theists Read the Bible? __OT claims greater biblical fidelity than TT, though Frame points out underlying presuppositions\. *Logic\. *While logic itself is infallible, humans apply it fallibly due to finite understanding and sin\. Open Theism challenges Traditional Theism's dismissal of perceived scriptural contradictions, like whether God can both hate and will sin\. Frame argues that contradictions can only be judged when fully understanding what the statements mean\. The key is the law of non\-contradiction: statements can't both be true "at the same time and in the same respect\." The real issue, he says, is understanding theological contexts rather than mere logical analysis\. *Models* Sanders contrasts a "Risk model of providence" with TT’s "no\-risk" view\. Frame argues that Scriptural authority should guide model development, not vice versa\. *Straightforward Exegesis and Anthropomorphism\. *OT and TT debate whether terms like "repentance" reflect literal attributes or anthropomorphic language\. Frame suggests that all scriptural language is both anthropomorphic and literal, truly depicting God’s nature\.

__4\. Is Love God's Most Important Attribute? __God's attributes can be described using nouns \(like eternity\) or adjectives \(like eternal\)\. Various theological perspectives attempt to identify a fundamental attribute: Being for Thomas, infinity for Scotus, aseity for some Reformed theologians, will for Socinians, reason for Hegel, love for Ritschl, love in freedom for Barth, person for Buber and Brunner, and futurity for Moltmann\. Open Theism adopts Ritschl’s focus on love, which is prominent in the New Testament\. However, Frame questions if love is more fundamental than other attributes or centralize it more than others\. Frame argues that Scripture emphasizes God's lordship as fundamental, but not metaphysically\. Traditional Theism \(TT\) holds that God is his attributes, implying no single attribute holds primacy\. Frame suggests that God's essential attributes are perspectival, with some being more crucial for our understanding\. While love may seem central, the question of "what is love" remains unexplored within Open Theism\. __Love, Sensitivity, Responsiveness, and Vulnerability__\. Open Theism suggests that love includes sensitivity and responsiveness, implying Traditional Theism lacks these qualities\. Frame contests this, citing Charles Hodge's perspective that love inherently involves feeling, underscoring that God does possess emotion\. Frame plans further discussion on how a supra\-temporal God responds to temporal events\. He speculates that Open Theism may actually seek to emphasize God's "vulnerability," a concept he explores by noting that while God can be vulnerable in some senses, he remains ultimately invulnerable\.

__5\. Is God's Will the Ultimate Explanation of Everything? __

__The Natural World\. __Scripture attributes events in the natural world to God's active role, asserting that he "makes" rather than merely "allows" things to happen, even random events like the casting of lots\. This is evident in purposeful acts, such as the Ten Plagues\. Jesus emphasizes God's control over nature, suggesting a personalistic view of the natural world\. __Human History\. __Just as God controls nature, He also directs human history, including the course of individual lives\. Scriptural examples, like the story of Joseph and God's governance over blessings and curses, show that all events serve his purposes, culminating in the coming of Jesus\. Thus, God is sovereign over the entire sweep of human history\. __Individual Human Lives\. __

God’s control begins at conception, influencing every aspect of our lives, from DNA to life events, as seen in Jeremiah 1:5\. Even unintended actions fall under God’s sovereignty, as indicated in Scriptures where God allows certain events to occur, such as accidental deaths\. __Human Decisions__\. Our decisions are not independent of God, and His sovereignty deeply influences our actions through heredity, environment, and circumstances\. Human choices, including those leading to historical events like Joseph's journey to Egypt, are foreordained by God\. The heart, as the root of decision\-making, is under divine control, aligning with Proverbs 16:9 and New Testament instances of fulfilling Scripture through human actions\. __Sins\. __Frame acknowledges the theological challenge of God foreordaining sin yet maintains this view based on Scripture\. God orchestrates human behavior, including sin, without compromising His goodness, exemplified through events like the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and prophecies of sin\. This extends to key moments like the crucifixion of Jesus, showing that God foreordains events, including sin, for a greater purpose\. __Faith and Salvation__\. Faith is a divine gift, while unbelief stems from God withdrawing His blessing\. Salvation involves both divine action and human choice, yet God's eternal choice precedes ours, challenging Arminian views of foreordination\. Open Theism's denial of foreknowledge fails to explain biblical teachings on election\. God's decision, not ours, initiates faith and salvation, affirming His sovereignty in effectual calling and ongoing spiritual life\. Believers continually depend on the Lord for the resources needed to live obediently\.

__6\. How Do Open Theists Reply? __

__Universalizing Particulars? __Open Theists assert that verses about God's sovereignty should be contextually limited rather than universal\. For instance, Isaiah 45:7 highlights God's sovereignty not just in political events but universally\. Frame argues that while scripture addresses specific contexts, it does so under universal principles\. He contends that Sanders's objection is outweighed by multiple scriptural references that imply God's universal control guiding all human history\. __Divine Foreordination Versus Human Responsibility?__ Open Theism sees a conflict between divine ordination and human responsibility\. However, Frame posits that they coexist without conflict\. While Open Theists base human responsibility on libertarian freedom, Frame plans to refute this, advocating for the compatibility of divine sovereignty and human responsibility\. __What Kind of Election?__ Open Theists view election as primarily corporate and for service rather than salvation\. Frame acknowledges both corporate and individual election in Scripture: historical \(people can be initially elect but later non\-elect\) and eternal \(unchangeable, involving salvation\)\. He highlights God's sovereign choice in individuals for salvation, as seen in the cases of Jacob and Esau in Romans 9\-11, reflecting God’s eternal election\. __How Can God Act "Now" if He Acts "Always"?__ Open Theism questions why specific divine actions are distinguished if God is always acting\. Frame explains that God's actions are universal, but certain events stand out because they 1\) have special human interest, 2\) reveal God extraordinarily, 3\) contrast divine power with finite agents, and 4\) clearly advance God’s historical purposes\. __Other Open\-Theist Objections\. __Open Theists challenge that: 1\) God's will isn't always irresistible \(addressed in chapter 7\), 2\) exhaustive foreordination contradicts libertarian freedom \(chapter 8\), and 3\) God lacks exhaustive foreknowledge, affecting his control over the future \(chapter 9\)\. Frame plans to engage with these objections in subsequent chapters\.

__7\. Is God's Will Irresistible?__

Open Theism \(OT\) argues that God doesn't always achieve his desires, suggesting that he takes risks with events like the fall of angels and humans\. On a broad level, OT concedes that God's will is generally fulfilled, but not necessarily in specific circumstances\. Frame notes that Calvinism offers a similar distinction, acknowledging that some desires are only realized over time, while others may never be fulfilled if they conflict with God's greater plan\. __Antecedent and Consequent Wills__\. God's antecedent will reflects his general desire for goodness, like wishing everyone to be saved\. His consequent will is his specific choice among those goods\. Frame agrees with this distinction but argues it doesn't support libertarianism as God's choices precede human responses, making human choices effects of divine determination\. __Decretive and Preceptive Wills\. __Reformed theology often rejects the antecedent\-consequent distinction due to its libertarian implications, instead differentiating between God’s decretive will \(decree/foreordination\) and preceptive will \(valuations of preferable states\)\. Not all states are possible, as they must align with God’s consistent plan\. Temporally, God evaluates potential states \(preceptive\) and chooses among them for his historical purposes \(decretive\)\. This approach finds support in Scripture\. __Sander's Distinction\. __Open Theists, like Sanders, suggest human freedom and nature’s unpredictability limit God's control\. Frame disagrees, positing that God wills his will to be thwarted when prioritizing certain desires over others\. Frame questions if God's desires are simple and unified, without composition\. __The Efficacy of God's Will__\. Scripture asserts that God's power accomplishes his purposes\. While historical events, like the cross, may seem to temporarily resist God’s intent, his eternal purposes are assured\. Frame counters OT's interpretation of the potter\-clay metaphor as mutual interaction, arguing instead that it demonstrates God's absolute control, supported by passages like Romans 9:19\-21\. Ultimately, God's good pleasure is always realized, underpinning the concept of irresistible grace\.

__8\. Do We Have Genuine Freedom? __

__Libertarian freedom__ stands as a central issue in the debate surrounding Open Theism\. According to John Frame, libertarian freedom is a fundamental component driving the Open Theism viewpoint, which posits a definition of freedom where an agent is free regarding a specific action if it is within their power to both perform and refrain from that action\. This conceptualization assumes that human choices are not determined by God\. While God may be the initial cause of the universe, humans are seen as the primary actors in their decisions, with the capacity to make choices independently, even those contrary to their character and desires\. Frame remarks that this implies there is a will within human nature that functions independently, allowing decisions that defy one's motivations\. Open Theism asserts that only under these conditions can individuals be fully accountable for their actions\. Some proponents, like Rice, argue for a vision where all human decisions are radically free, suggesting that God requires human cooperation to influence outcomes\. Others, like Boyd, recognize situations where God actively intervenes, such as when He hardens an individual's heart to determine specific sinful actions, exemplified by Judas' betrayal\. __A Critique of Libertarianism\. __Libertarian freedom was widely discussed in the early church but first contested by figures like Augustine, and later by Luther and Calvin, especially against Molinists, Socinians, and Arminians\. Today, it is mainly self\-conscious Calvinists who oppose libertarian freedom\. Several criticisms have been leveled against it: 

1\. God’s sovereign control over human actions, including sin, is fundamentally incompatible with libertarian freedom\. 

2\. Scripture does not explicitly endorse libertarian freedom, and Open Theism does not meet the burden of truth, often contradicting Sola Scriptura\.

3\. Scriptural teachings posit that God’s authority forms the necessary and sufficient basis for human responsibility, with foreordination not diminishing this accountability\.

4\. The Bible does not attach positive value to libertarian freedom, presuming it exists at all\.

5\. Scripture suggests that in heaven, the highest state of human existence precludes the freedom to sin, indicating a state without libertarian freedom\.

6\. Biblical judgment is not contingent upon libertarian freedom; for instance, Judas is held responsible despite lacking such freedom\.

7\. Libertarian freedom is not acknowledged as a requisite for moral responsibility in civil courts\.

8\. Legal frameworks often assume motives and causation, contrasting the assumptions of libertarian freedom\.

9\. Scripture challenges the notion that only uncaused decisions are morally accountable\.

10\. The independence postulated by libertarian freedom contradicts biblical teachings\.

11\. Libertarian freedom undermines the biblical unity of human personality, separating the will from the heart and other faculties\.

12\. If libertarian freedom were necessary for moral responsibility, it would imply that God, who cannot act against His nature, is not morally accountable, nor are glorified saints, who cannot sin\.

13\. Libertarian freedom is seen as an abstract extrapolation of the idea that inability limits responsibility\.

14\. It is inconsistent with God’s foreordination and foreknowledge, suggesting an external deterministic chain if God does not foreordain future events\.

15\. While libertarian freedom is often considered a foundational principle, its lack of scriptural support challenges its role as a governing framework\.

16\. Philosophical defenses of libertarian freedom typically rely on intuition, which does not conclusively reveal whether we are influenced by external causes, and is partly shaped by subconscious factors\.

17\. Lastly, libertarian freedom implies a limited sovereignty of God, which is deemed unscriptural\.

__Alternative Perspectives: Other Kinds of Freedom\. __In contrast to libertarian freedom, other concepts of freedom are explored\. Spiritual or moral freedom aligns with choosing actions deemed good in the sight of God\. Compatibilist freedom proposes that individuals are free when they act according to their desires, even within a deterministic framework, as it harmonizes personal will with predetermined circumstances\. The Westminster Confession of Faith introduces the notion of natural liberty, presenting a form of freedom free from natural causation and external compulsion and not determined by any necessity inherent in human nature, which neither imposes nor necessitates a particular moral outcome\. __Addressing the Problem of Evil\. __Libertarian freedom is often posited as a potential solution to the problem of evil, providing an explanation for why a good and omnipotent God allows evil to exist\. Proponents argue that God permits the risk of evil to maintain human autonomy and moral responsibility\. However, John Frame critiques this approach for failing to adequately address divine responsibility and suggests that denying divine foreknowledge only exacerbates the problem\. He questions whether such an arrangement aligns with a God who values goodness, righteousness, and holiness\. Instead, Frame proposes embracing the inherent mysteries of Christianity, which accept divine sovereignty even in the presence of evil\. He points to biblical narratives, such as the crucifixion of Jesus and the story of Joseph’s slavery, to illustrate how God can use evil to achieve greater good\. Ultimately, libertarian freedom is deemed unscriptural, logically incoherent, and destructive to both divine sovereignty and human accountability, advocating instead for a theology that reconciles these tensions within a framework of divine purpose and foreordination\.

__9\. Is God in Time?__

Open Theism challenges the idea of God's supratemporality, suggesting it is more aligned with Greek philosophy than Scripture\. Historically, most of the early church, except for the Arians, viewed God as timeless, a concept echoed by theologians like Augustine and Boethius\. While these views suggest God exists beyond time, others, like Socinians, believed God operates within time, partly due to their rejection of exhaustive divine foreknowledge\. Theologians like Charles Hodge considered that while God fully perceives past, present, and future, it is unclear if He experiences them in succession\. Nicholas Wolterstorff argues that God's actions occur within time, implying a temporal existence necessary for engagement with the temporal world, a view generally accepted by process theologians and Open Theists to support libertarian freedom\. __Arguments Against Divine Atemporality\. __Frame critiques arguments for God's atemporality, reasoning that an atemporal being can initiate time sequences without existing temporally\. While Wolterstorff suggests God's temporal acts presume temporality, Frame counters that God knows temporal events through His immanence\. Additionally, claims that God's supratemporality renders time unreal overlook the distinction between Creator and creation; time as a creation remains real\. Further, divine knowledge is experienced timelessly by God, though perceived temporally by humans\. These philosophical arguments are mirrored in discussions about God's spatiality\. __Philosophical Arguments for Divine Supratemporality\. __Philosophical arguments assert God's supratemporality based on immutability and omniscience\. Aquinas claims temporality would imply change, and Augustine argues it would necessitate an increase in knowledge, undermining omniscience\. Boethius suggests that temporality prevents God from possessing His entire existence at once\. Furthermore, relativity theory proposes that God’s existence across all timeframes signifies supratemporality, whereas an infinite temporal existence implies time isn’t a creation, posing logical paradoxes\. __Scripture on God and Time\. __Scripture hints at God being everlasting, yet it does not align with modern concepts of time\. Instead, it suggests that God transcends human temporal limits, existing without beginning or end, unchanged, and omniscient across all times\. God's experience of time differs from human temporal frustrations and is not subject to their flow\. __Temporal Omnipresence\. __God’s supratemporality reflects His transcendence beyond time, while His temporal omnipresence signifies His active engagement within time\. God participates in redemptive history successively and is always present in covenant with His people\. This duality resolves Wolterstorff's emphasis on temporal engagement, as God understands temporal events and reacts accordingly within His omnipresence, maintaining both His immanence and transcendence\.

__10\. Does God Change? __

Open Theism suggests that while God is unchangeable in essence and trustworthiness, He can change in response to events in history\. This perspective aligns with the notion that God’s essence remains constant, but His actions and decisions can adapt to human actions\. However, Scripture maintains that God is fundamentally unchanging and trustworthy\. __A God Who Relents\. __Despite these assurances, numerous biblical texts depict God as changing His mind, often using the Hebrew word "nacham," which indicates relenting\. While relenting might appear contradictory to God's unchanging nature, it is presented as part of His divine character\. For instance, passages in Jonah and Joel frame relenting as integral to God's consistent nature, suggesting that many prophecies are conditional, hinging on human behavior such as obedience, repentance, or prayer\. Jeremiah 18:5\-10 illustrates this through imagery of the potter and clay, symbolizing God’s sovereignty and willingness to relent based on human actions\. This passage clarifies that God's relenting, while appearing as a change, aligns with His sovereign decisions and incorporates human responses without undermining His eternal plans or decretive will\. __How Is God Unchanging? __Defining God's unchangeability acknowledges that Scripture attributes change to God\. Bavinck posits that any change is limited to the creature, while God's nature remains constant\. When God’s attitude shifts, such as from wrath to favor, it reflects the creature transitioning from a state aligned with Satan to one with Christ, initiated by God\. Frame further categorizes divine unchangeability into four aspects: God’s essential attributes, His decretive will, His covenant faithfulness, and the truth of His revelation, all of which remain unchangeable\. __Unchangeability and Temporal Omnipresence\. __God exists both above and within time, which is significant for understanding His unchangeability\. Relenting can be seen as anthropomorphic, taking place in human history, yet from an atemporal perspective, God’s decisions, like forgiving Israel through Amos’s intercession, are part of an eternal decree that remains unchanged\. This dual reality means God acts as a true agent in history while also existing changelessly outside of time\. The distinction between these states began with creation, where God initiated a sequence of events and judged them as good\. Consequently, history can be viewed as a divinely authored novel, where God orchestrates every event, and they unfold within the world He creates\.

__11\. Does God Suffer? __

__Aseity and Divine Emotions__\. God’s aseity implies He is self\-existent and self\-sufficient, immune to any change or suffering that might affect His essential nature or eternal plan\. While Scripture ascribes emotions to God, such as compassion, love, and wrath, these emotions differ from human experiences as they lack corporeal elements\. God's emotions align with His eternal decrees and His responses are consistent and purposeful, being the ultimate evaluator of all events\. Although God may empathize, such “suffering” does not imply a loss but reflects His relational engagement with creation, taken seriously within His sovereignty\. __Weakness in Power and Suffering in Christ\. __God’s power sometimes manifests through perceived weakness, notably through Christ’s sufferings, which are indeed God’s sufferings\. Jesus, possessing both divine and human natures, experienced suffering and death, allowing for divine empathy\. Through divine *communicatio idiomatum *and *cirum\(in\)sessio*, the Trinity shares in these experiences\. Despite this, God’s aseity and unchangeability remain intact, viewed as a mystery that offers joy and reassurance\. 

__12\. Does God Know Everything in Advance? Open Theism and Foreknowledge\.__

Open Theism argues that God does not have exhaustive knowledge of the future, positing that God can change His mind in response to unforeseen events, challenging traditional theological views of exhaustive foreknowledge\. This interpretation arises from the Open Theism concept of libertarian freedom, suggesting that God's omniscience extends only to what can be known in the present, not the future\. __Divine Ignorance and Scripture’s Depiction__\. Scriptural narratives where God "learns" often occur in judicial contexts, serving rhetorical purposes rather than literal ignorance\. Phrases like "God's remembering" or "forgetting" operate within covenantal, judicial frameworks\. When Scripture seems to show God's unawareness of future events, it frequently points to relational dynamics with humanity rather than His eternal foreknowledge\. __God’s Exhaustive Knowledge\. __Scriptural prophecy supports the notion of God's exhaustive foreknowledge\. While prophecies may seem conditional, they attest to God’s foreknowledge and predetermined plan\. Critics like Rice argue some prophecies may depend on human decisions, yet others are definitive, indicating God's overarching determinative will\. Frame rejects the former and accepts the latter\.

__Is Open Theism Consistent with Other Biblical Doctrines?__

__Inspiration and Sin\. __Open Theism raises questions about biblical inspiration, challenging how God could inspire fallible authors if He lacks comprehensive foreknowledge or authority\. The concept is seen as incompatible with orthodox views of sin and moral responsibility, given that libertarian free actions under Open Theism lack theological and moral grounding, thereby destroying moral responsibility\. __Redemption, Assurance, and Eternal Realities__\. Open Theism's ideas about righteousness and redemption diverge from traditional beliefs\. The potential for a lack of assurance arises if God cannot control human freedom or predict future outcomes\. Concerns extend to heaven and hell, where eternal security seems uncertain if libertarian freedom is maintained or subsequently revoked, contradicting Open Theism's emphasis\. __Divine Guidance and Wisdom\. __Open Theism suggests that God can make mistakes, engendering doubt about divine wisdom and guidance reliability\. The analogy of trusting a gambler underscores the incompatibility and risks when placing trust in a God framed as uncertain in foreknowledge and control\.
