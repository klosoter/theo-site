__Modern Christian Thought: Volume II – The Twentieth Century – Livingston and Fiorenza__

__Ernst Troeltsch__

Ernst Troeltsch was closely affiliated with scholars such as Wilhelm Bousset, Hermann Gunkel, Johannes Weiss, and William Wrede in Göttingen, all influenced by Albrecht Ritschl\. Troeltsch's intellectual pursuits centered on historicism and the essence of Christianity, exploring how historical context profoundly affects religious beliefs and practices\.

__Historicism, the Science of Religion, and Theology\. __Troeltsch was concerned with how norms and values can be upheld amid historical and cultural change\. He primarily focused on historical theology and Christianity's claim to absoluteness\. His approach to historicism included three central aspects: 

1. No historical event or tradition escapes historical\-critical scrutiny\.
2. While all events are unique, analogies between past and present events are necessary\.
3. The interconnection between faith and facts is not isolated; it must be comprehended within a broader historical framework\. Troeltsch argued that despite relativism, meaningful values and comparative judgments remain possible\.

__The Absoluteness of Christianity\. __Troeltsch's views on Christianity's absoluteness were complex and evolved throughout his life\. In "*Die Absolutheit*" \(1901\), he described Christianity as the highest form of religious life as a matter of personal conviction\. By the 1902 edition, he acknowledged that Christianity might be superseded and shouldn't be regarded as absolute or immutable\. Later, he recognized inherent contradictions between global faiths and the cultural determinism of Christianity's historical development, yet asserted that spiritual power and truth accompanied this relativism\.

__What Does "Essence of Christianity" Mean? __Troeltsch believed that understanding Christianity's essence required a historical\-comparative study, extending beyond empirical history to a philosophy of history\. He outlined three principles:

1. Criticism: The definition of essence involves both imaginative abstraction and ethical judgment\.
2. Development: Christianity should be understood as a developing spiritual principle reflecting the entirety of its history, rather than a static doctrine\.
3. Ideal Concept: The essence must be considered in terms of future possibilities \(what ought to be\), with its determination seen as a creative act\.

__The Historical Jesus, Faith, and Christology\. __Troeltsch developed his position regarding the *Historical Jesus* by responding to three contemporary theological approaches: traditional orthodoxy, Neo\-Hegelians, and Ritschlians\. He critiqued the reliance on biblical authority \(1\), freedom from historical contingencies \(2\), and the idea that the historical Jesus is essential and normative \(3\), arguing that he cannot be fully and clearly known and must not be known as an isolated historical fact, but also “through the community and the living effects by means of subsequent Christian personalities\.” Troeltsch posited that faith interprets facts but does not establish them\. Instead, he based Christianity's understanding of Jesus not on faith or historical accuracy alone but primarily on a universal law of social psychology\. He viewed Jesus as the creator of Gospel symbols but more so as a symbol himself, representing God in Christ\. Troeltsch rejected the Nicene and Chalcedonian claims as impossible doctrines in an age dominated by a historical way of thinking and argued that Jesus cannot be viewed as the exclusive final revelation of God\.

__Radical Empiricism and Religion: William James__

__Existential Crisis and Free Will\. __William James experienced an existential crisis, viewing humans as mere automatons in a closed mechanical world\. He chose to assume for one year that free will is not an illusion, epitomized by his statement, "my first act of free will shall be to believe in free will," embodying the essence of pragmatism\. __Experience, Pragmatism, and the "Will to Believe\." __James argued that the will plays an actual role in believing\. People respond to certain beliefs as live or dead \(1\), with live beliefs being appealing as real possibilities due to a pre\-existing tendency to believe them\. Decisions between hypotheses can be forced or avoidable \(2\), and beliefs may be trivial or momentous \(3\)\. Sometimes, faith in a fact can help create that fact, particularly in moral, religious, and existential truths\. __Example\. __In religious hypotheses, the best things are the more eternal things, and believing this affirmation is beneficial\. Assuming this hypothesis is a live one, it must be recognized as a momentous one due to the potential gain or loss of vital good and, therefore, as a forced option regarding that good\. In such cases, when empirical evidence is lacking, personal beliefs and desires can permissibly influence decision\-making\. __The Varieties of Religious Experience: An Empirical Exploration\. __James asserted that what makes an experience religious is its *phenomenological* nature, not psychological aspects\. He opposed reductionism, suggesting that medical materialism, like attributing Paul's vision to epilepsy, does not exhaustively explain phenomena\. __Personal Dimensions Over Institutional Forms\. __He focused on personal dimensions of religious experience rather than institutional religious expressions\. __Healthy\-Minded vs\. Sick Soul\. __In religious personalities, he distinguished between the healthy\-minded, who are optimistic, and the sick soul, characterized by pessimism, noting that the former often have deeper communion with the Divine\. __Conversion and Genuine Religious Life\. __Conversion \(transitioning from a sick soul into a healthy mind\) is the process where the divided self gains unity, involving a change of interests, with some becoming central and others negligible, often occurring imperceptibly\. Genuine religious life comprises a feeling of connection to a broader life beyond selfish interests and the existence of an Ideal power, a sense of continuity and self\-surrender to this power, immense elation as self\-boundaries dissolve, and an emotional shift towards loving, harmonious affections embracing "yes, yes" instead of "no," in relation to the non\-ego's claims\.

__American Empirical Theology: Douglas Clyde Macintosh__

__Macintosh's Method: Critical Monistic Realism__\. Douglas Clyde Macintosh developed a theological approach he called critical monistic realism\. According to Macintosh, "revelation is the individual's perception of the religious value issuing in the right adjustment to the religious object or Divine Reality\." He assumes that absolute and universal values exist and that humans can discern them, although he does not specify why these values are "apparently found in the personal life and character of Jesus\." Macintosh assumes the Christian system of values to be universally normative when examining humanity's religious experience, essentially defending Christianity on radically empirical grounds\. __The Right Human Religious Judgment\.__ Macintosh outlines that God's positive action is contingent upon certain human religious judgments: 

1. Concentration on God as the object of religious dependence and his moral ends\.
2. Self\-surrender to God and consecration to one's self towards morally desired ends\.
3. Willed responsiveness to divine guidance\.
4. Steady persistence in religious attitude\.

__Blindspot\. __A critique of Macintosh's method is questioning how he knows whether religious experience and derived laws are from God \(i\.e\., external\) or simply descriptions of the inner workings of the human psyche\. __Normative Theology and Christian Belief\.__ Macintosh describes *scientific theology* as based on perceptual intuitions, while *normative theology* relies on strong subjective convictions about God's nature, which transcend empirical experiences\. In defense, similar to William James, he argues that "we have the right to believe that those theological doctrines are true which are necessary for the maintenance of the highest well\-being of humanity," if they appear reasonable to us\. __Universal Applications\. __His theology emphasizes the action and being of God in both empirical and normative discussions and insists it must be universal \(e\.g\., knowledge of God, not of Christ\) and not tied to a specific historical revelation\. Despite this, Jesus remains important for his psychological and pedagogical value in Christian upbringing and is seen as logically indispensable for religious conduct\. Within experimental religion, the most normative revelation of the divine is apparently found in the personal life and character of Jesus\. Although radical in his method Macintosh was often evangelical in spirit and in his defense of several traditional Christian doctrines\. __Concept of Atonement\.__ Macintosh's concept of atonement is not the orthodox substitutionary, objective, or individualistic one\. Instead, he views it as embodying universal brotherhood, seeing it as an ideal for the future rather than a fact of past history\. 

__Henry Nelson Wieman__

__Critique of Christian Theological Tradition__ Henry Nelson Wieman argued that the Christian theological tradition is inadequate as a guide for humanity\. He believed that scientific inquiry, rather than tradition, should be the constructive principle shaping our lives in the modern technological age\. He famously noted that the atomic bomb on Hiroshima divided history more decisively than the star of Bethlehem, illustrating his view of "anti\-history" where history cannot effectively guide our lives\. 

__Wieman's Radical Modernism\.__

__Scientific Method and Naturalistic Theology\. __Wieman, influenced by John Dewey's experimentalism, prioritized knowledge of God through the scientific method within a naturalistic worldview\. He proposed that God must be perceivable in experience\. Knowledge is attained through the development of habits such as worship and prayer and must be tested through critical analysis to align with scientifically verified knowledge\. Wieman rejected the transcendence of time and reason found in mystery theism and knowledge beyond reason, seeing these as harmful to human salvation and progress\. __Doctrine of God\. Process Theology\. __Wieman viewed ultimate reality not as static objects but as an organic process of events and their qualities\. The creative event produces qualitative meaning, enhancing life’s felt quality, and thus, God is this creative process or event, thought of in functional rather than substantial terms\. The source of human good involves four subevents: emerging awareness of qualitative meaning through communication, integrating new and old meanings, expanding the world's qualitative richness, and deepening community through creative communication\. Wieman denied his view was humanistic because humans cannot accomplish what the creative event does—these events are accidental relative to human effort\. Evil and sin obstruct the creative event, akin to traditional sin doctrines, where sin cannot be fully eradicated and forgiveness requires more than human effort alone\. He argued that God is not a person, omnipotent, transcendent, or a being but an event or process revealing a structure or pattern\. __Creativity Over Personality\. __Wieman asserted that humans are not the most basic reality; creativity is ontologically prior to personality, and devotion should be directed to the creator rather than creatures\. __Jesus and the Creative Event: Demythologizing\. __Wieman did not consider Jesus to be God, noting the lack of sufficient information and the impossibility of knowing supernatural aspects experientially\. However, Jesus was associated with unique creative thrusts in history, marking a breakthrough in creative interchange during his life, death, and resurrection\. Although Jesus is a participant in the creative event, he did not most fully or uniquely reveal it\. Like Troeltsch, Wieman saw Christ as sufficient for revelation and salvation for us in our tradition or context\. __Problems with Orthodox Doctrine\. __Questions arise regarding Wieman's view of God: Is the creative event singular? Is it metaphysically consistent? Without personhood, who judges "good"? As only humans can make value judgments, Wieman's concept offers no redemption beyond history, rejecting perfectionism and historical progress and conflicting with Christian eschatological hope\. 

__Chapter Three: The Dialectical Theology: Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, and Friedrich Gogarten__

__Origins and Critique of 19th Century Theology\.__ In response to the widespread support of World War I by German theological intellectuals, Karl Barth became disillusioned with 19th\-century theology, leading him to believe that it had no future\. This catalyzed a movement towards dialectical theology, or the theology of crisis, which was a short\-lived revolution from around 1910 to 1930 \(important date: 1920 *Zwischen die Zeiten *by Gogarten\) with variations among theologians like Barth, Brunner, Gogarten, and sympathizers such as Tillich\. __The Beginnings of Dialectical Theology\. __Dialectical theology was a reaction against liberal theology and the horrors of WWI\. Many theologians associated with this movement originated from the Ritschlian or Idealist traditions\. Karl Barth, known for his socialism and union activism as the "red pastor of Safenwil," criticized the church's endorsement of WWI and state religion\. He returned to academic theology with a focus on scriptural study, rediscovering a "strange new world within the Bible," influenced by Kierkegaard’s notion of an "infinite qualitative difference between God and man\." Barth's commentary on Romans was controversial, leading to repudiation from figures like von Harnack but praise from young theologians like Emil Brunner for its direct approach\. Dialectical theology rejected equating Christianity with the social order, emphasizing a theology of "crisis" where God is a hidden, wholly other being that must be revealed\. __Liberal Theology: History and Interpretation\.__ Dialectical theologians, including Barth, Brunner, and Gogarten, opposed the Ritschlian and Idealist traditions, challenging their views on historical consciousness\. Liberal theology embraced the historical\-critical method, claiming it freed theology from dogmatic tradition\. However, Barth and his contemporaries criticized this approach as it led to divergent historica views, for example, on the Historical Jesus, and failed to account for the complexity of historical contexts\. Gogarten identified two incompatible ways to conceive the relationship between revelation and history and critiqued Troeltsch for pantheism of history, advocating for a dialectical theology that emphasizes both the presence of the Absolute and its separateness from human history\. __Harnack vs\. Barth\.__ In the debate over historical knowledge's necessity in understanding the Bible and Jesus Christ, Harnack posed "Fifteen Questions to the Despisers of Scientific Theology" to challenge figures like Barth\. Barth responded by asserting that historical\-critical study cannot alone reveal the Gospel's truth, as it extends beyond the Scriptures and requires the Spirit\. Barth argues that the figure of the Historical Jesus is not identical to the full divine revelation, which is understood as an act of God that transcends mere historical reconstruction\. He emphasizes that the connection between God and history is not straightforward or simplistic\. While God acts within history, His actions and the revelation of Jesus Christ are part of an eternal truth that cannot be directly equated with historical events\. This creates a tension between the temporal and the eternal, the historical and the absolute\.

__Major Themes in Karl Barth's Theology of the Word of God\.__

__The Dialectical Method\. __

__Influence of Kierkegaard\.__ The dialectical method in theology, influenced by Kierkegaard, rejects the smooth progression of the Hegelian dialectic from thesis to antithesis to synthesis\. Instead, it embraces a dialectical tension between truths, never fully resolving, due to revelation existing between two worlds \(eternity and time\) for which we have no analogy\. This method is expressed paradoxically and preserves the creator\-creature distinction, emphasizing God as *der Ganz Andere*\. 

__God as Wholly Other\. __

__The Leitmotif of Crisis Theology\. __"Der Ganz Andere" is a central theme of crisis theology, with the creator\-creature distance as the primary theological task\. God can only be known through God's self\-revelation, as the finite world hides rather than reveals God, emphasizing no direct path from humanity to God\. Instead, God's revelation comes through Jesus Christ, where *Deus Revelatus* equals *Deus Absconditus*—the revealed God is the hidden God\. The resurrection *event* transcends history, rendering the quest for the Historical Jesus futile\. Christ's otherness and mystery can only be apprehended through faith, beyond human comprehension\.

__The Strange World of the Bible\.__

__Approaching the Bible with Presuppositions\. __Readers often approach the Bible with preconceived worldviews, finding only what they seek\. According to this perspective, the Bible holds little direct value in history, morals, or religion, emphasizing instead God's incomprehensible realm\. It offers scant historical explanations or moral guidance and little practical religious value because it witnesses a greater divine world\. __Scandal of Revelation in Human Literature\. __The scandal lies in God's revelation within the relative and problematic literature of the Bible—a radically human and fallible document\. Like the mystery and scandal of the Incarnation, the Bible is both a human document and the Word of God\. It cannot be said to *be* the Word of God; rather, it *becomes* God's Word through engagement with it\.

__The Breakdown of the Dialectical Theology\.__

__Agreements among Dialectical Theologians\. __The original group of dialectical theologians, whose work was published in "Zwischen die Zeiten," shared a critical stance toward liberal theology and bourgeois culture, particularly opposing the conflation of social order with the Kingdom of God\. They rejected attempts to objectify God or establish scientific foundations for faith, as well as the identification of revelation strictly with Church doctrine\. __Differences Between Bultmann and Barth\. __Notable differences emerged between Rudolf Bultmann and Karl Barth\. Barth emphasized the historical continuity of scripture between past and present, whereas Bultmann insisted on a historical responsibility to critically assess whether texts adequately express their subject matter\. Bultmann advocated using philological historical criticism to discern and grasp the subject matter, which he believed transcended the authors, such as Paul\. Barth opposed this view, arguing that it assumes one can fully engage with Paul's Jewish\-Hellenistic context, and when content becomes particularly strange, it leads to a critical stance against it\. Barth contended that all scripture is inherently strange, and thus requires acceptance without imposing contemporary judgments\. Despite their disagreements, Barth and Bultmann maintained a cordial and frank dialogue\. __Barth and Gogarten\. __The divergence between Barth and Friedrich Gogarten was less amicable\. Bultmann and Gogarten sought to ground theology in existentialist anthropology, drawing from Heidegger\. Barth, however, rejected any anthropological or existential starting point for theology, emphasizing that theology should not rest on a conception of human existence\. He opposed natural theology, a direction that Brunner had also explored, maintaining that theology must focus solely on divine revelation without human presuppositions as its base\.

__Emil Brunner\.__

__Religious Socialism and Philosophical Influences\. __Emil Brunner, like Barth, was deeply influenced by the movement of Religious Socialism\. His works, such as "Die Mystik und das Wort," reflect the influence of the I\-Thou philosophy of thinkers like Ebner and Buber\. In "Man in Revolt," Brunner outlined these ideas, which Barth criticized as a return to corrupt influences, analogous to "the fleshpots of Egypt," a critique he also directed at Gogarten and Bultmann\. Brunner’s "Wahrheit als Begegnung" developed the idea that truth is a personal encounter, further elaborated in "Offenbarung und Vernunft\." Unique among his contemporaries, Brunner’s extensive travels and engagement with the Ecumenical movement set him apart from Barth and Gogarten\. __Anthropology and the Apologetic Task\. __Brunner made anthropology a cardinal point of his theology, focusing on human nature and existence\. He shifted the theological question from "What is God?" to "What is Man?" Brunner supported the idea of natural theology, claiming it is affirmed by Scripture and the Reformers, contrasting with Barth’s outright rejection\. However, Brunner clarified that his interpretation of natural theology does not imply natural knowledge of God \(only of Man\) due to human sin\. __Point of Contact and Apologetics\. __Brunner's apologetics suggested that God's revelation in creation provides a point of contact between revelation and science, though humans do not inherently possess natural knowledge of God due to sin\. He proposed that sin, defined as rebellion and idolatry, requires knowledge of God and serves as a witness to the God\-given revelation in creation\. __Divergent Views on Natural Theology\. __Despite Barth’s strong opposition, both theologians rejected natural theology in the sense of humans possessing innate knowledge of God, though Barth’s emphatic "Nein" to natural theology may have overstated their differences\. 

__Revelation as Encounter and Truth\.__

__A Third Way Between Subjective and Objective Revelation\. __Brunner advocated for a middle ground between subjective revelation, as seen in Liberal Theology, and objective revelation, as in orthodoxy\. Revelation, for Brunner, involved both an objective divine action and a subjective reception\. __Scripture and Personal Encounter\.__ Brunner held that faith in Scripture arises because "Christ, whom I am convinced in my conscience is the Truth, meets me in the Scriptures\." This reflects an instrumental authority of Scripture, where genuine knowledge is found in the personal encounter with God\. __Influence of I\-Thou Philosophy\. __Guided by Ebner and Buber, Brunner emphasized the I\-Thou relationship over I\-It knowledge, which pertains to rational\-scientific understanding\. Genuine humanity emerges through a divine call to the Creator, with knowledge being transformational and relational, restoring humans to their intended relationship with God\. __Historical Jesus and Faith\. __Brunner maintained the significance of the Historical Jesus, which is accessible through Scripture and church fellowship via the Spirit\. He opposed reducing faith to historical criticism or the abandonment of historical claims, countering both objectivism and the existential reduction of faith to subjective understanding\. __Critique of Bultmann’s Demythologizing\. __While respecting Bultmann’s historical scholarship and agreeing on reinterpreting mythological elements of the New Testament, Brunner critiqued Bultmann’s interchange of myth with worldview, particularly concerning the Incarnation and death of Christ\. Though rejecting a literal cosmology, Brunner upheld supernaturalism, affirming God’s historical intervention\. __Brunner’s Personalism in Theology\. __Brunner’s theology of God and Christ is deeply personalistic, viewing divine attributes as reflections of God as a person\. His Christology starts inductively from scriptural testimony, emphasizing knowledge of Christ through his works and benefits, echoing Melanchthon’s emphasis\.

__Friedrich Gogarten\.__

__Influence and Themes\. __Gogarten, less known outside Germany, was an influential exponent of "secular" theology\. Influenced by Fichte, Luther, and Kierkegaard, he developed a distinctive interpretation of the I\-Thou relationship, similar in some respects to Martin Buber's formulation\. His theological critique focused on both Idealists and Barth, promoting a "theology of secularization" and defending Bultmann's "demythologizing\." 

__The Christian Understanding of the World and Secularization\. __ Gogarten's view of history rejects both subjective Idealism, which involves interpreting meaning into history, and scientific positivism, which focuses on accumulating "objective" facts\. Instead, he emphasizes that the reality of human history is constituted by interpersonal encounters with God, the individual, and the neighbor, highlighting relationships in everyday events rather than grand historical movements\. This stands against abstract moral concepts like Catholic natural law\. Gogarten's interpretation of the I\-Thou relationship shares some similarities with Martin Buber's concept but is uniquely influenced by the biblical Creation account, emphasizing human existence between and in relation to the Creator and neighbor\. He distinguishes this from the autonomous self, contrasting the solitary I with the Thou\-I of biblical encounters, thus prioritizing the other—both God and community—as central\. __Being\. __Gogarten further elaborates concepts of being \(Sein\), focusing on being\-from\-the\-other \(Von\-dem\-Ander\-sein\), where individuals derive their being through relationships, and being\-with\-the\-other \(Mit\-dem\-Andern\-sein\), where genuine life involves communion with others\. This framework opposes a self\-centered existence \(An\-und\-für\-sich\-sein\), rejecting individualism and subjectivism\. Over time, his terminoloy shifts from the "I\-Thou relationship" to "responsibility," positing that secularization is the authentic outcome of Christianity's radical historicizing of human existence, equating to humanity's responsibility for the world\. He distinguishes secularization, seen as humanity's adulthood and freedom from but responsibility for the world, from secularism, which he describes as an idolatrous sense of responsibility to worldly powers and ideologies, representing a surrender of freedom aligned with the "this world" of the New Testament\. __Christian Faith\. __In the context of Christian faith, Gogarten introduces a new understanding of human responsibility, where faith, called forth by God, inspires responsive obedience\. This involves a sense of sonship and the concept of being a son of God, applicable to believers in and through Christ, which includes a new relationship to the world characterized by Lordship\. This Lordship implies not being of the world but being responsible for it, ensuring it remains aligned with God's creation\. Additionally, it presents a unique gift of freedom, characterizing sonship and Lordship as existing from the world while being the image of God, belonging to God in freedom\. 

__The Historicizing of Human Existence\. __Gogarten applies Luther's two realms of faith and works, suggesting faith – although not intruding in \(the works of\) science and reaon \- should inform the limits of reason\. This dominion is partial and does not pertain all of existence, which is secularism \(being responsible for the whole world\)\. 

__Demythologizing and History\. __Gogarten asserts that biblical events, while not historically factual in the scientific sense, are "Acts of God" that are suprahistorical and thus not subject to direct investigation\. Bultmann employs historical criticism to analyze the *weltanschauung* of the New Testament, distinguishing between its mythological Weltbild and the kerygma, or preaching about Jesus as the Christ\. Gogarten challenges the notion of God acting "objectively" in history, seeing it as both a historical and theological issue\. He aligns with Luther in emphasizing that faith should focus on God's intention for humanity as revealed in biblical facts, rather than on objectively verified facts\. True faith, according to Gogarten, aligns with this divine intention\. The modern secular world and the Bible share an understanding of the *geschichtlichkeit*, or historicity, of human existence, rather than an essential metaphysical conception\. Thus, Bultmann's task of historical criticism remains relevant, yet Gogarten argues for a deeper understanding of the historical\-theological task\. He posits that God's action occurs within the life of the concrete historical person, emphasizing the *geschichtlichkeit* of human existence\. This occurs as kerygma, an ever\-present proclamation, not as a report of past events\. While faith is not subjective, as it involves confrontation with the Word of God from beyond oneself, it does create a new historical mode of being in the world: transforming from *being\-from\-the\-world* to *being\-with\-the\-other*\.

__Gogarten and Harvey Cox\. __Harvey Cox's "The Secular City" builds on Gogarten's view of secularization, highlighting the biblical worldview's role in disenchantment, desacralization, and deconsecration\. While Cox presents a modern urban, technological ethos positively, Gogarten's perspective sees Christianity as offering prophetic insight into this context\.

__Chapter Four: The Theologies of Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer__

__The Development of Karl Barth's Theology\. __Barth's theology underwent significant development between 1922 and 1930 as he sought to eliminate existential philosophical presuppositions and create a theology independent of external philosophical or anthropological influences\. His pivotal work, *Kirchliche Dogmatik*, emphasizes the centrality of the Church in theology, distancing itself from the overly broad use of "Christian\." Barth was influenced by Anselm, advocating that theology must originate from the beliefs of the Confessing Church: true understanding emerges when the literal scriptural text and its meaning converge\. While his earlier *Römerbrief* emphasized a dialectical revelation, his later works incorporate more realism, though the dialectical nature continues with a distinctive use of theological analogy\.

__Political Theology and Christian Social Ethics\. __Barth actively opposed theologians who supported the Nazi regime, including separating from some within the *Zwischen die Zeiten* group and challenging the "German Christians" who endorsed racist ideologies and anti\-Semitism\. His influential work, *Theologische Existenz Heute*, was even sent to Hitler, outlining his critical stance\. In 1933, Barth, alongside Niemöller, organized opposition to the "German Christians\." His authorship of the Barmen Declaration in 1934 marked a theological stand against idolatrous political ideologies, stressing the sovereignty of Jesus Christ's word\. The Declaration's six articles articulate key positions: Christ as the sole source of divine authority, rejection of doctrines attributing areas of life to lords other than Christ, opposition to anti\-Semitic teachings, reinforcement of church authority within its ministry, critique of state absolutism while acknowledging both Church and State fall under God's Word\. Besides secular utilitarianism/calculationism, it was also against the Roman Catholic concept of natural law, Brunner’s natural theology, and Gogarten’s “order of creation\.” 

__Ethical Framework and Theological Ethics\. __Barth’s ethical framework rejects the possibility of understanding God outside divine revelation in Jesus Christ, insisting that knowledge of God derives from God alone\. According to Barth, ethics are not abstract principles but continuously new insights emerging from the concrete hearing of Christ’s Word in every context, constituting Barth's concept of ethical actualism, as opposed to situation ethics\. This view stands against formulating broad theological stances on social or political matters \(“before God everything is impure, therefore, nothing is especially impure”\), instead advocating for a church free of ideologies to communicate a unique message of freedom and justice in the world\. Barth maintained that theological ethics are guided not by circumstances but by God's gracious word\.

__The Major Themes of Barth's Church Dogmatics__

__The Doctrine of the Word of God and Interpretation\. __Barth outlines the Word of God as a singular reality manifesting in three forms: revealed in Jesus Christ, written in Holy Scripture, and proclaimed by the Church\. The first form is the source for the latter two, which are human activities\. Barth rejects a presuppositionless objectivity in biblical exegesis, advocating instead for a distinctive theological approach with two presuppositions: 1\) the remembrance of how the Church has historically heard God's Word through the Bible, and 2\) the expectation that the reader will also hear God's Word\. This approach necessitates surrendering human autonomy, recognizing that biblical interpretation is not an equal dialogue but a subordination to the prophetic and apostolic testimony\. Biblical interpretation involves three stages: understanding the literal words of Scripture through literary\-historical methods, reflecting on Scripture’s declarations, and employing a scheme of thought driven by the text itself\. __The Christological Concentration\. __In the *Römerbrief*, Barth focused on the "Whole Otherness" of God, but the *Church Dogmatics* marks a shift towards a Christological concentration\. God and humanity cannot be understood apart from Christ, making Christ central to theological understanding\. Christ is the sole foundation and objective of creation, framing anthropology; creation isn't the work of *Deus Absconditus*, but the work of God as manifested in Christ\. Christ, not Adam, is the human prototype, affirming a positive relationship between creation and God, as sin and evil embody ontological impossibilities nullified by the eternal covenant in Christ\. __Doctrine of Election\. __Traditionally, Reformed theology views election as predating Christ and shrouded in mystery, involving double predestination as by the *Deus Absconditus*\. Barth reconceives this by positioning Christ as both the "electing God" and the "elected human\." In Jesus Christ, God commits Himself to humanity, enduring rejection while electing humanity to share in divine glory\. This doctrine involves double predestination within Christ alone: God elects Himself for rejection and death \(God's NO to Christ\) and chooses sinful humanity for election and eternal life \(God's YES to humanity\)\. Here, Jesus Christ is both the elect and the reprobate for all humanity, conceptualizing predestination as the "non\-rejection of man\." This interpretation emphasizes the triumph of grace, but some critique it for potentially diminishing the seriousness of evil and divine judgment and limiting human freedom\. 

__The Reception and Critique of Barth's Theology\. __Barth's influence on theology was profound, yet he remains a contentious figure subject to continual scrutiny and criticism\. His work is often misunderstood or caricatured, partly due to his shifts in theological direction, his polemical style, and the sheer scale of his Church Dogmatics, which many critics do not fully engage with\. __Criticism of Theology and Philosophy\. __One primary criticism concerns the relationship between theology and philosophy\. Barth's concept of "divine actualism" portrays humans as passive and God as the sole active agent in the event of revelation\. Critics argue that revelation is mediated through finite, human means, suggesting that philosophy and science should play a larger role in theological discourse, a point emphasized by theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg\. __Criticism of Revelation and History\. __Another critique targets the relationship between revelation and history\. Barth's notion of "sacred history," or *Heilsgeschichte*, blends the supernatural and miraculous with historical events, discernible only through faith\. Critics like R\. R\. Niebuhr question whether such a view strips events like the resurrection of their revelatory power, arguing that revealing history must meaningfully engage with empirical reality\. __Criticism of the Relationship Between God and the World\. __Finally, Barth faces criticism for his portrayal of the dialectical relationship between God and the world\. His focus on God's prevenient action in Christ is said to undervalue human agency and fails to adequately explain the continuity of God's revealing activity within the world\. These critiques underscore tension in Barth's theology regarding divine action and human engagement with the divine narrative\.

__Dietrich Bonhoeffer\. __

__Early Life and Theological Development\. __Bonhoeffer studied under Adolf Harnack but maintained independence from liberal theology\. During his time at Union Theological Seminary in New York, he was deeply affected by the racial injustices faced by black Americans, which informed his social activism upon returning to Germany\. He preached against idolatrous leadership and Hitler, which led to his ban from teaching in 1936\. His seminal work, The Cost of Discipleship \(*Die Nachfolge*\), was published in 1937\. In 1938, he was expelled from Berlin and began connecting with leaders of the conspiracy against Hitler\. By 1940, Bonhoeffer was forbidden from public speaking, and his involvement with the resistance led to his arrest in 1943\. Following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944, evidence of his involvement surfaced, leading to his execution on April 9, 1945\. __Bonhoeffer's Early Writings and Relationship with Karl Barth\. __Bonhoeffer's *Sanctorum Communio* integrates theology, drawn from Barth, with sociological insights from Weber and Troeltsch to develop an ecclesiology that highlights the social character of the Church with profound theological implications\. He argues that Christian concepts like sin are only comprehensible within the social context of the Church\. Bonhoeffer was critical of grounding theology in Neo\-Kantian epistemology, like Barth's revelation focus, or in existential situations, like Heidegger and Bultmann, advocating instead for a view of "Christ existing as community\." This approach emphasizes the role of the Church as a collective person in mediating God's love through Jesus Christ\. In *Act and Being*, Bonhoeffer critiques transcendentalism, pointing to the danger of God's otherness overshadowing His presence and freedom for humanity\. He challenges the ontological perspectives that objectify God within institutional frameworks, insisting instead that the Church is the manifestation of Christ's existence in community\. __Critique and Relationship with Karl Barth\. __While Barth was a mentor, Bonhoeffer critiqued his views, particularly Barth's emphasis on God's complete otherness and actualism, which, he felt, undermined the continuity between God and humanity\. Bonhoeffer argued for a view where God's presence and aseity are realized through vicarious action, being "for others" in Jesus Christ within the Church\. He affirmed the *finitum incapax infinit* but gave it a Lutheran twist: in Christ, the finite becomes capable of containing the infinite\.

__The Christological Concentration\. __

Bonhoeffer's Christology is founded on the notion of Christ as a living presence today, manifest in word, sacrament, and community, affirming His historical and social presence\. This contemporaneity requires acknowledgment of Jesus as fully human and fully God, embodied in the God\-man, Jesus Christ\. The scandal and offense of the cross represent the form of the incarnation, witnessed in Christ’s humiliation\. Both the humiliation and exaltation of Christ are to be understood together as veiling yet revealing modes of God's existence in the incarnate, crucified one, underscoring the truth of the Chalcedonian formula\. These aspects pose challenges not only to historical scholarship but also to Church proclamation, which often separates the present\-historical Christ from the historical Jesus of Nazareth \(e\.g\., Christ’s sinlessness, empty tomb, and miracles\)\. __Discipleship and Ethics\. __Bonhoeffer rejects the Lutheran "two realms" doctrine, promoting engagement with the world for its betterment rather than dual allegiance or withdrawal\. The *Cost of Discipleship* outlines true discipleship through the Sermon on the Mount and counters a Lutheran tendency to sever justification from discipleship, warning against "cheap grace\." He asserts that grace is costly, requiring followers to abandon worldly ties and endure adversity, emphasizing conformity to Christ's image not as an aspirational ideal but as Christ's form seeking manifestation in believers\. When we are assimilated to the form of Christ in its entirety, we have recovered our true humanity lost in the fall\. Concerning ethics, Bonhoeffer shifted from passive to active resistance against the Nazi regime, advocating for a Christian presence that affirms Christ's lordship over all aspects of life without dividing faith and worldliness\. __The World of Age and a Religionless Christianity\. __Bonhoeffer critiques the immaturity in Christian dependency on metaphysical abstractions and individualistic practices centered on personal salvation\. He argues that God should not be viewed as a metaphysical hypothesis or psychological stopgap, but instead as encountered in the concrete, communal life of love and service\. This approach advocates a "this\-worldly" transcendence, where God's presence is found in the tangible reality of living for others\. Despite proposing a nonreligious Christianity, Bonhoeffer insists on retaining the Church's cultic practices and traditional doctrines as part of the "secret discipline," preserving Christian identity through humility and silence from an indifferent public\. __Bonhoeffer's Legacy\. __Bonhoeffer's *Letters from Prison* and *Nachfolge* are among his most influential works, sustaining interest in his theological approach, particularly his "Christology from below" and theology of the crucified God, later explored by theologians like Moltmann and Jüngel\. His legacy persists as a challenging yet illuminating voice in modern theological and ethical discourse\.

__Chapter Seven: The New Theology and Transcendental Thomism\.__

Thomas Aquinas was declared the official philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church, leading to the dominance of Neo\-Scholasticism, which schools were required to teach\. However, the *nouvelle théologie* emerged as a response, emphasizing the study of the "historical" Thomas as a theologian influenced by Neo\-Platonism and Augustinianism, rather than the philosophical and Aristotelian Thomas\. This new perspective portrayed Thomas as using an a priori approach to knowledge and faith\. __Neo\-Scholasticism as a Phenomenon of Modernity\. __Neo\-Scholasticism aimed to counter naturalism, deism, and Romanticism by establishing a rational foundation for supernatural revelation\. It distinguished natural theology from revelation, viewing grace as distinct from nature and stressing the importance of reason over subjective feelings, with nature conceived as a closed system\. __Henri de Lubac and the Nouvelle Théologie\. __Henri de Lubac played a key role in the revival of Catholic theology during the 1940s and 1950s in France, marked by renewed interest in patristic theology\. His work, particularly "Le Súrnaturel," argued for the integral relationship between nature and grace, challenging the Neo\-Scholastic dualism and impacting the nexus between culture, apologetics, and theology\. __Interpretation of the Senses of Scripture\. __The nouvelle théologie promoted the integration of Scripture's spiritual and literal senses, reflecting the unity of nature and grace\. It emphasized the interdependence and dynamic continuity of the literal, allegorical, moral, and analogical senses, arguing that no single interpretation exhausts Scripture's richness\.

__Karl Rahner,__ a Jesuit theologian, explored metaphysics and epistemology in works like "Spirit in the World" and "Hearers of the Word," questioning how humans can know the metaphysical, specifically God, who transcends sensory perception\. Influenced by Thomas Aquinas and Dionysius, Rahner emphasized the analogy of being, proposing that human intellect understands its limits and yearns for what transcends the world\. In "Hearers of the Word," Rahner develops this into a philosophy of religion that views revelation as a transcendental experience beyond mere propositional knowledge\. __The Religious Dimension of Human Experience\. __Rahner mirrored Schleiermacher by situating human self\-transcendence as pointing toward the *whither* \(rather than *whence*\) of existence, an absolute mystery\. His method of correlation investigates the relationship between transcendental human experiences and historical meaning\. __The Supernatural Existential\. __Rahner's theology sees human nature as historically and concretely created with a supernatural existential goal, characterized by an innate, pre\-reflective orientation toward the divine \(pre\-apprehension\)\. This framework interprets human experience and revelation through a historical lens, applying the concept existentially to humans, distinct from nature\. __Revelation as Transcendental and as Categorical\. __Transcendental revelation refers to the innate capacity for God's presence and grace, exemplified in "anonymous Christians" who exhibit implicit religiosity\. Categorical revelation concretizes and historicizes this divine grace\. __Rahner's Theological Method\. __Rahner's theological method prominently features a "method of correlation," which draws a comparison to Paul Tillich's approach\. Tillich posits that "the ambiguities of being, reason, existence, history, and life give rise to the questions that find their correlation in the symbols of God, revelation, Christ, the Kingdom, and Spirit\." In contrast, Rahner centers his method of correlation not on these ambiguities, but on the experience of divine grace present within the human experience of self\-transcendence\. __The Symbol\.__ Rahner distinguishes real symbols from mere signs, considering them expressions and actualizations of reality\. In this view, creation is God's self\-communication, with Jesus Christ as the pinnacle of such expression\. This notion extends to the Trinity, Incarnation, anthropology, salvation history, the Church, and anonymous Christianity, presenting Christianity as a universal symbol of God's grace\. Rahner's integration of anthropology, theology, and Christology raises critical issues within his broader theological framework\.

__Edward Schillebeeckx, __a Dominican theologian, began his career with a phenomenological approach, emphasizing personal experience in theological exploration\. __Sacramental Theology\. __Schillebeeckx viewed sacraments as personal communion between God and individuals, translating traditional scholastic concepts of causality into a more experiential and phenomenological account and their efficacy\. His approach is decidedly more personalistic, focusing on encounter, rather than the mechanical and causal views characteristic of scholastic traditions\. __Jesus as Eschatological Prophet\. __Schillebeeckx transitioned from a phenomenological approach to historical, hermeneutical, and political methods, largely due to the insights from the study of the Historical Jesus\. He emphasized the importance of history and interpretation over starting with phenomena\. His work traces four historical creeds: 1\) the maranatha/parousia creed focusing on Jesus's proclamation of God's reign; 2\) the divine man creed emphasizing Jesus's miracles; 3\) Jesus as a teacher of wisdom; and 4\) the Easter creed \(Paul\) starting with Jesus's death and resurrection\. __Method of Correlation\. __The double correlation method adopted by Schillebeeckx is patterned on the Thomistic analogy of proportion, which differs from the stronger similitude in the analogy of attribution\. This approach examines how early Christians' faith and experiences relate proportionally to __their__ cultural context, offering parallels to the relationship between contemporary Christianity and __current__ cultural settings\. __The Conflict over Ministry\. __Schillebeeckx's book *Ministry: Leadership in the Community of Jesus Christ* sparked controversy within the Roman Catholic Church\. He identified a significant shift in ministry understanding from the first to the second millennium\. Due to the current priest shortage, he advocated that laypersons should be allowed to perform the Eucharist, reflecting early Christian practices as noted by Tertullian\. He discussed historical shifts from functional and ministerial roles to more cultic and ontological understandings, and from a model of equal discipleship to a hierarchical church resulting from Christianity becoming a state church\.

__Chapter Eight\. Vatican II and the Aggiornamento of Roman Catholic Theology\.__

__Hans Urs von Balthasar\.__ 

__Analogy of Being and Karl Barth\. __Von Balthasar agreed with Karl Barth's critique of Liberal Protestantism due to its turn toward the subject\. However, he diverged on Barth's rejection of the analogy of being, which Barth viewed as a fundamental Roman Catholic principle, considering it the invention of the anti\-Christ\. For von Balthasar, there is a correlation between natural and supernatural realms, as highlighted by the *nouvelle théologie* and Henri de Lubac\. God's creation establishes a relational foundation for communion between God and humanity, which is the basis for the analogy of being\. __Theological Aesthetics\. __Von Balthasar proposed aesthetics as a point of contact with Christianity for positivists and atheists\. __From Theo\-Drama to Theo\-Logic\. __In his works, the theodrama spans the Triduum of Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday, asserting that these events deeply affect God's very being\. The theodrama is grounded in the idea that God acts to embrace the tragedy of human existence\. Von Balthasar employs aesthetic categories such as Gestalt, form, and symbol, as well as concepts of play, role, and narrative, rendering the dramatic structure as Trinitarian: the Father as author, the Son as actor, and the Spirit as director, with humanity playing its part within the divine drama in response to God\-given missions and callings\. Theo\-Logic deals with truth and complements the exploration of the beautiful \(__Theological Aesthetics__\), the good \(__Theodrama__\), and the truth \(__Theo\-Logic__\)\. God's kenosis in Christ's crucifixion is a manifestation of love, referred to as *analogia caritatis*, revealing the beauty, goodness, and truth of reality\.

__Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger\.__

__From Church as People of God to Church as Body of Christ\. __Ratzinger argues that Christians should not be understood merely as the People of God, as this perspective inadequately reflects the Christological and sacramental dimensions of the Church\. Instead, he emphasizes the Church as the Body of Christ\. __The Optimism and Modernism of Vatican II\. __Ratzinger critiques *Gaudium et Spes*, asserting that it views the Church and the world as counterparts, leading to a portrayal of the Church as a closed entity with a ghetto mentality\. He criticizes Vatican II's call for solidarity with humanity and cooperation with the world as excessively accommodating and optimistic\. __Theology of the Cross or Theology of Incarnation\. __Favoring Bonaventure and Augustine over Thomas Aquinas, Ratzinger emphasizes the distinction between the theology of incarnation and the theology of the cross\. The Theology of Incarnation, associated with Rahner and Teilhard de Chardin, proposes that grace perfects nature, leading to a static, optimistic view of human sin as minor\. In contrast, the Theology of the Cross emphasizes the disparity between worldly wisdom, seen as folly, and divine wisdom\. Ratzinger argues that the Theology of the Cross urges a dynamic, anti\-world conception of Christianity, viewing it as a continual challenge to human self\-assurance, including the Church itself\. He believes both theological perspectives should be considered as correcting polarities\. __Religious Pluralism and Moral Relativism\.__ Following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Ratzinger moved his critique from liberation theology and Marxist ideology to moral relativism\. He identifies relativism as the philosophical underpinning of democracy, asserting that it “not only robs faith of its claim to truth, but does not provide a vision of human dignity that should be the foundation of democracy\.”

__Chapter Nine\. Political Theology and Latin American Liberation Theologies\.__

__Political Theology\.__

__The Post\-World War II Context\. __Political theology emerged in Germany after World War II, emphasizing a future orientation, hope for societal transformation, and the public impact of religion\. Johann B\. Metz and Jürgen Moltmann, both of whom experienced the war as teenagers, share common features in their work\. These include their interpretation of religion's cultural and social positioning, critiques of earlier twentieth\-century theologies, and a retrieval and application of eschatology to social and political life\. Two significant currents influenced political theology: the retrieval of biblical eschatology, as seen in the work of Ernst Käsemann, and the push for churches to engage in social and political critique, advocated by Ernst Bloch\. __Interpretation of the Situation: The Privatization of Religion\. __The impact of technocratic rationalism, which objectifies nature, and market capitalism, which reduces religion to a market commodity, is critiqued\. These forces lead to the privatization and reification of religion\. The result is that the Christian religion is dismissed as the integrating center of modern society, relieved of its duty to represent society's highest goals\. __The Critique of a Dominant Existential Theology\. __Moltmann challenges the subjectification of individuals \(as seen in Bultmann's theology\) and of God \(as in Barth's viewpoint\), along with the two\-kingdom doctrine, which failed to resist Nazism\. Metz also critiques Rahner's transcendental theology for its inability to address critical political issues, such as the Holocaust\. __The Emphasis on Eschatology\. __Both Metz and Moltmann place eschatology at the center of their theological frameworks\. They view the promise inherent in eschatology as a commitment that requires action, highlighting its performative nature and its implications for the future of history\.

__Johann Metz__ initially sought to interpret secularization in a positive light but later viewed it negatively as privatization of religion\. He emphasized the freedom and autonomy of individuals in the modern world, attributing the desacralization of nature and the rise of modern technology to Christian belief in the goodness of creation\. __Political Theology as Fundamental Theology\. __Metz developed political theology as a practical fundamental theology focused on the "subject," which he insisted must not be separated from social and political contexts, unlike transcendental theology\. He highlighted the correlation between the ideas of God and the human subject, viewing the "subject" not as an isolated individual but as a member of a community before God\. Thus, the subject is religiously and socially constituted, situating political theology as a form of fundamental theology\. __The Critique of Bourgeois Religion\. __Metz argued that by engaging with the suffering and poverty of the Third World, churches within bourgeois society could overcome their own bourgeois obsessions\. He advocated for a "church" of the people, as opposed to a capital\-C "Church" of the people, aligning with Latin American liberation theologians' focus on base communities\. This vision promotes a polycentric church that moves beyond institutional constraints to become a "basic\-community church\." __The Memory of Suffering and the Holocaust\. __Metz's narrative theology does not seek simplistic explanations, easy reconciliations, or theoretical solutions to suffering\. Instead, it retains the memory of suffering and amplifies the voices of victims, providing a critical and dangerous memory that challenges the present\. __Assessment: Political without Politics\. __Initially, Metz faced criticism for allegedly recreating a union between church and state\. Later critiques, particularly from liberation theologians, pointed out that his political theology lacked clear political stances and did not develop a comprehensive political ethics\.

__Jürgen Moltmann\.__

__Promise and Hope\. __Moltmann, in his "Theology of Hope," challenges previous theological views that understood God as an "epiphany of eternal presence," proposing instead that revelation is a promise and history constitutes a mission\. He contrasts the Greek worldview, which places a transcendent, unchangeable God above worldly suffering, with the faith of Israel, in which God accompanies his people and fulfills historical promises\. For Moltmann, eschatology serves as the universal horizon of all Christian theology, establishing that the death and resurrection of Jesus are crucial because they affirm God's faithfulness to promises and anticipate the eschatological new creation\. __The Crucified God and the Doctrine of the Trinity\. __Eight years after "Theology of Hope," Moltmann published "The Crucified God," in which the crucifixion of Jesus becomes the decisive event and criterion for his theology\. It marks a shift from emphasizing God's eschatological promise to highlighting God's suffering solidarity with human suffering, while maintaining a critique of political religion\. In "The Trinity and the Kingdom of God," Moltmann presents a Trinitarian understanding that integrates the immanent and economic Trinity, asserting that the crucifixion and resurrection are not external to the Trinity but internal to the divine life itself, __constituting__ the Trinitarian relations\. He challenges Greek influences that deny God's capacity for change and suffering: “God suffers in God's very self\. God's love is not simply a giving generosity that flows in one direction; rather, God's love is such that it is affected by God's Creation, by its history, and by God's involvement in the history of Creation\.” Because God’s very self is constituted by the relationships of equality and love \(the social Trinity\), God’s relation to the world is not one of dominion, countering monotheism that might justify political domination and suppression\. God's love is dynamic, deeply affected by creation, and the Cross illustrates God's loving solidarity with suffering, demonstrating a dialectical panentheistic view in which God embraces even the godless\. “God does not merely enter into the finitude of men and women; he enters into the situation of their sin and God\-forsakenness as well\. … To recognize God in the cross of Christ means to recognize the cross, inextricable suffering, death, and hopeless rejection in God\.” __Later Works\. __In "The Way of Jesus Christ: Christology in Messianic Dimensions," Moltmann focuses more on the life of Jesus and discipleship\. "The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology" ties earlier themes from the "Theology of Hope" to classic eschatological issues like death, immortality, and resurrection, and addresses various forms of millenarianism while affirming the universality of salvation\. __Critical Issues\. __Moltmann faced criticism from liberal theologians who viewed his eschatology as overly transcendent, advocating instead for a more realized eschatology\. Rahner critiqued Moltmann's affirmation of God's suffering for not resolving the problem of theodicy\. By incorporating suffering into God's very self, Moltmann could be seen as valorizing suffering\.

__Latin American Liberation Theology\.__

__The Context: From Development to Liberation\. __Developmentalism aimed to push Third\-World countries toward economic, industrial, social, and cultural growth\. However, it failed to tackle the fundamental causes of problems and did not lead to institutional reform\. As gradual reform proved ineffective, Liberation Theology emerged, advocating not conservative or developmentalist/evolutionary changes but rather revolutionary, radical social and economic transformation\. __Interpretation of the Situation: Dependency\. __Liberation theology views liberation as freedom from dependency conditions\. It posits that the poverty in the Southern Hemisphere stems from its dependence on Northern countries, particularly through the supply of raw materials from the South to the North\. __Previous Theology\. __Liberation theology abandons the traditional distinction between grace and nature, intertwining the Church's sociopolitical mission with its religious mission\. It also rejects the separation between clergy and laity\. __Eschatology\. __Contrary to Metz and Moltmann, liberation theology argues that the Kingdom of God should not be viewed solely as a judgmental contrast to present society and its institutions\. It criticizes their emphasis on the transcendence and otherness of the Kingdom as excessive\. Liberation theology interprets the Kingdom of God using categories that relate the imperfect present to the perfect future, suggesting that where love, peace, and justice prevail on earth, the Kingdom of God is being realized, albeit in an incomplete and imperfect manner\. It maintains that supernatural salvation perfects, rather than nullifies, the natural order\.

__Gustavo Gutiérrez\.__

__Gutiérrez's Interpretation of the Historical Jesus\. __Gutiérrez argues that Jesus's preaching, lifestyle, and eschatological message, although religious, carry political implications\. Liberation theology remains true to the historical Jesus by addressing these political dimensions without conflating religion and politics entirely\. Contrary to claims, Jesus was not part of the Zealot movement; his vision of the Kingdom of God is universal and extends beyond the narrow, nationalistic focus of the Zealots\. The gospel possesses social and political implications yet transcends political confines\. __The Nature of the Church\. __Gutiérrez sees the Church as a manifestation of God's saving plan for the world, where God's grace symbolically and explicitly resides\. Drawing parallels with Rahner's concept of anonymous Christianity, he argues that God's grace that is present in the world has its symbolic and explicit presence in the Church and in the history of salvation\. __The Meaning of Liberation and Salvation\. __In Gutiérrez's view, liberation is closely linked to salvation, with political action intertwined with religious faith\. This connection operates on three levels: religious faith \(hope\), utopian vision \(imagination\), and political action \(social analysis\)\. __Questions\. __Pannenberg raises a point that the deepest servitude and need for liberation lie in humanity's bondage to sin and death, not just social injustice, achievable only through Christ's death and faith in God and his kingdom\. Similarly, Reinhold Niebuhr's ethical realism and awareness of human sin pose a contrast to the optimistic anthropology and ethics of liberation theology, arguing it does not adequately address human sinfulness and power dynamics\.

__Juan Luis Segundo\.__

__Faith and Ideology\. __Segundo critiques Metz and Moltmann for positioning faith outside the realm of ideology\. He defines "ideology" in two ways: a neutral sense encompassing everything beyond scientific precision \(the suprascientific or superstructural realm\), and a negative sense referring to cognitive mechanisms that disguise or justify existing modes of production, benefiting those who profit from them, in line with Marxist thought\. In understanding the relationship between faith and ideology, Segundo views ideology as a person's fundamental system of values, goods, and goals\. Traditionally, faith has been contrasted or opposed to ideology in both senses\. __The Hermeneutical Circle\. __Segundo outlines four steps in his hermeneutical circle\. *First*, our way of experiencing reality, particularly the reality of the poor in Latin America, triggers ideological suspicion, which becomes the starting point for liberation theology\. *Second*, this suspicion is applied to the ideological superstructure as a whole and to theology, highlighting the class interests of the rich and powerful elite\. *Third*, there emerges a new way of experiencing theological reality, leading to exegetical suspicion of traditional biblical interpretations that have overlooked important data\. *Fourth*, a new hermeneutic is developed, which involves interpreting Scripture with new elements from the perspective of the poor and oppressed\. __A Critical Question: The Difference from Feminist Theology\. __Liberation theology begins with Scripture, albeit from a renewed perspective, while feminist theology often views the Bible with suspicion, considering it a patriarchal text that conveys "Bad News" for women\.

__Chapter Ten\. Process Theology\.__

__Background\. __Process Theology can be traced to Buddhist doctrines of becoming and the dependent origination of all things, as well as Heraclitus's concept of eternal flux and the world's constant becoming\. Influences also include the Romantic philosophy of Schelling and Hegel, which see development, process, and change as fundamental to reality\. Schelling posited that the reality of evil is irreconcilable with the notion of a perfect being as the universe's source\. 

__Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,__ a geologist and paleontologist, wrote religious works that were only published posthumously due to Church restrictions\. His notable texts include "The Phenomenon of Man," "The Divine Milieu," "Letters from a Traveller," "The Future of Man," and "Hymn of the Universe\." Teilhard proposed a creative vision harmonizing science and religion through an evolutionary theology that views the cosmos as driven by a fundamental energy undergoing development\. This continuous process unfolds through three critical stages: inorganic matter \(solidified earth crust\), life \(biosphere\), and mind \(noosphere\)\. Teilhard noted that the evolutionary process is inexorably guided toward humanity and will continue to evolve toward a higher consciousness known as *noogenesis*\. In its first, already completed, phase, is characterized by *centrifugal* forces, increasing individuality and freedom, while socialization only advanced slowly\. The second phase, characterized by *centripetal* forces, looks to foster greater communication and socialization globally, eventually leading to planetary unification and the future convergence at the Omega Point\. __Omega Point\. __The__ __Omega Point represents the culmination of the evolutionary process, where all entities attain a suprapersonal unity in God, characterized by *agape*, or self\-transcending love\. There is ambiguity regarding whether Omega Point is God or merely signifies perfect unity with God\. Omega is closely linked to the divine Logos, guiding cosmic evolution towards its ultimate goal or telos, with the incarnate Christ offering a glimpse of Omega\. Teilhard's view includes__ ambiguity__, as he shares with other Process Theologians \(cf\. Pannenberg – although not a process theologian\) the idea that the future remains open and dependent on human actions, posing a contrast to the fixed nature of Omega Point as the evolutionary endpoint\. Nonetheless, he believes God provides humanity with the lure of creative advance as a persuasive agency, emphasizing interdependence\.

__Alfred North Whitehead, __an English mathematician and philosopher, is regarded as the most significant process theologian of the 20th century\. Similar to Enlightenment rationalists who sought to align Christian theology with Newtonian cosmology, Whitehead aimed to develop theism that harmonizes with Darwinian biology and Einsteinian physics\. Later in his career, Whitehead's reflections on nature and science converged into a comprehensive metaphysical philosophy, articulated in works like "Science and the Modern World," "Religion in the Making," "Symbolism, Its Meaning and Effect," "Process and Reality" \(his magnum opus\), and "Adventures in Ideas\." Whitehead's thought centers on viewing time and process as essential to all __reality__\. Reality is dynamic, organic, and social, rather than static and discrete\. He describes process as the movement of interrelated and interdependent entities and societies, termed "concrescence"—the growing together of diverse entities into a complex unity\. Whitehead identifies four key factors in his metaphysical framework: 

1. __Creativity__: The world advances to novelty; creativity itself is not an entity but becomes real through the actual entities exemplifying it\.
2. __Actual Entities__: These are the final components of the world\. They appropriate or "prehend" the past, realize their own unique subjective form or aim, and eventually perish, becoming an objective datum for other entities\.
3. __Eternal Objects/Pure Potentials__: These are abstractions from concrete objects, serving as potentials actualized in the world\. For example, a color might be an eternal object\.
4. __God__: Although God is an actual entity, God is everlasting and immutable, grounding eternal objects in actuality and providing actual entities with their initial aim\. God cannot be fully known\.

Whitehead's notion of God is dipolar, consisting of *primordial* and *consequent* natures\. The primordial nature involves the conceptual structure that orders and grades eternal objects\. The consequent nature concerns how God is affected by the world's concrete entities\. According to Whitehead, the creation of the world necessitates interdependence with God\. God is viewed not as the creator in the traditional sense but as the savior of the world\. Finite actual entities achieve a kind of objective immortality in God, granted freedom to reject this, as God is not omnipotent\. __Assessment of Whitehead's Theism\. __Whitehead posits the real potentiality of God, marking a complete departure from traditional theism, which views God as pure actuality\. In Whitehead's view, God is not the absolute efficient cause of the world but is seen as a creator due to the immanence of his primordial nature in the world, serving as the principle of its order and purpose\.

__Chapter Eleven\. History and Hermeneutics__

__Common Threads\. __

This chapter explores common threads in the fields of history and hermeneutics, highlighting three key areas of development\. *First*, there is a reaction against the "individualism" found in existential philosophy and theology, signaling a shift towards collective and historical perspectives\. *Second*, there is a focus on history, tradition, and interpretation, challenging the devaluation of history seen in Neo\-Orthodoxy\. Hermeneutical theories developed by Gadamer and Ricoeur serve to broaden, expand, and correct the existential interpretations previously advocated by Bultmann\. *Third*, there is a noticeable change in philosophical mentors\. While Neo\-Orthodoxy, represented by Barth and Bultmann, drew on Søren Kierkegaard, thinkers like Pannenberg and Gadamer turned to Hegel for their understanding of history, reflecting a shift toward more historical and dialectical approaches\.

__Wolfhart Pannenberg\.__

Wolfhart Pannenberg, who studied with Karl Barth and was influenced by Gerhard von Rad, taught alongside Jürgen Moltmann\.  __Revelation as History\. __In "Revelation as History," Pannenberg, along with other post\-WWII theologians, emphasizes the role of history in theology\. This marks a shift from the Neo\-Orthodox focus on the Word, proclamation, and kerygma to understanding history as the furthest horizon of Christian theology\. God's history with humanity and the whole of creation is oriented toward a future that remains hidden but is revealed in Jesus Christ\. Pannenberg’s contribution, "Dogmatic Theses on the Doctrine of Revelation," outlines seven key ideas: 

1. God's self\-revelation is not direct, like a theophany, but indirect and is brought about through God's acts in history\.
2. It is at the end rather than at the beginning of history that divine revelation is completely comprehended\.
3. Historical revelation is open for all to see and has a universal character\.
4. The universal revelation of God's Deity is anticipated in the fate of Jesus\.
5. The Christ event is part of God's history with Israel\.
6. The formulation of revelation in the Gentile Christian Church brings to actual expression the universality of God's eschatological vindication of Jesus\.
7. The Word relates itself to revelation as foretelling, forthtelling, and report\.

Pannenberg’s theses are controversial, emphasizing the indirectness and universal openness of revelation and the universality of history\. This creates a tension: while history is already anticipated in Jesus’s fate, it remains open\-ended, understood only at its conclusion\. 

__The Resurrection of Jesus Christ: Historical and Retroactive\. __Pannenberg identifies four elements concerning the resurrection\. *First*, the historical demonstrability of the resurrection, visible to those receptive to it\. *Second*, the historicity of the resurrection, which is more than a kerygmatic event and roots the kerygma in historical fact, supported by the convergence of traditions about the empty tomb and resurrection appearances\. *Third*, the retrospective nature of the resurrection regarding Jesus's Sonship, indicating Jesus was the Son of God from the start, emphasizing his oneness with God from the perspective of his resurrection, countering the kenosis theology\. *Fourth*, the proleptic character of the resurrection, anticipating the end of history in Jesus's resurrection\. This underscores a duality: history is inherently open and incomplete, with meaning fully manifest only at its end, but the end is also proleptically anticipated in Jesus’s fate through his resurrection, signifying God’s vindication\. __Theology as an Intellectual Discipline\. __Wolfhart Pannenberg critiques positivism for its lack of hermeneutical awareness and challenges the hermeneutics of Bultmann and Gadamer for being overly focused on expressed conceptions of truth, thereby neglecting objectivity\. He asserts that theology must begin with the affirmation of God\. He views 'God' as the 'all\-determining reality,' not directly knowable like ordinary objects, but accessible indirectly through the human anticipation of meaning\. Since history has yet to conclude, this total meaning remains open, pending confirmation or refutation\. __Anthropology as Fundamental Theology\. __With the rise of evolutionary theory and a mechanistic view of the cosmos, the universe is no longer the starting point for theology\. Anthropology takes center stage as the testing ground of truth\. Moral justifications for religion, as seen in the works of Kant \(morality\) and Schleiermacher \(human experience\), along with critiques from Nietzsche, Freud, and Feuerbach, underscore the centrality of anthropology\. Pannenberg positions anthropology as fundamental theology, focusing on human history and its openness\. He emphasizes that self\-fulfillment through self\-perfection is impossible and that humans are directed toward divine providence within history, a concept known as *Weltoffenheit*\. *Weltoffenheit* indicates that humans find no ultimate satisfaction in their experiences and creations, bringing forth the question of God's connection to human existence, not as proof of God but as an inseparable inquiry tied to humanity, aligning with Rahner \(pre\-apprehension\) but emphasizing historical orientation and human nature's incompleteness\. __Critical Issues: The Rationality of Faith\. __Pannenberg's work receives widespread ecumenical attention\. The Roman Catholic tradition appreciates his emphasis on historical evidence and philosophical demonstration\. In contrast, Lutherans find his approach overly rationalistic, lacking focus on faith's role, while others criticize it as too idealistic, drawing heavily on Hegel's philosophical history\. There is an inherent tension in his theology: while it posits that history is open, the end of history is already anticipated in Jesus's resurrection, reflecting his complex view of faith and history\.

__Hans\-Georg Gadamer\.__

__The Critique of Historicism and Romanticism\. __Gadamer critiques the historicism of Leopold von Ranke, which treats history as an empirical and objective science grounded in historical facts\. Gadamer argues that Hegel more accurately understands the historian's involvement in history\. He also challenges Schleiermacher's hermeneutics, which overly emphasizes the author's intention and assigns a psychological task to interpretation\. Gadamer posits that the human sciences should be approached through the traditional concept of Bildung—formation and education—rather than modern ideals aligned with the scientific method\. Influenced by Heidegger's concept of "facticity" or "there\-ness" \(Dasein\) of human existence, Gadamer maintains that our identity and possibilities of being are fundamentally connected to our self\-understanding\. __Recasting the Hermeneutical Circle\. __Drawing on Heidegger's concept of Dasein, Gadamer suggests that individuals are born into specific historical constellations that shape their existential possibilities and meanings\. This leads to a hermeneutical circle, in which interpretation operates with a forestructure—a pre\-understanding influenced by our life experiences\. Every interpretation contributing to understanding requires a pre\-existing life\-relation to the subject matter\. This pre\-understanding echoes Rahner's idea of pre\-apprehension, an innate orientation to the divine\. __Hermeneutics of Belonging: Key Concepts\. __Gadamer introduces "*the Classic*," a concept for works that are historically situated yet timeless, enduring, and capable of making claims across ages\. The concept of *Wirkungsgeschichte*, or effective history, emphasizes that a classic influences history through its continued relevance, providing a more nuanced, historical view of Heidegger's concept of pre\-understanding\. The King James Version or the American Declaration of Independence are examples of such classics\. *The fusion of horizons* involves stepping out of one's perspective to engage with the original author or historical situation\. __Self\-Understanding, the New Testament, and Marburg Theology\. __Gadamer argues that "demythologizing" neither theologian's interpretations nor biblical texts guarantees an accurate understanding\. The true *event* of understanding transcends methodical efforts and self\-awareness\. Through genuine dialogue, new insights emerge beyond what individuals consciously recognize and control\.

__Paul Ricoeur\.__

__Phenomenology and the Symbols of Evil\. __Ricoeur explores two main approaches: the hermeneutics of *suspicion* and the hermeneutics of *retrieval*\. The hermeneutics of suspicion is a regressive path moving from an overt meaning to uncover hidden meanings rooted in unconscious desires, while the hermeneutics of retrieval focuses on reappropriating meaning\. This dual motivation involves a willingness to suspect versus a willingness to listen, balancing a vow of rigor with a vow of obedience, and navigating between idols and symbols\. In this framework, ideology provides a symbolic justification of the past, whereas utopia represents a symbolic opening toward the future\. __The Hermeneutical Turn: From Symbol to Metaphor\. __In "The Rule of the Metaphor," Ricoeur examines how metaphors play a crucial role in language by creating new meanings within human discourse, requiring philosophical language for comprehension\. Metaphors possess emotive value and also __create meaning__, highlighting their creative role\. For instance, Jesus's parables create a shock that generates new meaning, offering a radical vision that subverts conventional views\. __Hermeneutics of Objectification: Key Concepts\.__ Ricoeur discusses how discourse, when *objectified* as a text, becomes analyzable independently of its original context\. Writing separates the event from its meaning, facilitating the analysis of texts \(which comprise all cultural productions\)\. He introduces the concept of *distanciation*, emphasizing the text's independence from the original lived experience and enabling structural analysis to derive its sense, contrasting with Gadamer's concept of distanciation, which focuses on temporal distance and *Wirkungsgeschichte*\. __Religious Language and Forms of Discourse\. __Ricoeur views revelation as pluralistic, polysemic, and analogical due to its varied literary forms\. He criticizes Bultmann for hastily transitioning from mythical language to existential interpretation, neglecting the diverse forms of language and the surplus of meaning present\. Ricoeur's phenomenology of the sacred includes the numinous, hierophanic manifestations, myth and ritual interactions, and sacred elements of nature, which are replaced by the word, instruction, ritual repetition, and the ethical dimension in Hebraic proclamations\. __Narrative and Hermeneutics\. __For Ricoeur, narrative configures events, granting them identity through its plot, thereby constructing social and historical identities\. "Narrative refiguration" challenges the view of language as merely propositional and descriptive, emphasizing the narrative's semantic dimension\. Reception becomes crucial to the meaning of a text, and refiguration highlights narrative’s power to reveal, transform, and apply to life, bridging description \(acts\) and prescription \(ethics\)\.

__Hans Frei’s__ work, particularly his doctoral dissertation on Karl Barth and revelation, offers a critical perspective on modern theological approaches, including historical criticism, transcendental conceptions of human nature in theology, and contemporary views of correlation\. __The Critique of Modern Historical Criticism\. __Frei contends that the meaning of biblical texts arises not from external historical events but from the internal *narrative* world of the scripture itself\. He critiques the use of historical criticism, which wasemployed by Enlightenment rationalism and Christian apologetics\. Unlike the historical\-critical methodology, Protestant Reformers used the literal sense of Scripture to perceive Christ in all of Scripture by unifying biblical narratives to form a comprehensive narrative\. Frei advocates for a return to pre\-modern and Protestant interpretative methods, arguing that Scripture reading does not necessitate expert analysis to understand its meaning\. __Narrative and Identity\. __Central to Frei's thesis is that narrative is crucial to the Christian interpretation of Scripture\. He argues that the religious, ethical, and sacramental life of the church is fundamentally derived from the narrative of Jesus—his life, teachings, death, and resurrection\. Frei criticizes both historical\-critical analysis and fundamentalist biblical literalism for misunderstanding the identity between written text and actual referents\. His emphasis on reading scripture within the church context leads him to focus on the literal, plain meaning of texts\. When engaging with the Gospels, the pertinent inquiry shifts from their accuracy to the identity and character of Jesus as indicated by the narratives\. The Gospels, similar to novels, derive their meaning from what they describe rather than any external referent, offering an intratextual account that *refigures* Jesus's identity within the scriptural narrative\. Frei identifies two types of identity description: intention\-action, as seen in Jesus's obedience to God's mission, and self\-manifestation, evident in Jesus's resurrection\. __Against Correlation Theology\. __Frei's critique extends to the theological use of the method of correlation and the grounding of Christian faith in general anthropology\. Unlike figures such as Pannenberg, Gadamer, and Ricoeur, Frei does not attempt to transcend or critique Neo\-Orthodox theology but rather aims to reformulate Karl Barth's theology\. He resists allowing external descriptions of Christianity to become the benchmark for internal self\-description or theological understanding, similar to Barth and Schleiermacher's approach of prioritizing Christian self\-description while accommodating a role for theology\. __Redescription and Thick Description\. __Frei envisions theology as encompassing both first\- and second\-level statements\. First\-level statements pertain to communal beliefs found in creeds and confessions, which do not encapsulate the essence of Christianity\. Second\-level statements involve the community's assessment of its language and actions under norms internal to the community\. This includes two aspects: descriptive, which articulates the internal logic or grammar of first\-level Christian statements, and critical, which appraises the success of Christian language in adhering to these norms\. For example, the Christological creedal formula of Chalcedon affirms Jesus as two persons in one nature\. Descriptively, it explains the internal logic, while critically, the formula is a response to unacceptable theological views\. The formula represents a conceptual redescription of gospel narratives that identify Jesus Christ\. "Thick Description" aims to depict a society's beliefs and practices to illuminate the logic of its identity\.

__Chapter Twelve\. Evangelical Theology\.__

This chapter examines "evangelical" as it pertains to contemporary Anglo\-American Protestantism, encompassing a spectrum of Christian churches, organizations, and groups that share specific theological commitments\. It presents evangelicalism as a cohesive entity amidst its diversity, characterized as a dynamic, transdenominational coalition unified in goals and activities\. Core convictions include: 1\) the full authority, infallibility, and sufficiency of Scripture in religious matters, a wariness towards relying solely on church tradition, reason, or personal experience; 2\) the uniqueness of salvation through Christ's substitutionary atonement; 3\) the unmerited direct gift of God's grace received through faith and personal conversion; 4\) the necessity of spiritual transformation; and 5\) the urgent need for worldwide evangelism\. __The Fundamentalist Defense of the Faith\. __Machen's "Christianity and Liberalism" is an influential reaction to liberalizing tendencies in Protestantism\. The term “evangelical” must be distinguished from Fundamentalism, which became criticized for its anti\-intellectualism, separatism, and focus on biblical apocalypticism\. __The "New Evangelicalism\." __New Evangelicalism marks a departure from older Fundamentalist views, with figures like Carl F\. Henry critiquing the fundamentalist movement's negative and loveless spirit, as well as its schismatic tendencies\. Billy Graham and institutions such as Fuller Theological Seminary, Calvin College and Seminary, Wheaton College, Gordon\-Conwell Theological Seminary, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and Regent College played significant roles in the movement\. Organizations like Youth for Christ, Young Life, Inter\-Varsity Christian Fellowship, and Campus Crusade for Christ International further illustrate the evangelical infrastructure\. __Diversity\. __The chapter highlights various evangelical theological traditions, including Southern Baptists, Dutch Reformed Confessionalists, Mennonites, Wesleyan Holiness Movement, Pentecostals, and Dispensationalists\. Evangelicalism is presented as a "third way" between Roman Catholic theology and Liberal and Neo\-Orthodox theologies\. Its broad diversity makes it challenging to identify representative theologians, yet figures like Carl F\. Henry and G\. C\. Berkouwer are noted for their enduring influence and deep engagement in ecumenical discussions\. Both are committed to a high doctrine of the Bible as the infallible standard of Christian faith and practice, and to the principal orthodox doctrines of classical Protestantism\.

__Gerrit Cornelius Berkouwer\.__

__Neo\-Calvinistic Foundations and Theological Method\.__

Gerrit Cornelius Berkouwer was a prominent figure in the neo\-Calvinistic tradition, influenced by the theological heritage of Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck at the Free University\. His theological method was rooted in the traditions of Augustine and the Reformers, emphasizing that faith precedes reason and enhances understanding\. Berkouwer stood against the 17th and 18th\-century Calvinistic Scholasticism, exemplified by figures like Francis Turretin, for its tendency to prioritize reason over faith\. He also diverged from Princeton Theology, which he felt gave undue priority to theological apologetics and rational presuppositions before faith could have its effect\. Although Berkouwer followed Kuyper and Bavinck, he rejected the analogy between natural knowledge and religious faith\. His work involved an ongoing dialogue with theologians outside his Dutch Neo\-Calvinist tradition, including Karl Barth, to whom he was somewhat sympathetic yet critical\. He also engaged with Roman Catholicism in his theological explorations\. __The Co\-relationship Between Revelation and Faith\. __Central to Berkouwer’s theology was the co\-relationship between revelation and faith\. He critiqued liberal theology for overemphasizing the subjective and existential aspects of this relationship and opposed Protestant Orthodoxy, as represented by Barth, for its exclusive focus on a purely objective and unhistorical conception of divine revelation\. Berkouwer asserted that the Bible is not merely a source of doctrinal information or objective facts; rather, it is the dynamic address and revelation of the living God, which necessitates the co\-relation of a receiving faith\. According to him, faith, coming from God, finds reality only in correlation with the divine Word or revelation\. Understanding faith as both passive, as the work of the Holy Spirit, and active, a dynamic human apprehension of divine truth, Berkouwer contended that without this co\-relationship, revelation and Scripture would risk being viewed as purely *a priori* external authority or purely experiential authority\. __Relativity and Relevance in Theology\. __Berkouwer proposed that theology is always a relative science, not in the sense of relativism, but in being relative to the dynamic, ever\-renewing, and deepening Word of God\. He believed that theology must maintain relevance for contemporary issues, achieving this relevance through obedient attentiveness to the Word rather than cultural trends\. He viewed theologians as faithfully receptive to Scripture, rather than neutral masters of it\. Regarding Reformed catechisms and confessions, Berkouwer emphasized that dogma should reside within the Church, which is subject in all its expressions to the Word of God\. He believed that the Church must never absolutize its creeds and confessions but must instead be ready to reformulate Christian truth in response to new situations that threaten the Gospel\. Through such conflicts and challenges, Berkouwer argued, the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, can gain new insights into the riches of Scripture\. 

__Holy Scripture\.__ __Revelation and Scripture\. __Berkouwer’s doctrine of Scripture centers on the “co\-relationship” of revelation and faith, drawing from Augustine's concept of “faith in search of understanding” \(*fides quaerens intellectum*\)\. Berkouwer contends that discussing Scripture cannot be divorced from a personal belief in it\. Aligning with Kuyper and Bavinck, he rejects the notion that Scripture stands as the object of the testimony of the Holy Spirit apart from its message\. Formalizing Holy Scripture to provide a prior certainty of its authority contradicts the nature of faith and is as illogical as raising a book without reading it\. Consequently, Berkouwer advises against dismissing historical\-critical studies due to preconceived ideas of biblical inerrancy—a viewpoint criticized as artificial since it ignores Scripture's composition in human language, thus offering the reader legitimate freedom to explore and understand the text\. __Inspiration and Inerrancy\. __Berkouwer supports Bavinck’s idea of organic inspiration and views the Reformers' concept of the perspicuity or clarity of Scripture as a clear Gospel message rather than an assertion of inerrant human language in the Bible\. This perspective sharply contrasts with the views of Warfield and Princeton theologians who hold abstract conceptions of biblical inerrancy\. Such conceptions fail to acknowledge effectively that God adapts divine revelation to human speech and modes of thought, reflecting Berkouwer’s belief that the Bible does not consist of timeless generalities but requires awareness of cultural context and intent to understand the Word of God\. He argues that obedience to God’s Word is unattainable unless it involves actively discovering the meaning and essential goal of the words, a process vital due to Scripture’s historically human nature—a stance opposing both rationalistic Fundamentalism and Bultmann's approach of demythologizing the New Testament’s worldview\. __Time\-Relatedness\. __Moreover, Berkouwer emphasizes that the time\-relatedness of Scripture should not be perceived as a threat to the Church’s confession regarding Scripture\. Instead, biblical research should aim at “searching for the goal and the Word within the many words,” aligning with Barth’s views\. Berkouwer concludes that Scripture is not a metaphysical document but a dynamic tool serving God in proclaiming the message of salvation\.

__Providence and Human Freedom\. __Berkouwer challenges Bavinck's view of providence as a "mixed article" discernible through both natural reason and special revelation, contesting the alignment of human freedom and nature's necessity with the nature of God’s providence\. Berkouwer warns against naturalistic interpretations of fate and cautions against attributing specific historical occurrences to God’s providence, emphasizing the limitations of human understanding\. Introducing the concept of "concurrence," he seeks to articulate how divine and human actions coincide, all the while opposing the notion that God is the cause of sin\. Berkouwer insists that God's providence, especially in relation to evil, remains a mystery to be acknowledged in faith rather than approached as a philosophical dilemma\. __Election and Reprobation\. __In discussing election, Berkouwer breaks with traditional Calvinist orthodoxy and the Canons of Dordt by insisting that divine election cannot be understood apart from the grace of God in Christ\. He aligns somewhat with Barth but critiques Barth's objectification of the doctrine of the electing Christ\. For Berkouwer, election is comprehensible only through faith, and it should not be seen as a fixed state but as a call and summons within the realm of God’s grace revealed in Christ\. Reprobation, on the other hand, should not be seen as a counterpart to election\. He argues that reprobation emerges as God's holy response to human sin, drawing from Calvin to support his perspective against the Calvinistic view of an eternal decree\. Berkouwer's approach emphasizes the existential context of election and reprobation, framed within kerygma, the dynamic preaching of good news\. __Berkouwer’s Critique of Rationalistic Fundamentalism\. __Central to Berkouwer's theology is his opposition to rationalistic fundamentalism, with its a priori conceptions such as inerrancy and the doctrine of eternal reprobation, which stand outside the framework of faith\. He underscores that wrath, as depicted in the Gospels, is not a limitation of the good news but a reflection of opposition to the Kingdom, perceivable only through faith\. Wrath operates as an instrument of divine grace and love, reinforcing the message of God’s love and assurance rather than fostering a deterministic fatalism\.

__Eschatology and Universalism\. __Berkouwer emphasizes that biblical eschatology is not merely about future events divorced from faith\. While rejecting a definite assumption about *apokatastasis*—universal reconciliation—he does not exclude its possibility, emphasizing the freedom of God’s grace\. Agreeing with theologians like Balthasar, Rahner, and Barth, Berkouwer underscores that eschatological questions are intricately connected to the Church's *kerygma* and human faith\. He critiques the idea of unbelief as powerless, instead presenting a serious tension between salvation and reprobation, where the gospel serves both as an invitation and a warning against unbelief, continuously pointing to divine mercy and the hope of salvation\. __The Proclamation of the Gospel and Hell\. __In Berkouwer's view, the threat of hell and the proclamation of the gospel are intertwined; hell is understood in the context of God’s loving invitation\. He argues that the Gospel calls believers to faith in the triumph of Christ, seeing hell not as a demythologized concept but as part of a faithful exorcism\. Berkouwer is cautious about treating hell in objectified terms, instead stressing a personal response to the Gospel's message of salvation\. In interpreting Jesus’s seemingly evasive answer in Luke 13:23 \(“Lord, will those who will be saved many?” – “Strive to enter by the narrow door\.”\), he argues that the Gospel’s call to strive for salvation answers questions about who will be saved in a profound, once\-for\-all manner\. __Reception of Berkouwer's Perspective\. __Berkouwer’s dynamic interpretation of the Word of God as relational rather than static or scientific has faced criticism, particularly from evangelical scholars who adhere strictly to doctrines like biblical inerrancy, double predestination, and limited atonement\. This relational view aligns God's Word closely with the dynamics of faith, a stance not universally embraced within evangelical circles\.

__Carl F\. Henry\.__

__Theological Foundations and Presuppositionalism\. __Carl F\. H\. Henry, a pivotal figure in 20th\-century evangelical theology, was known for his robust defense of biblical theism and critique of modern theological trends\. At the core of his theological approach was foundationalism, with a strong presuppositionalist stance that affirmed Christian theism, grounded in biblical revelation, as the only coherent and non\-contradictory system of thought\. Henry argued that even post\-fall, human reason retains the capacity to perceive and elucidate divine truths\. This belief led him to emphasize propositional revelation, where God communicates in express cognitive truths, asserting that Scripture cannot be subject to selective reading or control by external criteria\. __Critique of Neo\-Protestantism and Concept of Inspiration\. __Henry was a vocal opponent of Neo\-Protestantism concerning biblical inspiration and inerrancy\. He criticized Neo\-Protestantism for locating scriptural authority in the subjective inspirations of the believer rather than in the "inspiredness" of the text itself\. Henry contended that inspiration resides within the biblical text, not implying that writers had special genius or were merely expressing divine thoughts in their own culturally contingent words\. Instead, he professed that inspiration is a supernatural influence on divinely chosen prophets and apostles, ensuring the truthfulness and trustworthiness of their proclamations, all while maintaining their unique personalities and cultural contexts\. This perspective leads to his affirmation of the full plenary inspiration of the Bible, declaring it completely true in all its parts, whether expressed through symbolic forms like poetry or parables\. __Inerrancy and Scriptural Authority\. __Henry's understanding of biblical inerrancy distinguishes between precise modern technological reporting and the conveyance of truth through metaphorical or symbolic language\. He maintained that the Bible's inerrancy extends not just to theological and ethical matters but also to historical and scientific aspects when they form part of the Bible's explicit message\. For example, he argued that the Genesis account of creation holds implications for God's causal relationship with the cosmos\. While the Bible is not a science or history textbook, it nonetheless offers relevant information in these areas\. Despite this stance, some find Henry's language vague regarding how biblically related information is both relevant and truthful\. Henry also specified that verbal inerrancy pertains directly to the original autographs of Scripture and only indirectly to copies, rooting the infallibility of existing texts in scholarly textual criticism \(\!\) rather than inner testimony\. This approach is contrasted with Berkouwer’s, who rejected the notion of Scriptural inerrancy\. __Criticism and Influence\. __Henry faced criticism for his rational\-propositional conception of theology and was often accused of adhering to a discredited foundationalism\. Yet, his commitment to the authority and integrity of Scripture sustained his influence as a defender of evangelical orthodoxy amidst shifting theological landscapes\.
