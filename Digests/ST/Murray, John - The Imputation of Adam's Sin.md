__The Imputation of Adam's Sin – John Murray__

__Chapter One\. __John Murray explores the theological treatment of Adam's sin as presented in Romans 5, questioning whether this account is mythical or symbolic and emphasizing its central importance in Paul's letter to the Romans\.

__I\. Syntactical Construction\. __Murray points out that verse 12 in Romans 5 begins an unfinished comparison, which is later resolved in verse 18\. This indicates a resumptive or recapitulatory construction, where the initial statement in verse 12 is paused and then resumed to provide clarity and continuity with verse 18\.

__II\. The Sin Contemplated\. __Central to the discussion is the phrase "ex hoi pantes hemarton," translated as "in which all have sinned" or "in that/because all men sinned\." This phrase is pivotal in understanding the nature of the sin in question\. 

*1\. The Pelagian View* posits that Paul refers to the actual sins committed by individuals, with Adam serving as a prototype\. However, Murray critiques this interpretation as it faces significant challenges: it is not consistent with the historical fact that some, like infants, die without committing voluntary sins\. Moreover, verses 13\-14 highlight that death impacts even those who did not commit a transgression akin to Adam's, emphasizing a single sin by one individual, which contradicts the Pelagian perspective\. This interpretation also undermines the passage's overall analogy since Paul has already invalidated justification by personal works\.

*2\. The Roman Catholic View* lacks unanimity, though theologians like Catharinus and Pighius argue that Adam's conscious sin is imputed to his descendants as original sin\. The Council of Trent maintains that Adam's immediate loss of original holiness and justice affected both him and his posterity, with sin transfused primarily as a habitual condition\. However, this view encounters objections, such as the grammatical use of the aorist tense "hemarton," indicating a historical act rather than a continuous state\. Furthermore, Protestants emphasize that justification comes through imputed, external righteousness, consequently arguing that sin should also be viewed as imputed rather than infused\. The focus on a singular sin in the text clashes with the notion of habitual, original sin\.

*3\. According to Calvin's Interpretation*, Calvin underscores human radical depravity, suggesting sin spreads to all who endure its consequences, equating sin with inherent corruption\. Yet, this interpretation is critiqued for lacking exegetical accuracy concerning what Paul specifically means by the term "in that all sinned\."

*4\. The Classic Protestant Interpretation* brings several considerations to bear: Verse 12 highlights the universal sway of sin, serving as the rationale for death across humanity\. Verses 15\-19 argue that the universal reign of death stems from Adam's single transgression\. Paul's discourse in both sections must refer to the same sin\. Consequently, the conclusion is that Romans 5:12\-19 operates as a cohesive unit, with the sin in verse 12 aligning with that in verses 18\-19\. The incomplete comparison of verse 12 must be consistent with later verses; had Paul intended otherwise, he would have further elaborated\. Additionally, verse 14 negates the notion of personal sin being the issue in verse 12, indicating Paul's focus on a representative, original sin rather than individual acts\.

__Chapter Two__

__III\. The Union Involved\. __Murray explores the concept of solidarity, both within human familial, ecclesiastical, and state structures and on a racial level, specifically concerning Adam and his posterity\. The key question is how this union functions to affect both sin and salvation\.

__1\. The Realistic View\. __This perspective posits that human nature existed numerically and specifically as one in Adam\. In this framework, Adam represents human nature in its entirety; thus, when Adam sinned, the whole human race participated in that transgression and its resultant curse\. The foundational idea is that the race, at that time, existed solely in Adam, making the imputation of Adam's sin native rather than external to us\. Adam's role as the natural head of humanity is not at odds with his role as a representative head\. 

Calvin emphasizes hereditary depravity, and Murray notes that both Calvin and Augustine \(who famously stated that "all were in that one man"\) argue against the notion of Adam's sin\. However, Murray identifies several challenges with the realistic view: i\) it doesn't adequately address the “apparent arbitrariness” of Adam's actions affecting all humanity; ii\) there is no apparent realistic union, akin to that between Adam and his descendants, between Christ and believers; iii\) Scripture never declares Adam as pure humanity, an idea central to the realistic argument; and iv\) solidaric relationships, such as those between family members or citizens of a state, do not necessitate such a specific, integrated unity\.

__2\. The Representative View\. __This perspective involves both punishment \(*poena*\) and guilt \(*culpa*\) being shared\. It affirms Adam's natural headship in that original sin is propagated through generation\. In this view, Adam and Christ serve as representative figures—Adam as the first man and Christ as the second, each uniquely positioned in relation to all of humanity\. 

Murray notes several key elements: i\) a natural or seminal union is assumed in this view; ii\) the unique roles of Adam and Christ as the first and second man toward all men are highlighted; and iii\) in Romans 5, Adam serves as a type or foreshadowing of Christ\. This passage reveals that a\) Christ's righteousness is not imputed to us in a realistic sense, but as an act of grace and justice; b\) the vicarious role of Christ is underscored, emphasizing justice in redemption; and c\) there exists a parallel relationship between Adam and his posterity and Christ and believers\.

__Chapter Three__

__IV\. The Nature of the Imputation\. __In this chapter, Murray delves into the theological nuances of how Adam's sin is imputed to his descendants\. He outlines two main perspectives: mediate and immediate imputation\.

__1\. Mediate Imputation\. __This view, associated with theologians like Josué de la Place \(Placaeus\), suggests that original sin equals depravity, which initially seemed to imply no imputation of guilt\. However, Placaeus defended the idea of mediate imputation, where the imputation of guilt is a consequence of corruption\. In contrast, the immediate view holds that the imputation of guilt causes corruption, as supported by theologians like Heidegger and Turretine\. Murray also includes a detailed section on Jonathan Edwards' contributions to this theological debate\.

__2\. Immediate Imputation\. __This perspective emphasizes an immediate connection between Adam's sin and its repercussions for humanity\.

i\. In Romans 5:12, 15, and 17, Paul's writing underscores the immediate link between Adam’s sin and the resulting death for all\. Verse 12 indicates that just as Adam sinned and died, all people sinned \(in Adam\) and experienced death\. Verse 15 states the death of all is directly tied to Adam's single transgression\. Verse 17 highlights that the trespass of one led to one death through one\.

ii\. Romans 5:16 illustrates the immediate connection between Adam's sin and the condemnation of all, underscoring that the judgment leading to condemnation stemmed from one transgression\.

iii\. The immediate tie between Adam's sin and the sin of all is further underscored in Romans 5:12 and 19, and reinforced by 1 Corinthians 15:22, where Paul asserts, "In Adam all die," establishing a direct connection between Adam's sin and the sinfulness and mortality of humanity\.

iv\. The analogy with Christ supports immediate imputation, as there is no mediation involved in the imputation of righteousness through Christ, paralleling the immediate imputation of Adam's sin to his descendants\.

__Chapter Four\.__

__V\. The Sin Imputed\. __Murray examines the theological concept of the imputation of sin, viewing "impute" as a term signifying to reckon or esteem something to someone\. He assesses this concept through a detailed analysis of various theological perspectives, including a notable section on the work of __Charles Hodge\.__

In Reformed theology, three key concepts are related to imputation, with *culpa* \(guilt\) being foundational to the others: *reatus* \(liability\) and *poena* \(penalty\)\. Mastricht aligns these as *culpa* leading to *reatus* and subsequently *poena*\. Calvin emphasizes that there can be no *reatus* \(liability\) without *culpa* \(guilt\), a view shared by Zanchius, who links disobedience directly to *culpa* and *reatus* through the mechanism of imputation\. The Leyden Synopsis concurs, presenting disobedience as producing culpa with consequent reatus\. Amesius focuses on how imputation results in communicating these outcomes, while Turretine aligns with the sequence of culpa leading to reatus and then to poena\. Lutheran theology also supports this framework\.

Murray elaborates that Paul discusses not only the wages of sin \(*reatus poena*\) but also the imputation of its guilt \(*culpa*\)\. He posits that Adam's trespass was seen as both *peccatum alienum* \(an alien sin\) and *peccatum proprium* \(a proper sin\) of his descendants\. He contends:

1\. When Adam sinned, his posterity did not yet exist independently\.

2\. Each individual of this posterity comes into existence as inherently sinful\.

3\. Sin intertwined with human existence, imputed from the outset of one's life\.

4\. Humans are reckoned as having sinned in Adam\.

5\. Adam's sin constitutes a transgression against the divine law of God\.
