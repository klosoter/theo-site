__Book II: Chapters 12\-17 – Christology – John Calvin__

__Chapter XII: Christ Had to Become Man in Order to Fulfill the Office of Mediator\.__

__1\.__ __Dual Nature as the Bridge\.__ Only one who is both true God and true man can bridge the gap between a holy God and fallen humanity\. Christ as God is the holy mediator, while his humanity allows him to sympathize and be close to us, as emphasized in Hebrews\. __2\. Mediator's Dual Task\.__ The Mediator's role is to transform those destined for destruction into heirs of heaven\. Thus, the Son of God became Son of Man, adopting human nature to enable divine adoption\. As God, he gains victory over death\. __3\. Obedience through Dual Nature\.__ Christ had to be true God and man to satisfy God's judgment by taking Adam's place\. As man, he could experience death, and as God, he could conquer it, ensuring victory over sin\. __4\. Purpose of the Incarnation\.__ Critics argue Christ might have become man without the need for redemption, but Calvin emphasizes that Scripture connects his incarnation to redemption\. Christ's role as Redeemer is consistently affirmed in Scripture, as seen in passages like John 12:27\-28\. __5\. Hypothetical Incarnation without Sin\.__ Calvin contends that discussing whether Christ would have incarnated without Adam's sin is unwarranted as the Spirit declares that Christ's role as Redeemer and partaker of human nature was predetermined by God’s eternal decree\. __6\. Osiander's Image of God Doctrine\.__ Osiander suggests humanity was created in the image of the Messiah to come, implying they were fashioned to resemble Christ as he would come flesh\. Calvin counters that Christ was always the true image of God as the eternal Son, not just through the incarnation\. Osiander’s stance is similar to Barth’s\. __7\. Refutation of Osiander\. __Calvin methodically disputes Osiander's claims, stating that if Christ preceded creation, he would be the "first Adam\." Christ's divine role names him "first\-born of creation" as its origin, while as man, he is "first\-born from the dead\." Osiander's claim that Christ must be incarnate to lead the Church is dismissed by noting Christ's headship over angels without incarnation\.

__Chapter XIII: Christ Assumed the True Substance of Human Flesh\.__

__1\. Refuting Ancient Heresies Concerning Christ's Manhood\.__ Calvin addresses the heresies of the Marcionites and Manichees, who deny the true manhood and materiality of Christ's body\. He asserts that Scripture affirms Christ’s genuine humanity against these erroneous views\. __2\. Misinterpretations of Scripture by Heretics\.__ Marcion and Mani distort Scripture to support their views, citing phrases like "the likeness of a man" and "second Adam of heaven" out of context\. Calvin clarifies that such interpretations are misleading\. __3\. Christ's Human Descent through the Virgin Mary\.__ Calvin challenges theories by figures like Menno Simons who suggest a purely spiritual birth of Christ\. He argues that Christ’s lineage includes the seed of woman, as genealogy in the Bible accounts for both paternal and maternal lines\. __4\. True Human and Divine Nature of Christ\.__ Calvin discusses how Christ, while truly human, is without sin and remains eternal God\. He introduces the *extra\-Calvinisticum*, explaining that Christ, while fully human, was not confined by human limitations since the divine Word retained the fullness of deity\. 

__Chapter XIV: How the Two Natures of the Mediator Make One Person\.__

*Explanation of the Human and Divine Natures in Christ\.*__* *__

__1\. Duality and Unity in Christ\.__ Calvin explains that while Christ's divine and human natures remain distinct, they constitute a united person\. He compares this to the *soul and body uniting in a person*, emphasizing the communication of properties in Scripture\. __2\. Interrelation of Divinity and Humanity\.__ Scripture attributes both divine pre\-existence and human development to Christ, showcasing this dual nature through expressions like "the Lord of glory was sacrificed" and "the Son of man who was in heaven," the *communicatio idiomatum\.* 3\. Unity of the Mediator's Person\. Calvin asserts that passages speaking of both divine and human attributes highlight the true unity of Christ’s two natures\.

*Condemnation of the Errors of Nestorius, Eutyches, and Servetus\.*

__4\. Rejecting Fusion or Separation of Natures\.__ Calvin condemns Nestorius for suggesting a duality of persons to preserve two natures and Eutyches for fusing the natures to preserve unity\. __5\. Critique of Servetus on Christ's Sonship\.__ Servetus claims the Reformed view implies two Sons of God\. Calvin refutes this, stating the pre\-existent Son did not become a new God through incarnation\. __6\. Christ as Son of God and Man\.__ Calvin emphasizes Christ's dual identity: from David according to flesh and as God blessed eternally\. __7\. Servetus' Counterarguments\.__ Servetus inaccurately claims Christ’s sonship only begins with incarnation, failing to acknowledge the eternal nature of the Son\. __8\. Rebuttal of Servetus' Doctrine\.__ Calvin refutes Servetus' view against the eternal begetting of the Son, pointing out similarities with Manichean views and asserting the continuous, eternal nature of Christ’s divinity\.

__Chapter XV: To Know the Purpose for Which Christ Was Sent by the Father, and What He Conferred Upon Us, We Must Look Above All at Three Things in Him: the Prophetic Office, Kingship, and Priesthood\.__

*Christ's saving activity is threefold: first, prophetic office\.*

__1\. Christ's Prophetic Fulfillment\.__ Understanding Christ's role involves examining Scriptural passages related to his prophetic office, which fulfills and culminates in the Old Testament prophetic tradition\.  __2\. Significance of the Prophetic Office\.__ While Christ is acknowledged as the Messiah and King, his role as prophet and priest is equally significant\. The Spirit anointed Christ as a herald and witness of God's grace\.

*The kingly office – its spiritual character\.*

__3\. Eternal Dominance of Christ’s Kingdom\.__ Christ’s kingly office signifies both the perpetual existence of the entire Church and individual believers' blessed immortality\. __4\. Blessings of the Kingly Office\.__ This office is inherently spiritual, promising happiness linked to heavenly life\. Through the Spirit, believers are empowered and equipped for victory over the Devil, clothed in righteousness\. __5\. Nature of Christ's Sovereignty\.__ As Messiah, Christ’s anointing with grace equips believers, while his position at the right hand of the Father establishes his sovereignty\. "God has bestowed upon him the name above every name\."

*The priestly office: reconciliation and intercession\.*

__6\. Mediator’s Holiness and Reconciliation\.__ Christ’s priestly office, marked by his *sinless holiness*, reconciles humanity with God through expiation and appeasement\. His blood alone achieves satisfaction for sins, and *he sanctifies himself for our benefit*\.

__Chapter XVI: How Christ Has Fulfilled the Function of Redeemer to Acquire Salvation for Us\. Here, Also, His Death and Resurrection Are Discussed, as Well as His Agent Into Heaven\.__

*Alienated by sin from God, who yet loved us, we are reconciled by Christ, 1\-4*

__The Redeemer and Understanding Divine Wrath\.__ Recognizing God's wrath is crucial to understanding the necessity of the Redeemer\. His loving act through Christ bridges divine hostility\. Fear of God sets the stage for embracing His mercy\. God's eternal love necessitates reconciliation despite His opposition to unrighteousness, finding both what He opposes and what He cherishes in us\. As Augustine notes, love predates creation, and redemption stems from this eternal love\.

*The Effects of the Obedience and Death of Christ, 5\-7*

__Redemption Through Obedience and the Significance of the Crucifixion\.__ Christ's life and death exemplify willing obedience, reversing Adam's disobedience and achieving redemption\. His crucifixion represents liberation from the curse of the law, while his death and burial break the hold of death, facilitating the mortification of the flesh and our spiritual renewal\.

*Explanation of the Doctrine of the Descent into Hell, 8\-12\.*

__Descent into Hell: Spiritual Torment and Scriptural Defense\.__ Though historically a later addition, "descended into hell" reflects a common theological insight, transcending mere burial symbolism\. Various interpretations include freeing patriarchs or manifesting grace\. Calvin sees it as depicting Christ’s spiritual torment and divine wrath, with Biblical texts from Acts, Hebrews, and Psalms supporting this perspective \(“fear/pangs of death,” “why have thou forsaken me”\)\. He addresses misinterpretations regarding Christ's suffering, emphasizing that it involved genuine anguish without sin\.

*Christ's Resurrection, Ascension, and Heavenly Session, 13\-16\.*

__Resurrection, Ascension, and the Significance of the Session\.__ Christ's resurrection signifies not suffering but rebirth; it affirms justification and ensures our resurrection\. The cross represents mortality, resurrection embodies glory, and ascension marks the initiation of Christ’s kingdom authority\. His exaltation to God’s right hand signifies honor, admired by all creation\.

__Benefits and Returning Judgment\.__ The ascension offers access to heaven, enables Christ's intercession, and facilitates sanctification through the Spirit\. Christ’s return promises judgment of the living and dead, making His kingdom manifest\. His dual role as redeemer and judge provides unparalleled comfort, emphasizing that the entirety of salvation, as reflected in the Creed, revolves around Christ alone\.

__Chapter XVII: Christ Rightly and Properly Said to Have Merited God's Grace and Salvation for Us\.__

__1\. Harmony of Merit and Grace\.__ Christ's merit does not oppose God’s free grace; instead, it complements it, working in harmony\. __2\. Scriptural Union of Grace and Merit\.__ Scripture couples God's grace with Christ's merit, illustrating that God loved us first \(grace\) and provided propitiation for sins through Christ \(merit\)\. __3\. Testimony of Christ's Merit\.__ Scripture asserts that reconciliation is achieved through Christ’s death, highlighting his merit in God’s plan of salvation\. __4\. Substitutionary Role of Christ\.__ Grace is imparted through Christ's merit, with his blood cleansing us and sins imputed to him\. His death acts as expiation\. __5\. Redemption Price of Christ’s Death\.__ Christ's sacrifice ransoms and cleanses us from sin, paying the price and absolving guilt\. Justification through the law nullifies Christ’s sacrifice\. __6\. Christ's Merit Not Self\-Serving\.__ Contrary to queries from Lombard and Schoolmen, Calvin argues that Christ acquired no merit for himself, for the Son of God needed nothing new\.
