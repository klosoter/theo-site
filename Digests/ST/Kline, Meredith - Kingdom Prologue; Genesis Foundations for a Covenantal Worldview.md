__Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview – Meredith G\. Kline__

__Part I: The Kingdom in the World That Then Was\.__

*Genealogies and Historical Span of Genesis\.* Genesis is concerned with posterity and future generations, as indicated by the recurring phrase "these are the generations of," which underscores a vast history from Adam to Abraham\. Kline suggests that the genealogies in Genesis 5 and 11 are selective and thus contain significant gaps, potentially placing the Flood as far back as the last ice age or earlier\.

__Section A\. Creational Covenant\. __*Covenantal Nature of the Pre\-Fall Kingdom\.* The question of whether the pre\-Fall kingdom can be seen as covenantal is addressed by Scripture itself, with references like Hosea 6:7 and Isaiah 24:5 pointing back to Genesis 1\-3\. The narrative here features oaths and bonds akin to creative decrees that establish the kingdom's core\. The presence of the Glory\-Spirit and the covenantal marriage imagery reinforce this view\. In conclusion, Genesis 1\-3 is rich with evidence of Eden's covenantal character, seen as the "creator's covenant of works with Adam\."

__Chapter One: Lord of the Covenant\-Kingdom\. __

*The Structure of Ancient Treaties\.* The opening of ancient vassal treaties is reflected in the creation covenant, which begins by identifying the king's name, paralleling the presentation of the Creator in Genesis\. 

__I\. God, the Alpha\-Author\.__

__A\. Creator of All\.__ God is the source, maker, and ultimate purpose of all things, including heaven, earth, and the unseen realm\. In the Genesis prologue, Elohim is uniquely presented as the Eternal Creator, existing outside time and creation\. __B\. Sovereign Architect\-Builder\.__ Unlike the warrior deities of pagan myths, God is depicted as an artisan and architect of the universe\. The Genesis creation narrative offers architectural directives instead of battle epics, requiring no demythologizing but appreciation of its poetic form\. __C\. Glory\-Spirit Archetype\.__ Genesis 1:1\-2 describes both visible and invisible realms, with the "Spirit" denoting the divine court\. As King of the heavenly temple and host, God’s sovereignty encompasses all creation, aligning with insights in Kline's "Images of the Spirit\." 

__II\. God, the Omega\-Consumator\. __*God as the Alpha and Omega\.* God is not only the initiator but also the ultimate completion of all things, embracing both the beginning and the end, which is revealed through the Sabbath\.__ __

__A\. Sabbath and Consummation\.__ The Sabbath marks creation’s culmination and transitions from the Glory\-theophany \(Alpha\) to the Glory\-Spirit \(Omega\), highlighting its eschatological dimension within pneumatology\. __B\. Sabbath and Enthronement\.__ Completion of creation leads to divine rest, underscoring God's sovereignty and authority over the cosmos, not as a sequel but as an integral extension of His power, with the Sabbath embodying both a victory celebration and an everlasting dominion\. __C\. Sabbath and Consecration\.__ The creation account's framework culminates in the consecration of all creation for humanity, appointed as sovereign representatives, underscoring divine sovereignty and dominion over all\.

__Chapter Two: Holy Theocratic Kingdom\.__

*Historical Context of Covenants\.* In line with the second part of international treaty formats, this chapter narrates the historical relationship of the Lord with His vassal, leading up to their covenantal interactions\.

__I\. Royal Investment as Image\-Son\. __*Human Kingship and Divine Image\.* God granted kingship to humanity, which is understood through the concept of the Image of God\. __A\. Spirit\-Paradigm of the Image\. __The Glory\-Spirit serves not only as an architect but also as an archetype, establishing humanity as a temple for the Creator\-Spirit\. __B\. The Glory of the Imago Dei\.__ Humanity holds the status of earth's ruler under God's authority, reflecting the dominion of the divine and angelic host\. This endowment includes ethical glory, signifying a state of righteousness with a promise of even greater glory\. __C\. Image of God and Son of God\.__ The father\-son dynamic is implied, as seen in Genesis 5:1\-3, where Adam's likeness is passed to Seth\. Humanity bears God's likeness, akin to a son reflecting the image of his father\.

__II\. Kingdom Endowment\. __

__A\. Kingdom as Sanctuary\. __*1\-Site of God's Throne\-Presence\.* Eden represents the tangible presence of the Creator\-King, making humanity's dwelling a sacred site and original holy land, where God communicated with man and revealed His royal glory akin to Ezekiel's holy mountain\. *2\-Theocracy\.* Eden portrayed a theocracy with political and cultic unity, contrasting with the post\-fall distinction where theocratic realms are differentiated from the broader creation\. Initially, God's reign implied a particular geopolitical realm manifesting in structures like the Tabernacle and Temple\.

__B\. The Kingdom as Divine Protectorate\. __*1\) Consecration\-Sacrifice\-Death in Paradise\.* The Edenic covenant highlighted the suzerain's obligations, emphasizing God's promise and protection\. Despite creation’s inherent goodness, post\-fall curses fell upon humanity, illustrating man's subordination to God, mirrored by the dominion order in Genesis\. *2\) Death, Blessing, and Curse\.* Kline considers the scientific curiosity about predatory animals before human existence and concludes that man's blessing centered on dominion rather than the absence of death\. Biblical texts like Genesis 9 affirm the permissibility of meat consumption and reflect shifts in post\-fall relationships\. *3\) Divine Shield\.* Eden was not just a holy place; it embodied divine security and preservation, sustained by the presence of the Glory\-Spirit depicted by images like a shield, canopy, and pavilion, drawing on descriptions from Isaiah and Psalms\.

__Chapter Three: Law of the Creation Theocracy\.__

__I\. Law of the Image\-Son of God\. __

__A\. The Imitation of God\.__ The *sensus divinitatis* awakens an imperative within humans to imitate God, reflecting God's self\-love and self\-glorification\. Humans must follow suit, recognizing their role and reflection of divine nature\. __B\. Service of Love\.__ Humanity is inherently subordinate to God, serving out of love and allegiance\. This service merges both worship of God and obligations toward fellow humans, emphasizing that love of neighbor is part of one’s duty to God\.

__II\. Theocratic Kingdom Commission\. __

*Cult and Culture as Religious Acts\.* Humanity's theocratic commission involves dual roles—priest\-king offices—that reflect both vertical \(cultic\) and horizontal \(cultural\) relationships\. As king over creation, mankind's tribute and offerings are consecrated to the Great King\.

__A\. Cultural Commission\. __*1\) Construction of the Kingdom City\.* Humanity is tasked with exercising dominion and engaging in God's creative work, transforming the original paradise into a universal kingdom city through cultural endeavors\. This mandate encompasses intellectual and physical capacities, aimed at extending God’s original creation\. *2\) Community Polity\.* The commission necessitates an institutional approach, beginning with the first human pair as husband and wife\. This reflects a covenantal and legal structure, where family roles and governance extend throughout human relationships, stressing both familial hierarchy and federal representation through Adam\. *3\) Culture and the Imitation of God\.* As image\-bearers, humans partake in God’s creative work, advancing knowledge and mastering creation\. Naming the animals symbolizes human authority and interpretive roles, mirroring God’s sovereign rule\. *4\) The Sabbatical Form of Culture\.* Cultural endeavors move humanity towards a sabbatical rest in God's own royal rest, reflecting and marking creation's fulfillment\. The Sabbath serves as both a consummation and consecration of time, symbolizing humanity's anticipated ultimate fulfillment of God's cultural mandate\.

__B\. Cultic Ministry\. __*1\) Adoration and Consecration\.* Acknowledging God through natural revelation, human beings are called to be a living temple, engaging in adoration shaped by theophanic revelations of God's glory\. Rituals, perhaps without animal sacrifice prior to the fall, emphasize consecration to God\. *2\) Guardianship and Sanctuary*\. As the Edenic sanctuary mirrors heavenly dwelling, humans guard against profanation, performing priestly duties of protection, holding judicial and military responsibilities as a guardian\-priest against anything hostile to God’s holiness\. *3\) Primacy and Priesthood*\. The priestly office is primary, shaping humanity's historical mission\. The pre\-fall cultural commission is cult\-oriented, influencing the redemptive plan, through temple construction \(post\-fall\) and human development as vessels of divine replication, reflecting Spirit\-temple ideals\.

__Chapter Four: Eschatological Sanctions\.__

Kline draws parallels between ancient suzerain\-vassal treaties and God's covenant with Adam, which includes themes of probation, blessing, and curse, pointing to eschatological outcomes\. These sanctions define the future of the covenant\.

__I\. The Dual Sanctions\. __

__A\. The Promised Blessing\. __*1\) Eschatology of the Image\. *The imago Dei implies an eschatological fulfillment from its original state to consummated blessedness\. This perfection aligns with reaching the sabbatical goal of completing God's temple construction as prescribed in the kingdom commission\. *2\) The Sacramental Tree\. *The trees in Eden offer mankind ultimate beatitude, serving as sources of delight and nourishment, symbolizing theophanic Glory's elements: judicial dominion and immortality\. The Creator\-Logos invites man in covenantal faithfulness to partake of the sacramental fruit of the tree of life\. *3\) Consummation of Glory\. *Obedience concerning the tree of knowledge allows man to partake of the sacramental tree of life, fulfilling the promise of glorified life and entrance into the Sabbath rest\. The eschatological prospects inherent in the imago Dei are signified by the Sabbath and the tree of life\. Christ's work re\-creates and perfects the imago Dei, ushering his people into Sabbath rest with access to the tree of life\. Kline emphasizes that heaven is a divine creation, not a human achievement\. *Human Culture and Eternal Continuity\.* The divine investment in glorifying the imago Dei renders human cultural accomplishments obsolete, highlighting the provisional nature of external culture before consummation\. What endures is the family of mankind, ensuring continuity between historical cultural products and the eternal state\. In an unfallen world, cultural history would focus on constructing one universal kingdom\-city, with glorified man epitomizing the Metapolis, or New Jerusalem, identified with the glorified church\. __B\. The Threatened Curse\. __The curse reflects the reversal of man's original dominion over the world, leading to torment and humiliation, delineating the nature of hell as a consequence of covenant\-breaking\.

__II\. Probation\. __

__A\. The Probation Tree\. __Eschatological advancement in kingdom glory depended on man's obedience, with temporal limits of testing marking probation\. This probation aimed not to jeopardize man's beatitude but to guide him toward its consummation\. Adam was a federal head representing probationary obedience\. Two measures intensified the probationary process: a specific proscription \(Gen\. 2:16\-17\) to underscore man's vassal status and satanic temptation toward disobedience\. The phrase "good and evil" reflects the opposite choices in the probation context, framed in legal and judicial terms\. __B\. Covenant of Works\. __The principle "do this and live" implies that entering Sabbath rest is contingent upon man's fulfillment of probationary work, which would be meritorious and lay the foundation for the Covenant of Works\. Despite objections based on man's inability to add to God's glory, Kline argues the biblical evidence is compelling, grounding the gospel of grace in this works principle, with Christ as the second Adam performing meritorious works\. The Mosaic economy was informed by the works principle, reflecting God's paternal love and legal justice, even though it wasn't a matter of grace\. *The Role of Divine Grace and Justice\. *Divine grace engages with both the absence and presence of merit\. If Adam's obedience lacked eternal significance, his disobedience couldn't warrant eternal punishment, thus questioning God's justice consistency\. The opposing view of disproportionality elevates human justice standards above divine justice, assigning ontological values to God's reward and Adam's obedience\. Biblical data affirms federal\-representative probation and forensic imputation, where two Adams' righteousness imputed to their descendants serves as meritorious grounds for justification and inheritance of the consummate kingdom, incompatible with disavowal of the works principle\.

__Chapter Five: Covenant Judgment\.__

In Chapter Five: Covenant Judgment, the text discusses the breaking of the covenant through the advent of the Antilord and the temptation and fall of man\. Satan's emphasis on the prohibitory aspects led humanity to ignore God's positive commands, isolating dominion\-glory from ethical\-glory, the *image of God*\. This shift resulted in a polytheistic idolatry centered around the self and Satan\. Judgment Day is characterized by the Parousia of the Glory\-Spirit, a theophanic presence described as "the Spirit of the day," rather than the traditional "cool of the day\." Judgment entails self\-exposure and a loss of righteousness, aligning humanity with the image of Satan\. An irrevocable curse is pronounced on the serpent, while the judgment on man involves a common curse, emphasized by the refrain "and he died" throughout Genesis, reflecting pervasive mortality\. Humanity's expulsion from Eden signifies a fall from the divine presence, leading to wandering eastward and highlighting their diaspora from their original sanctuary\.

__Section B: Redemptive Covenant in the Old World__ discusses two redemptive covenants: the eternal covenant, where the Son \(second party\) assumes the role of a covenant servant and represents the elect as the second Adam with a works\-based principle, and the historical administration, where the messianic Son acts as Lord and mediator, involving the church community of confessors \(second party\) under the principle of grace\. 

__Chapter One: Inauguration of the Redemptive Covenant__ focuses on the Renewal of the Covenant through the Gospel of Redemptive Judgment, highlighting the Messiah, grace, and election, and introducing the Seal of the New Covenant\. Redemptive Eschatology and Common Grace suggest that the Gospel promise in Genesis 3:15 requires a postponement of final judgment to allow for the progression of human history, as presupposed in the prophecy of the woman's seed and the warfare with the devil and his seed\. It examines the relationship between the holy and the common within this framework\.

__Chapter Two: Prophetic Cult in the City of Man\.__

__A\. The City as Divine Ordinance\. __This chapter examines the *city as a divine ordinance rather than simply an evil invention* of fallen man, even though it *becomes a symbol* of human rebellion against God\. Despite its associations with the rejected line of Cain, the city is not inherently a cursed contradiction of divine order; instead, it serves the eschatological vision of the city in human culture\. The couple in the Garden of Eden was meant to multiply, supplying citizens for this city as part of fulfilling the cultural mandate\. In their building efforts, they would create the city's architecture and governance structure, thus organizing life under God's sovereign design\. The city, therefore, is the embodiment of human endeavor and hope, seen through both the covenant's stipulations and blessing sanctions\. The city provides remedial benefits and functions within the frameworks of common grace and curse, existing as neither the kingdom of Satan nor the kingdom of God\. It involves basic state functions and limitations, which include the complementarity of family and state, social responsibilities, and avoiding utopian delusions\. However, the city also experiences apostate malfunction, represented by the city of man, the dynasty of Cain, and the cult of divine kings, highlighting its potential for deviation from divine intent\. __II\. The Redemptive Community\. __The redemptive community identifies as the people of Yahweh, organized into a covenantal polity\. This community functions as a cultic entity with familial ties, maintaining a nontheocratic stance\. The mission of the covenant people involves fulfilling priestly roles, focusing on the sanctification of culture and offering a confessional witness\. Additionally, they engage in prophetic functions through the figure of prophets and the divine lawsuit\.

__Chapter Three: Sign of Kingdom Consummation \(Flood\)\. __

This chapter explores the __Flood__ as a sign of kingdom consummation, beginning with its role as a redemptive judgment\. The Antichrist crisis precipitates a judicial ordeal that results in dual verdicts, preserving a redeemed remnant\. The Day of the Lord, or the Deluge, is characterized by parousia, symbolized by thundering storms as manifestations of the Lord's Glory\-cloud, and the gathering of the elect\. Following the Flood, a __re\-creation__ is depicted with literary parallels to Genesis 1, using seven divisions in two triads to echo the creation narrative\. The cosmological correspondence includes a return to primeval chaos, with the merging of the waters from above and below, reminiscent of Genesis 1:2\. This includes new mountain formations, vegetation growth, and a renewed cultural mandate, among other changes\. The __Kingdom Consummation__ section portrays the Ark as a cosmic house of God, with its occupants representing glorified mankind\. The Sabbath consecration of the kingdom signifies its fulfillment\. The __Covenantal Grant__ is anchored in the fulfillment of the Genesis 6:18 covenant during the Flood\. Noah is the grantee of this covenant, typifying the Messianic servant in his role as surety, mediator, and savior\. The covenantal grant acknowledges Noah's faithful service, highlighting his role in the redemptive narrative\.

__Part II: The Kingdom in the World That Now Is\.__

__Chapter One: Covenantal Resumption of Common Grace\.__

__I\. Covenant Confirmation\. __The covenant is confirmed through the third generations\-divisions, renewing common grace in an A\-B\-A pattern with the main sections being Genesis 8:20\-22, 9:1\-7, and 9:8\-17\. The covenant involves Noah and his family representing humanity and all living creatures, with the rainbow as its sign\. This renewal resumes the prediluvian interim order despite the persistent evil of mankind\.

__II\. The Order of Nature\. __God’s providential ordering of nature is symbolized by the rainbow, representing peace as a horizontal bow rather than a vertical war\-bow\. This order is essential for the continuation of humanity’s historical existence and cultural development\. The covenant of common grace places a partial and temporary limit on nature’s curses and will last as long as the earth remains\.

__III\. The Cultural Program\.__

__A\. General Regulations\. __The original cultural commission to Adam and Eve is reaffirmed to Noah and his sons, emphasizing creative fruitfulness, propagation, dominion over the earth, and sustenance provision\. The structure is centered around the family\. __B\. Special Regulations For God's People\. __Dominion over animals allows for eating them, but with a prohibition on consuming lifeblood, underscoring regulations against murder\. *1\) Discontinuance of Clean/Unclean Distinction\. *All kinds of meat are permissible for consumption, reversing temporary restrictions imposed between the Fall and the Flood\. *2\. Continuance of Restriction on Blood\. *The prohibition against consuming blood remains, limiting its use to cultic sacrifice and symbolic satisfaction of God's justice, maintaining its sacredness\. The common grace covenant re\-establishes natural revelation as a testimony to God's everlasting power and patience, setting the historical stage for the renewed program of the redemptive covenant, especially as realized in the Lord's covenant with Abraham\.

__Chapter Two: Redemptive Covenant in the New World\.__

__I\. Oracle of Kingdom Judgment\.__

__A\. Noah's Oracle and Genesis 3:14, 15\. __Noah's oracle in Genesis 9:25\-27 connects with the primal oracle of Genesis 3:14\-15\. It deals with the curse on Satan and his followers, foreshadowing the ultimate conquest through the messianic champion\. Key elements include the spiritual antithesis and the parallel of Noah's nakedness with God covering Adam and Eve\. The curses address agents of evil within the spiritual warfare between the Lord's seed and Satan's seed, situated within the redemptive sphere rather than the social\-political realm of common grace\. __B\. Canaan Cursed\. __The curse on Canaan represents a redemptive judgment and declaration of reprobation\. The use of Canaan, meaning "subdue," anticipates its subjugation in the Israelite conquest\. __C\. Shem Blessed\. __Shem, meaning "name," signifies the bearers of God's name, underscoring the covenant relationship\. The line of Shem\-Terah is the covenant line, echoed in Melchizedek's doxology: "Blessed be God most High\." __D\. Japheth Blessed\. __The destiny of Japheth unfolds from the Mosaic Covenant's ethnic particularism focused on Israel to the messianic age, where the church's mission embraces all nations, realized in the apostolic mission, notably Paul's outreach to the Greeks\. 

__II\. The Kingdoms of This World\. __

__A\. Focus and Fullness\. __The fullness and expansion of the covenantal mandate is achieved through cultural structuring, extending to a temple\-city\. The character of the curse is dispersion, yet focus and fullness unite in the church's Spirit\-union\. Jerusalem stands as God's typological city, while Babel represents a pseudo\-focus and antitype\. __B\. City of Man as Pseudo\-Focus\. __*1\) Diaspora of the Nations\. 2\) Babel's Ascent to Heaven\. *The Babel narrative begins with mankind wandering eastward, echoing Cain\. The term ziggurat is used polemically, suggesting that Babylonian myths trace back to Babel, a human attempt to create a cosmic focus in defiance of God\. *3\) Heaven's Descent on Babel\. *Expected to descend upon the tower of Babel, God's actual coming is a judicial inspection, illustrating the broader dispersion and division occurring worldwide, as described in Genesis 10\. This delay in justice allows room for common grace history and the maturation of God's redemptive program\.

__III\. The Community of the Blessing\. __

The unfolding redemptive history of Shem transpires in the fifth generation\-division \(Genesis 11:10\-26\)\. __A\. Noah's Oracle and Genesis 10:1\-11:26\. __Genesis 10 situates between Noah's curses and blessings and their fulfillment, specifically Shem's descendants, leading directly to Abraham, both genealogically and literarily\. __B\. The Sons of Japheth\. C\. The Sons of Ham\. __These include nations later judged by God's judgment through Israel, with Jerusalem and Babel as prominent world\-centers\. __D\. The Sons of Shem\. __*1\) Shem and the Sons of Eber\. *Shem fathers the Hebrews, with Peleg and Joktan furthering the covenantal genealogy\. *2\. Peleg\. *Peleg, meaning "division," may refer to subdivisions within his family or the Babel episode, continuing Noah's oracle's wordplays\. *3\. The Hebrews\. *Shem is their progenitor, and Abraham, identified as a Hebrew, demonstrates lineage and covenant election\. Genesis 14 highlights Abraham's role in defending the covenant community\. __E\. Covenant Community: From Shem to Abraham\. __Shem's line is distinguished as the covenant family, heirs of the Kingdom of God, without restriction to Seth's prediluvian line\. __F\. A Mosaic Postscript\. __Deuteronomy 32:8\-9 conveys that while God assigned territories to nations with human rulers, only in Israel is the LORD himself King, marking Jacob as his heritage\.

__Chapter Three: The Kingdom Promised in the Abrahamic Covenant\.__

__I\. Covenant of Promise\.__

__A\. Divine Promise and Oath\. __*1\) Promise as Gospel Grace\. *The divine promise to Abraham reverses the narrative of Babel, restoring cosmic and cultic order\. The great name is granted to Abraham not through human effort but as a promissory gift, forming the covenant of grace and a promise\-faith relationship, which anticipates the New Covenant in Jesus Christ\. *2\) Ratification Oath\. *In Genesis 15, the covenant is formally ratified through an oath ceremony involving severed animals and torches, signifying the presence of the Glory\-Spirit\. God alone passes through the pieces, symbolizing His commitment and willingness to bear the judgment curse if He fails to fulfill the promise\. *3\) Confirmatory Oaths\. *The symbolism of sacrificial cutting recurs in later oaths, such as Genesis 22 with Isaac, foreshadowing the messianic Son's path through death to eternal life\. __B\. Divine Promise and Divine Sovereignty\. __*1\) Sovereign Election\. *Genesis 3:15 introduces a divine division within fallen humanity, further exemplified in Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Israel\. Romans 9 emphasizes that not all descendants of Abraham are elect, including Gentile believers\. The seed of Abraham is ultimately spiritual, with patriarchs selected for eternal blessings and their lines leading to Israel and the Messiah\. Their individual election finds expression in the broader history of their descendants, rooted in God's grace rather than a works principle within the national covenant\. *2\) Supernatural Execution\. *The sovereign authority of the Promiser is demonstrated through supernatural acts, such as the birth of Isaac from barrenness\. In Genesis 22 and Galatians 4, the contrast between the flesh principle represented by Ishmael and the promise and Spirit principle represented by Isaac further highlights divine sovereignty\. __C\. Sovereign Grace and Human Obligation\. __*1\) Stipulated Demands\. *Divine promises of the covenant always included human obligations, though not based on merit from work or obedience\. The call of Abraham resembles the call of disciples with a directive to "follow me" and to "walk before me and be perfect\." There is a causal link between Abraham's obedience and the promises' fulfillment, as seen in Genesis 26\. Covenantal vow and tributary tithe are evident in Abraham's actions in Genesis 14 and Jacob's in Genesis 28\. *2\. Vows of Consecration\. 3\. Circumcision Oath\. *In Genesis 17, the covenant includes a theophany where God identifies Himself and instructs circumcision as a requirement\. Circumcision serves as a confirmatory sign of the covenant and parallels the Sabbath ordinance as an everlasting covenant seal\. It symbolizes the curse of divine judgment, similar to the dismemberment of animals in Genesis 15, and points to redemptive judgment seen in the sacrifice of Isaac\. True circumcision reflects heart\-consecration to the covenant Lord\. Baptism is compared to circumcision in terms of symbolism and theological import\. It represents divine judgment and participation with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection, functioning to consecrate individuals into a holy community separate from the profane world\. *4\. Compatibility of Promise and Obligation\. *Obedience is not the grounds for receiving or retaining kingdom blessings\. The Abrahamic covenant requires human obedience as evidence of faith appropriating righteousness, without implying a works principle\. The foundation of blessing lies in Christ's obedience\. *5\. The Works Principle and the Typical Kingdom\. *According to Kline, the Mosaic Covenant operates under a works principle\. Paul's discussions in Galatians 3 and Romans 10 highlight the law's principle as antithetical to promise\-faith\. However, the Mosaic Covenant does not annul the Abrahamic promise\. The Israelites' continued tenure in the promised land depended on national fidelity to the divine King\. The New Covenant, established on God's sovereign grace in Christ, cannot be broken\. Abraham's obedience served as a basis for Israel's inheritance of Canaan but not for the inheritance of heaven, ultimately symbolizing the Messiah's sacrificial obedience\.

__II\. Promises of the Covenant__

__A\. Résumé of Roots\. __The transition from the Edenic creation kingdom to Metapolis reflects the broader scope of the covenant\. __B\. Blessed and Blessing\. __Abraham is both blessed and made a blessing, roles that find fulfillment in Christ as the ultimate Blessing\. The imperative to "be a blessing" signifies redemption as a form of re\-creation, with Abraham serving as a mediator\. The promise of a "great nation and great name" echoes the blessing given to Shem\. __C\. Promised Kingdom on Two Levels\. __*1\) The Promised King\. *Abraham's role as father of nations suggests the emergence of kings, with a focus on kingship that becomes more specific in Jacob's blessing to his sons, particularly Judah\. This encompasses two levels: Judah's royal supremacy in Israel through David and the coming of Jesus Christ, Shiloh, introducing a new covenant\. *2\) The Promised Kingdom People\. *The fulfillment occurs on two levels: the provisional great nation and the messianic, eternal promise\. Paul identifies this promise as realized in the spiritual children of Abraham, justified by faith, and integrated into the messianic new covenant\. *3\) The Promised Kingdom\-Land\. *Canaan, depicted as God's holy land, stands distinct from common grace, granted to people within redemptive election for conquest\. It reflects continuity with the creation kingdom, symbolized by its description as a new Eden and pointing to the New Jerusalem\. __D\. Typal and Antitypal Kingdom\. __*1\) Covenantal and Dispensational Hermeneutics\. *The relationship between covenantal and dispensational perspectives examines how the two levels of the Abrahamic covenant relate\. Dispensationalism often misunderstands scriptural continuity, focusing on literalistic interpretations of typologies meant to signify fulfillment in the New Covenant\. *2\. Typological Unity and Succession\. *The development of theocratic kingship follows a single line, culminating from the Old Testament people to the Church\. This is evidenced in the analogy of an olive tree, unifying one kingdom inheritance\. Abraham did not see the promise's fulfillment, indicating a second level realization\. *3\) Dispensationalism at Odds with the Gospel\. *Dispensationalism’s emphasis on a works principle in the Old Testament does not align with the grace offered in the Gospel\. This helps explain why some hold to Zionism, viewing it as lacking spiritual focus\. *4\. Evolving Dispensationalism\. *Some newer dispensationalists recognize that the eschatological blessings of salvation arise not from works but from God's grace in Christ, while denying a works principle in the Mosaic covenant\. Scripturally, in Christ, distinctions between Jews cease, negating a separate future salvation\-kingdom for Jewish Christians\. *5\. Antitype Kingdom and the Millennium\. *The expectation of a geographically limited premillennial kingdom for Jews conflicts with Scripture, which states evil remains until the final judgment\. The distinction lies between a geographically bounded typal kingdom and the supernatural, eternal New Jerusalem\. *6\. Design of the Typal Kingdom\. *Governed by the works principle, the typal kingdom sets the context for the messianic mission and offers a preparatory spiritual structure, serving as a schoolmaster to Christ\. Ethnic particularism in the typal kingdom functioned to prevent further decline and preserve the covenant community\.

__Chapter Four: Pre\-Kingdom Abrahamic Community__ explores the structure and dynamics of the Abrahamic community before the formal establishment of the kingdom\. It examines the political and familial roles, highlighting Abraham's leadership and patriarchal authority\. The community is portrayed not just as a family but as a covenant congregation, with spiritual leadership intertwined with familial duties\. Additionally, the text discusses the presence of the divine through angelic theophanies and prophetic altars, which foreshadow the coming kingdom and emphasize the community's spiritual focus and identity\. The role of the Spirit is noted in maintaining the community’s covenantal identity and mission, prefiguring future re\-creation and renewal\.
