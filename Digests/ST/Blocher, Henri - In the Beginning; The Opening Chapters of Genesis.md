__Henri Blocher – In The Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis__

__1\. Approaching Genesis__

__Interest in Origins\.__ The beginnings are key to understanding fundamental principles and nature\. Genesis, historically accepted at face value, has been subjected to various interpretations with the advent of modern science\. __Word of Man, Word of God__\. Genesis must be approached as inspired scripture, using the method of *analogia fidei*—interpreting parts of scripture in the context of the whole\. This requires recognizing its authoritative nature while understanding its literary elements, genres, and human elements like tropes and figures of speech\. __The Places of the Sciences\.__ While language and history sciences are vital for exegesis, natural sciences also play a role\. Blocher discusses several attitudes\. *Concordism* seeks harmony between scripture and science but risks imposing scientific views onto biblical text\. *Antiscientism* tends towards a literal interpretation, questioning the presumptions behind scientific accounts\. *Fideism* distinguishes scripture as doctrinal truth from scientific realms, arguing that Scripture is doctrinal rather than historical\. God is indeed distinguished from the world but not *separate*\. The Bible is indeed not a handbook for science but does have something to say which touches the realm of the scientist \(God is the cause of everything that exists\)\. Blocher argues that each approach has good and bad points but that the first concern is discerning the maning of the biblical text\. Science has a ministerial, servant\-role and is subject to Biblical authority\.

__The Two 'Tablets' of Creation\.__ The "two tablets" of creation in Genesis indicate a dual structure in which Genesis 2:4 serves as either a conclusion or introduction\. The first account \(Genesis 1:1\-2:3/4\) is structured around seven days, while the second \(Genesis 2:4\-3:24\) includes seven structural elements\. Traditional documentary hypotheses, suggesting separate sources \(Yahwist for the second, Priestly for the first\), have been largely rejected in favor of seeing the text as the work of Moses, incorporating a simple prologue and genealogy\. __The prologue__ is marked by simplicity, emphasizing the lack of rhetorical flourish\. The narrative of Genesis 1 employs exalted, semi\-poetical language—lacking typical Hebrew poetic features like parallelism but using rhythmic sentences and alliterations akin to a hymn, reflecting a narrative of intricate design using symbolic numbers like threes, sevens, and tens\. This composite genre, a highly stylized narrative, rejects theories of origin in pagan myths or oral tradition\. The mode of revelation aligns with Wisdom writing—reflecting meditation on God’s creative acts without being tied to visions\. __The second tablet__ closely resembles mythic language yet achieves a high literary and theological standard, utilizing word plays and theological richness that suggest a deliberate stylistic distance from myth\. This "learned ingenuousness" uses common language to convey its unique theological message\. Historically, the church read Genesis literally, but its mixed genre calls for an interpretation beyond a simple literal reading\.

__2\. The Week of Creation\.__

__God's Rest and Time\.__ God's rest on the seventh day is an allusion to the Sabbath, raising questions about how to interpret the days of creation\. Four theories offer different perspectives: __*The Reconstructionist Theory*\.__ Proposed by Thomas Chalmers, this theory suggests a gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2, positing a catastrophe, possibly linked to Satan's fall, leaving the earth "formless and void\." However, the Hebrew grammar of "became" contradicts this, requiring implausible alterations in meanings such as "remake," thus lacking textual support\. __*The Concordist Interpretation*\.__ This 19th\-century theory argues the days represent long epochs, not literal days\. Supporters note "yom" can mean different time periods and highlight the seventh day’s lack of closure\. However, the context suggests a 24\-hour day, and scientific order conflicts \(e\.g\., stars created after vegetation\) make it untenable\. __*The Literal Interpretation*\.__ Historically dominant, especially among Reformers, this view takes the Genesis days as literal, 24\-hour days, asserting them as a straightforward chronological narrative\. Critics, including Blocher, note that dismissing scientific consensus on earth’s age requires significant assumptions, although such interpretation has historical backing\. __*The Literary Interpretation / Framework Theory\.*__ Rooted in Augustine, Aquinas, and others, this view treats the creation week as an artistic, non\-literal framework organized to convey theological themes, particularly the Sabbath's significance\. Focusing on thematic and theological content rather than strict chronology solves discrepancies in day length and order without conflicting with scientific findings\. It highlights Genesis's structural symmetry, such as the geometric alignment of two triads of days, and positions the fourth day as central, connecting the creation narrative's progression with Sabbath theology\. Within this framework, two peaks emerge: __mankind and the Sabbath__\. Humanity's purpose is tied to the Sabbath, emphasizing their role in glorifying and enjoying God\. God's rest from creation underscores His sovereignty, revealing time and history as arenas for divine revelation and redemption, where God remains transcendent and unabsorbed by His creation\.
