__Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting – J\. Cooper__

__Chapter One: Traditional Christian Anthropology and Its Modern Critics\. __

__I\. Early Christian Views of the Afterlife\. __Personal Existence Post\-Death: Diverse beliefs about life after death were present, including immediate transition to heaven or hell, or temporary sojourn in places like hades or purgatory\. Despite variations, a cohesive theme was belief in the resurrection and the intrinsic goodness and continued necessity of the body\. The soul/spirit could exist independently from the body, reflecting either trichotomous or dichotomous perspectives, with dualism prevailing\. 

__II\. Dualistic Anthropologies\. __*A\. Augustine\. *Against Platonic Dualism: Augustine refuted the idea of eternally existing souls and affirmed the goodness of the body\. He advocated for soul\-body unity, where the soul permeates and morally guides yet surpasses the body due to its immortality\. *B\. Thomas Aquinas\. *Distinct Substance Unity: Building on Augustine, Aquinas merged Aristotelian thought, proposing the soul as an immaterial intellectual substance surviving death, though incomplete without the body, focused primarily on actualizing form through function\. *C\. John Calvin\. *Intermediate State Advocacy: Calvin described the soul as an immortal incorporeal substance governing the body, residing in an intermediate resting state for fellowship with Christ post\-death\. *D\. René Descartes\. *Substance Dualism: Descartes posited distinct bodily and soulful substances, interacting to form a phenomenological unity during life, with the soul as the thinking self separable from the physical body\. *E\. Conclusion\.*__ __Divergent Views on Unity: Debates centered around the intermediate state, resurrection body, and the nature of unity, deemed essential by Thomists but viewed as more accidental by Augustinians and Cartesians\. 

__III\. Nondualistic Philosophical Anthropologies\. __*A\. Thomas Hobbes and Materialism\. *Material Monism: Hobbes argued that consciousness is a bodily byproduct, denying any intermediate state while asserting that resurrection involves God raising both bodies and their mechanically generated souls\. *B\. Baruch Spinoza and Dual\-Aspect Monism\. *Unified Reality Perspective: Spinoza introduced dual\-aspect monism, in which everything, including God and Nature, is one substance\. Humans, as expressions of this substance, have impermanent modes of soul and body\. *C\. Conclusion\. *Critiques of Soul Immortality: Both Hobbes and Spinoza presented challenges to traditional Christianity, questioning the notion of an immortal, separable soul\.

__IV\. The Scientific Challenge to Dualism\. __Consciousness and Neuroscience: Scientific exploration challenges dualism by asserting mind\-body unity, with the brain generating consciousness\. Psychology argues that behavior is stimulus\-driven rather than spiritually influenced\. 

__V\. The Challenge to Dualism from Biblical Scholarship\. __Scriptural Terms Reinterpreted: Biblical words like *nephesh*, *ruach*, *psyche*, *soma*, and *sarx*, previously thought non\-material, must be reassessed, with Old Testament ideas about the afterlife being practically non\-existent\.

__VI\. The Historical\-Theological Challenge to Dualism\. __Cultural Interactions: Initially, the Greco\-Roman tragic unity of spirit and matter influenced Christian thought towards dualism, later contrasted with Hebrew holistic views\. Figures like Augustine transitioned from Platonism to dualism, meeting critique from Von Harnack\. 

__VII\. The Challenge to Dualism from Christian Orthopraxis\. __Dualophobia and Its Effects: Fears of dualism potentially devalue human life, fostering more dualist dichotomies like nature vs\. grace and sacred vs\. secular, leading to exploitation and social ills\.

__VIII\. Conclusion\. __Christianity's Dualist Legacy: Historically dualist due to the intermediate state concept, Christianity contends with emerging holistic/monistic perspectives suggesting humans are inherently bodies, not possessors of them\.

__Chapter Two: Old Testament Anthropology: The Holistic Emphasis__

__I\. Introduction: The State of the Debate\. __*A\. Traditional Christian Dualism\. *Christian Platonism significantly shaped biblical interpretation, especially through translations where Hebrew terms like *ruach*  and *nephesh* were rendered into Greek as *pneuma* and* psyche*, thus reinforcing dualistic interpretations\. *B\. Modern Christian Antidualism\. *There has been a movement towards holism and monism, as critics like Von Harnack argue against dualism's Platonic roots\. They contend that Greek thought permits survival after death, whereas the Hebrew perspective is more integrative, prioritizing unity\. *C\. Some Questions\. *Cooper probes into what the Old Testament truly articulates and how it was shaped by Greek influences\. He suggests that a balanced understanding combines the Hebrew focus on integrated unity with a notion of continued existence beyond death\. 

__II\. The Holistic Emphasis of the Old Testament\. __*A\. Antidualist Emphases\. *The Old Testament challenges Christian Platonism's separation of material body and spiritual soul\. It does not endorse viewing posthumous existence as more spiritual, contesting such dualistic interpretations\. *B\. Old Testament Anthropological Terms\.*__ __*Nephesh* traditionally translates as "soul," but in context, it refers to physical aspects like the throat, living beings \(including animals\), or self\-identity\. *Ruach*, often "spirit," denotes life force and embodies higher subjective potentials, frequently linked to divine breath\. *Basar*, meaning "flesh," describes the body as a vulnerable whole, without implying pure materiality\. Terms like *qereb* and *leb* stand for internal parts, associated with spiritual and ethical impulses, synthesizing emotional and rational dimensions\. *C\. Preliminary Results for the Holism\-Dualism Debate\.*__ __The flexibility and interchangeability of these terms in scripture make a clear dualistic interpretation challenging\. *Nephesh* and *ruach* relate to the complete psychophysical person, with frequent synecdoche illustrating the whole person, rather than isolating discrete parts\. 

__III\. Philosophical Reflections\. __*A\. The Old Testament, Holism, and Monism\. *The Old Testament's holistic approach avoids extremes like monism and Platonic dualism\. It acknowledges a unity composed of interdependent elements, allowing ontological holism whereby an entity's identity derives from its systemic unity, and not solely from a single substance or material entity\. *B\. The Old Testament and Philosophical Anthropology\. *There are suggestive parallels between Aristotle's ideas and Old Testament thought, where ruach can be likened to form or soul, and dust to matter\. However, these parallels do not imply direct philosophical alignment, as the Old Testament maintains its narrative and theological distinctiveness\. Exploring these facets of Old Testament anthropology lays the groundwork for further discussions on post\-death existence, which becomes more complex in subsequent chapters\.

__Chapter Three: Old Testament Anthropology: The Dualistic Implication\.__

__I\. The Old Testament View of Existence after Death\. __The prevailing belief among Hebrews leaned towards annihilation after death, as opposed to eternal existence\.  A\. Introduction: The Rephaim in Sheol

The term "rephaim" refers to shadows, indicating that the dead were perceived more as insubstantial shadows rather than souls\. This concept implies a form of ontic dualism, suggesting the possibility of something persisting beyond biological death, separate from earthly life\. *B\. Sheol\. *Sheol is sometimes equated with the grave and is envisioned in Hebrew cosmology as a realm beneath the earth resembling Hades\. It is viewed neither as scientifically literal nor purely symbolic, but rather a universal destination where all the departed reside\. *C\. Existence in Sheol\. *Life in Sheol is characterized by lethargy and inactivity, lacking work, worship, or knowledge, as depicted in Ecclesiastes 9:10 and Psalms 88:10\-12\. References such as in Isaiah describe interactions among the *rephaim*, and non\-poetic accounts like in Isaiah 8:19 reference consulting with spirits, affirming belief in some form of afterlife\. With necromancy exemplified in 1 Samuel 28, there is evidence of personal identity continuity, marking the existence of shades as differentiated from Platonic or Cartesian minds\. *D\. Terminology for the Dead\. *The term *rephaim* also denotes giants or healing spirits in Ugaritic contexts, indicating a semidivine status attributed to the dead\. *nephesh* is used to describe individuals post\-death, as when Psalms express redemption from Sheol, contributing to the overall understanding of postmortem existence\. *E\. Hope Beyond the Grave; Resurrection\. *The concept of resurrection offers ultimate hope\. Scriptural references such as in the Psalms highlight a hopeful fellowship with Yahweh beyond death\. Texts like Ezekiel 37 and Job 19 suggest renewal and resurrection, while Daniel 12 speaks to judgment and dual destinies without detailing Sheol\. Isaiah 26 subtly alludes to the *rephaim* and resurrection, foundational to later Christian doctrines\. 

__II\. Philosophical Reflection: Holistic Dualism\. __* A\. Clarifying the Anthropological Image\. *Ontological holism, alone, precludes postmortem existence\. However, the account of Samuel hints at an ethereal yet substantial form\. Several alternatives are explored: ghosts as distinct shadows retaining personal identity, hollow of life force and substance, or ghost existence as a continuation of life\-force identity\. Cooper tentatively endorses the latter interpretations\. *B\. Dualism: The Inescapable Implication of Existence in Sheol\. *Despite various understandings of ghosts, Sheol inescapably implies a soul or spirit existing separately from the body, ensuring personal identity continuation\. This leads to two possible frameworks: radical dualism where separate entities exist, or a more integrated holistic dualism\. *C\. Holistic Dualism: Philosophical Implication of Old Testament Anthropology\. *Building from Chapter Two's emphasis on holism and spirit\-soul\-body interplay, Chapter Three elaborates on dualism with post\-death expectations\. While Aristotle denies personal postmortem existence and Plato dismisses holism entirely, Cooper proposes a synthesis akin to Aquinas's hylomorphism fused with Augustinian thought, proposing holistic anthropology complementing postmortem survival\.

__Chapter Six: Anthropology and Personal Eschatology in the New Testament: The Non\-Pauline Writings\.__

__I\. Introduction: Refining the Terms of the Debate\. __In the discussion of monism versus dualism, the New Testament's eschatology offers insights, with Cooper pointing towards a historical context that aligns with holistic dualism\.

__II\. Dualism in the Anthropological Terminology\. __*A\. "Spirit\." *In texts like 1 Peter 3:19\-20, references to "spirits in prison" could indicate an intermediate state of disembodied souls or refer to pre\-incarnate actions by Christ\. Hebrews 12:33 describes "spirits" of the righteous perfected, suggesting human entities continuing beyond physical existence\. The act of "giving up the spirit," as seen in Jesus's crucifixion, implies a transfer of life force, signifying the spirit as an ongoing entity beyond death\. *B\. "Soul\." *Revelation discusses the souls of martyrs who await resurrection, implying an intermediate state with conscious awareness\. Matthew 10:28 introduces the soul's condition apart from the body, linking to contemporary Jewish dualist beliefs of the soul's temporary, bodyless state\. *C\. Summary on "Soul" and "Spirit\." *The terms "soul" and "spirit" are often used to denote deceased individuals who maintain existence\. Although interpretations like in 1 Peter 3 can be ambiguous, they generally support the concept of a non\-material yet enduring existence\.

__III\. Is There a Non\-Pauline Eschatology? __*A\. The Time of the Resurrection\. *Biblical passages such as Luke 20:35 and John 5:28 address post\-death aspects like marriage and judgment timing in the resurrection, informing debates about immediate resurrection versus an intermediate phase\. *B\. The God of the Living\. *The debate over immediate versus future resurrection emerges, with contrasting views between models of extinction\-re\-creation, immediate resurrection, and intermediate state\. *C\. The Transfiguration\. *The presence of Moses and Elijah during the Transfiguration prompts questions around resurrection, implying possibilities of immediate resurrection or continued existence\. *D\. The Rich Man and Lazarus\. *This narrative subtly suggests an intermediate state, highlighted by details like the Rich Man’s still\-living brothers and the use of Hades instead of Gehenna\. *E\. Jesus and the Thief on the Cross\. *Jesus’s promise to the thief about being in paradise "today" is taken literally, aligning with Jewish ideas of an intermediate resting place for the dead\. *F\. Where Was Jesus Between Good Friday and Easter Sunday? *The context indicates that Jesus resided in paradise, a place for the blessed dead\. This is consistent with theological assertions that divine nature remains unaltered, supporting the concept of an intermediate state\. *Provisional Conclusion\.*__ __The notion of an intermediate state is embraced in non\-Pauline writings, leading to an examination of its potential contradiction or harmonization with Pauline teachings\.

__Chapter Seven: Anthropology and Personal Eschatology in the New Testament: The Pauline Epistles__

__I\. Introduction\. __Pauline eschatology is a well\-researched field, focusing on Paul's views on life after death and how they integrate or contrast with broader theological concepts\. 

__II\. Relevant Pauline Texts\.__

*A\. Acts 23:6\-8\. *This passage references the Pharisaic belief in resurrection, angels, and spirits suggest a conscious intermediate state until the future general resurrection\. Paul, educated as a Pharisee, likely held this comprehensive eschatological framework, indicating a belief in an intermediate resurrection\.

*B\. I Thessalonians 4:13\-18\. *Paul discusses the future resurrection of those who have "fallen asleep\." The term "sleep" is used ambiguously but leans towards a state of "soul\-sleep," suggesting an intermediate condition awaiting resurrection\. This is further supported in 1 Thessalonians 5:10, with references to awake and asleep aligning with living and dead states\.

*C\. I Corinthians 15\. *Paul emphasizes the final resurrection following a period of "sleep," implying an intermediate state due to the staggered timing of human deaths\. While the soul goes unmentioned, Cooper notes this neither directly supports dualism nor excludes monistic interpretations\. The use of metaphor, such as the seed analogy, hints at a continuity and potential dualist view within Paul's theology\.

*D\. II Corinthians 5:1\-10\. *In verses 1\-5, metaphors of tents, buildings, and clothing raise the topic of existence without the body\. While some interpret this as challenging the intermediate state, others argue these metaphors refer to a temporary status, with "nakedness" denoting awaiting full resurrection\. Verses 6\-10 contrast bodily existence with being in the presence of the Lord, lending support to both immediate resurrection and intermediate states, depending on interpretation\. Cooper argues that immediate resurrectionists lean on monistic assumptions, while the text remains open to intermediate interpretations\.

*E\. II Corinthians 12:1\-4\. *Paul reflects on ecstatic or visionary experiences, contemplating whether they occurred in the body or apart from it\. This opens a possibility for temporary disembodied experiences, which aligns with the concept of an intermediate state\.

*F\. Philippians 1:21\-24\. *Paul speaks of departing to be with Christ, paralleling 2 Corinthians 5:6\-10, which negates the idea of extinction after death, supporting an immediate transition or an eventual resurrection\. His interchangeable use of terms soma and sarx in 1 Corinthians 15 complicates any straightforward conclusion\.

*G\. The Time of the Resurrection in Philippians and Romans\. *In Philippians 3:20\-21, Paul connects resurrection with the second coming, placing the event in a future context rather than an immediate state\. Similarly, Romans 8:18\-23 discusses an anticipated bodily redemption, implying that resurrection is not instantaneous but rather part of an overarching eschatological timeline\.

__III\. Conclusions\.__

*A\. Paul\. *Paul's writings suggest an intermediate state preceding a future general resurrection\. Critiques of immediate resurrection fail to find consistent support, while the notion of extinction\-re\-creation demands symbolic or phenomenological interpretations\. Evidence points to resurrection at the second coming, with ample textual and circumstantial support for an intermediate state preceding the final resurrection\.

*B\. The New Testament as a Whole\. *Paul's teachings align with New Testament eschatology, though scripture remains relatively reticent about the specifics of the intermediate state\. Despite this silence, the conceptual framework aligns with broader theological interpretations\.
