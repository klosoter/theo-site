__Chapter 3 – Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology \(pp\. 55\-70\) – Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

In this chapter, Gaffin explores the relationship and development of Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology\. 

__Developments in Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology__\. Systematic Theology has traditionally aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of biblical teachings\. In contrast, Biblical Theology has had a more problematic history, emerging prominently during the German Pietism movement, which sought to return to the Bible and oppose speculative dogmatics\. Initially, it was not seen as a distinct discipline but simply a different name for a theological approach\. Over time, particularly in the 18th century, Biblical Theology became distinct, marked by a rationalistic rejection of inspiration and canonical unity, with an emphasis on human autonomy\. J\. P\. Gabler played a significant role in defining Biblical Theology as a historical and descriptive discipline aimed at discovering what biblical writers thought and taught\. In contrast, he viewed Systematic Theology as didactic and normative, focusing on contemporary statements of faith based on philosophy and reason\. 

__Predecessors of the Biblical Theology Concept__\. Despite its troubled history, Biblical Theology has found a positive place in the Reformed tradition, notably with Geerhardus Vos, who became a professor of Biblical Theology in 1893\. In his inaugural address, Vos emphasized Biblical Theology as a special discipline\. Charles Hodge viewed Biblical Theology as exegetical theology aimed at ascertaining and stating the facts of Scripture\. Systematic Theology, on the other hand, was seen as harmonizing these facts\. A\. A\. Hodge also considered Biblical Theology as a sub\-branch of Exegetical Theology but did not fully elucidate its relation to Systematic Theology\. B\. B\. Warfield, who came after Vos, considered Biblical Theology the synthesizing crown of Exegetical Theology and a crucial basis for Systematic Theology, although he lacked a precise definition for Biblical Theology\. Vos, acquainted with the works of Bavinck and Kuyper, distinguished himself in his conception of Biblical Theology\. Kuyper rejected the concept and name of Biblical Theology, arguing that theology presupposes dogma, which is a product of the institutional church's life based on completed Scriptures\. Nonetheless, Kuyper was positive about studying the history of revelation, aligning with Vos's interests\. Bavinck, while largely silent on Biblical Theology, stressed the historical\-progressive, deeds\-words combo, and soteriological nature of special revelation\. Vos's conception of Biblical Theology found no true predecessors, but Bavinck and Kuyper influenced him materially, while Warfield provided formal discussion\. 

__Murray's Elaboration on Vos's Concept of Biblical Theology\.__ John Murray defined Biblical Theology as a branch of Exegetical Theology dealing with the process of God's self\-revelation in the Bible\. Both Murray and Vos preferred the term "History of Special Revelation," emphasizing the historical process of divine revelation and its organic character\. Their work underscored the importance of understanding the revelatory process in Scripture and maintaining an organic unity\. Murray and Vos sometimes viewed Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology as separate yet compatible, focusing on either historical/process or logical/product perspectives\. Systematic Theology, from their perspective, should avoid abstraction, grounded instead in the redemptive\-historical unity of Scripture\. Vos argued that Christianity should not rely on isolated proof texts but emerge organically from biblical revelation\. Murray insisted that Biblical Theology is indispensable to Systematic Theology to prevent decontextualized abstraction\. 

__Future Directions and Integration \(Gaffin\)\.__ Both Vos and Murray agree that Systematic Theology must do justice to the historical character of revealed truth, opposing the notion of timeless truths\. They see Biblical Theology as regulative for exegesis, shaping how texts should be understood within the redemptive\-historical framework\. Despite objections to the name "Biblical Theology," Gaffin asserts that significant portions of Scripture, especially Paul's writings and Hebrews, exhibit a systematic and carefully argued theology\. This is crucial for maintaining the continuity of theology with the New Testament even after the completion of Scripture\. Vos initially opposed the idea of this continuity but later recognized its importance\. Gaffin concludes that Biblical Theology should provide comprehensive statements of Scripture’s teachings, ensuring that its divisions are broad and flexible enough to accommodate redemptive\-historically regulated exegesis\. This approach distinguishes Biblical Theology from Systematic Theology while highlighting their interconnectedness\.
