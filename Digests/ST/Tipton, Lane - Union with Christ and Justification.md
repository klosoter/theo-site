__Union with Christ and Justification – Lane Tipton__

The primary focus of Tipton’s article is how the union with Christ bears upon justification\. 1\) the union with Christ is the organizing structure of the *ordo salutis*, and 2\) the imputation of Christ’s righteousness is the *aspect* of the union with Christ and the ground for justification\.

__Union with Christ and Justification: Biblical and Systematic\-Theological Considerations\.__

__1\. Faith\-Union and Salvation Benefits__\. All the saving benefits of the gospel, including justification, sanctification, and adoption, are granted to believers solely through a faith\-union with the crucified and resurrected Christ as presented in Scripture\. This union is foundational for receiving the full spectrum of salvation's transformative effects\.

__2\. Soteric Replication of Christ’s Experience\.__ Union with Christ involves a soteric replication in the believer’s life\-experience of Christ’s own experience, specifically his death and resurrection\. Ephesians 2:5\-6 illustrates this by describing believers as having been made alive with Christ and raised with him into heavenly realms, encapsulating the pattern of death followed by life\.

__3\.__ __Christ’s Resurrection and Eschatological Justification\.__ Christ's bodily resurrection signifies an eschatological event in redemptive history that includes his own justification, adoption, and sanctification\. In 1 Timothy 3:16, Christ is "justified in the Spirit," highlighting a forensic declaration of righteousness\. This resurrection serves as justification because Christ, in his death, bore the guilt and judicial reality of eschatological condemnation as a substitutionary sacrifice for humanity\. Thus, his resurrection marks the fulfillment of the meritorious obedience demanded under the covenant of works\.

__4\. Comprehensive Soteriological Benefits in Christ\.__ Jesus Christ, through his crucifixion and resurrection, encompasses all soteriological benefits distinctly, inseparably, simultaneously, and eschatologically\. First Corinthians 1:30 declares that Christ embodies wisdom from God, righteousness, holiness, and redemption, collectively defining the believer’s comprehensive spiritual estate\.

__5\. Contrast Between Adam and Christ\.__ Romans 5:12\-19 contrasts Adam’s sin, which leads to condemnation and death, with Christ’s obedience, which results in justification and life\. Sin is relational, violating God's covenantal revelation, thus condemning Adam and his representatives\. In contrast, Christ's obedience counters this condemnation, providing life through justification\. His one righteous act reverses the liability to guilt and condemnation, applying his righteousness and obedience to those he represents, with Adam and Christ both serving as representative heads\.

__6\. Significance of Christ’s Obedience and Resurrection\.__ The decisive importance of Christ's obedience and resurrection lies in their profound implications for believers' justification\. Union with Christ ensures that his eschatological victory and redemptive work are applied to believers, securing their justified status and continuing transformation\.

__Union with Christ and Justification: Historical\-Theological Formulations\.__

__Union and Imputation in Reformed Theology: Distinct, Inseparable, and Simultaneous\.__ In Reformed theology, as articulated by Calvin, union with Christ is essential for receiving any redemptive benefits\. This union organizes the core of Calvin's understanding of salvation, where justification \(reconciliation with God\) and sanctification \(spiritual transformation by Christ\) are distinct yet inseparable and simultaneous, mirroring how both are contained within Christ himself\.

__Union and Imputation in Post\-Reformation Lutheran Theology: Distinct, Separable, and Sequential\.__ In Lutheran theology, justification is viewed as preceding and causing the mystical union\. Justification is seen as the foundational doctrine, influencing and surpassing other theological areas like union with Christ and eschatology\. Justification effects the believer’s sanctification as its outcome, maintaining a logical order where justification comes first, contrasting with the simultaneous nature observed in Reformed thought\.

__Union with Christ and Imputation: Inseparable and Indistinct \(N\. T\. Wright – New Perspective on Paul\)\.__ N\. T\. Wright argues that union with Christ in Paul's theology performs the role traditionally assigned to imputation in Protestant thinking, potentially rendering it unnecessary\. However, Tipton emphasizes that there remains a deep convergence between Paul's theology and Protestant thought concerning the inseparability of union with Christ and the imputation of righteousness\. While union encompasses both imputation and renewal as distinct yet intertwined processes, these complexities in their functioning highlight important doctrinal distinctions across perspectives\.
