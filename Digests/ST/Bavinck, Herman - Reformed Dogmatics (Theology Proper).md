__*Theology Proper *– Herman Bavinck \(Reformed Dogmatics 2\)__

__Divine Mystery and Incomprehensibility__

161\. Bavinck introduces the knowledge of God as the core content of theology, echoing Augustine's and Calvin's sentiments that knowing God constitutes the essence of life and theology\. This knowledge, though foundational, is not merely intellectual; it encompasses worship, love, and service\. God is knowable as He reveals Himself through Scripture, both as transcendent and immanent\. While Old Testament revelation is seen as partial and preparatory, the New Testament revelation through Jesus Christ is supreme and complete, affirming God's nature as both incomprehensible and knowable\.

162\. He elaborates on the unique Scriptural unity of God's personality and absoluteness, contrasting with Platonic and Gnostic views, which render God as distant and ineffable\. Christian theology asserts that while God's essence is ultimately unknown, He is not entirely unknowable\. Augustine highlights this by describing God as "being," suggesting that language falls short of capturing His essence, and that knowing God involves an acknowledgment of His incomprehensibility\.

163\. The discussion extends to Pseudo\-Dionysius and John Scotus, who propose that God transcends both being and knowledge, recognized only through His effects\. Positive theology gives way to a superior negative theology\. In Scholastic Theology, Aquinas differentiates between faith\-based and reason\-based knowledge, asserting God is only knowable through the perfections evident in creation\. However, Scholasticism’s detailed dialectic treatment risks overlooking divine incomprehensibility\. Nominalism, mysticism, and subsequently Roman Catholicism in the Reformation era emphasized the unknowability of God's essence, treating God as ineffable\. Reformers like Luther and Calvin pointed out the speculative nature of defining God, focusing instead on His nature as revealed\.

164\. Bavinck notes that Kant reaffirmed God's incomprehensibility, regarding Him as a necessary postulate for knowledge, thus minimizing metaphysics\. Influential figures like Fichte and Schleiermacher considered God not as knowable through epistemology but as the content of religious experience\. The theological focus shifted towards viewing God as a human projection, ultimately leading to the agnostic stance of positivism which limited knowledge to the observable and relegated theological knowledge to a science of religion\.

165\. Bavinck critiques agnosticism's emphasis on the finite limitations of human knowledge and the interdependence of object and subject, noting that while human understanding of God is anthropomorphic, it remains analogical and reliant on divine revelation\. Christian theology tension exists between perceiving God as both personal and absolute; God's interactions with humanity reveal His nature\.

166\. Bavinck acknowledges God as incomprehensible and ineffable\. Although God surpasses our rational grasp, we have an analogical understanding of Him through His revelation, where His eternal and infinite qualities are made known in finite and temporal terms\. This divine mystery is a gift to be accepted in faith, moving beyond shallow rationalism and acknowledging revelation as the means by which God is truly known\.

__The Problem of Atheism / Cognitio Dei insita\.__

167\. Bavinck asserts that God's revelation, while not exhaustive, confirms His knowability\. This is grounded in the scriptural affirmation that only the Son fully knows the Father\. God is made known through creation, which serves as a theater of His glory\. Bavinck argues that theoretical atheism, the belief that God does not exist, is extremely rare, as acknowledging a personal God is both natural and normal\. Practical atheism, living without acknowledgment of God, may exist, but denying God requires omniscience and omnipresence—traits that would make one God, thus refuting atheism\. 

168\. He reviews philosophical explanations for the universality of religious belief, which is considered innate in ancient and various philosophical traditions:

- Plato speaks of universal ideas\.
- Aristotle presents axiomatic principles\.
- The Stoics discuss divine common sense or implanted preconceptions\.
- Cicero claims that belief in God is a part of human nature\.

Philosophers like Descartes and Kant also discuss innate aspects of perception and reason, while Hegel and Fichte \(idealists\) assume antecedent knowledge\. However, Socinianism and empirical philosophers like Locke and Hobbes critique the concept of innate ideas, arguing that all knowledge stems from sensory experience\. Evolutionary thinkers dismiss innate ideas, suggesting instead that mind and ideas develop gradually from a blank slate\.

169: Christianity and Innate Ideas? Bavinck questions the concept of innate ideas within Christianity, acknowledging some universal natural truths, but suggesting these are not strictly innate but gifts of grace\. Scholasticism supports the abstraction of knowledge about God from sensory observation—where God's existence and attributes are discernible through perception and reflection\. This reflects a 'natural theology' founded on a habitus: a natural disposition guiding the mind from finite observations to infinite understanding\.

__Natural Theology__

Bavinck discusses Calvin's concepts of *sensus divinitatis* and *semen religionis*, which affirm natural theology against the Lutheran denial\. God's glory is perceivable both in the microcosm of human beings and the macrocosm of creation\. However, Reformed theologians universally reject the notion of "innate ideas\."

170\. Christian theology supports "natural theology" but refutes "innate ideas" to avoid the pitfalls of rationalism and mysticism\. Belief in innate ideas implies human autonomy and self\-sufficiency, negating the necessity of God and aligning with pantheistic notions, as seen in the idealism of Hegel, who posits universe construction from human thought\. Scripture depicts humans as dependent image bearers of God\. Mysticists and rationalists err by neglecting sensory primacy, overestimating immediate awareness, and conflating the orders of knowing and being\. Instead, Christian theology starts with creation as God's revelation, with our knowledge of God being analogical, mediated through diverse means such as senses, language, and cultural transmission\.

171\-172\. While rejecting innate ideas and emphasizing sensory perception, natural knowledge should not be undervalued\. God's revelation in nature interacts with human consciousness, providing intuitive implanted knowledge, while acquired knowledge results from reflective reasoning\. These forms of knowledge are closely tied but distinct from the divine revelation in Scripture\. Bavinck posits that all sciences rely on general, self\-evident principles, driving us toward empirical knowledge to explain our understanding\. Humans enter the world with the capacity \(aptitude, faculty\) and inclination \(habitus, disposition\) to acquire firm and certain knowledge of God, contradicting the idea of the mind as a tabula rasa\.

__"Proofs" for God's Existence__

173\. Bavinck notes that Scripture does not attempt to prove God's existence; it assumes human acknowledgment of God and speaks with authority\. A valid natural theology exists in Christian conviction of what can be known apart from special revelation, though it does not stand independently\. Ontological and teleological proofs have faced serious critique from modern thinkers like Kant and Darwin, though the moral argument retains some persuasive power\.

174\. The proofs considered include: *Cosmological and Teleological Arguments*: These arguments deduce God's existence from the world's origin and purpose\. The cosmological argument relies on the law of causality, asserting an ultimate cause that is infinite and eternal\. However, its weakness lies in the inability to specify the nature or character of this cosmic cause, leaving a gap between philosophy and Scripture\. The teleological argument suggests order and purpose imply an intelligent cause, countered by materialism's denial of purpose and pantheism's impersonal cause\. Bavinck emphasizes that claims about a purposive creation are matters of faith, reinforced by Scripture, philosophy, and common experience\. The *Ontological Argument* argument infers existence from thought, as Anselm argues that the concept of a maximal being necessitates existence\. Bavinck sees this as a witness eliciting a human response, rather than a definitive proof\.\- Moral Argument: Posits a supreme lawgiver based on human moral consciousness\. Critics argue morality is a survival mechanism, challenging the idea of a supreme moral authority\. Yet, the persistence of universal moral values suggests a supreme morality, functioning as a compelling witness rather than proof\.\- Argument from Universal Consent: Asserts religion's universality among humans, pointing to the fundamentally religious nature of humanity\. Although it serves as a powerful witness, it does not provide detailed knowledge of God\. Historical\-Theological Argument: Highlights progress in intellectual and material culture and the notion of providence, which has increasingly been supplanted by faith in evolutionary progress\. These arguments, while not definitive proofs, offer significant witnesses to divine existence and prompt reflection on the nature of God\.

__Naming God: Accommodation and Anthropomorphism__

178\. The question of how our knowledge of God compares to God's self\-knowledge is critical in theological discussions\. According to Bavinck, only God can name himself, and these names signify his perfections, such as YHWH for Israel and Father for the Christian Church\. These divine names do not reveal God's being as such but rather his revelations and complex relationships with his creatures\. Yet, God discloses himself as he truly is, essentially embodying his names\. This revelation occurs through human language, entailing divine accommodation and anthropomorphic expressions rooted in human and earthly relations\. God reveals himself through creation, describing himself using human faculties, body parts, emotions, sensations, and actions\. Proper names for God derive from terms initially used for creatures, subsequently elevated and applied to God\. Incommunicable attributes, such as eternity, emerge from the finite world and are expressed negatively \(e\.g\., eternity as the negation of time\)\. Scriptural attributions for humans are extended to God, albeit anthropomorphically\.

179\. In exploring the entire creation for descriptions of the divine, Scripture supports this comprehensive depiction of God's knowledge\. Augustine highlights the limitations of language, stating, "All things can be said of God but nothing can be said worthily of him\." Bonaventure reflects on this by indicating that creatures' attributes are transferred to the divine, suggesting that God surpasses every name and must be glorified by all\. Calvin asserts that even the smallest aspects of the world reflect God's glory, advocating that nature itself, when observed reverently, is a manifestation of God\. This understanding respects the inherent inequality and hierarchy within creation\.

180\. Despite God's transcendence and incomprehensibility, he remains knowable through his names on a finite level, which is not a contradiction\. Although our understanding of God is accommodated and limited, it is nonetheless real, true, and trustworthy\. God’s revealed attributes faithfully express his nature, allowing humans to anthropomorphize him because he "theomorphized" in creating humanity in his image\. Consequently, our theological knowledge is ectypal or analogical, not merely symbolic, and it remains truthful rather than imaginative\. This knowledge is always analogical, a finite likeness of the perfect understanding God has of himself\. Thus, even though our grasp of God is limited, it is truthful, pure, and reliable, grounded in God's self\-consciousness and his revelation within the cosmos\.

__The Living Acting God__

__The Names of God__

181\. Bavinck emphasizes that God's essence is distinct from creation, and Scripture does not recognize a divine essence that can be understood by human intellect without revelation\. There is no contradiction between God's ontological existence \(essence\) and his "economic" self\-revelation\. God reveals himself as he is, and he is known through his names\. The diversity of names, attributes, and persons does not rest on a "foundational principle" such as Being, the name YHWH, or "Essence\."

182\. Several groups, including Socinians, Arminians, and deists, reject metaphysical questions and focus solely on the will of God, leading to a perception of God as distant\. They reduce God to terms like "Supreme being," "infinite being," or "intelligent being\." Spinoza’s view portrays God as "the absolute, unique, infinite, necessarily existing substance," an immanent first cause\. Thinkers like Hegel and Schleiermacher lean toward pantheism, seeing God as becoming rather than being\. The separation of theology, philosophy, and science reduces divine understanding to morality, emphasizing God as Love\. Bavinck acknowledges the value of this view but warns against its one\-sidedness\.

__Divine Simplicity: Essence and Attributes__

183\. God is simple and free from composition; his attributes are identical with his essence\. Without this identity, there would be a drift toward polytheism\.

184\. God is true being, yet he defies definition\. The being he shares with creatures is not understood univocally but analogically and proportionally\. Terms like "absolute" can describe God if they imply that he exists of and through himself as a perfect being—this concept is known as aseity\.

185\. If God is the only, eternal, and absolute Being, it implies he possesses all perfections, reflected faintly in his creatures\. His essence is indistinguishable from his attributes in unity, yet there is diversity among them\. There is no name adequate to fully express God's being; multiple names aim to convey his transcendent grandeur\.

186\-187\. There are three accepted theological paths for naming God: *via negationis* \(negation\), *via eminentiae* \(eminence\), and *via causalis* \(causality\)\. Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed theologians agree on these methods, highlighting the necessity of starting with revelation\. While the way of eminence and causality is kataphatic, the way of negation is apophatic\. God is the archetype \(original\), and creation is the ectype \(likeness\), enabling analogical knowledge\. In mysticism, God is perceived as both panonymous and anonymous—those who know him best know him without knowing\. Reformed theology differentiates between God’s incommunicable and communicable attributes, opposing pantheism and deism\. Creatures relate to God through communicable attributes like intellect and will, countering deism\. Incommunicable attributes affirm God's essential distinction from creation, countering pantheism\. Each of God's attributes, in different senses, is both incommunicable and communicable\. Negative terms have positive content, allowing us to know and name them\. All creaturely perfections exist uniquely and originally in God, making each attribute, in one sense, incommunicable, and in another, communicable, highlighting both transcendence and relational orientation to the world\.

188\. Scripture not only details God's perfections but also provides personal names\. The name "God" has a disputed etymology, which Bavinck deems unimportant\. What matters is the universal practice of naming God across religions\. Although God intrinsically has no name, names are essential for referring to him\. __El, Elohim, El Shaddai__\. "El" is the simplest name, highlighting power and might, while "Elohim," a plural of abstraction, denotes the God of creation and nature\. "Adonai" refers to God as ruler\. Though these names could be applied to idols, they remain the customary names used to address God\. "El Shaddai" means "the almighty," a special revelation to God's people, like Abraham, signifying a God who commands nature's powers for the work of grace\. __YHWH__\. The LORD, as YHWH, is the God of grace and covenant promise, faithfully saving his people\. YHWH is considered God's real name\. Jewish tradition treated YHWH as God's essence and proper name, forbidding its pronunciation\. Its etymology is debated but possibly signifies "the one who is" or "will be what he will be," highlighting God as the Faithful and eternally Self\-consistent One, possessing aseity\. __YHWH Sabaoth__\. This name adds emphasis to YHWH, with "Sabaoth" \("hosts"\) possibly referring to angels or the cosmos, not in a warlike sense but illustrating God's glory as a king\. In this sense, "angels" is fitting\. YHWH is "the One who remains faithfully gracious," and YHWH Sabaoth is "a king in his glory, governing as the Almighty, surrounded by angels, receiving honor from all creation\." 

191: NT following LXX uses translated names of OT Father\. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ introduces the name "Father," highlighting God's familial relationship with his people\. While "Father" is used in pagan religions and the Old Testament \(indicating a theocratic relationship\), in the New Testament, it conveys God's personal, ethical, and individual connection with his children, transitioning from a theocratic kingdom to the kingdom of God\. Bavinck concludes that "Father" is the supreme revelation of God\.

__God's Incommunicable Attributes__

__Aseity/Independence__\. God's aseity, or independence, rooted in the name YHWH, signifies his status as the ultimate being\. Reformed theology favors "independence," encompassing all aspects of God—existence, perfections, works, and decrees—emphasizing the creator\-creature distinction against pantheism\. __Immutability__\. God remains unchanged while creation shifts; this immutability flows from his aseity\. Despite entering relationships with creatures, God's essence and being never vary\. His consistency is like the sun’s unchanging nature, according to Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\. __Infinity__\. God's immutability implies his infinity regarding time and omnipresence regarding space\. God is boundless in perfection and virtues, existing without the limitations faced by creatures\. __Eternity__\. God's eternity transcends time, being a quality not bound by time's constraints; he has no beginning, end, or succession\. Although not subject to time, God maintains a relation to every moment, independent of temporal existence\. __Omnipresence__\. God is present throughout creation by transcending spatial limits\. Not confined to any "place," he uniquely exists within himself while relating to creatures\. Against deism, God fills space and time; against pantheism, he remains transcendent\. __Unity__\. God's unity involves singularity \(numerical oneness\) and simplicity \(non\-composite nature\), rejecting polytheism, pantheism, and deification of humans\. This unity aligns with the cohesive nature of morality and truth\. __Simplicity__\. God's simplicity means his attributes are identical with his essence, which negates any composite nature\. God’s attributes and essence are undivided, aligning with Augustine's notion that divine simplicity embraces multiplicity\.

__God's Communicable Attributes__

__Intellectual Attributes__

__Spirituality\. __Rooted in simplicity, spirituality implies God's incorporeality, contrasting with the corporeal language in the Old Testament, which is anthropomorphic\. God is self\-existent, omnipresent, incomparable, invisible, and unpicturable\. The New Testament articulates that God is spirit\. Theosophists and similar groups propose God has a body, but Christians maintain his spirituality as a unique, immaterial substance distinct from the universe, imperceptible and without composition\. Human spirit serves as an analogy to divine spirituality, understood analogically rather than univocally or symbolically\. __Invisibility__\. God's spirituality inherently leads to invisibility\. Essential vision of God is deemed impossible, rebuffing mysticism\. Reformed theology holds that, while there's some beholding of God by the blessed in heaven, humans cannot eternally perceive the infinite essence due to their finitude – deification of humanity is impossible\. 

__Knowledge, Foreknowledge, Middle Knowledge\. __Scripture portrays God’s knowledge as an intellectual "light," encompassing all and implying a moral obligation\. God's omniscience counters pantheistic notions of an unconscious unity; he is self\-conscious and intelligent\. God knows inherently \(a priori\), unlike humans' experiential knowledge \(a posteriori\)\. There is no divine foreknowledge based on temporal distinctions; all is immediately present to God\. Discussions on omniscience and free will, from Origen to Augustine, recognize faith in both concepts despite human limitations\. Middle Knowledge, diverging from Augustine and Aquinas, suggests God's knowledge stems from creaturely will, challenging the stability of divine promises\. __Wisdom\. __Creation, providence, and revelation reflect God's wisdom, deemed purposeful and goal\-oriented\. Augustine credits creation to divine thought, with reality fashioned from God’s eternal designs\. Divine wisdom governs all, embodied in a creative analogy to human art\. __Trustworthiness__\. The ultimate intellectual attribute, God’s trustworthiness, represents truth and faithfulness, setting him apart from false gods\. Scriptural truth manifests metaphysically, ethically, and logically, represented entirely through Christ's revelation\. 

__Moral Attributes__

__Goodness__\. God exemplifies absolute goodness, embracing perfection and blessedness, typified by rest in plenitude\. His supreme goodness encompasses mercy, patience, grace, and love\. __Holiness\. __

God is holy, signaling he’s morally perfect and distinct from the profane creation\. For Israel, God's holiness encompassed deliverance and moral guidance\. Christ epitomizes redemption via divine holiness, leading to sanctification\. __Righteousness \(Justice\)\. __God's righteousness embodies just governance and vindication\. Forensically, he's humanity’s judge, administering retributive and remunerative justice\. His righteousness integrates divine virtues, asserting human rights through divine analogy\. __God's Sovereign Will__\. 207\. God's sovereign will, rooted in his role as Creator and Lord, governs all aspects of existence\. Hegel emphasizes the transition from being and actuality to becoming and potentiality, suggesting a dynamic process in divine operations\. Schelling prioritizes will, positing that "ultimately, there is no other being than volition\." He argues that if will is equated with striving, true rest or blessedness is unattainable for creatures unless through the annihilation of the will, a perspective Bavinck links to Buddhism and pantheistic mysticism\. Christianity, in contrast, seeks blessedness through harmony with divine will, as God wills his own delight and good pleasure\. God's will is inherently coexistent with his being\. 208\. God’s essence encompasses both freedom and necessity, as he eternally delights in himself and acts with liberty toward creation\. Medieval Nominalism, particularly Duns Scotus, embraced the idea of absolute freedom of will, asserting that human will is the total cause of its actions, even surpassing intellect\. This perspective led to interpretations of God's will as arbitrary, detached from nature and perfection, and promoted formal arbitrariness\. In Christian theology, God's nature, rather than his will, is the starting point\. Existence depends on divine will, while the essence lies in God's mind\. God operates with supreme wisdom, eschewing arbitrary or accidental actions, in contrast to pantheistic and deistic notions, affirming the goodness intrinsic in God's will\. __The Problem of Evil: Revealed and Hidden Will\. __209\. In addressing the problem of evil, it's crucial to recognize the distinction between God and the world\. God maintains a dual propensity: one towards himself and another towards his creatures\. His relationship with creatures varies; he doesn't act as a father uniformly to all\. The problem of evil encompasses both ethical and physical dimensions\. God's revealed or preceptive will provides us with guidance, setting rules for our conduct\. In contrast, God's hidden will, also known as the will of his good pleasure, represents his ultimate decree, which unfolds according to his divine plan\. __Omnipotence__\. Derived from biblical depictions of might, God's omnipotence is juxtaposed with nominalist notions of arbitrary action\. God's absolute power is consistent with his nature, maintaining coherence with reality's potential, beyond mere existence\. __Perfection, Blessedness, and Glory\. __Embodied by divine perfections, God’s blessedness arises from his completeness\. God's glory, the external display of his internal bliss, glorifies his attributes, eliciting creation’s gratitude and praise, mirroring divine grandeur\.

__The Triune God and His Counsel__

__The Holy Trinity in Scripture__

213\. The Old Testament plants the seeds of the Trinity through creation narratives featuring the Word of God, hypostatized as Wisdom, and the Spirit of God\. In the context of re\-creation, God reveals, saves, and preserves his people via his Word and Spirit, which function objectively in the work of the "angel of the LORD"—a figure that could sometimes be Christ or at other times a mere angel—and subjectively through the Spirit\. The Spirit serves as the principle of life, well\-being, and is associated with various gifts and power, promising to rest eternally on the Messiah and subsequently on all of humanity, offering a new heart and spirit\. This trinitarian aspect is mirrored in the threefold benedictions\.

214\. During the Intertestamental period, in Jewish thought, figures like Philo viewed the Logos as a second God\. Some Jewish traditions included angelology positing intermediaries or hypostases like the Word of God \(memra\), the presence of God's glory \(shekina\), and the oracular voice of God \(bath kol\)\. These were viewed as needing intermediaries between God and the world, including the Spirit \(ruach hakkodesh\) that brought higher knowledge\. However, this view is against the Old Testament’s firm stance against dualism and intermediary figures, which erases the boundary between Creator and creature and lacks soteriological significance\.

215\. In the New Testament, trinitarian language emerges with clear roles: "Father" in relation to the Son; "Son," emphasizing a unique relationship with God as Logos; and "Spirit," associated with the Church’s beauty and completion\. This continuity ties back to the Old Testament through word, deed, prophecy, and miracles, with trinitarian revelation present in events like Jesus' birth, baptism, teaching, and apostolic instruction\.

216\. Scripture delineates relations among the divine persons: the Father as creator, notably of human beings and Israel; the Son as full image of the Father, metaphysically by nature and from eternity; and the Spirit as the immanent principle of life\. While Father is often termed "God," this doesn't imply Arianism, for Christ is also called "God" and "Logos" and is uniquely related to the Father, not as a creature but eternal\. As a mediator, Christ is portrayed as subject to the Father in "office," not "essence" and "nature\."

217\. God the Holy Spirit bears witness to and glorifies Christ, enabling communion with the Father and Son\. The Spirit, present both in the Old and New Testaments, is described with verbs like "proceeding," indicating a personal existence through acts like searching, judging, and teaching\. The Spirit's essential unity with God is evident in creation and re\-creation, equipping Christ and believers for various tasks\. Communion with God occurs exclusively via the Spirit, which grants Christ's benefits: regeneration, adoption, renewal, and spiritual fruits\. The Spirit lives in believers, although Scripture doesn’t present a fully developed trinitarian dogma\.

__The Construction of Trinitarian Dogma__

218\. In early Christianity, Apostolic Fathers opposed Docetic and Ebionite heresies, exalting the Son based on Scripture\. Justin Martyr affirmed Christ's divinity and preexistence but did not fully articulate the immanent relations of the Trinity, presenting a subordination to the Father, although not in an Arian sense\. Important figures like Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen contributed significantly: Irenaeus argued against Gnostics, presenting the Logos as not a creature but true God alongside the Father, but fell short of fully articulating the unity of the Trinity\. Tertullian derived the Trinity from God's being, advancing the understanding of "three persons" and moving beyond Logos speculation to an ontological understanding\. Origen dealt with the Trinity as an eternal process within the divine being but began with the person of the Father rather than God's essence\.

219\. The Council of Nicaea in 325 did not follow Origen's ideas and instead affirmed the full deity of the Son\. Before Nicaea, the theological challenge was explaining threeness from oneness; afterward, it shifted to explaining oneness from threeness\. Key figures like Athanasius, the Cappadocians, and Augustine played pivotal roles in this development\. Athanasius emphasized that the three persons are distinct yet of one essence, with the Father serving as the principal source within the Trinity\. The Cappadocians clarified this through further illustrations and analogies\. Augustine, in "De Trinitate," highlighted the uncompounded essence of God shared among the divine persons and rejected any form of subordinationism, declaring the Father is called such in relation to the Son, not as God’s essence\. In the West, the concept of "filioque" became significant, embraced in the Athanasian Creed but not accepted in the Eastern tradition\.

__The Opposition: Arianism and Sabellianism__\. 

220\. Arianism and Sabellianism formed opposing theological errors: Arianism denied unity to preserve threeness, suggesting Christ was a created but perfect being, relying on Scripture and Aristotelian philosophy\. Sabellianism, or modalism, affirmed unity by making personal distinctions disappear, treating the persons as mere different modes of one God\. Paul of Samosata, pre\-dating Arianism, posited Christ as a human elevated to divinity through adoption during baptism\.

221\. Both Arian and Sabellian positions have persisted: Arianism influenced Socinianism and Unitarianism, while subordinationism appeared among Remonstrants and earlier figures like Tertullian and Clement\. Socinians viewed the Father as the sole true God and the Son as a mere human without preexistence, dismissing the Spirit as divine power without salvific necessity\. Arianism placed the Son and Spirit outside the divine nature, while Sabellianism collapsed personal distinctions within God\. Figures like Joachim of Fiore and David Joris depicted history as successive periods tied to each Trinity person, while thinkers like Michael Servetus repudiated traditional Trinitarian doctrine\.

__Trinitarian Language__

222\. To defend the Trinity, the Church developed language beyond Scripture, which was criticized by others\. Bavinck holds that inferential language is authoritative to safeguard Scripture's truth, primarily setting doctrinal boundaries\. Terms gradually evolved, though often imprecisely\. Tertullian introduced terms like essentia and substantia for God’s being and persona for the persons, formalized later in the West\. Disputes arose over terms like "person," with Boethius’ definition inviting potential tritheism\. Modern interpretations sometimes deny personality to the divine\.

223\. Trinitarian unity includes diversity, confronting errors like Nestorianism and Monophysitism\. The notion of person encompasses self\-existence and rationality\. Modern views often limit personality to finite beings\. Calvin described a person as "subsistence in God's essence," supplementing Augustine, who remarked the term "person" clarifies rather than explains the Trinity\.

__Distinctions Among the Three Persons__

224\. The Trinity presents a certain order and unique personal properties—paternity, filiation, and procession—that are eternal, not accidental\. Each person fully shares the divine nature\.

225\-227\. The Father is defined by non\-begottenness, emphasizing that the Son's eternal existence corroborates the Father's eternity\. The generation of the Son is spiritual, not implying division, akin to God expressing himself fully in the Logos\. The Son is not a creature but eternally generated, confirming the Father’s eternal Fatherhood\. The Holy Spirit’s procession is linked to spiration, affirming its deity, vital for conferring God himself to believers\. The Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, clarifying its unique role without subordinationism per Eastern traditions\.

__The Trinitarian Economy, Analogies, and Arguments__

229\. Trinitarian work *ad extra* is common and indivisible but appropriated to each person—initiated by the Father, accomplished by the Son, and completed by the Spirit\. The roles are mirrored in creation, redemption, and sanctification, reflecting ontological and economic Trinity\. History of revelation depicts periods dominated by each person: the Father in the Old Testament, the Son beginning at incarnation, and the Spirit at Pentecost, without pantheistic notion of Trinity evolving through time\.

230\. Various analogies illustrate the Trinity, from natural elements \(like flame and sun\) to logical constructs theorized by Augustine\. Augustine's favored lover\-loved\-lover analogy reflects relationship dynamics, echoed by others like Bonaventure\. Bavinck views such analogies as speculative yet resonant with biblical thought, avoiding theosophical extremes\.

231\. The Church generally reserved philosophical interpretations of the Trinity, relying on Scripture as proof\. Thomas Aquinas cautioned against proving the Trinity by reason alone, while analogies highlight divine imprints in creation, safeguarding doctrine against deistic abstraction and pantheistic confusion\.

__The Counsel of the Triune God__

232\. God’s Trinitarian being extends to his works, both immanent \(ad intra\) and towards creation \(ad extra\)\. These encompass decrees aligned with God’s counsel and their historical realization, influencing interactions with both wicked and righteous individuals\.

233\. The New Testament affirms God’s eternal knowledge and determinate counsel overseeing all events, including salvation\. God's unalterable and elective plan predicates on his sovereign will rather than universal salvation\.

__The Pelagian Challenge__

234\. The doctrine of God’s counsel faced challenges over human freedom, even influencing Islamic thought\. The Church rejected determinism while upholding moral free will, confronted by Pelagius who denied original sin and posited libertarian free will\. Augustine countered, emphasizing predestination grounded in God’s sovereign will\. 

235\. Pelagianism was condemned, but semi\-Pelagian ideas persisted, undervaluing grace’s irresistibility\. Discussions evolved over God’s will to universally save versus selectively according to consequent conditions, leading to mediating ideas like middle knowledge, suggesting foresight of human use of grace\.

236\. Reformation leaders like Luther and Melanchthon embraced synergism, resembling Remonstrantism, suggesting God’s will accommodates foreseen faith in granting salvation\.

237\. Calvin influenced Reformed confessions by rooting predestination in divine sovereignty, though expressed variably in documents like the Heidelberg Catechism and rigorously in the Canons of Dort and Westminster Confession\.

__Supra\- and Infralapsarianism; Remonstrance__

238\. A main Reformed debate, on the order of decrees, pondered whether predestination preceded creation and the fall \(Supralapsarianism\) or followed \(Infralapsarianism\)\. Augustine saw original sin as the ground for reprobation but argued God’s sovereign will as the ultimate cause\. Calvin was Infralapsarian but alternated between the two as well\. Both positions acknowledge the sovereign good pleasure of God as the root of election and reprobation\.

239\. While milder forms like Infralapsarianism encountered resistance, later philosophical trends and notions of universal love challenged predestination's compatibility with God's character\.

240\. God's counsel, his eternal plan, ensures all events are predestined in his wisdom, rejecting notions of randomness, unlike deistic or pantheistic ideas\. The decree \(ad intra\) differs from execution \(ad extra\), underscoring God’s independence from his works\.

__Providence and the Objections to Predestination__

241\. God’s counsel extends to providence, encompassing preservation and governance of the moral world, countering deterministic or Pelagian views by maintaining God’s sovereignty in all human conduct\.

242\. Scripture presents faith as a gift of grace, rooted in God’s will, not mere foreknowledge\. In practice, Christianity aligns with Augustinian thought, recognizing divine orchestration over history\.

243\-244\. Pelagianism, though untenable and repeatedly reappearing, poses God's decree as antecedent and conditional, offering universal grace\. This stance misaligns with the particular distribution of grace evidenced historically, stressing the efficacy and necessity of grace for salvation\.

__Predestination and Reprobation__

Predestination doctrines employ scriptural insights despite unresolved issues\. Infralapsarianism aligns decrees with a historical order, while Supralapsarianism emphasizes God’s sovereignty in both election and reprobation without resolving tensions about "possible human beings\."

245\-247\. Both Supralapsarian and Infralapsarian views lack comprehensive scripture representation\. Bavinck criticizes the focus on individual decrees instead of the corporate object of election, emphasizing God's glory\. Double predestination cuts to life’s gravity, recognizing God’s sovereign will as ultimate\.

248\-249\. Predestination often culminates in election\. Bavinck underscores pervasive inequality and calls believers to trust God's sovereign will as the absolute ground for all events, rejecting conditionality\. The ultimate grounds of both election and reprobation reside in God's will, not in merit or sin\. Bavinck encourages resting in the comfort that, because election is not based on human merit or effort, salvation is secure\. The object of election includes the people of God in Christ, with Christ as the elect One who assumes the role of mediator and head of the Church, forming a corporate, Christ\-centered view of election that prioritizes communal over individual considerations in God’s eternal decree\.
