__Modern Christian Thought: Volume I – The Enlightenment and the Nineteenth Century – Livingston and Fiorenza__

__Chapter 2: The Religion of Reason\.__

__Protestant Scholasticism\.__ Protestant scholasticism played a pivotal role in the development of the religion of reason\. The rationalistic approach of seventeenth\-century Protestant scholasticism emphasized arriving at truth through logical deductions from first principles, leading to efforts to find a common religious foundation that all rational persons would agree upon\. __John Locke, __considering himself a devout Christian, accepted both reason and the Bible as authoritative\. He categorized propositions as according to reason when their truth could be deduced by examining sensory and reflective ideas; above reason when their truth could not be reasoned from principles; and contrary to reason when inconsistent with clear ideas\. Locke distinguished reason, which derives truths from natural faculties, from faith, which involves assent to propositions based on divine revelation\. However, his followers often did not acknowledge the mystery of faith above reason\. __Voltaire and Deism\.__ In France, Deism was significantly influenced by Voltaire, who, unlike in England where expression was freer, faced persecution\. Voltaire is often seen as a mystical Deist, initially advocating for natural religion with arguments like the necessity of a first cause and the watchmaker analogy\. From 1751, he criticized Christianity while still supporting natural religion and tolerance\. Influenced by events like the Lisbon earthquake and the execution of a Huguenot, Voltaire's writings later fiercely opposed Christianity\. He introduced advanced biblical criticism, highlighting contradictions in the Bible, arguing that less superstition would reduce fanaticism and misery, aiming to purify religion from dogmatic Christianity\. __G\. E\. Lessing,__ known for his influence on Kierkegaard and his defense of religious tolerance, critiqued the proof of Christianity based on historical testimony of miracles or prophecies\. He argued that historical testimonies are less convincing than personal experiences of miracles or prophecies\. Lessing asserted that “accidental historical truths cannot substantiate necessary proofs of reason” and that if there be any "proof" of religion, it must stem from personal experience rather than historical accounts\.

__Chapter 3: The Breakdown of the Religion of Reason\.__

__Rousseau’s__ __Religious Philosophy\.__ Rousseau transitioned among Calvinism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, advocating that religious faith must be grounded in personal experience to avoid being sterile and perfunctory\. He argued that religious conviction is achieved through personal encounters with the world\. __View on Miracles and Book of Nature\.__ Rousseau dismissed miracles as mere human testimony, similar to Voltaire's view, and faced a dilemma in distinguishing divine miracles from those possibly performed by the devil\. He suggested maintaining an attitude of reverent doubt, supporting this with the idea that miracles must be proven through doctrine\. For Rousseau, the book of nature was the only reliable source from which all religious doctrines and convictions could be derived\. __Contributions to Rationalism and Emotional Deism\.__ His original contribution to the rationalism of his time was attempting to anchor religion in "inner light," "conscience," or "feeling," leading to emotional deism\. He posited two requisites for affirming any religion: religious ideas must relate to personal experience and moral sentiment, with other concerns being idle speculation—essentially framing theology as moral theology\. __Conscience and Romanticism\.__ Rousseau regarded conscience, a natural sentiment, as the true guide, fully realizing the religious autonomy of the Enlightenment while anticipating romanticism, where religious doctrine is grounded not in rational demonstration but in personal experience\. 

__Butler's Analogy of Reason\.__ Butler, in "The Analogy of Reason," addressed Deists' claims of ambiguities and contradictions in Scripture and Nature, noting that neither provides indisputable proof of theism\. He asserted that "probability is the very guide of life," and even nature with its deficiencies and irregularities, suggests a system of variety and change\. __Defense of Christian Revelation\.__ Butler used nature's irregularities to defend the particularity of Christian revelation, arguing that natural religion held no superiority over Christian revelation due to its supposed perfect rationality\. He suggested the imperfection of nature is no clearer than biblical revelation, making belief in God, the author of both, require a convergence of probabilities\. __Critique of Butler’s Argument\.__ However, the weakness of Butler's argument lies in its double\-edged nature: by claiming natural religion is riddled with enigmas, it implies that revelation should not be expected to be any clearer, thus presenting a less promising argument for revelation\.

__Hume's Religious Views\. __Hume critiqued prevailing religious principles, describing them as akin to a sick man's dreams\. Although often mistaken as an atheist, Hume was agnostic, perceiving religion as little more than the rejection of superstition\. He proposed that knowledge of God is reducible to a vague proposition, suggesting that the universe's cause or causes of order might remotely resemble human intelligence, thus opposing the design argument\. __Critique of Miracles and Theistic Proofs\.__ Hume strongly critiqued the concept of miracles, arguing that one cannot prove an event as miraculous without comprehensive knowledge of natural occurrences to exclude all possible natural causes\. This stance opposed the eighteenth\-century apologetics, which relied on two theistic proofs: miracles and prophecy, and design\. __Skepticism and Human Reason\.__ As a skeptic, Hume emphasized that causation is not directly perceivable but a mental habit formed through observation\. He contended that human reason is limited in metaphysical inquiries and that beliefs concerning the simplicity or identity of the self or external objects arise from habitual thinking, as identity does not inherently belong to perceptions but is a construct of the imagination\.

__Kant's Epistemology\.__ Kant diverged from empiricists who saw the mind as a passive blank slate \(*tabula rasa*\) receiving impressions from the exterior world, conforming knowledge to objects\. Instead, Kant argued that the mind is active, shaping objects by contributing *a priori* forms of cognition\. The mind imposes its own structures, such as space, time, causality, and substance, upon experiences, which presuppose these a priori categories that aren't observable themselves\. This means we cannot know *das Ding an sich*, the "thing\-in\-itself\." __Implications of Kant's Theory\.__ This active role of the mind makes a pure science of nature possible, as the mind's *a priori* categories function as universal laws structuring all possible experience\. However, this objective knowledge doesn't apply to what transcends space, time, and perception, which must be known through different means\. __Arguments for God's Existence\.__ Kant critiqued the three classical arguments for proving God's existence through pure reason\. 

1. The ontological argument is futile because ideas alone, without empirical content, cannot extend theoretical insight\. 
2. The cosmological argument relies on causality beyond the phenomenal world, making it conceptually rather than empirically based\. 
3. The physico\-theological argument from design is logically inadequate, seeing natural theology as fruitless\. However, metaphysical and transcendental concepts are not mere illusions; they aren't objects of knowledge, meaning God's existence can neither be proven nor disproven\.

__Moral Foundation of Rational Faith\.__ Kant posited that morality is rooted in the categorical imperative, a universal experience of "oughtness," not based on knowledge of God\. Instead, the knowledge of God becomes a postulate of moral reason\. Echoing Voltaire, the sole genuine theology is moral theology, with the moral conscience as the path to knowledge of God\. Since no human can achieve the supreme good—both moral virtue and natural happiness—within a lifetime, the possibility of summum bonum \(ultimate good\) leads to postulating a supreme being\. __Rational Faith and Christianity\.__ Kant saw Christianity as closely approached the ideal of a pure, rational, moral faith, explored in "Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone" \(1793\)\. He examined how free will, even when radically evil, can regenerate itself and how Christianity exemplifies this process\. However, Kant acknowledged a problem: the imperative "ought" implies "can," yet the will's radical corruption raises the question of how such an imperative is possible, hinting that divine cooperation may be necessary\. __Kant and Historical Jesus\.__ Kant shared an eighteenth\-century skepticism toward history, showing little concern for whether Gospel traditions portray the real historical Jesus\. The historical question, to him, was irrelevant, as the real object of faith is the ideal of the Son of God\. Kant saw Jesus Christ as the historical exemplification of humanity well\-pleasing to God, no more\. He conceived of atonement as the rightness of one's moral disposition covering previous evil deeds\.

__Chapter 4: Christianity and Romanticism: Protestant Thought\.__

__Schleiermacher's Theological Importance\.__ Schleiermacher is considered the "most important theologian between Calvin and Barth," balancing Romantic and Liberal influences\. Raised Moravian, his early work "On Religion: Speeches Addressed to Its Cultured Despisers" \(1799\) emerged during his romantic period, while "The Christian Faith" \(1821, revised in 1830\) reflected his mature theological perspectives\. __Essence of Religion in Speeches\.__ In his speeches, Schleiermacher aimed to demonstrate that what the cultural elite despised in religion was not its true essence but an external husk concealing it\. He argued that religion is not intellectual or defensible on utilitarian or hedonistic grounds\. Traditionally viewed either metaphysically \(by orthodox rationalists like Hegel\) or ethically \(by Deists and Kant\), Schleiermacher insisted religion must be distinct\. He identified three mental life elements: 1\) perception \(knowledge\), 2\) feeling \(the faculty of religious life\), and 3\) activity \(moral life\), emphasizing that piety stands as a necessary counterpart to science and practice\. __Feeling and Self\-Consciousness\.__ Religion, according to Schleiermacher, is essentially about feeling, described as immediate self\-consciousness or the consciousness of absolute dependence \(*schlechthinniges Abhängigkeitsgefühl*\)\. True piety emerges from one's original feelings, not from others' descriptions\. Dogmas result from contemplating feelings and are general expressions of specific feelings; however, holding them does not inherently make one religious, as religion pertains to one's innermost feelings and cannot be taught\. __Individuality and Community\.__ Schleiermacher encouraged individuals to explore their own imagination and feelings while stressing the social essence of religion, viewing the church as a pure spiritual fellowship\. He saw religion as concrete and particular, expressed validly through positive religions, considering Christianity the most profound universal religion\. __Theology and Christian Experience\.__ In "*The Christian Religious Affections*," Schleiermacher defined dogmatics as explaining Christian religious affections\. He believed we can know God only in relation to us, emphasizing the Christian experience of redemption in Jesus as the starting point for theology, making it Christo\-centric\. He linked consciousness of sin to God\-consciousness and saw sin as privation from true blessedness, emphasizing its social aspect\. __Jesus and Redemption\.__ Schleiermacher rejected the notion of Adam's static innocence, positing humanity's latent potential for God\-consciousness and perfection alongside an inherent predisposition to sin\. Jesus Christ's unique God\-consciousness reveals our sin and redeems us, forming a community around him\. Schleiermacher viewed Jesus not as a moral example since it implies humanity's self\-sufficiency in achieving perfection or overcoming sensuous control\. __Reception and Criticism\.__ Schleiermacher faced criticism for subjectivism, emphasizing self\-consciousness and feeling, yet he highlighted community's role in shaping self\-consciousness\. He was also charged with agnosticism for asserting that God can't be known in Himself, though he contended God is knowable in His relation to us\. Critically, Schleiermacher engaged with dogmas, creeds, the Bible, and Deism\.

__Chapter 5: Christianity and Speculative Idealism\.__

__Hegel's Theological Background\.__ Enrolled at the Protestant theological seminary at Tübingen in 1788 and later holding the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Berlin from 1818 to 1831 alongside Schleiermacher, Hegel had little in common with his colleague, resulting in frequent disagreements\. __Early Theological Writings\.__ In his early work, Hegel did not display antipathy toward Romanticism\. He differentiated between objective religion, which could be systematically organized and documented, and subjective religion, which expressed itself through personal attitudes and actions\. By 1794, he reexamined Kant’s moral philosophy and interpreted Jesus's life through Kantian principles, critiquing the tendency for teachings to become externally imposed laws rather than rational systems\. He contrasted Judaism’s estrangement from the universe with Christianity's positivity, suggesting that love, central to Jesus's teachings, transcends the law and embodies a synthesis of reason and inclination, called "Leben\." __Thought Form and Experience\.__ Hegel sought a thought form to encompass the dynamic polarities of experience, such as is and ought or finite and infinite, which conceptual thinking struggles to unify\. He argued that the universal becomes rationally necessary through particular actualization\. Christianity’s truth, therefore, lies in its historical manifestation of divine\-human unity and the realization of the Absolute Spirit\. __Conception of Christianity\.__ A key theme in Hegel's view of Christianity is humanity's "contrite/unhappy consciousness\." He interpreted the Fall as the necessary evolution from innocence to self\-consciousness, seeing estrangement as a crucial advancement\. __The Incarnation\.__ Christ’s uniqueness, Hegel argued, is not just in his teachings but in his embodiment of God in the world, grounded in the speculative Idea of Absolute Truth\. Christ is not merely symbolic; his historical existence signifies a change in divine\-human history, turning the abstract divine into historical individuality\. Through Christ’s passion and death, Spirit embraces finite existence, leading to a unity that overcomes death, heralding the coming of the Absolute Spirit\. __Kingdom of the Spirit and Christianity\.__ The Kingdom of the Spirit represents the historical goal, where the Absolute Spirit realizes itself through a dialectical process\. God’s historical actualization is completed through the Holy Spirit, making Christianity the "revealed" religion\. In this process, God transforms from a distant entity to the immanent Spirit actualized through the finite world\. __The Church as Spiritual Community\.__ The Kingdom of the Spirit manifests in the Church or "*die Gemeinde*," where God becomes fully actualized within a community of finite human minds\. Through this dialectical transition, God, initially perceived as transcendent, becomes realized in the collective experience, highlighting the Aufhebung \(sublation\) of Christianity into philosophy\.

__Chapter 9: The Post\-Hegelian Critique of Christianity in Germany\.__

__Strauss\.__ Initially losing sympathy with Schleiermacher's teachings, Strauss became a follower of Hegel\. His seminal work, *Das Leben Jesu: Kritisch Bearbeitet*, received acclaim from figures like Albert Schweitzer in *The Quest for the Historical Jesus* for critically examining the New Testament's historical claims about Jesus, free from religious biases\. Strauss contested the idea that Gospel writers were eyewitnesses, viewing myths as tied to Jewish expectations of a Messiah without fraudulent intent\. He proposed criteria for historical events: they must align with universal laws \(excluding supernatural occurrences\) and maintain consistency both within the narrative and with other accounts\. In "Die Christliche Glaubenslehre," Strauss argued that Christianity evolved beyond its ancient roots through philosophical adaptation\. His work "*Der Alter und der Neue Glaube*" further explored this evolution\.

__Feuerbach\.__ After delivering the controversial lecture *Thoughts on Death and Immortality*, which ended his academic career, Feuerbach became a private scholar\. His lecture denounced belief in personal immortality as egotistic, detracting from earthly life's importance, suggesting instead that true immortality lies in humanity's lasting contributions\. As a materialist, he rejected divine narratives and faced atheistic implications\. __Critique of Hegel\.__ Feuerbach moved towards a materialistic dialectic, believing philosophy had been dominated by theology\. He rejected speculative theology and surrogates for God, asserting that philosophy's core should be humanity\. While Hegel perceived humans as God in self\-alienation, Feuerbach saw God as humanity in its alienated form, effectively reversing Hegel's speculative theology by claiming the essence of theology is anthropology\. For Feuerbach, theology externalizes and objectifies human characteristics into the concept of God, making religion an anthropological projection\. __Reduction to Anthropology\.__ Feuerbach viewed Christian beliefs and practices as reflections of humanity's deepest self\-consciousness, revealing human needs, fears, and hopes\. He argued that religion represents humanity's dreams about earthly reality, not heaven\. In this paradigm, God embodies human nature, purified and idealized, serving as an ideal for individuals\. Humanity's self\-alienation stems from projecting its reality onto God, creating a compensatory dynamic for life's limitations and failing to realize its productive potential\. Feuerbach saw all religious dogmas and imaginations as alienated reflections of human truths\. He described religion as the disuniting of humanity from itself, setting God as the antithesis of human nature, emphasizing the extreme dichotomy between divine perfection and human imperfection\.

__Marx\.__ Initially part of the Young Hegelians, also known as the Doctors Club, Marx was influenced by both Strauss and Feuerbach\. His career as a journalist was cut short when the Prussian government shut down his publication, prompting his move to Paris, where he met Friedrich Engels\. Engels, although wealthy, was influenced by radical Hegelians and English socialists, and documented the plight of England's working classes\. In 1845, Marx was expelled from France and moved to Brussels, breaking with Feuerbach and developing his socioeconomic critique of religion, which later culminated in the 1867 publication of "*Das Kapital*\." __Critique of Religion\.__ Marx extended Feuerbach's abstract discussion of humanity's self\-alienation in religion to a more concrete analysis of the historical factors that produced such alienated consciousness\. He contended that religion is the self\-consciousness and self\-feeling of a humanity that has not yet discovered or has lost itself, serving as the "sigh of the oppressed creature" and "the opium of the people\." He believed that abolishing religion's illusory happiness was necessary for achieving real happiness\. __Beyond Feuerbach's Individual Focus\.__ Marx criticized Feuerbach for focusing solely on individual psychology and failing to explain the concrete and historical conditions that produced religious illusions\. Instead, Marx argued that self\-alienation is found by examining the social realities of human life, and that eliminating social conflicts would remove the need for religious illusions\. __Economic Transformation and Alienation\.__ Influenced by Moses Hess's economic interpretation of Feuerbach's doctrine of alienation, Marx saw the essence of the modern economic world as the realized essence of Christianity, with the commercial state as an inversion of the kingdom of heaven and God as idealized capital\. Marx equated Judaism with capitalism, viewing Christianity not as the cause of alienation, but as an effect of the socioeconomic system, and was thus unconcerned with attacking religion directly\. __Limitations of Marx's View\. __Marx viewed Christianity in idealist and other\-worldly terms, lacking recognition of its subversive and prophetic elements or its protest against suffering\. Marx's failure to critique his own system and his naïve belief in a utopian, classless society's automatic abolition of religious beliefs and sentiments highlighted limitations in his vision for societal transformation\.

__Chapter 10: The Encounter between Science and Theology: Biblical Criticism and Darwinism\.__

__Biblical Criticism\.__ Biblical criticism raised questions about the dating, authorship, and trustworthiness of biblical texts, challenging traditional views on events like the deluge and Isaiah’s prophecy about "Unto us a Child is born," claiming it was fulfilled during Ahaz's time\. Critics argued for alternative translations, such as rendering "Mighty God" as "Father of Age," and debated the interpretation of "day" in the creation accounts\. __The Situation before Darwin\.__ Before Darwin, perspectives on nature shifted from Paley’s optimistic design view, where nature filled with life and joy, to Tennyson's depiction of nature as "red in tooth and claw," highlighting loss and brutality found in the fossil record\. While early views were more harmonious with creation accounts, growing challenges arose from geology and ideas of continuous evolutionary development, leading to a diminished role for Providence\. Darwin's concept of natural selection did not deny a Creator's possibility but excluded active divine oversight, portraying God, if existent, as remote and impersonal\. __Darwin's Theory\.__ Central to Darwin's theory were the struggle for life, survival of the fittest, and common descent\. His ideas stirred controversy, especially among Christians who had limited alternatives to literal biblical interpretations and teleological arguments for design\. Scientists’ reactions varied; some retained strong religious engagement with science, while others, whose doubts were already present, claimed to lose faith, or attempted to dismiss Darwinism with scorn or ignorance\. __Christian Darwinism: Aubrey Moore\.__ Some orthodox theologians were open to integrating Darwinism, like Aubrey Moore, a Christian Darwinist who opposed design arguments as poor apologetics\. Moore believed God created by enabling creations to make themselves, adding rather than detracting from the argument for God's role in the world\. He rejected the idea of continuous divine intervention but maintained that original creation and the soul were beyond Darwinism's reach, as matters of faith\. Non\-Darwinist Christians were disturbed by Darwin’s low view of humanity, viewing Darwinism as the "Gospel of dirt\." __Anti\-Darwinism: Charles Hodge\.__ Charles Hodge, from Princeton Theological Seminary, did not fully separate science and theology, believing conflicts resolved with more knowledge or discernment of biblical truth\. He challenged Darwinism by stressing design and divine control\. Hodge opposed natural selection, advocating for species’ fixity, though this idea lacked scientific support\. His principal critique was that Darwinism's denial of divine design essentially denied God, and he believed vague theism, akin to Deism, was inadequate\. 

__Christian Darwinisticism: Lyman Abbot\.__ Not a Darwinist but an evolutionist, Lyman Abbot saw God's work as progressive change from simpler to complex conditions, following studyable laws and internal forces\. He extended this evolutionary view to God's revelation in Scripture, seeing the Bible as a history of growing God\-consciousness\. Abbot rejected classical doctrines of the Fall and redemption as inconsistent with evolutionary progression\. He perceived sin as relapse into older nature's depraved elements, aligning with Schleiermacher's views\. Christ's role was to evolve humanity's latent divinity, fostering an optimistic theology\. Abbot interpreted history as a spiritual pilgrimage showcasing God's life in human souls, aiming to transform society into God’s kingdom, contrasting starkly with the grim struggles suggested by Darwinian interpretations\.

__Chapter 11: The Ritschlian Theology and Protestant Liberalism\.__

__Neo\-Kantian Foundations\.__ With the decline of Hegelian speculative idealism, Neo\-Kantianism emerged, emphasizing empirical and historical investigations while maintaining a clear distinction between religion and dogma, associated with metaphysics\. Dogma was not rejected but seen as derived from religious experience, serving to protect religious truths\.

__Ritschl\.__ Ritschl rejected the idea that the early church synthesized primitive Jewish and Gentile Christianity, a quasi\-Hegelian view\. A dedicated historian and biblical exegete, his magnum opus, "The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation," was largely historical, aiming to "finish the unfinished Reformation" by creatively reinterpreting Reformation religious ideas to illuminate the New Testament message\. __Ritschl's Practical View of Religion\.__ Ritschl viewed religion as an experiential matter, with Christian theology rooted in Christian experience\. He critiqued Schleiermacher's focus on individual "Christian consciousness" for veering towards subjectivism\. Ritschl championed the historical reality of the Gospel, specifically the historical Jesus Christ in the New Testament, over individual consciousness\. To Ritschl, religion is a practical experience of spiritual freedom from nature’s blind necessity, and God's presence is experienced actively through faith in Christ's liberating grace, rather than mystically or metaphysically\. __Theory of Value Judgment and Historical Jesus\.__ Ritschl emphasized value judgments—necessary in cognition and as predictors of moral ends, leading to feelings and actions—in religious knowledge, where they relate to humanity's worldview and divine dominion or lack thereof\. Objective knowledge comes not from knowing *Dinge an sich* but through experiences and their effects on us\. God is revealed as a guarantor of victory over the natural world in Christ’s work, understood through faith\. Ritschl argued that scientific consciousness couldn't affirm or deny Jesus's divinity, with religious experiences interpreted as value judgments of faith rather than empirical facts\. __Person and Work of Christ\.__ For Ritschl, the historical Jesus is knowable through the Christian __*community*__, with Christianity starting with Peter’s confession of Jesus as Christ\. This perception of Christ’s divinity relies on His historical life's characteristics, revealing God and realizing humanity\. Christ actualizes God's moral will and permanently impacts His community through His calling and Kingdom introduction\. Ritschl viewed Christ’s redemptive work—sin forgiveness, human\-God reconciliation, community founding—not as substitutionary atonement but as __moral influence\.__ Justification and reconciliation are intertwined yet distinct; forgiveness enables, but doesn't assure, reconciliation\. __Redeemed Life and Ethical Living\.__ In Ritschl’s theology, salvation is a social experience within the Church, where believers become aware of sin, receive forgiveness, and grow in grace\. The redeemed life focuses on spiritual freedom from nature and labor for God’s Kingdom, emphasizing the ethical realization of love’s double commandment\. This is achieved supernaturally through unity in the community initiated by Jesus\.

__Von Harnack\.__ Influenced by Albrecht Ritschl, Von Harnack shared a distaste for metaphysical speculation and focused on a historical interpretation of Christianity\. Alongside Troeltsch, he believed one must overcome history through history, acknowledging historically\-shaped presuppositions\. Von Harnack's __*hellenization thesis*__" argued that while the development of dogma wasn't inherently negative, the entrenchment of dogma in an authoritarian ecclesiastical institution, influenced by Greek thought, introduced demands foreign to the primitive Gospel—a condition Luther sought to liberate the Gospel from\. __The Essence of Christianity\.__ For Von Harnack, the essence of Christianity lies in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which holds "permanent validity" despite temporal forms\. This essence, however, isn't an intellectual doctrine but a __*dynamic reality*__ centered on the living Jesus rather than the gospel narratives about him\. Von Harnack identified three core themes in Jesus's teachings: 1\) the coming kingdom of God, 2\) God the Father and the infinite value of the human soul, and 3\) higher righteousness with the commandment of love\. __Gospel Themes Explored\.__ 1\) The kingdom of God, while shared in Jewish apocalyptic worldview, holds a core message of God’s rule in individual hearts\. 2\) Von Harnack emphasized God the Father's care and the soul's infinite value, extending the concept of Providence universally\. 3\) The Gospel tasks individuals with practicing higher righteousness and love, severing ethics from external observance\. Jesus envisioned a community driven by neighborly love— profoundly socialistic and individualistic by valuing each soul\. __The Gospel and Christology\.__ Von Harnack posited that the Gospel’s focus should be on the Father, detaching from metaphysical claims about the Son\. Jesus's divine sonship is in his intimate knowledge of God\. The Gospel is realized personally through Jesus, serving as its living strength\.

__Rauschenbusch\.__ An American theologian, Rauschenbusch drew from Schleiermacher, Idealism, Ritschl, and evolutionary doctrine, with Ritschl’s influence being the most prominent in his theology\. He authored significant works like "Christianity and the Social Crisis," "Christianizing the Social Order," and "A Theology for the Social Gospel," advocating for a socially engaged Christianity that addresses and transforms societal structures\.

__Chapter 12: Movements of Recovery and Conservation: The Princeton Theology__

__Introduction\.__ The Princeton Theology emerged in reaction to the Enlightenment's perceived "infidelity" and the emotional fervor of American revivalism and liberal influences in religion\. Rooted in 19th century Presbyterianism, initially founded in 1706 by English Puritans and Scottish, Irish, and English ministers, the tradition championed independence from Britain\. A division existed between the "Old School" and "New School" Presbyterians, reflecting differing theological and organizational philosophies\. __New School vs\. Old School\.__ The New School favored union with Calvinistic Congregational churches, supporting a decentralized church government and embracing New Divinity teachings influenced by Jonathan Edwards\. They approved of emotional elements in revivalism and adopted speculative philosophical ideas, including intuitionism and philosophical idealism\. In contrast, the Old School emphasized high church order, a stricter reading of Westminster standards, opposed ties with evangelical denominations, and criticized the New School for its view of sin as voluntary acts and its concept of regeneration\. The Old School preferred the Scottish common sense realism approach, resisting speculation and advocating for an inductive, scientific method in theology\. __Princeton Seminary and Key Figures\.__ Founded by Archibald Alexander in 1812, Princeton Seminary aimed to counter New Divinity threats\. Significant members included Charles Hodge, Archibald Alexander Hodge, and Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield\. Archibald Alexander, in a General Assembly sermon, highlighted the theological errors and infidelity threats of his time, pointing out the influence of 18th century rationalism, deism in Unitarianism, and enthusiasm from New Divinity\. __Key Principles of Princeton Theology\.__ The core of Princeton Theology rested on three principles: 

1. Authority of Scripture\. Scripture was considered without error, the foundation of all Christian doctrine and truth\. Princeton theologians focused on apologetics to prove Scripture's perfect integrity and authority, asserting inerrancy as divine influence exempt from error\.
2. Conservative Calvinist Confessionalism\. A firm allegiance to Calvinist doctrinal standards was maintained, emphasizing texts like Francis Turretin's works, Calvin's Catechism, the Second Helvetic Confession, and the Canons of the Synod of Dordt\.
3. Scottish Common Sense Realism\. Introduced to Princeton through John Witherspoon, Scottish Common Sense Realism championed by Thomas Reid, opposed the idealism of Berkeley and skepticism of Hume\. It embraced an *inductive and scientific realism*, grounding knowledge in sensory experience, with belief in reality comparable to religious faith\. Reid posited that certain principles are naturally believed through common sense and necessity\. Scottish Common Sense Realism held that true science, notably Newtonian, and Protestant theology were compatible and supportive of each other\. Archibald Alexander asserted that Christianity must present sufficient evidence to warrant belief\.

__Charles Hodge\.__ Charles Hodge, who taught at Princeton Theological Seminary for 58 years, was a key proponent of the Princeton Theology\. Educated in the principles of Scottish Realism by Ashbel Green, Hodge taught oriental and biblical literature before becoming a Professor of Exegetical and Didactical Theology\. He believed that the Princeton Theology remained true to the Word of God as outlined in the Westminster standards and formulated his theology around four main subjects: 1\) Theological Method, 2\) Doctrine of the Bible, 3\) Polemics against Rationalists and Mystics \(Anthropology\), and 4\) the Relationship between Theology and Science, especially in relation to Darwinism\. __Theological Method\.__ In his *Systematic Theology*, Hodge began with a discussion of method, positing that theology is a science involving facts and the mind's understanding of their causal and logical relationships\. Theological work entails collecting facts from Scripture, demonstrating their interrelations, and vindicating them through their harmony and consistency\. Hodge adhered to an *a posteriori* method, which reasons from effects \(scriptural facts\) to causes, opposing the *a priori* or speculative method associated with theological rationalism\. __On the__ “__Mystical Method\.” __Hodge also criticized the "Mystical Method," which starts with religious feelings and affections, either natural or supernatural\. He warned against the dangers of subjectivism, particularly in the notion that God communicates truths directly to the soul\. For Hodge, true theology exists between the rationalism of Wolff and the experiential mysticism of Schleiermacher, remaining faithful to revelation in Scripture alone\. He viewed the Bible as analogous to nature for a scientist—a repository of facts to be examined systematically\. __Self\-Evident Truths\. __Hodge asserted that both scientists and theologians work from "first truths of reason," which are self\-evident and compelling to rational minds, and these truths support the consistency of biblical facts\.

__The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible\.__

__The Imperfection of Language\.__ Charles Hodge's theology acknowledged that language is an imperfect vehicle of thought, but he argued this does not imply Biblical authors should be distrusted\. Nor does it negate the possibility of objective revelation or scientific theology\. Hodge believed that faith in Christ inherently involves faith in the Bible as the Word of God, viewing Scripture as a cohesive set of divine facts and propositions, indicative of its singular divine authorship\. __Revelation vs\. Inspiration\.__ Hodge distinguished between revelation and inspiration\. Revelation imparts knowledge, while inspiration ensures infallibility in communication\. These are distinct concepts; some received revelations without the inspiration to share them, while biblical authors sometimes lacked new revelations\. Hodge further differentiated inspiration, exclusive to selected spokespersons, from illumination, which imparted divine truth discernment to all believers\. __Scope of Inspiration\.__ Hodge believed the scope of inspiration was limited to preserving biblical writers from error in their teachings\. He acknowledged that historical narratives in the Bible might not require extensive inspiration but insisted on the Holy Spirit's guidance in word selection\. Criticisms likened the writers to "superhuman Ventriloquists," which Hodge ambiguously addressed, sometimes suggesting Spirit dictation and other times allowing for personal expression\. __Reconciling Inspiration and Knowledge\.__ A significant issue for Hodge was reconciling inspiration with the biblical authors' limitations in knowledge\. He considered whether biblical assertions resulted from divine dictation, beyond contemporaneous understanding, or fit within the knowledge of their time without contradicting scientific truth\. As scientific fields like geology and biology progressed, Hodge maintained no scriptural content conflicted with scientific findings, labeling conflicting scientific "facts" as mere hypotheses\. __Doctrine of Inerrancy\.__ Occasionally, Hodge adjusted the doctrine of inspiration to include the "inerrancy of the original autographs," attributing biblical errors to transcription mistakes\. Despite this, he asserted the inerrancy of biblical statements on facts, be they scientific, historical, or geographical, particularly when addressing Darwinism\. His successors emphasized the original autographs' importance, making this perspective central to their theological argumentation\.

__Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield\.__

__Warfield's Role\.__ For over thirty years, Benjamin B\. Warfield was a leading defender of orthodox Presbyterianism and the Princeton Theology against Modernism\. Adhering to orthodox Calvinist standards, Scottish "common sense" realism, and the verbal inerrancy of Scripture, Warfield's views on biblical inspiration had a significant and lasting influence on Presbyterianism and other conservative Protestant groups, defending these ideas against both internal and external critique\. __The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible\.__ Known for his collaborative work "Inspiration" with A\. A\. Hodge, Warfield emphasized demonstrable proofs of the Bible's inerrancy and argued that verbal inerrancy applies only to the original autograph copies of the texts\. A\. A\. Hodge introduced the idea that Scripture, though composed with both divine and human cooperation, remains divinely regulated, with human authors contributing through their own endowments and experiences under God's providential guidance\. Plenary verbal inspiration ensured that *the very words of Scripture* were under divine superintendence, though not through mechanical dictation\. __Response to Criticism\.__ Warfield addressed criticisms by asserting that apparent inconsistencies in Scripture arise from imperfect copies, limited knowledge, or misinterpretations, distinguishing between exactness and accuracy\. He held that as long as critical scholarship doesn't conflict with apostolic authority and truthfulness, it is acceptable\. Warfield provided *proofs for plenary inspiration* beyond internal testimony, such as 1\) the evident systematic correlation among biblical books, 2\) miraculous conformity to modern knowledge, 3\) sublime moral teachings, and 4\) its historical doctrinal consistency within the Church\. However, these appeals were noted to be convincing primarily to those already convinced by internal testimony\. __Original Autographs and Criticism\.__ Warfield's strongest defense lay in the appeal to the original autograph copies of biblical texts, a stance criticized as unfalsifiable and implying corruption in existing manuscripts\. Warfield argued that the current text aligns closely with the autographs, as God would not permit the Bible to become hopelessly corrupt\. He challenged critics to 1\) prove discrepancies existed in the autographs, 2\) that problematic interpretations were intended meanings, and 3\) that original text was inconsistent with known historical and scientific facts\. __Scriptural Defense\.__ Warfield utilized Scriptures like 2 Timothy 3:16 and 2 Peter 1:19\-21 to support his claims of plenary verbal inspiration\. He assumed these passages applied broadly beyond prophecy to ensure historical and doctrinal inerrancy across Scripture, though critics argued that this interpretation disconnects the text's origins from its historical context and developmental processes\. Ultimately, Warfield's __*circular reasoning*__ aligned closely with his presuppositions about internal evidence and inspiration\.

__Warfield's Critique of Liberal Theology\.__ Although Warfield did not write a substantial constructive theology, relying instead on Charles Hodge's comprehensive "Systematic Theology," he dedicated much of his career to countering Liberal theology's critique of his doctrine of inspiration\. He responded to contemporary German biblical scholars and theologians like Bousset, Weiss, Troeltsch, Seeberg, Harnack, Herrmann, and Haering\. __Logical Inconsistencies\.__ Warfield argued that Liberal and Modernist theologians could not logically commit to both supernatural and naturalistic assumptions, viewing this as an either\-or choice\. Critics suggested this stance was limited by Warfield's Scottish "common\-sense" realism and his simplistic view of historical fact\. __Seeberg's Position on Revelation\.__ Seeberg proposed that it was possible to hold the Bible's religious truth while applying rigorous historical criticism\. Warfield criticized this view, arguing it separated the Bible's religious "essence" from its culturally outdated "husk\." Seeberg viewed revelation as *Heilsgeschichte*, divine acts in history revealing God's redemptive work, with inspiration allowing prophets and apostles to understand and communicate God's acts\. Warfield rejected this concept because it focused only on the initial divine truth acquisition, not its inerrant transmission\. __Opposition to Subjectivism\.__ Warfield was a persistent critic of Ritschlian theologians' "theology of subjectivism," particularly movements like the "Historical Jesus\." He believed that certainty about Jesus's historical reality should be based on historical evidence, not just faith\. Warfield maintained unwavering confidence in the demonstrative force of New Testament evidence \("the facts"\) despite his exposure to higher criticism\. __Legacy and Essential Doctrines\.__ Warfield's doctrine of biblical inspiration and inerrancy became central to the later Princeton Theology\. In 1910, the Presbyterian General Assembly adopted five essential doctrines reflecting Warfield's influence: 1\) the inerrancy of Scripture, 2\) the Virgin Birth of Christ, 3\) Christ's substitutionary atonement, 4\) his bodily resurrection, and 5\) the historical authenticity of biblical miracles\.

__Chapter 15: Kierkegaard and Nietzsche: Toward the Twentieth Century\.__

__Kierkegaard and Nietzsche\.__ These two prophetic figures symbolize a shift toward the Modern age, embodying what some argue is the spiritual essence of the revolution called Modernity\. Known for their use of seductive irony, indirect communication, and provocative attacks, they challenge essential features of Modernity\. Though critical of "systems" and foundationalism, they were not opposed to reason itself\. 

__Søren Kierkegaard\.__ Kierkegaard's collected works, including his pseudonymous writings, pose complex challenges for interpretation due to his use of indirect communication, irony, and diverse existential perspectives\. His work invites varied readings, with some scholars seeing him as offering multiple possibilities for existential appropriation rather than a single dominant viewpoint\. Kierkegaard himself acknowledged the ambiguity of his authorship\. __Contexts and Influences\.__ Kierkegaard must be understood within the specific context of Copenhagen as well as the broader European thought of the first half of the 19th century\. Having studied theology, he wrote his master's dissertation on the concept of irony, setting the stage for his exploration of religious existence and what it means to be a Christian\. __Personal Crises and Writings\.__ Key events leading to Kierkegaard's spiritual crisis included his father's confession of adultery and Kierkegaard's own broken engagement, allegedly due to his "thorn in the flesh" \(melancholy\)\. These personal trials led to significant works such as "Either/Or," "Repetition," "Fear and Trembling," "The Concept of Anxiety," "Stages on Life's Way," and "The Sickness unto Death," all pseudonymously authored\.

__Later Life and Christian Conviction\.__ In his later years, Kierkegaard's Christian conviction motivated him to witness to his interpretation of truth, embracing suffering as part of Christian discipleship\. He criticized the hypocrisy of conventional Christianity and the institutional Church, including the State Church of Denmark, engaging in strong polemics against it\.

__The Dialectic of Existence\.__ Kierkegaard is renowned for his resistance to systematization, yet certain prominent themes recur in his work\. He opposed rational theology in all its forms, rejecting Hegelian absolute idealism and Kantian moral idealism in favor of his own existential dialectic\. Unlike Hegel's approach, which begins with a closed logical system, Kierkegaard's dialectic starts with the individual faced with existential possibilities\.

__Three Spheres of Existence\.__ Kierkegaard outlined three spheres of existence: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious\. 

1. Aesthetic\. Explored in "Either/Or" and "Stages on Life's Way," the aesthetic sphere embodies Romantic sensibility characterized by moods of sensual immediacy, doubt, and despair, with a chief lack of involvement and decision\-making\.
2. Ethical\. In contrast, the ethical sphere arises when the despair of the aesthetic compels one toward a transformative decision, "choose thyself," embracing absolute choice with passion and seeking to transform the self\. Kierkegaard critiqued Kantian ethical systems for rendering sin superficial, inadequately addressing motivation, and failing to accommodate individual exceptions\.
3. Religious\. This sphere offers possibilities for authentic selfhood, particularly considered in "Fear and Trembling\." The three spheres are not linear stages but represent continually present possibilities in life\.

__Faith and the Absolute Paradox\.__ In examining the religious stage, Kierkegaard identified two possibilities:

1. Religiousness A\. The Socratic religion \(Plato: true knowledge is merely recollection\), representing philosophical Idealism, posits that truth resides within the individual, with self\-knowledge equating to God\-knowledge\.
2. Religiousness B\. The religion of Jesus Christ, suggesting a significant __Moment__ in history—the Incarnation—is essential for acquiring truth\. In this view, the *teacher* becomes a Savior and Redeemer, as the truth is imparted directly, contrasting with self\-discovery in Religiousness A\.

__Absolute Paradox and Faith\.__ Kierkegaard considered the Incarnation the Absolute Paradox, exceeding human comprehension by claiming that the Eternal became temporal and that eternal happiness begins in a historical event\. This paradox, beyond objective proof, calls for faith rather than offense\. True discipleship results from divine grace, and eternal truth cannot rely solely on historical knowledge, as history is inherently relative and probable\. Instead, faith involves a passionate embrace of the paradox\. __Understanding the Relationship\.__ Kierkegaard’s exploration of faith, subjectivity, and truth underscores the necessity of faith as a personal, subjective leap rather than objective certainty\. His works invite further analysis of the intricate relationship between belief and existential choice\.

__Truth Is Subjectivity\.__ Kierkegaard did not deny the existence of objective truths independent of the knower\. However, he argued against perceiving religious truth, specifically faith, as knowledge acquired in the same manner as factual information\. Viewing faith merely as information abstracts the person from truth and neglects the existential involvement necessary to grasp religious truth—a challenge faced by the individual\. __Subjectivity as Truth\.__ Kierkegaard posited that if subjectivity is truth, then any expression of such truth must inherently oppose objectivity and reflect the tension and risk associated with subjective inwardness\. He defined existential truth as "an objective uncertainty, held fast through appropriation with the most passionate inwardness," asserting it as the highest truth available to an individual\. For Kierkegaard, truth involves an existential venture, choosing an objective uncertainty with infinite passion\. __Christian Faith and Relationship\.__ Kierkegaard rejected the notion of Christian faith as a purely intellectual act—simply accepting the Absolute Paradox as an absurd dogma\. Instead, Christian faith fundamentally concerns a personal relationship with a Person, emphasizing a deep, subjective engagement rather than a detached, objective assertion\.

__Friedrich Nietzsche\. __

__Introduction\.__ Nietzsche is both praised and criticized as an archenemy of Christianity, though his views on Jesus are more nuanced\. He critiqued Christianity's "resentful slave morality" and nihilism, yet some interpret his work as suggesting a form of "genuine Christianity\." Born into a lineage of Lutheran pastors, Nietzsche admired Greek culture and was drawn to themes of blind will and atheism\. Initially a philologist, he formed a close friendship with Richard Wagner\. Nietzsche's first major work, "The Birth of Tragedy," was followed by "Thoughts Out of Season," "Human, All Too Human," "The Dawn of Day," and "The Joyful Wisdom," in which he attacked metaphysics, traditional morality, self\-renunciation, and Christianity as an amalgam of these evils\. His most famous work, "__Also sprach Zarathustra__," published in four parts between 1883\-1885, introduced significant ideas such as the transvaluation of values and the Übermensch\. Other notable works include "Beyond Good and Evil" \(1886\) and "A Genealogy of Morals" \(1887\)\. Posthumously, "The Will to Power" was intended as his magnum opus\. Later in life, Nietzsche became alienated and reported having "neither God nor friend\." He became insane in 1889 and died in 1900\. __The "Death of God" and Revaluation\. Cultural Decline and Nihilism\.__ Nietzsche perceived the modern world as experiencing cultural decline and nihilism, existing between two worlds: one dead, another unable to be born\. This condition reflects the transition away from traditional religious and moral frameworks, requiring a revaluation of values to establish new meanings\. __"The Madman" Parable\.__ Nietzsche's parable "The Madman," found in "The Gay Science," depicts a madman entering a marketplace to announce, "God is dead and we killed him\." The crowd's confusion and mockery illustrate their inability to grasp the profundity of this declaration, symbolizing the decline of Christian values and increasing secularization\. The narrative captures the ensuing existential crisis as humanity faces the loss of absolute meaning and morality, necessitating the search for new foundations and values\. In Nietzsche's view, the "death of God" marks the demise of the ultimate ground and support for all traditional values, calling for a radical reevaluation of life's purpose and meaning\.

__Naturalism, The Will to Power, and Perspectivism\.__ Nietzsche was not a materialist, rationalist, or idealist\. He viewed humanity as a species of animal and mocked the "verbal pomp" that suggested humans possessed an extra\-natural or supernatural essence\. The evolution of humanity's spiritual life or soul, for Nietzsche, was a matter of the body, rooted in naturalistic and organic processes\. Unlike optimistic Darwinian evolutionism, he saw spiritual life as either a process of self\-enhancement or of weakness and decay\. __Moralistic Naturalism\.__ Nietzsche argued that morals have natural \(extramoral\) explanations and origins\. Being anti\-Darwinian, he abhorred the future consequences of a godless world following the "death of God," predicting that such a world might lead to brotherhoods focused on robbery and exploitation\. __Vision of the "Truly Human Being\."__ Nietzsche's project was to envision a "truly human being," or a superior being who could rise above beasts\. The will to power was associated with the rare artist, philosopher, or saint rather than Darwin's concept of adaptive fitness\. Nietzsche emphasized *self\-enhancement over the preservation of the species*, critiquing biologists for focusing on the species rather than more powerful individuals\. He argued that mankind as a species is not progressing and does not surpass other animals in terms of progress, noting the fragility of higher types compared to the indestructibility of lower ones\. He argued that willing is independent of intention, desire, or goal, signifying an innate drive surpassing mere survival\. __Perspectivism and Truth\.__ Nietzsche asserted no perception of objective truths or singular interpretations exists; instead, truth is an error essential for a species's survival\. He denied the existence of pure reason or absolute knowledge, positing that the value of life is what ultimately determines truth\. Both sense perceptions and knowledge, according to Nietzsche, stem from affective senses tied to assessments of harm, utility, and necessity\. Similarly, moral judgments are conditioned by individual perspectives\. __Genealogy of Morals\.__ Nietzsche's genealogy of morals revealed two types of morality: 1\) one defending healthy instincts against decadence and 2\) the other defining and justifying decadence itself, which he associated with Christianity\. These moralities represented opposing forces, with the former seeking to uplift humanity and the latter leading it downward into decay\.

__The Critique of Christianity\. __Nietzsche's atheism is rooted not in rational skepticism of God's existence, but in his belief that the Christian God is no longer worthy of support\. He viewed Christian belief and practice as the unconscious product of "ressentiment," a resentment of the weak masses against their aristocratic superiors, leading to what he considered the Western decadence rooted in Christianity\. __Master vs\. Slave Morality\.__ Nietzsche explored the concepts of master morality and slave morality as products of resentment\. Slave morality, which he associated with Judaism and Christianity, arose from the frustration and resentment of a weak priestly class against aristocratic Romans\. He distinguished between Jesus and Christianity, often admiring Jesus as a life\-affirming figure who embraced love and forgiveness\. However, Nietzsche criticized Christianity for distorting Jesus's teachings into a doctrine of weakness and nihilism, blaming Paul for transforming the gospel into a message of revenge and decadence\. __The Philology of Christianity\. Critique of Faith and Belief\.__ Nietzsche criticized Christianity's reliance on scripture as arbitrary and challenged the idea that anyone has the "right" to believe without evidence\. He opposed pragmatic and utilitarian proofs of God's existence, viewing faith as a rejection of truth\-seeking\. Nietzsche described Christian faith as a manifestation of weakness that escapes from strong instincts and values, famously calling Christianity "the one great curse" and "the immortal blemish of mankind\." __The Übermensch and the Eternal Recurrence\. __Nietzsche dismissed the modern idea of progress, noting that development is not necessarily toward elevation or strength\. The Übermensch is envisioned as surpassing both God and humanity\. This self\-overcoming involves mastery over oneself and is antithetical to the Nazi's tyrannical interpretation\. The Übermensch, through self\-discipline and hardiness, organizes internal chaos and sublimates impulses\. __Eternal Recurrence\.__ Mastery of self leads to perfect joy and *amor fati*, a love of fate that liberates from the need to justify life's ways\. Embracing the eternal recurrence of pain and joy, one finds liberation and joy in life as it is, without seeking ultimate meaning or future goals\. Nietzsche opposed Platonism and Christianity for despising becoming and appealing to the beyond\. Observing decadence in modern culture akin to Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard, Nietzsche rooted nihilism in Christian values\. __Positive Impact on Christianity\.__ Despite its harshness, Nietzsche's critique has highlighted weaknesses in European culture influenced by Christianity, such as pessimism, asceticism, and self\-deprecating altruism under the guise of love, prompting meaningful introspection within the Christian tradition\.
