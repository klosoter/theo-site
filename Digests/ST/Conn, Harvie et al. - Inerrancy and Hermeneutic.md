__Inerrancy and Hermeneutic: A Tradition, a Challenge, a Debate \- Harvie Conn et al\.__

__WTS Symposium: Scripture and Hermeneutics__\. The symposium aimed at providing pastors with continuing education, offering a defensive yet affirming stance against superficial or reactionary responses and unguarded academic speculation\.

__1\. A Historical Prologue: Inerrancy, Hermeneutic, and Westminster \- Harvie Conn__\. 

Westminster’s Focus\. Westminster Theological Seminary \(WTS\) and old Princeton uniquely focused on affirming conservative hermeneutics, later joined by the Evangelical Theological Society \(ETS\)\. They placed a strong emphasis on infallibility, exemplified by Edward J\. Young’s 1957 comprehensive work on inspiration and Cornelius Van Til’s 1967 book, *The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture*\. Notable symposia included the 1973 *Scripture and Confession* and CVT’s 1974 *The New Hermeneutic*\. __Westminster and Infallibility in the 1970s__\. John Frame emphasized God’s lordship over human language, thus upholding the Bible’s infallibility against Wittgenstein’s philosophy\. Richard Gaffin provided historical evaluations of Kuyper and Bavinck\. Additionally, Davis suggested rethinking hermeneutics, implying that the doctrine of inerrancy might be unnecessary\. __Westminster and Emerging Hermeneutic Debate\. __In response to the New Hermeneutic, Gaffin highlighted three points: continuation of opposition to Enlightenment presuppositions, affirmation of the unity of Scripture and God’s interpretation as foundational, and continuity between human interpretation and divine revelation\. The New Hermeneutic shifted the focus from “What does the *text* mean?” to “What do *we* mean by meaning?”__ Hermeneutics and New Tools__\. Mark Noll identified two tasks for seminary curricula: introducing significant 20th\-century hermeneutics and reexamining hermeneutical principles within Christian convictions\. Vern Poythress advocated for a holistic approach, viewing structuralism as just one perspective, noting that both historical\-critical methods and structuralism emerged from post\-Kantian naturalism\. Form and redaction criticism were also discussed, with contributions from scholars like Stonehouse and Kline\. __Tremper Longman III on Genre__\. Longman questioned Gunkel’s work, arguing that genres are neither pure nor static\. He identified four benefits of proper genre analysis: correct understanding, uncovering the text’s original context, focusing on clarification rather than classification, and gaining insights from comparative studies \(e\.g\., Kline’s work on Hittite treaties\)\. __Raymond Dillard on Chronicles__\. Dillard considered Chronicles a theological essay that requires familiarity with Samuel\-Kings, emphasizing that biblical history is more than just factual reporting\. __Emerging Evangelical Agenda at WTS\. __Westminster sustained a commitment to inerrancy while creatively addressing new theological and hermeneutical questions\. Key contributions included Sinclair Ferguson’s emphasis on self\-testimony, Moisés Silva’s advocacy for hermeneutical flexibility, Poythress’s focus on dual authorship, Bruce Waltke’s discussion on redaction history and oral tradition, Tremper Longman’s exploration of the distinction between fiction and nonfiction in the Bible, Raymond Dillard’s focus on harmonization methods, Richard Gaffin’s address on the canonical versus non\-canonical texts, Harvie Conn’s discussion on the Bible’s cultural universality versus human subjectivity, and David Clowney’s questioning of the relevance of Scripture as law or norm in contemporary times\.

__2\. Inerrancy and Westminster Calvinism \- D\. Clair Davis__\.

__Calvinism and Evangelicalism on Scripture__\. Inerrancy became an ecumenical doctrine across evangelical theology, though various traditions had differing views\. Calvinism opposed Lutheran and Anabaptist views: where Lutherans saw salvation as forgiveness and Anabaptists as obedience, Calvinists saw it as both\. Warfield emphasized that human authors were shaped by God to communicate His word, indicating human factors and divine power are not contradictory, supported by the doctrine of providence\. However, T\. F\. Torrance proposed that the doctrine of Scripture should analogically reflect the incarnational events of Christ, suggesting a “hypostatic union” between God and Scripture\. __Calvinism and Westminster on Scripture__\. Old Princeton engaged with New England, Southern, and German theology, while Westminster drew from the Reformed heritage of the Netherlands\. The Reformation emphasized Christ’s authority, with the 17th century responding to rationalistic philosophies\. Gaffin noted differences between Old Amsterdam and Old Princeton but highlighted their organic perspectives \(Bavinck, Vos, Gaffin\)\. WTS’s biblical\-theological approach viewed inspiration and authority through the providential relationship between God and fallen creation\. Questions of Christianity’s interaction with culture, apologetics, and missions are central to understanding scriptural authority\. __Apologetics: Cornelius Van Til versus Old Princeton\. __Cornelius Van Til incorporated elements from both Old Princeton and Old Amsterdam\. Old Princeton accepted Scottish common\-sense realism, exemplified by Thomas Reid, who argued fundamental principles of common sense are instinctively believed and anything contrary is absurd\. Charles Hodge of Old Princeton used systematic theology to tie biblical proof to human experience and focused on detailed refutations of error\. In contrast, Westminster aimed – positively – to uncover the profound riches of God’s Word, adding a dynamic and organic approach to the doctrine of Scripture, emphasizing revelation history and providence\.

__3\. How Does the Bible Look at Itself? \- Sinclair B\. Ferguson__

John Calvin and his successors argued that Scripture \(1\) bears witness to its divine character, \(2\) is the written Word of God, and \(3\), while marked by its human authors, remains uncompromisably reliable due to its divine origin\. James Barr challenged this, asserting that the Bible does not claim to be divinely inspired and lacks a self\-view\. __Does the Bible have “A View of Itself”? __Ferguson examines whether the Bible has “a view of itself” by discussing 2 Timothy 3:16, questioning whether it refers solely to the Old Testament, the entire Christian canon, or includes the rest of the New Testament\. Despite debates over canonical consciousness in the Old Testament, he asserts that: \(1\) The Old Testament had no canonical consciousness; whatever God provided was Scripture; \(2\) The New Testament clearly accepts the Old Testament as Scripture; \(3\) New Testament writers were aware of their writings’ authority, similar to Old Testament writers, as seen in Hebrews 2:2\-3 and their instructions to the whole church; and \(4\), Some New Testament writings recognize the canonical authority of other New Testament writings, for example, references to the Gospels and Paul\. Thus, there is a consciousness of canonical status within biblical texts\. The New Testament affirms the Old Testament’s canonicity and places itself in the same category, indicating an inherent self\-awareness in both Testaments of belonging to a divinely given canon\. __The Bible’s View of Itself\. __Regarding __inspiration__, it is the inadequate translation of the term “theopneustos” which is better understood as “God\-breathed\.” Issues include whether “all Scripture” encompasses every part, the inclusion of non\-God\-breathed Scripture, and whether the term is active or passive\. Despite no final explanation, inspiration characterizes all Scripture and does not negate the need for interpretation\. The__ authority__ of Scripture stems from the phrase “it is written” and Jesus giving the apostles authority to teach\. Scriptural authority is contextually tied to redemptive history and is authoritative on all subjects it addresses, leading to the principle of sufficiency \(*sola scriptura*\)\. Regarding __reliability__, neo\-orthodox views consider Scripture a fallible human word through which God’s eternal Word is heard\. The syllogism of infallibility posits that because God is infallible and Scripture is His Word, Scripture is thus infallible\. Christians cannot prove Scripture’s infallibility but accept it as the ultimate authority, validated by the Holy Spirit\. Scripture’s __necessity__ lies in its purpose to preserve God’s revelatory Word for evangelistic purposes, written clearly for common understanding\. Despite these affirmations, the exact nature of inspiration and authority remains somewhat mysterious, not a conclusively defined doctrine\.

__4\. Old Princeton, Westminster, and Inerrancy \- Moisés Silva__

__Hodge and Warfield\. __Hodge and Warfield acknowledged the limitations and defects of each biblical writer, including traces of errors due to their reliance on fallible sources\. Moisés Silva contends this recognition is consistent with a belief in inerrancy if understood correctly, asserting that Scripture’s human qualities coexist with divine inerrancy\. Hodge and Warfield ultimately maintained that the Bible, authored primarily by God, contains no errors\. What’s important to note is that this acknowledgment of human limitation does not undermine inerrancy but places it within the context of divine preservation\. __Inspiration vs\. Omniscience__\. There is a distinction between official teachings and personal opinions regarding inspiration, which does not imply omniscience\. Divine inspiration ensures both the communication of divine truth and the preservation of each writer’s unique personality\. __Text Interpretation and Context__\. Passages like Psalm 14:1 \(“there is no God”\) must be interpreted within their context\. The intention and purpose behind the text are crucial, emphasizing the importance of grammatical\-historical exegesis\. __Different Factual Accounts\. __Scripture occasionally presents different factual accounts \(e\.g\., differing numbers\), reflecting the authors’ lack of intent to provide exact counts\. Even Calvin acknowledged this lack of precise counting as consistent with inerrancy\. __Hermeneutic Consequences of Inerrancy\.__ Inerrancy does not imply that interpretation must be literal, nor does it determine historicity; rather, it requires contextually appropriate exegesis\. Old Princeton and Westminster Theological Seminary have demonstrated different exegetical outcomes on scientific matters, highlighting that inerrancy does not mandate specific interpretations\. __Disputes and Hermeneutic Flexibility\. __Disputes over interpretations should be resolved through exegesis, promoting hermeneutic flexibility\. We place our total confidence in God’s revelation rather than our particular interpretations, recognizing that divine truth transcends our understanding\.

__5\. What Does God Say Through Human Authors? \- Vern Sheridan Poythress__

Four Approaches by Evangelicals \(as per Darrel Bock\): \(1\) The New Testament use of the Old Testament implies that God meant more than the human author understood; \(2\) Rejection of the idea that God’s meaning surpasses the human author’s understanding; \(3\) The canon as the final context for interpretation; and \(4\), Apostolic hermeneutics are directly linked to Jewish interpretive practices\. The main issues – which Poythress addresses – are the dual authorship of the Bible and the New Testament’s use of the Old Testament\. __Situations with One and Two Authors\. __God, as the divine author, chose human intermediaries, fashioning their personalities to convey His message\. Although operating under divine inspiration, human authors retain their individual characteristics and knowledge\. This dual authorship brings the challenge of determining whether there are two distinct intentions and interpretations—one human and one divine\. The human author’s role is crucial, but prophets and other biblical writers do not speak as ordinary persons, prompting us to consider the level of divine understanding each possessed \(e\.g\., psalms, poetry, prophecy\)\. __Christological Focus in Interpretation\. __Jesus, both fully God and fully human, exemplifies dual authorship\. As a human, He had limitations in knowledge, yet as the Second Person of the Trinity, His speech carried divine authority, presenting a unified yet mysterious communication\. Jesus’ words should be interpreted in light of His identity and divine commissioning\. They are in harmony, not mathematically identical\. __Progressive Revelation\. __Scripture indicates that revelation is progressive, with the full picture only becoming clear with Christ’s coming\. This principle shows that OT prophecies often found unexpected fulfillments and OT symbols pointed towards greater truths\. Thus, Scripture can be understood at three levels: In the context \(1\) of the specific book it appears in, \(2\) of the canon available up to that point, and \(3\) of the entire canon of Scripture\. __Psalm 22:12\-18 Example__, for example, can be interpreted on three levels: as David’s personal experience, as representing Israel’s king, and as foreshadowing Christ\. The interpretation of a text thus involves a complex interplay of all three interpretive approaches: book\-specific, historical\-canonical up to that point, and the complete canonical context\. __Scholarly Use of Grammatical\-Historical Exegesis\. __Grammatical\-historical exegesis involves understanding Scripture as God’s words in human language and contexts\. It includes: \(1\) Paying attention to human linguistic and situational context; \(2\) Using grammatical\-historical analysis to counter traditionalism; \(3\) Recognizing the progressive nature of revelation\. However, interpretation extends \(i\.e\., multiperspectivalism\) beyond grammatical\-historical analysis by \(1\) Acknowledging the divine author’s role; \(2\) Exploring the full canonical context; \(3\) Affirming that laypeople can understand Scripture; and \(4\) Recognizing that NT writers did not confine themselves to grammatical\-historical methods, suggesting a broader interpretive approach\. Overall, Poythress emphasizes divine\-human authorship, the progressive nature of revelation, and the necessity of holistic \(i\.e\., multiperspectival\) interpretation that respects both historical context and the overarching biblical narrative\.

__6\. The New Testament’s Use of the Old Testament \- Dan G\. McCartney__

McCartney explores the hermeneutical methods used in the New Testament for interpreting the Old Testament, noting that figures like Paul did not employ a historical\-grammatical approach\. He presents four theses to explain this\. __One: Hermeneutical Method Is a Product of Worldview\. __Hermeneutical methods are deeply influenced by the worldview of their time\. For example, Origen and Medieval Exegetes utilized a fourfold meaning due to their prevailing worldview\. Contemporary methods also reflect current perspectives, such as premillennialism being more common in contexts of persecution\. Although culture\-boundedness exists, as bearers of God’s image, true communication can be contextually grounded within any culture\. Diverse perspectives are essential to understanding\. __Two: Hermeneutical Method is Subservient to Hermeneutical Goal\. __New Testament interpretation, such as Paul’s use of the Old Testament, serves the goal of conveying the message, sometimes literalizing figurative meanings\. Identifying the correct goal involves recognizing that the NT’s purpose evolves from the OT’s aims\. Among various scriptural interpretations \(e\.g\., Koran, Mormon texts\), only the NT maintains a clear, compatible focus with the OT worldview and objectives\. __Three: Our Worldview Must Be Compatible with the Biblical Worldview\.__ To interpret biblical texts genuinely, our worldview must align closely, though not identically, with that of the biblical writers\. While total identification is impossible, a compatible understanding—using the historical\-grammatical method when appropriate—facilitates true interpretation\. This involves a double hermeneutical circle where both natural revelation \(e\.g\., language comprehension\) and special revelation inform our worldview\. __Four: A Focus on Christ and His Redemptive Program Must Be Maintained\. __Hermeneutical methods should be subservient to the goal of highlighting Christ and His redemptive work\. The NT asserts that Christ fulfills everything written in the Law, Prophets, and Psalms, retaining the OT’s context within its quotations\. This contrasts with the Qumran community, which selectively interpreted only parts of the Mosaic Law\. For the NT, Christ fulfills the entire history and narrative of the OT, integrating historical meaning with its Christological fulfillment\.

Maintaining a focus on Christ requires *both of the following*: \(1\) a compatible worldview against neo\-orthodoxy and \(2\) the correct hermeneutical goal\. Bultmann and the Neo\-Orthodox only used \(2\) but rejected the worldview of the Bible itself \(1\)\. Legalism is an example that holds to \(1\) without using \(2\) and basically conflating our worldview with the Bible’s\. Ultimately, while the historical\-grammatical method is useful, it is insufficient alone; a holistic approach considering the divine goal and context is necessary for true biblical interpretation \(cf\. Poythress\)\.

__7\. Oral Tradition \- Bruce K\. Waltke__

Bruce K\. Waltke examines the principles and evidence surrounding the idea that oral tradition predates written Scripture and was reinterpreted over time before being committed to writing\. This perspective raises questions about the nature of revelation and the authenticity of seemingly changing loci\. __Form, Tradition, and Canonical Criticism\. __The theory that oral traditions existed before being written down and were reinterpreted in new settings to gain new meanings brings forth concerns about the stability and authenticity of such traditions\. Brevard Childs argues that only the final form of the canon matters, although there remains unease regarding the role of the final redactor\. Waltke challenges the notion of extensive oral prehistory through evidence from various sources\. __Ancient Near Eastern Literature\. __In examining ancient Near Eastern literature, Waltke finds multiple pieces of evidence\. From Ebla, we learn that highly literate cultures existed 3\-5 centuries before the patriarchs and 1000 years before Moses\. In Mesopotamia, there were minimal changes in epics and proverbs over centuries, with written hymns dating back to 1900 BC and practices indicating textual stability through oral memorization and recitation\. Hittite literature also underscores the importance of written commitment, while Ugaritic texts show that oral poetry often accompanied written forms\. In Egypt, transmission errors such as graphic errors, auricular mistakes, and memory slips occurred but didn’t indicate significant fluid reinterpretation\. __North\-West Semitic Regions\. __Despite the poor preservation due to the climate, we find evidence of high literacy, even among Israelite slaves\. This suggests that the oral traditions, potentially including those of the Pentateuch, were not overly fluid before being written down\. __Outside the Ancient Near East\. __There is a lack of substantial evidence pointing to oral traditions being molded to fit changing contexts over centuries in cultures outside the Ancient Near East\. __The Source of Patriarchal Narratives\. __Waltke notes that biblical narrators are often viewed as omniscient due to divine inspiration\. Even if God used oral traditions, this did not compromise the historicity of the narratives\. The divine orchestration and preservation of biblical texts ensure their reliability despite the processes they may have undergone, affirming their historical accuracy and divine origin\.

__8\. Storytellers and Poets in the Bible: Can Literary Artifice Be True? \- Tremper Longman III__

__Literature Versus Truth\. __Tremper Longman III explores the relationship between literature and truth in the Bible, emphasizing that fiction and poetry, which often employ literary artifice, contain truth\. This distinction is often misunderstood in modern contexts, where poetry is mistakenly seen as devoid of truth\. __The Bible as Literature\. __The Bible contains much non\-fiction but also utilizes literary artifice, especially in its poetic sections\. For example, the dialogues in Job are beautifully poetic and highly structured, making it unlikely that they were spoken exactly as written\. Similarly, the flood story in Genesis, though prose, demonstrates sophisticated literary techniques, such as sophisticated chiliasm and parallelism\. __The Literary Approach to the Bible\. __The literary approach to the Bible incorporates methods and attitudes from secular literary studies into biblical literature\. While this approach has its dangers, it also offers substantial benefits\. Modern prejudice often creates a false dichotomy between the literary and historical, leading some to describe the Old Testament as “historicized fiction” or “fictional history\.” However, Scripture is multifunctional, encompassing both literary and historical elements\. __Benefits of a Literary Approach\. __Longman concludes that the Bible is filled with literary forms, including stories and poetry\. There are several reasons for this approach: \(1\) By presenting theological truths in these forms, it captures the reader’s full attention and engagement via defamiliarization or distanciation; \(2\)  Literature appeals to the whole person—intellect, will, and emotions—more comprehensively than systematic theology alone\. In summary, understanding the Bible through its literary forms not only enriches our comprehension but also reveals the multidimensional ways God communicates His truth\.

__9\. Harmonization: A Help and a Hindrance \- Raymond B\. Dillard__

Raymond B\. Dillard explores the practice of harmonization in biblical interpretation, focusing on its role in addressing apparent contradictions and discrepancies in Scripture\. __Harmonization as a Help \- Its Assets\. __*Its Inevitability\. *In the presence of discrepancies, giving Scripture the benefit of the doubt and attempting harmonization is a natural response\. This approach is akin to how we handle data in other areas of life\. *Its Antiquity\. *Harmonization is not a product of the Enlightenment; it has ancient roots\. For instance, the Chronicler sometimes appears to harmonize doubles found in Kings, attempting to reconcile historical details\. *Its Contributions\. *Harmonization methods, while not provable as right or wrong outright, help explain variations in calendrical and regnal reckoning seen in the Ancient Near East, thereby providing chronological clarity\. *Its Respect for the Author\. *This technique focuses on understanding literary devices rather than assuming intentional misrepresentation of truth by the biblical authors\. *Its Theological Warrant\. *Given that God is true and cannot lie, harmonization is warranted by the belief that Scripture, as God’s word, is also true\. __Harmonization as a Hindrance \- Its Liabilities\. __*Its Arbitrariness\. *Harmonization can be arbitrary, such as interpreting large numbers in the Bible \(e\.g\., armies\) by redefining terms like “eleph” to mean tribe or officer\. However, this method doesn’t always apply consistently, such as in contexts involving large numbers of animals\. Multiple harmonization attempts can exist, yet only one can be true\. *Its Adequacy\. *Discrepancies in the Gospels, “incorrect” OT citations in the NT, and textual variations post\-Qumran \(e\.g\., the Chronicler using a significantly different source of Samuel than the Masoretic Text\) present challenges that require extensive exegetical, theological, and hermeneutical work to clarify\. *Its Focus\. *Harmonization aims to defend the doctrine of Scripture; however, this goal can be misguided if it concentrates too much on minutiae and problem\-solving\. The principal focus of exegesis should be explaining Scripture rather than solely defending inerrancy\.

In summary, while harmonization has a long history and has contributed significantly to biblical studies, it can be a mixed blessing\. When overused or applied too simplistically, it can lose credibility and fail to support the doctrine of Scripture effectively\. Genre criticism, despite its own challenges, might offer a way to address these issues more fruitfully\.

__10\. The New Testament as Canon \- Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\.__

Richard B\. Gaffin, Jr\. addresses two central questions regarding the New Testament  canon: when did the church recognize the canon, and must the church regard the canon as closed? __The Problem\. __The issue centers on the completed or closed character of Scripture\. While the Old Testament canon was established by Christ, the NT canon faced initial disputes over books like Hebrews, Revelation, and 2 Peter, as well as non\-canonical texts like the Shepherd of Hermas\. The challenge lies in reconciling this process with the fallible intentions of individuals\. __Criteria of Canonicity\. __Historical criteria for canonicity included antiquity, public lection, and inspiration \(though not all inspired material was included in the canon\)\. The early church emphasized apostolic authorship and conformity to apostolic teaching \(orthodoxy\)\. Later, the Historical\-Critical tradition rejected these criteria as outdated\. Karl Barth’s non\-verbal conception of revelation further complicated the issue, suggesting that the church failed to establish definitive criteria for canonicity\. Gaffin asserts that the NT is a self\-establishing, self\-validating entity—what is canonical is the NT itself, and vice versa\. __God is Canon\. __Gaffin argues that one cannot find an Archimedean point outside or above the NT canon since God is both its origin and author\. The canon’s existence and recognition involve both constitutive \(God’s action\) and reflexive \(the church’s action\) elements\. __The NT Canon and the History of Redemption \(Apostolicity and Canonicity\)\. __*The Apostles as Representatives of Christ*: The apostles had an authoritative commission akin to a power of attorney, functioning as Christ’s authorized representatives\. *The Apostles as the Foundation of the Church*: Apostles served as the foundational structure of the church, with Christ as the cornerstone \(Ephesians 2:20\)\. Their unique, once\-for\-all role is emphasized, distinguishing them from prophets\. *The Apostles as Witnesses*: Empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit, the Apostles were normative witnesses of revelation\. Their role involved ensuring the preservation of their witness, which became known as “tradition\.” *The Apostles and the Canon*: The apostles anticipated the recognition process of their writings as canonical, reflecting both apostolic intent and Christ’s intentions\. __The NT Canon and the History of Revelation__: There is a correlation between redemptive acts and revelatory work\. While the OT saw periods of inactivity after prophets, the NT marks a new revelatory phase after Christ’s exaltation and the church’s founding\. Here, revelation is considered closed until Christ’s return\. __The NT Canon is Closed\. __Gaffin examines three views on the NT’s completeness: \(1\) The NT as a human anthology of divinely inspired writings; \(2\) The NT as a complete entity shaped by God but open to continual additions; and \(3\) The NT, along with the OT, as a complete entity given by God which brings His authority—a view favored by Gaffin\. Gaffin supports the view that the current canon includes all that God chose to preserve\. He differentiates this question from that of variant readings, affirming that the NT as it exists is complete and authoritative\.

__11\. Normativity, Relevance, and Relativism \- Harvie Conn__

Harvie Conn discusses contemporary evangelical approaches to interpreting and applying biblical texts, addressing the challenges of ensuring Scripture’s relevance across different cultural contexts while avoiding relativism\. __Contemporary Evangelical Discussion\. __Conn notes the ongoing debate among evangelicals about the relevance and applicability of the Scriptures, such as whether foot\-washing should still be considered an institution\. Hermeneutics involves exegesis to explain authorial intention, yet there remains a gap in its applicability\. Neo\-Orthodoxy posits that Scripture conveys situationally bound rather than timeless information\. Reader\-response theory suggests that text gains meaning only through interaction with the reader, leading to questions like “What does Scripture mean to *me*?” Evangelicals maintain that the meaning in the original context should translate to meaning in our contemporary context, countering the Neo\-Orthodox claim that Scripture merely becomes the Word of God upon reading\. They argue that the Word is not passive but actively seeks application\. __A New Agenda of Problems\. __New issues arise from old questions:

1. The historical and cultural nature of revelation raises questions about its relation to inerrancy, revealing the culture\-bound character of Scripture\.
2. The cultural, social, and worldview dispositions of interpreters affect how Scripture is understood and applied today\. Acknowledging the myth of a neutral observer, Conn highlights that everyone brings presuppositions to Scripture\.
3. The hermeneutical gap poses challenges in crossing cultural boundaries between the original context and ours\. Limitations of “application” show that “plain meaning” addresses only one horizon\.

__Living in the Hermeneutical Spiral\. __Evangelicals navigate a “hermeneutical spiral” akin to the progress of sanctification, where understanding evolves as Scripture reshapes cultural questions and vice versa\. Unlike the static approach of Hans\-Georg Gadamer’s “New Hermeneutic,” this dynamic, upward spiral keeps the Bible central and normative\. __False Leads\. __Principles can also be culturally contextual, showing that all readings are dependent on both the text and the translator’s perspective\. There should not be a false distinction between normative principles and cultural injunctions\. __Clues from the Godward Side of Hermeneutics\. __God condescends in the hermeneutical spiral as Father, Teacher, and Physician\. Guidelines include: \(1\) Original intent understood through exegesis forms the foundation; \(2\) Seeking universals within redemptive\-historical epochs, acknowledging that cultural particulars do not cloud God’s self\-disclosure\. This shared task links us with Paul; and \(3\) The Holy Spirit actively participates in the interpretative process, working through our cultural conditioning\. __Clues from the Human Side of Hermeneutics\. __Recognizing our biases, several approaches help: \(1\) Awareness of differences \(or “distancing”\) between cultural contexts is essential, even if feared as relativism\. The Word of God includes broader general revelation\. \(2\) Our assumptions can aid the interpretative task, as the two horizons \(original and contemporary\) fuse at the heart level through the Holy Spirit and progressive sanctification\. \(3\) Acknowledging cultural and interpretative particularity aids understanding\. Paul’s sensitivity to cultural perceptions \(e\.g\., long hair in 1 Corinthians\) shows intention to avoid unnecessary offense and uphold general cultural order\. In sum, Conn emphasizes the complex interplay between maintaining the normativity of Scripture and ensuring its relevance, advocating for a dynamic approach informed by both divine guidance and cultural awareness\.

__12\. The Use of the Bible in Ethics \- David Clowney__

David Clowney explores the Bible’s teachings about its role in guiding ethical life\. He begins by emphasizing that biblical laws are not meant to be followed mechanically but instead understood as part of a divine framework that includes exemplary commands, reasons for those commands, and overarching principles\. __Commands for Grown\-Ups: The Bible as God’s Law for Life\. __Clowney outlines three main objections to viewing the Bible as God’s law\. __One: Law Versus Grace__\. While some fear legalism, Clowney argues that the moral law remains relevant\. The Reformers highlighted its importance in revealing our need for Christ, promoting civic righteousness, and guiding life in Christ \(the third use of the law\)\. These laws must be approached through Christ to maintain proper motivation and content\. __Two: Letter Versus Spirit__\. Ethical conduct is not dictated by rigid applications of laws but by the Holy Spirit, who teaches through examples rather than step\-by\-step instructions\. Key principles for the apostles included the example of Christ, the law of love, and God’s intention to unify all things in Christ\. __Three: New Rules for New Times?__ Clowney acknowledges that while biblical norms evolved from the Old Testament to the New Testament, there are questions about the continuation of progressive moral revelation\. Understanding these requires a redemptive\-historical perspective\. __“On Whom the Ends of the Ages Have Come”: Ethics and Redemptive History\. __Clowney insists that revelational history serves as moral paradigms, providing motivation, examples, and existential grounding\. The key is Christ, whose life and teachings guide us\. While the New Testament contains situational applications of principles, the overarching story of redemption informs how we live today\. For example, the gradual transformation of life within existing social structures like slavery demonstrates the application of Christian principles over time, changing hearts rather than directly altering structures\. __“I Am Your God; You Are My People”: Covenantal Ethics\. __Beyond goals and commandments, God desires a covenantal relationship with His people, calling for us to glorify and enjoy Him forever\. The personal character of Christianity and the Bible provides the motivation for ethical living\. This relationship\-based approach moves beyond cold legalism, calling us to live in the light of God’s love and presence\. The Spirit of God transforms us into new creations, driving us to ask, “Who is the Lord, how has He loved us, to what does His presence call us, what sorts of persons are we and should we be because we are in Christ, and how, in that light, should we live?” Clowney concludes that ethical living is shaped by understanding biblical laws through the lens of redemptive history and covenantal relationship\. This perspective gives us the framework to explore and apply biblical teachings in our lives\.

__13\. Bible Authority: When Christians Do Not Agree \- George C\. Fuller and Samuel T\. Logan Jr\.__

George C\. Fuller and Samuel T\. Logan Jr\. tackle the implications of differing views on biblical authority among Christians, emphasizing how these stances should not determine Christian identity\. They argue that, logically, Christians must affirm the authority of the Bible, yet some seek to affirm their faith while denying inerrancy\. This inconsistency arises from wrong presuppositions or borrowing capital from the Christian tradition\. The chapter warns against two temptations: viewing those who differ on Scripture as non\-Christian and glossing over the inconsistency of affirming the incarnate Word while denying the written Word\. __The View from the Extremes\. __The spectrum of beliefs ranges from liberal/radical to conservative/fundamentalist, with mutual suspicion often characterizing interactions\. On the left, the Bible is seen as just another book, while on the right, it is inerrant, with no further discussion needed\. __Discontinuity in the Spectrum\. __A critical question is where the gospel disappears on this spectrum\. Typically, individuals place this point just to their left\. Others ask where the gospel is distorted by sterility and pharisaic impotence, typically placing this point just to their right\. __Life on the Spectrum\. __Those on the left may emphasize shared fellowship in Christ, while those on the right stress the good and sufficient reasons for their view on Scripture\. Regardless of stance, both sides should expect and engage with challenges and criticism\. __Proper Response to Challenge\. __Effective communication with those holding different views on biblical authority necessitates dialogue rather than throwing epithets\. Christians should “walk in each other’s shoes” to better understand different perspectives\. __Issuing Challenges Properly\. __When the written and incarnate Word are separated, a critical yet gracious response is necessary\. There’s a gap or chasm, and those on the other side should be treated with the hope that they might recognize their error\. Extremes include pietism, which bases doctrines on human *experience* rather than God, and humanism, which bases doctrines on human *reason*, with God no longer as the ultimate authority\. Responses should be courteous, examining whether the difference is merely interpretative or represents a fundamental crossing of the gap\. __Proper Outlook Toward Others\. __Christians should treat others as they wish to be treated, challenging them *graciously and firmly* but avoiding labeling them as non\-Christians\. All should be regarded as fellow Christians, yet they must be gently challenged on their views to foster mutual understanding and growth in faith\.

__14\. Evangelicals and the Bible: *A Bibliographic Postscript* \-John R\. Meuther__

In the 1970s, evangelical discussions focused on inerrancy, while the 1980s shifted to hermeneutics\. Recent challenges include the hermeneutics of liberation, feminism, and suspicion, which question traditional interpretations\. Meuther raises the question of whether evangelicals can survive in a world of faith and criticism\. Discussions will continue as evangelicals navigate new hermeneutical challenges and evolving cultural contexts\.
