# Lesslie Newbigin (1909–1998)

Lesslie Newbigin’s theology of **Church and Kingdom** centers on the Church as the sign, instrument, and foretaste of the **Kingdom of God** within history. He rejects both the identification and separation of Church and Kingdom, insisting that the **mission of the Church** is to witness to the **reign of Christ** in the midst of the world, embodying the **eschatological hope** inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection.

- "The Church is not meant to call men and women out of the world into a safe religious enclave but to call them out in order to send them back as agents of God’s kingship." (The Gospel in a Pluralist Society)

## Key Works

- The Gospel in a Pluralist Society (1989)
- Foolishness to the Greeks: The Gospel and Western Culture (1986)
- The Open Secret: An Introduction to the Theology of Mission (1978)
- The Household of God: Lectures on the Nature of the Church (1953)
- A Word in Season: Perspectives on Christian World Mission (1994)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Sign, Instrument, and Foretaste of the Kingdom**
    - The Church is not the Kingdom, but points beyond itself to the **eschatological reign of God**.
    - It is called to embody the values and life of the Kingdom in the present world.
    - The Church’s life is a visible sign of God’s future for the world.
    - Its mission is inseparable from its identity as a foretaste of the coming Kingdom.
    - "The Church is the provisional incorporation of mankind into Christ, the sign, instrument, and first-fruit of God’s purpose." (The Gospel in a Pluralist Society)

2. **Mission as Participation in God’s Kingdom**
    - The Church’s mission is grounded in the **missio Dei**, not merely in institutional expansion.
    - Mission is participation in the ongoing work of Christ’s **reconciliation** and **renewal**.
    - The Church is sent into the world as a witness to the Kingdom’s reality and promise.
    - Evangelism and social action are united in the Church’s witness to the Kingdom.
    - "The mission of the Church is to make the Kingdom present in the life of the world." (The Open Secret)

3. **Rejection of Church–Kingdom Identification**
    - The Church must not equate itself with the fullness of the Kingdom.
    - The Kingdom is God’s sovereign rule, which transcends all human institutions.
    - The Church is always in need of repentance and renewal in light of the Kingdom.
    - This distinction guards against triumphalism and ecclesiocentrism.
    - "The Church is not the Kingdom of God; it is the community of those who bear witness to the Kingdom." (The Household of God)

4. **Eschatological Orientation of the Church**
    - The Church lives in the tension of the **already/not yet** of the Kingdom.
    - Its hope is rooted in the **resurrection** and the promised consummation of all things.
    - The Church’s life and mission are shaped by anticipation of the Kingdom’s fullness.
    - This eschatological vision fuels perseverance and humility in mission.
    - "The Church lives by the power of the age to come, but in the midst of the present age." (The Gospel in a Pluralist Society)

5. **Public Witness and Engagement with Culture**
    - The Church is called to engage the world as a distinct yet public community.
    - Its witness challenges both secular and religious distortions of the Kingdom.
    - The Church must resist privatization and embody the **Lordship of Christ** in all of life.
    - Faithful presence in society is essential to the Church’s Kingdom vocation.
    - "The Church is called to be the place where men and women are prepared for responsible action in the world in the light of the Kingdom." (Foolishness to the Greeks)

## Legacy and Impact

Newbigin’s vision of the **Church and Kingdom** has profoundly shaped contemporary missiology, especially in the areas of **public theology** and the Church’s engagement with pluralistic societies. His insistence on the Church as a sign and foretaste of the Kingdom has influenced ecumenical dialogue and the practice of mission in the West. Newbigin’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the Church’s identity, mission, and relationship to culture, challenging Christians to embody the Kingdom in every sphere of life.
