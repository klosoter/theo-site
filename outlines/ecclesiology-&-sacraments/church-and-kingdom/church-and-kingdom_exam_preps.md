### TITLE
Between Institution and Eschaton: Reformed Ecclesiology and the Kingdom of Christ

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How the visible and invisible **church** relate to the present and future **kingdom of God**, and how this relation structures Reformed doctrine, worship, and mission.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Geerhardus Vos, and Abraham Kuyper.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic Latin theology on the civitas Dei, magisterial Reformation and **Reformed scholastic** ecclesiology, neo-Calvinism and **biblical theology** in the Dutch tradition, with Roman Catholic and Anabaptist positions as primary external contrasts.
- Debates:
  - Internal: marks and attributes of the church, **visible/invisible church**, church–state relation, “transformationist” vs “pilgrim” construals of the kingdom.
  - External: Roman Catholic **societas perfecta** and papal primacy, Anabaptist **sectarian** ecclesiology, liberal “social gospel” kingdom-ethic.
  - Contemporary: “missional church,” Kuyperian cultural engagement, theonomy and Christian nationalism, inaugurated eschatology and “kingdom” language detached from the church.
- Defended position: In classic Reformed theology the church is the institutional and sacramental center of Christ’s present reign, truly but not exhaustively identified with the kingdom, such that the kingdom is broader in extent yet never separable in history or eschatology from the **people, ministry, and ordinances** of the church.

### ESSAY
The relation of **church and kingdom** is a pressure point where ecclesiology, eschatology, and Christology converge. To answer cleanly before examiners one must first define the terms: by the church we mean the one people of God in all ages, as it exists invisibly as the totality of the elect united to Christ, and visibly as congregations where the word is preached, the sacraments administered, and discipline exercised. By the kingdom of God we mean the dynamic exercise of Christ’s royal rule over all things, with a particular saving form in which sinners are brought under that rule through union with the Mediator. The decisive question is whether the church is simply identical with this saving kingdom, merely an instrument of it, or its sacramental and institutional center. The position defended here is that the kingdom is the reign of the triune God in Christ, extending as common and special rule, but that within history and consummation alike, this reign always has a visible, covenantal, and doxological center in the church.

Augustine is the first decisive figure because he reframed the problem by relocating the locus of God’s people and God’s rule in a changing political world. In The City of God, written after the sack of Rome, he rejects any simple identification of the kingdom with a temporal political order, whether Roman empire or post-Constantinian Christendom. Instead he draws the distinction between the civitas Dei and the civitas terrena. These two “cities” are defined not by institutional boundaries, but by two loves: the love of God to the contempt of self, and the love of self to the contempt of God. The historical church, including its mixed composition of elect and reprobate, largely overlaps with the pilgrim form of the city of God, but never exhausts or perfectly displays it. Augustine therefore affirms a real but eschatologically conditioned correlation between church and kingdom: the church is the historical embodiment of the city of God, but the final manifestation of that city is the eschatological kingdom in glory. Examiners will press whether this dissolves the institutional church into an invisible “city” of the heart. The answer is that Augustine, especially in his anti-Donatist writings, robustly affirms the visibility, sacramentality, and catholicity of the church: the city of God is concretely present in word and sacrament under a mixed administration until the last judgment. Here he sets the path for the **mixed body** doctrine that will shape magisterial ecclesiology: the kingdom is already present in the sacraments and discipline of the church, but its holiness is veiled under the form of a corpus permixtum.

John Calvin takes Augustine’s distinction, but in a post-Reformation configuration where the institutional church itself is contested. Calvin’s Institutes, particularly book four, stand at the center of Reformed reflection on church and kingdom. Calvin defines the church as the mother of believers and the place where God is pleased to nourish his children. He distinguishes the visible church, where all who profess the true religion and their children are counted, from the invisible church, which consists only of the elect. Examiners may challenge whether this renders the visible church a mere human shell around an invisible reality. Calvin’s response is clear: the visible church, so far as God is pleased to work through the ordained ministry of word and sacraments, is a true manifestation of the kingdom. He defines the kingdom of Christ as that spiritual reign by which he governs and protects his people, chiefly through the internal work of the Spirit, but also through the external administration of the gospel.

Calvin is decisive for two conceptual moves. First, he binds **kingdom and covenant** together. The kingdom is the form that the covenant of grace assumes as Christ, the mediatorial king, rules his people. Thus the church is not merely a voluntary society of the pious, but the covenant community in which Christ’s royal promises and demands are administered. Second, in his polemic against the so-called “fanatics,” he resists any tendency to identify the kingdom with inner illumination apart from institutional form. The Spirit binds believers to the visible word and churchly discipline as means of grace. Regarding church and state, Calvin rejects a theocratic collapse of the kingdom into political order but affirms a distinction of **two governments** in the one kingdom of Christ: the spiritual government of the church and the temporal government of the magistrate. The magistrate has a calling under the broader rule of Christ, but the specific administration of the saving kingdom is entrusted to the ministry of the church. Here one must be ready to answer whether this is Erastian. Calvin, unlike some Reformed successors, keeps a principled distinction: the magistrate may support and protect the church, but may not administer word and sacrament. Thus for Calvin, the church is not the totality of the kingdom, but the principal sphere where Christ’s saving reign is exercised.

Herman Bavinck, working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, rearticulates this in the context of modern pluralistic society and Roman Catholic claims after Vatican I. Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics is especially helpful because he carefully distinguishes kingdom as reign from kingdom as realm, and then maps the church’s role within that distinction. The kingdom, in its broadest sense, is the total sovereignty of God over all creation by **providence**. In a narrower, redemptive sense, the kingdom is the new creation order in Christ, already inaugurated and advancing in history. The church is the assembly of those who share in this new life and are united to the king. Bavinck insists that the church is neither identical with the kingdom nor merely one voluntary association within it. It is the institutional form and first-fruits of the kingdom, the place where the kingdom’s life, truth, and righteousness are concentrated and from which they radiate. This allows him to resist two opposite errors. Against Roman Catholicism, he rejects equating the kingdom with the hierarchical church as a juridical **societas perfecta** under papal headship. Against liberal Protestantism and social gospel theories, he resists equating the kingdom with ethical progress or social uplift detached from the supernatural rebirth that constitutes the church.

Examiners will often test whether this Bavinckian distinction between church and kingdom underwrites a robust doctrine of cultural engagement without sacralizing culture. Bavinck affirms that Christ as king is Lord over science, art, family, and state. The kingdom broadly understood renews all of life. Yet he maintains a covenantal distinction between the **church as organism** and the **church as institution**. As organism, the church is the totality of believers in all their callings; as institution, the church is the assembly under officebearers gathered around word and sacrament. The kingdom manifests itself in both, but uniquely and normatively in the institutional church. This keeps the church from being swallowed by cultural programs while preventing kingdom language from being reduced to ecclesiastical boundaries.

Herman Bavinck must be read alongside his contemporary Abraham Kuyper, whose theology of **sphere sovereignty** has deeply impacted Reformed talk of church and kingdom, especially in neo-Calvinist circles. Kuyper famously insists that there is not a square inch of reality over which Christ does not cry “Mine.” He speaks of two kinds of grace, **common grace** and **particular grace**, and two corresponding centers: the world under common grace and the church as the sphere of particular grace. The kingdom, for Kuyper, has a broad societal manifestation in the Christianization of all spheres of life: politics, education, commerce, art. This gives rise to a more expansive understanding of the kingdom than one finds in Calvin. Critics inside the Reformed camp have charged Kuyper with displacing the church from the center of the kingdom, effectively treating the kingdom as a cultural project. Yet Kuyper himself strongly emphasizes the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments as the heart of the church’s life, and he never abandons the visible church as the locus of covenant identity.

The internal Reformed debate that grows out of Kuyper concerns whether the kingdom should be primarily described in institutional–ecclesial terms, or in transformational–cultural terms. Many “neo-Calvinist” heirs of Kuyper emphasize the kingdom as renewal of creational structures and can speak of the church as “servant of the kingdom” rather than as its center. Others, drawing more strongly on Bavinck and the classical confessions, insist that while the kingdom indeed touches every sphere, the church as the institutional expression of the covenant of grace is the primary embassy of that kingdom in history. Before examiners, one must be able to affirm the goodness of cultural labor under Christ’s lordship while refusing to identify cultural influence with kingdom advance as such. The defended position is that cultural obedience of Christians is fruit and witness of the kingdom, but the formally constituted church is the place where the keys of the kingdom are exercised and where the eschatological kingdom is sacramentally anticipated.

To solidify the relationship between church and kingdom in redemptive history, Geerhardus Vos must be brought into view. Vos, often called the father of Reformed **biblical theology**, shows how the kingdom theme develops from the Old Testament theocracy through the ministry of Jesus to the apostolic church. In his work on the teaching of Jesus, Vos argues that the kingdom is primarily the dynamic inbreaking of God’s eschatological rule in and through the person of Christ. The church, on his account, is the gathered community of those who live from that inbreaking. Vos thus upholds inaugurated eschatology: the kingdom is “already and not yet.” The “already” is realized in the presence of the king and the gift of the Spirit; the “not yet” awaits the resurrection of the body and the renewal of all things.

This inaugurated structure has significant ecclesiological consequences. The church is the form the kingdom takes between the comings of Christ. It is not a different entity from the kingdom, but the community that exists because the king has already come and will come again. Vos places particular emphasis on the way in which the apostolic church understands itself as the **first-fruits** of the new creation. Pentecost is not primarily an institutional moment, but an eschatological one; yet it gives rise to institutional structures that are not arbitrary but essential to the kingdom’s present administration. When examiners press contemporary “kingdom without church” rhetoric, Vos is the key figure for showing that the New Testament does not know of a realized kingdom apart from the apostolic pattern of word, sacrament, and discipline. The kingdom is not a free-floating ethical ideal, nor a generalized spirit of justice in the world. It is the reign of the crucified and risen Christ, effectually present where he gathers and builds his church.

With these figures in view, the internal, external, and contemporary debates can be articulated more sharply. Internally, Reformed theology has struggled to balance the **visible/invisible church** distinction and the **marks of the true church** with a robust sense of the kingdom’s cosmic scope. Some strands have practically identified the kingdom with the institutional church and its offices, producing an overly introverted ecclesiology. Others have diluted the church into one important but not decisive expression of a kingdom equated with social transformation. The confessional Reformed tradition, from Calvin through Bavinck and Vos, offers a more coherent synthesis: the invisible church is the kingdom as it exists in its perfected membership, the elect united to Christ; the visible church is the kingdom as it exists under the conditions of history, mixed with hypocrites and administered through fallible but real means of grace. The marks of the church are thus also marks of the kingdom’s presence: wherever Christ rules by his word, seals his promise in sacraments, and purifies his people through discipline, there the kingdom is at hand.

Externally, the chief dialogue partners are Roman Catholic and Anabaptist ecclesiologies and, more recently, liberal Protestant kingdom ethics. Roman Catholic theology after Trent and especially after Vatican I tends to equate the kingdom of God, in its present historical form, with the Roman church as a juridical and sacramental society under the pope. The kingdom is thus visibly, formally present wherever the papal church is. The Reformed critique, already in Calvin and sharpened by Bavinck, is that this confuses the ministerial authority of the church with the royal authority of Christ. Christ alone is king of the church. The church’s authority is ministerial and declarative, exercised under **sola Scriptura**. The pope cannot be the vicar of Christ in a monarchical sense, because Christ continues to rule his church directly by his Spirit and word. On the other hand, Anabaptist and later free church traditions tend to locate the kingdom in pure gathered communities of the regenerate, often sharply separated from political and cultural structures. Here the Reformed response is that while the church should indeed seek regenerate membership and holy discipline, it must not imagine an unmixt ecclesia perfecta in history, nor withdraw the lordship of Christ from common life. The kingdom is present amidst weakness and mixture in the historical church, and Christ’s royal claims extend to magistrate, marketplace, and family even as the church remains a pilgrim people.

Liberal Protestantism and the social gospel relocate the kingdom almost entirely into historical ethical progress and social justice. The church, on this account, is an instrument of kingdom values, but the supernatural elements of regeneration, atonement, and eschatological judgment recede. Here Reformed theology must insist that apart from reconciliation in the blood of Christ and the gift of the Spirit, there is no entry into the saving kingdom. Social improvement without conversion is not the kingdom in the New Testament sense. Yet one must also affirm, with Kuyper and Bavinck, that the ethical demands of the kingdom do bear on social structures and that redeemed individuals and communities will work for justice as fruit of the gospel. The critical distinction is that this ethical fruit cannot be abstracted from the church’s primary charge to preach Christ crucified and to make disciples, which is the principal way the kingdom advances.

Contemporary debates tend to scramble these issues under new labels. The “missional church” movement rightly criticizes an ecclesiology that sees the church as a vendor of religious goods and instead recovers the notion that the church is sent as an embassy of the kingdom. However, in some versions, “kingdom” language is deployed so broadly that it is difficult to distinguish the mission of the church from any humanitarian project. In defense, one must articulate that the mission of the church as church is narrowly defined by Christ’s commission: preaching, sacrament, discipline, and catechesis. Individual Christians, as members of the church in the world, have broader callings. Confusing these leads either to ecclesiastical activism in every domain or to the evacuation of doctrinal content from mission in favor of generic “kingdom work.”

On the other end, recent movements such as theonomy and Christian nationalism claim a more direct visible manifestation of the kingdom in political structures. Appeals are made to Old Testament theocracy, to Christ’s universal kingship, and to the duty of nations to confess the true religion. Examining these, one must distinguish Christ’s **mediatorial kingship over the church** from his providential rule over the nations. The New Testament never authorizes the church to wield the sword or to identify any temporal polity as the realized kingdom. The Reformed two-kingdoms or twofold government doctrine is helpful here: Christ rules his church by his word and Spirit in a redemptive way and rules the civil order by common grace. This does not forbid Christian political engagement, nor deny that magistrates have moral obligations before God, but it rejects collapsing the eschatological kingdom into a civil order. The church’s weapon is the word, not the sword.

Another contemporary pressure comes from evangelical appropriation of inaugurated eschatology. “Kingdom now” language is often detached from classic ecclesiology, with talk of “joining God’s mission in the world” without serious account of the church’s form and discipline. Vos and Bavinck again provide categories: the kingdom is indeed already present, but precisely in and through the church’s life as the body of Christ. The sacraments are not optional symbols but kingdom signs and seals. Baptism and the Lord’s Supper mark the boundary and sustenance of the kingdom community. To downplay church membership and discipline while exalting “kingdom mission” is to deny the very shape the king has given to his reign in this age.

Against these distortions, the defended position draws the lines in the following way. The kingdom of God is the triune God’s saving and judging reign in Christ, inaugurated in his first coming and consummated at his return. In its present form, this kingdom is concretely manifested wherever Christ gathers believers by his word and Spirit into local congregations that bear the marks of the true church. The invisible church is the kingdom considered in its perfect spiritual membership and destiny; the visible institutional church is the kingdom as it exists under the administration of the means of grace in history. The kingdom is broader in the sense that Christ’s reign extends to all of life, including political and cultural spheres, and in the sense that there are elect not yet gathered into the church. Yet this broader reign is ordered toward and flows out from the church, which is the royal priesthood and temple of the living God.

When examiners ask whether one can speak of “kingdom work” outside the church, the answer is yes, but only analogically. Acts of obedience done in faith by believers in their vocations are fruits of the kingdom and anticipations of the new creation. Structures of justice and mercy that accord with God’s law reflect his reign at the level of common grace. But strictly speaking, the keys of the kingdom, as confessed in classic Reformed polity, are entrusted to the church’s officers in the proclamation of the gospel and the exercise of discipline. Therefore the church is not one ministry among many in the kingdom, but the king’s own embassy and household. To neglect the church while speaking of the kingdom is to reject the means by which the king makes his reign known and effective.

Finally, the church’s relation to the eschatological kingdom must be underscored. The church is both the already and the seed of the not yet. In worship, the church ascends by the Spirit into the heavenly assembly and participates proleptically in the reality of the age to come. In this way the Lord’s Day gathering is the central kingdom event in the week, a weekly manifestation of the eschatological kingdom in the midst of the present age. At the last day, there will not be a kingdom that displaces the church; rather, the church will be perfected as the bride, the new Jerusalem, and the people over whom the king reigns in manifest glory. Thus, from Augustine’s civitas Dei to Calvin’s twofold kingdom, from Bavinck’s church as first-fruits to Vos’s inaugurated eschatology, the Reformed tradition consistently maintains that while church and kingdom can and must be distinguished conceptually, they cannot be separated in the purposes of God. Any theology that relativizes the church in the name of the kingdom has in fact departed from the scriptural pattern and from the confession that Christ “loved the church and gave himself up for her” in order that she might share eternally in his royal reign.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **kingdom of God** is the triune God’s saving reign in Christ, already and not yet; the **church** is the covenant community gathered by that reign, invisibly as the elect united to Christ and visibly as congregations where word, sacraments, and discipline manifest the kingdom’s presence.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: distinguished civitas Dei from earthly politics, locating the kingdom in the pilgrim city of God embodied in the mixed historical church.
  - Calvin: articulated visible/invisible church, tied kingdom to **covenant** and the ministry of word and sacrament, and distinguished spiritual and civil governments under Christ.
  - Bavinck: distinguished kingdom as reign and realm, treated the church as institutional first-fruits and center of the kingdom against both Roman and liberal reductions.
  - Kuyper: emphasized Christ’s lordship over all spheres via common and particular grace, stimulating internal Reformed debate over cultural “kingdom” and ecclesial centrality.
  - Vos: framed kingdom in inaugurated eschatology, showing the church as the historical form of the eschatological kingdom between the comings of Christ.
- Debates:
  - Internal: balance of **visible/invisible church**, identity vs distinction of church and kingdom, Kuyperian cultural transformation versus pilgrim ecclesial focus.
  - External: Roman Catholic identification of kingdom with papal church, Anabaptist separatist “kingdom communities,” liberal social gospel equating kingdom with ethical progress.
  - Contemporary: “missional church” and diffuse kingdom language, theonomy and Christian nationalism, kingdom rhetoric detached from word–sacrament–discipline.
- Defended position: The kingdom is broader than the church in scope but never separable from it; the visible, instituted church is the sacramental and administrative center of Christ’s saving reign, while believers’ cultural obedience is fruit of that reign, not its primary locus.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Is the church identical with the kingdom?  
    No; the kingdom is Christ’s reign, the church is its covenant people and institutional center, but they are never separated in God’s plan.
  - How do you relate kingdom to church in inaugurated eschatology?  
    The already of the kingdom is concretely realized in the church’s worship and discipline; the not yet is the perfected church in glory.
  - What is the Reformed critique of Roman Catholic “kingdom = church”?  
    It confuses Christ’s royal authority with human hierarchy and identifies the kingdom with a juridical structure rather than with Christ’s rule by word and Spirit.
  - How do you avoid collapsing the kingdom into cultural transformation?  
    By insisting that the keys of the kingdom belong to the church’s ministry and that cultural obedience is fruit, not definition, of the kingdom.
  - What is the role of the visible/invisible distinction for church and kingdom?  
    It guards both the mixed character of the present church and the certainty that the true kingdom consists of the elect united to Christ, even when this is not perfectly visible.
