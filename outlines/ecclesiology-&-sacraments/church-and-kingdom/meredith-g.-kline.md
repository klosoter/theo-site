# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline offered a distinctive vision of the relationship between the **church** and the **kingdom of God**, emphasizing the church as the visible covenant community and the kingdom as the eschatological reality inaugurated by Christ. He stressed the **already/not yet** dynamic of the kingdom and distinguished the church’s pilgrim status from the typological theocracy of Old Testament Israel, shaping a robust biblical-theological framework for **ecclesiology**.

- "The church is not the kingdom in its consummate form but is the community of those who have entered into the kingdom’s preliminary realization." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Structure of Biblical Authority
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Church and Kingdom**
    - The **church** is the visible, covenantal assembly, while the **kingdom** is the eschatological reign of God.
    - The church participates in the kingdom but does not exhaust or fully embody it.
    - The kingdom is present in an inaugurated sense but awaits consummation.
    - Kline rejects any identification of the institutional church with the fullness of the kingdom.
    "The church is the present form of the kingdom community, but the kingdom itself is a broader, eschatological reality." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Intrusion Ethics and Theocracy**
    - Old covenant Israel functioned as a typological theocracy, uniquely manifesting kingdom realities.
    - The ethics of the Mosaic theocracy (e.g., holy war, civil law) are not normative for the church age.
    - The church exists as a pilgrim people, not as a geopolitical kingdom.
    - The intrusion of final judgment in Israel’s history is not repeated in the church’s mission.
    "The theocratic kingdom was an intrusion of the final judgment into the midst of common grace history." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Covenantal Structure of the Church**
    - The church is defined by **covenant membership** and the administration of covenant signs.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper mark out the visible boundaries of the church.
    - The church’s identity is rooted in its relationship to the new covenant in Christ.
    - The church is a community under the authority of God’s word and sacraments.
    "The church is constituted as the covenant community by the administration of the covenant signs." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The kingdom has been inaugurated by Christ but awaits its consummation at his return.
    - The church lives in the tension between the present reality and future fulfillment of the kingdom.
    - The church’s mission is to bear witness to the coming kingdom, not to establish it in fullness.
    - The sacraments and preaching are means by which the kingdom is presently manifested.
    "The kingdom is already present in the midst of history, but its fullness is yet to come." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Pilgrim Ecclesiology**
    - The church is a pilgrim people, distinct from the world and awaiting the consummation.
    - The church’s calling is spiritual, not political or territorial.
    - The church’s life is marked by suffering, witness, and anticipation of the kingdom.
    - The church’s hope is fixed on the return of Christ and the final establishment of the kingdom.
    "The church is a pilgrim community, journeying toward the consummation of the kingdom." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and eschatological distinctions have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and the understanding of the church’s relationship to the kingdom. His emphasis on the **pilgrim status** of the church and the typological nature of Old Testament theocracy has influenced debates on the church’s role in society and politics. Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblical-theological approach to the church and the kingdom of God.
