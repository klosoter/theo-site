# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Church** and **Kingdom** is foundational for Western theology, distinguishing sharply between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**. He emphasizes the **pilgrim status** of the Church in this age, seeing it as the visible manifestation of the **Kingdom of God** on earth, yet always mixed with the fallen world until the final consummation.

- "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to the contempt of God, made the earthly city; love of God, even to the contempt of self, made the heavenly city." (City of God, XIV.28)

## Key Works

- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana)
- Sermons on the New Testament Lessons
- Letters (Epistulae)
- The Confessions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between the Two Cities**
    - The **City of God** and the **earthly city** are defined by their ultimate loves and destinies.
    - The Church is the earthly manifestation of the City of God, but not identical with it.
    - The two cities are intermixed in history, only to be separated at the end.
    - Membership in the visible Church does not guarantee citizenship in the City of God.
    - "Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves..." (City of God, XIV.28)

2. **Pilgrim Church**
    - The Church is a **pilgrim people**, journeying through history toward its heavenly home.
    - The Church’s true citizenship is in heaven, not in any earthly polity.
    - Suffering and imperfection are expected in the Church’s earthly existence.
    - The Church’s mission is to witness to the Kingdom while awaiting its full realization.
    - "The Church, though now on pilgrimage, is nevertheless the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

3. **Sacramental and Mixed Nature of the Church**
    - The visible Church contains both **wheat and tares** until the final judgment.
    - Sacraments mark the boundaries of the visible Church but do not guarantee inward grace.
    - The Church is holy in its Head and calling, but not all its members are regenerate.
    - The distinction between visible and invisible Church is crucial for ecclesiology.
    - "Many who appear to be without are within, and many who appear to be within are without." (Homilies on 1 John, 3.2)

4. **Church as the Present Form of the Kingdom**
    - The Church is the present, historical form of the **Kingdom of God** on earth.
    - The Kingdom is already inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - The Church’s authority is derived from Christ’s kingship.
    - The Church’s mission is to extend the Kingdom through preaching, sacraments, and charity.
    - "The Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven." (City of God, XX.9)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The fullness of the Kingdom will only be realized at the **end of the age**.
    - The Church’s hope is directed toward the resurrection and the final vision of God.
    - The separation of the two cities will be completed only in the eschaton.
    - The Church’s present struggles anticipate future glory.
    - "Then, at last, shall the saints reign with their King forever..." (City of God, XX.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s vision of the **Church and Kingdom** shaped medieval and Reformation ecclesiology, providing a framework for understanding the Church’s identity as both a visible institution and a spiritual reality. His distinction between the **two cities** influenced Christian attitudes toward politics, culture, and eschatology. Augustine’s thought remains central to debates about the relationship between the Church and the world, and his emphasis on the Church’s pilgrim status continues to inform Reformed and Catholic theology alike.
