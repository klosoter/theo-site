# Peter Leithart (1959– )

Peter Leithart articulates a vision of the **Church** as the visible, historical embodiment of the **Kingdom of God**, insisting that the Church is not merely a spiritual reality but a public, political community. He challenges sharp distinctions between **Church** and **Kingdom**, arguing that the Church is the first fruits and primary agent of God's reign, tasked with manifesting **eschatological renewal** in the world. Leithart’s approach is deeply shaped by a **sacramental** and **ecclesiocentric** reading of Scripture.

- "The Church is not a club for religious people, but the new polis, the city of God on earth." (The Kingdom and the Power)

## Key Works

- The Kingdom and the Power: Rediscovering the Centrality of the Church (1993)
- Against Christianity (2003)
- The End of Protestantism: Pursuing Unity in a Fragmented Church (2016)
- Delivered from the Elements of the World (2016)
- "Church, Kingdom, and History" (essay in The Oxford Handbook of Ecclesiology, 2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as the Embodiment of the Kingdom**
    - The Church is the historical and visible manifestation of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - Rejects dualistic separations between spiritual and political realities.
    - The Church’s communal life is itself a sign and foretaste of **eschatological fulfillment**.
    - The mission of the Church is to enact God’s reign in every sphere of life.
    - "The Church is the beachhead of the kingdom, the place where God’s future is already present." (The Kingdom and the Power)

2. **Sacramental Ecclesiology**
    - The Church’s sacraments are means by which the **Kingdom** is enacted and embodied.
    - Baptism and Eucharist are public, political acts that shape a new humanity.
    - The Church’s liturgy forms its members for **kingdom citizenship**.
    - Sacramental life is inseparable from the Church’s public witness.
    - "The sacraments are not mere symbols but the very instruments by which God builds his city." (Against Christianity)

3. **Political and Public Nature of the Church**
    - The Church is a **polis**, a public society with its own order and practices.
    - Christian worship is inherently political, challenging the world’s powers.
    - The Church’s allegiance to Christ relativizes all earthly loyalties.
    - The Church is called to model an alternative social order.
    - "The Church is a political body, a city set on a hill, not a private club." (The Kingdom and the Power)

4. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The Church lives between the ages, embodying the **already/not yet** of the Kingdom.
    - The Church’s life anticipates and participates in the final renewal of creation.
    - Eschatology shapes the Church’s mission and hope.
    - The Church’s failures and divisions are judged in light of the coming Kingdom.
    - "The Church is called to be what she will be: the radiant bride of Christ." (The End of Protestantism)

5. **Unity and Catholicity**
    - The visible unity of the Church is essential to its witness to the **Kingdom**.
    - Denominationalism is a scandal that undermines the Church’s mission.
    - Pursuit of unity is not optional but intrinsic to the Church’s identity.
    - True catholicity is both global and local, embracing diversity within unity.
    - "The unity of the Church is not a goal but a gift to be received and enacted." (The End of Protestantism)

## Legacy and Impact

Leithart’s work has significantly influenced contemporary discussions of **ecclesiology** and the relationship between **Church** and **Kingdom** within Reformed and evangelical circles. His insistence on the public, sacramental, and political character of the Church challenges privatized and individualistic models of Christian life. Leithart’s vision has sparked renewed interest in the Church’s role as a visible, transformative community, and his critiques of denominationalism have fueled ongoing debates about Christian unity and catholicity.
