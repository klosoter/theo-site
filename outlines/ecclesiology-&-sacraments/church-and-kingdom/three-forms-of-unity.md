# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust Reformed understanding of the relationship between the **church** and the **kingdom of God**. These confessions emphasize the visible and invisible aspects of the church, the church’s role as the primary means by which God advances his kingdom, and the distinction between the church as an institution and the broader scope of God’s reign. The documents stress the church’s authority in preaching the **Word**, administering the **sacraments**, and exercising **discipline** as central to the manifestation of the kingdom on earth.

- "Outside of this holy congregation there is no salvation, since there is no remission of sins or any salvation apart from it." (Belgic Confession, Art. 28)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 27–29
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 54–56
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine V
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (various editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as the Assembly of the Elect**
    - The church is defined as the **community of true believers** gathered by Christ.
    - It is both **visible** (institutional, gathered) and **invisible** (spiritual, known to God).
    - The unity of the church is rooted in **faith in Christ** and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The church is distinguished from all other religious assemblies by its adherence to the **pure preaching of the gospel**, administration of the sacraments, and exercise of discipline.
    - "We believe and profess one catholic or universal Church, which is a holy congregation of true Christian believers." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

2. **The Kingdom of God as God’s Redemptive Reign**
    - The kingdom is the **sovereign rule of God** manifested in Christ and extended by the Spirit.
    - It is present wherever God’s will is done, but is especially visible in the church.
    - The kingdom is both **already** (present in Christ’s work) and **not yet** (awaiting consummation).
    - The church is the primary sphere where the kingdom is made manifest on earth.
    - "The Son of God gathers, defends, and preserves for Himself, by His Spirit and Word, in the unity of the true faith, a church chosen to everlasting life." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 54)

3. **Means of Grace as Kingdom Instruments**
    - The **preaching of the Word** is the chief means by which the kingdom is advanced.
    - The **sacraments** (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) are visible signs and seals of the kingdom’s promises.
    - **Church discipline** maintains the purity and witness of the church as the kingdom community.
    - The Spirit works through these means to gather and preserve the people of God.
    - "The marks by which the true Church is known are these: if the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if she maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised." (Belgic Confession, Art. 29)

4. **Distinction and Relationship Between Church and Kingdom**
    - The church is not identical with the kingdom, but is its primary earthly manifestation.
    - The kingdom extends beyond the institutional church to all of God’s sovereign rule.
    - The church’s mission is to bear witness to the kingdom and serve as its embassy.
    - The fullness of the kingdom will only be realized at Christ’s return.
    - "The kingdom of heaven is opened to believers by the preaching of the holy gospel and shut against unbelievers by the same." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 84)

5. **Necessity of Church Membership and Participation**
    - Believers are commanded to join and remain in the visible church.
    - Separation from the church is equated with separation from Christ and his kingdom.
    - The church is the context for spiritual growth, mutual accountability, and participation in the kingdom.
    - The unity and peace of the church are essential for the advance of the kingdom.
    - "No person ought to withdraw from the church, content to be by himself, regardless of his status or condition." (Belgic Confession, Art. 28)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology and the doctrine of the **kingdom of God** in the continental tradition. Their careful articulation of the relationship between church and kingdom has influenced subsequent confessional standards and continues to guide Reformed churches worldwide. By emphasizing the church as the primary means of the kingdom’s advance, these confessions have fostered a high view of the church’s role in God’s redemptive plan, while maintaining the distinction between the visible church and the fullness of God’s eschatological reign.
