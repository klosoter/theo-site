# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust distinction between the **visible church** and the **invisible church**, grounding his ecclesiology in the Reformed tradition. He maintained that the **kingdom of God** is both broader and more spiritual than the institutional church, yet the church remains the principal means by which the kingdom is manifested and advanced in the world.

- "The church is the kingdom of Christ, but the kingdom is not so restricted to the church as not to extend itself further." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, XVIII.1.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 3, Topics XVIII–XX)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on ecclesiology
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Visible and Invisible Church**
    - The **visible church** consists of all who profess faith and their children, marked by the preaching of the Word and administration of the sacraments.
    - The **invisible church** is the company of the elect, known only to God.
    - This distinction safeguards the church’s spiritual integrity while acknowledging human imperfection.
    - The visible church is the historical manifestation; the invisible church is the eschatological reality.
    - "The visible church is the assembly of those who profess the true religion, but the invisible church is the company of the elect." (Institutes, XVIII.3.2)

2. **The Kingdom of God Is Broader Than the Church**
    - The **kingdom of God** encompasses all of Christ’s rule, not limited to the institutional church.
    - The church is the primary but not exclusive sphere of the kingdom’s manifestation.
    - The kingdom includes both the internal reign in believers’ hearts and the external administration through the church.
    - Civil society and the world are also under Christ’s sovereign rule, though in a different manner.
    - "The kingdom of Christ is not so restricted to the church as not to extend itself further." (Institutes, XVIII.1.7)

3. **Means of Grace and the Advancement of the Kingdom**
    - The church is entrusted with the **means of grace**: Word, sacraments, and discipline.
    - These means are the ordinary instruments for gathering and perfecting the saints.
    - The kingdom grows primarily through the faithful administration of these means.
    - The church’s ministry is essential for the visible advance of Christ’s kingdom.
    - "The church is the kingdom of Christ, as to its external administration." (Institutes, XVIII.1.7)

4. **Christ’s Mediatorial Kingship**
    - Christ rules as **mediatorial king** over both church and world.
    - His kingship is exercised in a special, redemptive sense within the church.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial and derived, not magisterial or autonomous.
    - Christ’s rule is spiritual, not political, in the church.
    - "Christ is king of the church in a special and spiritual sense." (Institutes, XVIII.1.8)

5. **Church and Kingdom Distinguished from Civil Government**
    - The **church** and **civil government** are distinct but both under God’s sovereignty.
    - The church’s power is spiritual; the magistrate’s is civil and temporal.
    - The two spheres should not be confused or conflated.
    - The church does not wield the sword; its authority is ministerial and declarative.
    - "The church is a spiritual kingdom, distinct from the civil government." (Institutes, XVIII.1.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions between the **church** and the **kingdom of God** became foundational for later Reformed ecclesiology, influencing both continental and Anglo-American traditions. His articulation of the visible/invisible church distinction and the spiritual nature of Christ’s kingship shaped confessional standards and theological education. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the church as the primary, but not exclusive, locus of the kingdom’s advance.
