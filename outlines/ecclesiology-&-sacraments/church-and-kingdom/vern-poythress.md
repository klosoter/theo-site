# Vern Poythress (1946–)

Vern Poythress approaches the relationship between **church** and **kingdom** through a robustly **biblical-theological** and **multiperspectival** lens, emphasizing the unity of God's redemptive purposes across history. He sees the **kingdom of God** as both present and future, manifested in the life of the **church** as it participates in Christ’s reign and mission. Poythress stresses the inseparability of the church’s identity from its calling to bear witness to the kingdom in all spheres of life.

    - Argues that no single perspective exhausts the biblical teaching on this topic.
    - Integrates **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives in ecclesiology.

    - Defines the **kingdom of God** as the dynamic reign of Christ over all creation.
    - Emphasizes both the **already** and **not yet** aspects of the kingdom.
    - The church is the primary sphere where Christ’s reign is acknowledged and embodied.
    - The kingdom extends beyond the church but is most clearly seen within it.
    - "The kingdom is God’s reign, and the church is the people who submit to that reign." (The Lordship of Christ)

3. **Church as the Community of the Kingdom**
    - The church is the visible community where the values and authority of the kingdom are displayed.
    - Stresses the church’s role in manifesting **redemptive-historical** realities.
    - The church is both a sign and instrument of the kingdom’s presence.
    - Participation in the church is participation in the mission of the kingdom.
    - "The church is the community in which the reign of Christ is manifested most clearly in the present age." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

    - Calls for Christians to serve Christ in every sphere—family, work, culture.
    - The church equips believers to live out the kingdom in the world.
    - All of life is to be brought under the **lordship of Christ**.

    - "The church and the kingdom are united in God’s redemptive plan, unfolding through history." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectival** and **biblical-theological** approach has influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on the relationship between church and kingdom. His work encourages theologians and pastors to see the church as both distinct from and integrally related to the kingdom of God. By emphasizing Christ’s lordship over all of life, Poythress has helped shape a holistic vision for Christian discipleship and mission. His contributions continue to foster a robust, Christ-centered ecclesiology within evangelical and Reformed circles.
