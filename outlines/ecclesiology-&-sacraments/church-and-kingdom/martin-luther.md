# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther distinguished sharply between the **visible church** and the **invisible church**, emphasizing that the true church is constituted by faith in Christ rather than external institutions. He viewed the **kingdom of God** as fundamentally spiritual, present wherever the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered, and he critiqued the confusion of **temporal authority** with the spiritual reign of Christ.

- "The church is not wood and stone, but the company of believing people." ("On the Councils and the Church")

## Key Works

- "On the Councils and the Church" (1539)
- "Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed" (1523)
- "The Babylonian Captivity of the Church" (1520)
- "Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation" (1520)
- "The Freedom of a Christian" (1520)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between the Two Kingdoms**
   - Luther taught a clear distinction between the **kingdom of the left (civil government)** and the **kingdom of the right (spiritual rule of Christ)**.
   - The church operates under the spiritual kingdom, while secular rulers govern the temporal realm.
   - Mixing these kingdoms leads to corruption and confusion of the gospel.
   - Each kingdom has its own God-ordained means and responsibilities.
   - "God has ordained two governments: the spiritual, by which the Holy Spirit produces Christians and righteous people under Christ, and the secular, which restrains the unchristian and wicked." ("Temporal Authority")

2. **Primacy of the Word and Sacraments**
   - The true church is present where the **Word of God is preached** and the **sacraments are rightly administered**.
   - External forms and hierarchy do not guarantee the presence of the kingdom.
   - The kingdom of God is not identified with any particular institution or visible structure.
   - Faith, not outward membership, marks participation in the kingdom.
   - "Wherever you hear or see this word preached, believed, professed, and lived, do not doubt that the true ecclesia sancta catholica, a 'holy Christian people,' must be there." ("On the Councils and the Church")

3. **Invisible and Visible Church**
   - The **invisible church** consists of all true believers known only to God.
   - The **visible church** includes both believers and hypocrites.
   - The visible church is necessary for the proclamation of the gospel but is not identical with the kingdom of God.
   - The marks of the church are the preaching of the Word and the administration of the sacraments.
   - "The true church is hidden, the saints are known only to God." ("On the Councils and the Church")

4. **Critique of Papal and Ecclesiastical Authority**
   - Luther rejected the identification of the **kingdom of God** with the papal hierarchy.
   - He argued that church power is ministerial, not magisterial.
   - The gospel liberates believers from bondage to human ordinances.
   - The church’s authority is derived from Christ and exercised through the Word.
   - "The church does not make the Word of God, but is made by the Word." ("The Babylonian Captivity of the Church")

5. **Christian Freedom and Vocation in the World**
   - Christians are free in conscience under the gospel but called to serve their neighbors in the world.
   - The doctrine of **vocation** affirms the value of ordinary life within the temporal kingdom.
   - The kingdom of God is advanced through faith and love, not political power.
   - Believers live as citizens of both kingdoms, fulfilling their duties in each.
   - "A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none; a Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all." ("The Freedom of a Christian")

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s distinction between the **two kingdoms** profoundly shaped Protestant ecclesiology and political theology, influencing later Reformed and Lutheran traditions. His emphasis on the **Word and sacraments** as the marks of the true church redirected focus from institutional authority to the means of grace. Luther’s theology of the church and kingdom continues to inform debates on the relationship between church and state, the nature of Christian community, and the limits of ecclesiastical power.
