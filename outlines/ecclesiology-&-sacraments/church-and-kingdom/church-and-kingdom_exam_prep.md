### TITLE
Embassy and Reign: Clarifying the Relation of Church and Kingdom in an Inaugurated Age

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How the **kingdom of God** as Christ’s royal reign relates to the **church** as his visible community, without collapse into identity or separation into dualism.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Abraham Kuyper, Geerhardus Vos, Herman Ridderbos.
- Traditions: Patristic Augustinian theology, Magisterial Reformation Lutheran and Reformed, Neo-Calvinism, Reformed biblical theology; Roman Catholic and Anabaptist alternatives as external interlocutors.
- Debates:
  - Internal: **two kingdoms** versus **sphere sovereignty**, church-as-institute versus organism, **visible and invisible church**, marks and mission, priority of **means of grace** relative to cultural engagement.
  - External: Roman Catholic Church-as-sacrament-of-the-kingdom, Anabaptist church-as-kingdom ethic, liberal social gospel equating kingdom with moral progress.
  - Contemporary: missional church strategies, integralism and Christian nationalism, radical two kingdoms, public justice under pluralism.
- Position: The church is the embassy and primary institutional manifestation of Christ’s **kingdom** in this age through Word, sacrament, and discipline, while the **kingdom** as the redemptive reign of the risen Lord is broader in scope than the church and advances providentially in culture and politics without ecclesial capture or political identification.

### ESSAY
Church and kingdom are often conflated, opposed, or blurred into slogans. Conceptual clarity starts by defining the **kingdom of God** as the royal authority of the triune God vested in the Messiah, publicly revealed in the resurrection and ascension of Jesus, and operative now by the Spirit in an **already–not yet** form. The church is the community gathered and ruled by this reign, marked by the **means of grace** and the **keys of the kingdom**, bound to Christ by **covenant**, and appointed as the embassy of his dominion among the nations. The task is to articulate how the reign and the community interrelate such that neither collapses into the other. If we equate kingdom with church, we risk ecclesial self-importance and political quietism. If we equate kingdom with ethical progress or culture, we risk ecclesial marginalization and doctrinal dilution. If we sever them, we deny that the gospel creates an ordered people under a king. The thesis defended here is that the church is the primary institutional form of the kingdom in this age, yet the kingdom as Christ’s rule extends wider than the church through **divine providence** and **common grace**, and will culminate only at the consummation. The church is thus the embassy of a greater reign, not its totality.

Augustine supplies the decisive patristic grammar. Writing after Rome’s sack, he reframed Christian public identity in The City of God by distinguishing two cities formed by two loves: the earthly city by love of self to the contempt of God, the city of God by love of God to the contempt of self. This is not a map of two visible institutions but an eschatological anthropology that cuts through every social order, including the mixed body of the church until the last day. Augustine’s church is pilgrim and penitent, a corpus permixtum based on **covenant** sign and reality, moving toward a heavenly polity that dawns in history yet is not contained by any empire. The kingdom is not a Christianized Rome. Nor is it a hidden interiority detached from public life; the citizens of the city of God seek the earthly peace for the sake of the heavenly peace, using temporal goods with ordered love. Augustine thus breaks the identity of church and political order while recognizing the good of civil authority under **divine providence**. He treats sacraments as signs sealing citizens and anticipations of the heavenly city’s order. This Augustinian posture underwrites the claim that the church is an embassy among the nations, not their sovereign, and that Christ’s reign is real yet not identical with any regime. Examiners may press whether Augustine’s two cities sanction quietism. The answer is no. Ordered love mandates active pursuit of temporal peace, justice, and neighbor-love as penultimate goods, while refusing to crown them as the kingdom’s fullness.

Luther sharpened the distinction between gospel and law into a doctrine of **two kingdoms** that has often been caricatured. God exercises a twofold rule: by the gospel he justifies and sanctifies, creating a people who live by mercy; by the law he preserves external order through vocations, authorities, and the sword. Luther’s aim was to secure the liberating primacy of justification and to protect conscience from political and ecclesial tyranny. Coram Deo the believer is righteous by faith; coram mundo we serve neighbor through creaturely offices. When it is said that the kingdom is God’s rule, Luther guards its evangelical character by refusing to identify it with coercive power. He will not grant the church the sword, nor render the magistrate preacher of the gospel. The doctrine risks antinomian fracture or passivity if abstracted from Christ’s Lordship, and history has seen such abuse. But properly read, Luther grounds active vocation in Christ’s royal will over all spheres, without sacralizing any. This theological grammar prevents the church from swelling into empire while legitimizing civil work as Christian service under Christ, a crucial anchor for the later Reformed.

Calvin reconfigures Luther’s distinction into a constructive architecture for church and polity under Christ’s universal kingship. He speaks of a **twofold government** by which God rules man: the spiritual government concerns the life of the soul and the eternal kingdom; the civil government concerns external polity and human relations. This is not two lords but one Christ who reigns by different modes, the spiritual by Word and Spirit, the civil by prudence and law. The **kingdom of Christ** is predominantly spiritual in the present age, not because it is unreal, but because its power is exercised through the **means of grace** that bring sinners into union with the king. Calvin’s high ecclesiology is the hinge. The church is the mother of believers, visible and invisible in distinction but not in separation. The visible church is recognized by the pure preaching of the gospel, right administration of the sacraments, and faithful discipline. These are not optional adornments but the public exercise of the **keys of the kingdom**. The church, under this definition, is the divinely authorized embassy of Christ’s reign. It bears the message that transfers people from darkness to light, binds and looses, provides foretaste of the new creation in ordered worship, and forms a people whose life anticipates eschatological righteousness.

Calvin’s social theology must be understood through this ecclesial heart. He assigns the magistrate a ministry of justice, calling rulers nursing fathers who protect the church’s ministry and the quiet of common life. He rejects Erastian capture of the church, defending a distinct ecclesial jurisdiction. On the other side, he rejects Anabaptist collapse of church and kingdom into a sectarian ethic that abandons civil office. The unity is Christ’s **Lordship of Christ** over both governments, the distinction is of media and ends. Examiners will ask whether this is simply a Lutheran two kingdoms dressed in Reformed robes or a covert theocracy. It is neither. Calvin differs from Luther by locating ecclesial authority in a disciplined polity with spiritual jurisdiction, not merely in preaching. He differs from theocrats by refusing to grant the church coercive power or to identify the **kingdom** with civil law. The kingship of Christ is exercised by spiritual means to spiritual ends in the church, and by providential means to civil ends in society. The church is thus the royal embassy, not the civil sovereign.

Abraham Kuyper retrieves and extends this tradition under modern conditions. As a theologian, journalist, and statesman in the Netherlands, he articulated **sphere sovereignty**, a principled pluralism in which distinct societal spheres such as family, church, state, commerce, science, and art exist under Christ’s kingship with their own God-given norms. Kuyper’s signature line that there is not a square inch over which Christ does not cry mine translates the classic confession of Christ’s universal reign into a modern doctrine of structural differentiation. He also distinguishes church as institute and church as organism. As institute, the church gathers for Word, sacrament, and discipline. As organism, the church disperses into vocations, saturating culture with the life of Christ. Coupled with **common grace**, this yields a robust account of Christian cultural labor that refuses both the sacred-secular split and ecclesiastical domination of society. Kuyper’s doctrine avoids collapsing the **kingdom** into ecclesial form by recognizing Christ’s reign over every sphere, while still giving the instituted church primacy as the appointed steward of the gospel that renews persons and norms. The risk is triumphalism, where the organism swallows the institute and mission drifts into activism. Kuyper himself guarded against this by keeping the marks of the true church and stressing the antithesis between belief and unbelief even amid common grace. The corrective needed today is to reaffirm that the church-as-institute possesses the **keys of the kingdom** uniquely, and that cultural service, however valuable, is derivative as an effect of discipleship, not a definition of the kingdom’s essence.

Geerhardus Vos supplies the eschatological lens that integrates these trajectories. In The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom and the Church, Vos argued that the kingdom is primarily God’s saving action and reign breaking into history in the person of Christ, not a geographic domain nor a mere ethic. The **already–not yet** frame is decisive. The decisive victory has been won in Christ’s death and resurrection; the consummation awaits his return. The church is the community gathered into this reign, the provisional historical form in which the powers of the age to come are tasted. Mystical union with Christ and the gift of the Spirit constitute the church as the fellowship of the kingdom, and Word and sacrament are the king’s instruments for extending his rule. Vos’s conceptual contribution safeguards complexity. Because the kingdom is God’s active reign, it can encompass both ecclesial and non-ecclesial effects of Christ’s lordship. Because it is eschatological and not yet consummated, the church is not the kingdom in its fullness. Because it is already present, the church is neither a waiting room nor a voluntary association, but the locus of eschatological power. To an examiner’s question about the Lord’s Prayer, your kingdom come, Vos’s answer would be that we plead for the intensification and extension of God’s royal saving presence through the church’s ministry to the nations, the sanctification of believers, the restraint of evil, and the final appearing of the King.

Herman Ridderbos, building on Vos, pressed the New Testament exegesis in The Coming of the Kingdom. For Ridderbos the kingdom is basileia, the royal position and action of God, revealed in Jesus’ person and deeds. It is not a place that the church can occupy, nor a task the church can complete. It is fundamentally the rule of God, inaugurated in Christ’s first coming with cosmic scope, encompassing exorcism, forgiveness, and the subjection of powers. The church proclaims and serves this reign; it does not generate it. Ridderbos clarifies how Paul’s corporate and eschatological categories place the church as first fruits of the new creation. This matters for our thesis because it rescues mission from managerial illusions. The church’s task is to herald, baptize, teach, discipline, and care for the saints, practices by which the kingdom’s power is made present and effective as God’s work, not ours. The social-ethical implications are thick, but they do not replace the king’s means with human programs. Ridderbos thereby corrects both the social gospel, which equates the kingdom with moral advance, and quietist ecclesiologies that reduce it to inward piety.

With these figures in hand, the internal debates within the Reformed family can be set in order. First, the **two kingdoms** debate. A Calvinian twofold government, properly read, affirms that Christ is one king who rules all; it specifies distinct media and ends in church and civil life. Radical two kingdoms advocates sometimes press this into a near quarantine of the church from public ethics and political discourse. Kuyperians sometimes press the unity of lordship into ecclesial overreach or the collapse of ministerial specificity. The mediating, and I would argue confessional, position is that ministers must not bind consciences beyond Scripture in prudential political specifics, and the church must not usurp the magistrate’s calling; yet the church must teach the whole counsel of God, including his moral law, and equip saints for public vocation under the **Lordship of Christ**. Second, institute versus organism. To say the church is the kingdom’s primary institutional form is to assign primacy to the institute. The organism is real and precious but derivative. If the organism defines the church, the **means of grace** lose their centrality. If the institute denies the organism, the priesthood of all believers is betrayed. Third, visible and invisible. The **visible and invisible church** distinction defends the mixed character of the present church and prevents utopian equations of kingdom with any visible fellowship. Yet it should not be permitted to sever sacramental and disciplinary form from spiritual reality. The invisible is the church as it is before God; the visible is the same church as it is on pilgrimage under Word and sacrament. The kingdom is present in both aspects through the king’s governance.

External debates sharpen the picture. Roman Catholic theology, particularly Vatican II’s Lumen Gentium, calls the church the universal sacrament of salvation and describes it as seed and beginning of the kingdom. Properly received, this reminds Protestants that the church has objective visibility and instrumentality. Yet the tight sacramental identification in some Catholic theologies can tend to compress the kingdom into the church’s hierarchical and sacramental system. The Reformed reply is not to deny sacramental ontology but to insist that the kingdom is God’s reign and action, which cannot be circumscribed by ecclesial structure, even as it is normatively mediated to the world through **Word and sacrament**. Anabaptist and neo-Anabaptist strands, represented paradigmatically by Yoder, treat the church’s peaceable political ethic as the kingdom’s presence. This dignifies discipleship and witness but often collapses the kingdom into ecclesial ethics, refusing the use of civil authority and reading the Sermon on the Mount as a direct civil charter. The Reformed insist on the spirituality of the church as an institution alongside the legitimacy of civil vocation and coercive authority under **divine providence** and natural law. Liberal Protestant social gospel traditions equate the kingdom with moral progress, democracy, or social improvement. This misidentifies the king and the power by which his reign advances. The Reformed correction is that the kingdom comes by the Spirit through the gospel, sanctifying the people of God and yielding social fruits; social improvement can be an effect, never the essence.

Contemporary debates intensify older questions. The missional church movement rightly insists that the church exists for the sake of God’s mission. But its tendency to define mission in expansive cultural or political terms often subordinates the **keys of the kingdom** to strategy. The corrective is to define mission in terms of the Great Commission, itself a kingdom text in which the risen Christ declares all authority and commands baptizing and teaching. The church’s mission is nothing less and nothing more. Christian nationalism and integralism, in different ways, promise a reidentified Christendom by aligning church and civil power. They are right to warn against secular neutrality and to name the public character of religion. They are wrong to identify any regime with the kingdom or to grant the church coercive authority. A classic Augustinian and Calvinian posture provides a better path: civil order should pursue justice under God, and the church should publicly witness to the moral law and the gospel, but the sword remains the state’s and the **keys** remain the church’s. Radical two kingdoms positions that counsel ecclesial silence about public morality misread the ministerial office. Ministers must refrain from partisan directives and prudential specifics, but they must declare God’s whole counsel, including creation ordinances and the demands of neighbor-love, because Christ is king. In pluralist democracy, the church will be a disciplined minority. That intensifies, not reduces, the need for a thick ecclesial life ordered by the king, and for lay vocation animated by the **Lordship of Christ** in all spheres.

Objections must be handled crisply. Is not the kingdom identical with the church, since the keys are keys of the kingdom and the church binds and looses? The keys belong to the church because the church is entrusted with the king’s embassy, but the kingdom is larger than the embassy. Providence, preservation, and even judgments outside the church are acts of the same king. The identification fails because the New Testament speaks of the kingdom as God’s action and regime, which creates, orders, and will finally judge the church. Is not the kingdom broader than the church because it embraces culture, and therefore the church should take a back seat to cultural renewal? The kingdom is broader in scope, but not in authority. The church remains the unique steward of the gospel and sacraments. Cultural renewal without ecclesial vitality is borrowed capital that soon runs dry. Does the twofold government divide Christ? No, it specifies the modes and ends of the one king’s rule. The split would occur only if we assigned a distinct lord to each sphere or denied moral relevance across the distinction. Does this view encourage passivity? It cannot, if one understands vocation. Every baptized believer is summoned into public love of neighbor. The church equips saints for this work by catechesis, not by issuing technical policy. How does this square with the prayer your kingdom come? It means praying for conversions through the church’s ministry, for sanctification and discipline within the church, for justice and peace in society under Christ’s providence, and for the final appearing of the king.

Two final integrations must be made with adjacent loci. First, **covenant**. The kingdom in history advances by the administration of the **covenant of grace**. The church is the covenant community under the new covenant, with elders and deacons ordered by the king’s covenant law. The sacraments are covenantal signs and seals that not only mark individuals but constitute the people as an ordered society under the king. The relation of church and kingdom cannot be understood apart from federal realities. Second, eschatology and sacramental theology. The church’s worship is an ascent into the heavenlies where Christ reigns. In the Lord’s Supper, the king hosts his people in an anticipatory banquet of the coming kingdom. In baptism, he grants citizenship and arms his people for warfare against the powers. These practices are not simply emblematic; they are the king’s exercises of power in his embassy. This is why reducing mission to social activity or reducing church to service provider guts the kingdom’s presence in the world. The church’s discipline, furthermore, is not an archaic relic. It is the royal court’s local enactment of the keys, declaring who bears the king’s name in truth. Without discipline, the embassy’s seal is counterfeited and the kingdom’s presence is obscured.

The defended position therefore binds together Augustine’s eschatological two cities, Luther’s evangelical **two kingdoms**, Calvin’s twofold government and high ecclesiology, Kuyper’s **sphere sovereignty** and common grace under Christ’s universal reign, Vos’s **already–not yet** kingdom, and Ridderbos’s biblical exegesis of the king’s saving action. The church is not the kingdom’s totality but is its primary institutional manifestation; the kingdom is not mere culture but Christ’s redemptive reign; culture is not irrelevant but is subordinated to the king’s mission through the vocations of the saints. When examiners push on hard cases, such as whether a church should speak against unjust law, the answer follows our architecture. The church must teach God’s moral law and may speak to the moral character of laws as such, but it must not dictate specific legislative tactics. When asked whether Christians should seek political office, the answer is yes, as vocation under the king’s providence, without baptizing parties or regimes as the kingdom. When asked whether mercy ministries belong to the church’s essence, the answer is that diaconal care for the household of faith is an essential exercise of the king’s care, with overflow to neighbors as capacity allows, while broader social programs may be pursued by Christians in their vocations.

The church and the kingdom meet supremely in the preaching of Christ crucified and risen. There the king exercises his scepter, liberating captives and binding the strong man. There the community is constituted and reconstituted. There the future intrudes upon the present. The embassy gathers around this Word and Table, where citizens are formed into a public that lives in anticipation of the consummation. The reign exceeds the embassy, running through creation by **divine providence** and **common grace**, restraining evil and establishing penultimate orders. But the embassy is where the king’s name is declared, his treaty is offered, and his people are disciplined into a foretaste of the city to come. To confuse church and kingdom is to politicize the gospel or to ecclesiasticize politics. To divide them is to deny the king. The Reformed answer is to confess the one Christ ruling in distinct modes to distinct ends, to honor the church as the royal embassy in an age between the times, and to send the saints into the world under the **Lordship of Christ**, until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.
