# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the relationship between **Church** and **Kingdom of God** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He argued that the **Kingdom** is not a future, apocalyptic realm or an institutional reality, but an existential event realized in the proclamation of the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with faith within the Church community.

- "The Kingdom of God is not a spatial or temporal reality but the reign of God which is present in the word of proclamation." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Jesus and the Word (1926)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Kingdom**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is not a literal, future event but a symbol for God's existential claim on the individual.
    - Apocalyptic language in the New Testament must be interpreted existentially, not cosmologically.
    - The Church's proclamation transforms myth into existential decision.
    - The Kingdom is realized wherever faith is awakened by the kerygma.
    - "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the decision of faith." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter in the Church**
    - The Church is the community where individuals encounter the call of God through proclamation.
    - Faith is not assent to doctrine but an existential response to God's Word.
    - The Church's role is to facilitate authentic existence, not to mediate salvation institutionally.
    - The Church is not identical with the Kingdom but is its provisional sign.
    - "The Church is the place where the Word is proclaimed and heard." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Kerygma as the Presence of the Kingdom**
    - The **kerygma** is the decisive event in which the Kingdom becomes present.
    - The Kingdom is not a static possession but a dynamic event in proclamation.
    - The Church's mission is to proclaim, not to establish, the Kingdom.
    - The Kingdom is realized in the existential response to the kerygma.
    - "The Kingdom of God comes where the kerygma is believed." (Jesus and the Word)

4. **Rejection of Institutional Identification**
    - The Church must not equate itself with the Kingdom of God.
    - Institutional forms are secondary to the existential reality of faith.
    - The Kingdom transcends all historical and ecclesiastical boundaries.
    - The Church is always provisional, pointing beyond itself to the eschatological event.
    - "The Kingdom of God cannot be identified with any institution or movement." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Eschatology as Existential Decision**
    - Eschatology is not about future events but about present decision and authentic existence.
    - The Kingdom is realized in the individual's acceptance of God's claim in the present.
    - The Church's eschatological significance lies in its call to decision, not in its structure.
    - The future aspect of the Kingdom is a metaphor for the ongoing demand of faith.
    - "Eschatology is the call to decision here and now." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential interpretation of the **Kingdom of God** and the Church profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship and Protestant theology. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional views of eschatology and ecclesiology, prompting ongoing debates about the nature of faith, proclamation, and the Church's mission. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the Church and the Kingdom in modern theology.
