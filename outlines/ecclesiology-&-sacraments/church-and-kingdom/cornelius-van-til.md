# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s understanding of **Church and Kingdom** is rooted in his commitment to the absolute sovereignty of God and the antithesis between the **covenant community** and the world. He saw the **Church** as the visible manifestation of the **Kingdom of God** in history, tasked with proclaiming the lordship of Christ over all spheres of life and standing in opposition to all forms of autonomous thought.

- "The church is the army of the Lord, called to maintain the claims of Christ over every sphere of human life." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antithesis between Church and World**
    - The Church embodies the **covenant people** set apart from the world by God’s sovereign grace.
    - There is a fundamental opposition between the **Kingdom of God** and the kingdom of man.
    - The Church’s identity is defined by its allegiance to Christ, not by cultural accommodation.
    - The antithesis is epistemological, ethical, and spiritual, shaping all of life.
    - "There is no neutral ground between the church and the world." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Church as the Visible Manifestation of the Kingdom**
    - The Church is the historical and visible community through which the **Kingdom of God** is made known.
    - The Church’s worship, discipline, and proclamation are means by which Christ’s reign is displayed.
    - The Church is both a sign and instrument of the coming fullness of the Kingdom.
    - The Church’s mission is inseparable from the advance of the Kingdom in the world.
    - "The church is the visible representation of the kingdom of Christ in the world." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Christ’s Lordship over All of Life**
    - Christ’s kingship extends beyond the Church to every sphere of creation.
    - The Church is called to witness to Christ’s authority in culture, science, politics, and education.
    - There is no sacred-secular divide; all of life is under the lordship of Christ.
    - The Kingdom’s claims are comprehensive and totalizing, challenging all rival authorities.
    - "There is not one square inch of creation over which Christ does not say, 'Mine!'" (paraphrased from The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Covenantal Structure of the Kingdom**
    - The Church is constituted by the **covenant of grace** and lives out its implications corporately.
    - The Kingdom is realized through God’s covenantal dealings with his people in history.
    - The Church’s sacraments, preaching, and discipline are covenantal acts.
    - The unity of the Church and Kingdom is grounded in the covenantal promises of God.
    - "The church is the covenant community, called to manifest the kingdom in every area of life." (Essays on Christian Education)

5. **Apologetic Task of the Church**
    - The Church defends the truth of the **Kingdom of God** against all forms of unbelief.
    - Apologetics is not a neutral enterprise but a covenantal confrontation.
    - The Church’s witness is both proclamation and defense of the exclusive claims of Christ.
    - The apologetic task is essential to the Church’s identity as the people of the Kingdom.
    - "The church must always be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in her, as the representative of the kingdom." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **antithesis** between Church and world has profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology and apologetics, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the comprehensive lordship of Christ and the covenantal nature of the Church continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **Church and Kingdom**. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the Church’s distinct identity and mission in a pluralistic world.
