# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the relationship between the **church** and the **kingdom of God** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity of God's redemptive rule and the institutional and organic dimensions of the church. He sees the **church** as both the primary manifestation of the **kingdom** in history and as a community called to bear witness to Christ’s lordship in all areas of life.

- "The church is the focal point of the kingdom in the present age, but the kingdom is broader than the church." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God
- Worship in Spirit and Truth

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Understanding of Church and Kingdom**
    - Applies the **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives to ecclesiology and kingdom theology.
    - Emphasizes that no single perspective exhausts the biblical teaching on church or kingdom.
    - Sees the church as the community where God's rule is normatively proclaimed, situationally embodied, and existentially experienced.
    - Argues that the kingdom is both present and future, with the church as its present focal point.
    - "We must see the church and kingdom from the perspectives of God's norms, the historical situation, and personal experience." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Church as the Primary Manifestation of the Kingdom**
    - The church is the visible, covenantal community where Christ’s kingship is most clearly seen.
    - The sacraments, preaching, and discipline are central means by which the kingdom is administered.
    - The church is entrusted with the keys of the kingdom, exercising authority in Christ’s name.
    - While the kingdom extends beyond the church, the church is its institutional center.
    - "The church is the kingdom in its institutional form." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Kingdom Extends Beyond the Church**
    - The kingdom encompasses all areas of life under Christ’s lordship, not just ecclesiastical structures.
    - Christians are called to serve Christ in family, vocation, and society as expressions of kingdom living.
    - The church equips believers for kingdom service in the world.
    - There is a distinction between the institutional church and the broader kingdom activity of God.
    - "The kingdom is God’s rule over all things, but the church is the people who acknowledge that rule." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Eschatological Tension: Already and Not Yet**
    - The kingdom is inaugurated but awaits consummation at Christ’s return.
    - The church lives in the tension of present participation and future hope.
    - This shapes the church’s mission, worship, and ethical life.
    - The church’s witness anticipates the fullness of the kingdom.
    - "The church is the community of the end times, living between the times." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Integration of Worship, Ethics, and Mission**
    - Worship is central to the church’s identity as the kingdom community.
    - Ethical obedience is a manifestation of kingdom life.
    - Mission flows from the church’s calling to extend the reign of Christ.
    - All aspects of church life are to be understood as participation in the kingdom.
    - "The church’s worship, ethics, and mission are all kingdom activities." (Worship in Spirit and Truth)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **church–kingdom relationship** has shaped contemporary Reformed ecclesiology, especially through his triperspectival method. His emphasis on the church as both institution and organism, and on the kingdom’s comprehensive scope, has influenced discussions on worship, mission, and Christian cultural engagement. Frame’s work continues to be a significant resource for those seeking a biblically integrated and theologically robust understanding of the church’s role in God’s redemptive plan.
