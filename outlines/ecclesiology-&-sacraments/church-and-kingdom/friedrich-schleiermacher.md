# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the relationship between **church** and **kingdom of God** by grounding both in the sphere of **religious experience** and the communal consciousness of **absolute dependence**. He viewed the church as the historical manifestation of the kingdom, emphasizing its role as a community shaped by the redemptive work of Christ and the ongoing presence of the Spirit, rather than as a divinely-instituted polity or visible institution.

- "The church is the fellowship of those who are conscious of being in a state of redemption through Christ." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- The Life of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Community of Redemption**
   - The church is constituted by the shared **consciousness of redemption** in Christ.
   - It is not primarily an external institution but a spiritual fellowship.
   - The church arises from the inner transformation of individuals.
   - Its unity is grounded in the common experience of **absolute dependence** on God.
   - "The church is the fellowship of those who are conscious of being in a state of redemption through Christ." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Kingdom of God as Ethical Ideal**
   - The **kingdom of God** is understood as the realization of divine will in human community.
   - It is an ethical and spiritual goal, not a political or institutional reality.
   - The kingdom is present wherever the spirit of Christ shapes human relationships.
   - The church serves as the provisional form of the kingdom in history.
   - "The kingdom of God is nothing other than the dominion of the pious spirit." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Historical Development of the Church**
   - The church develops organically within history, shaped by cultural and social contexts.
   - Its forms and practices are historically conditioned and subject to change.
   - The essence of the church remains its spiritual core, not its outward structures.
   - The church is always in process, never a static entity.
   - "The church is a product of the Spirit’s activity in history." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
   - True religion is rooted in the feeling of **absolute dependence** on God.
   - The church is the community where this experience is nurtured and expressed.
   - Doctrines and institutions are secondary to the lived experience of faith.
   - The church’s authority derives from its capacity to foster authentic religious life.
   - "Religion is to be found in the heart, not in external forms." (On Religion)

5. **Universal Scope of the Kingdom**
   - The **kingdom of God** transcends the boundaries of the visible church.
   - It includes all who participate in the spirit of Christ, regardless of formal affiliation.
   - The church is a means, not the end, in the realization of the kingdom.
   - The ultimate goal is the universal fellowship of humanity under God.
   - "The kingdom of God is the universal community of the redeemed." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **church and kingdom** profoundly influenced modern Protestant ecclesiology, shifting the focus from institutional structures to the inner life and communal experience of believers. His emphasis on the **kingdom of God** as an ethical and spiritual reality paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies. While criticized by some for downplaying the visible church, his thought remains foundational for discussions of the church’s nature, mission, and relationship to the world. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in contemporary debates over the spiritual versus institutional dimensions of Christian community.
