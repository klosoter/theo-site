# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the relationship between **church** and **kingdom** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **eschatology**, emphasizing the inaugurated-but-not-yet-consummated nature of the **kingdom of God**. He maintains that the **church** is the present, visible manifestation of the kingdom, participating in its blessings while awaiting its final consummation at Christ’s return.

- "The church is the new creation community, the people of the kingdom, but the kingdom itself is not yet fully here." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Kingdom of God" (in The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Church as the New Humanity" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Already/Not Yet**
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ’s resurrection but awaits consummation.
    - The church lives in the tension between present realization and future fulfillment.
    - Believers experience the firstfruits of the kingdom through the Spirit.
    - The church’s mission is shaped by this eschatological dynamic.
    - "The church is the community of the resurrection, living between the times." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Church as the Visible Manifestation of the Kingdom**
    - The church is the present, historical embodiment of the kingdom on earth.
    - Its life and worship are signs of the kingdom’s presence.
    - The church is not identical to the kingdom but is its primary visible expression.
    - The sacraments and Word mark the church as the locus of kingdom activity.
    - "The church is the earthly form of the heavenly kingdom." ("The Kingdom of God")

3. **Redemptive-Historical Orientation**
    - The church and kingdom are understood within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the decisive turning point in this history.
    - The Spirit’s outpouring marks the new age, linking church and kingdom.
    - The church’s existence is grounded in the once-for-all work of Christ.
    - "The church is the community constituted by the Spirit in the last days." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the basis for participation in the kingdom.
    - The church is united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - All kingdom blessings flow from this union.
    - The church’s identity and mission are inseparable from Christ’s person and work.
    - "To be in Christ is to be in the kingdom." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Mission and Witness**
    - The church’s mission is to bear witness to the kingdom’s reality and hope.
    - Evangelism and discipleship are kingdom activities entrusted to the church.
    - The church’s life is a foretaste of the coming consummation.
    - Social and cultural engagement are secondary to the church’s primary calling.
    - "The church’s witness is to the kingdom that is and is to come." ("The Kingdom of God")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **church–kingdom** relationship has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in emphasizing the **eschatological tension** of the Christian life. His redemptive-historical approach has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly at Westminster Theological Seminary. By rooting the church’s identity in union with Christ and the unfolding of redemptive history, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for understanding the church’s mission and hope within the broader narrative of Scripture.
