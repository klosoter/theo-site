# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the Church as a dynamic event grounded in the proclamation of the **Word of God**. He critiqued institutionalism, insisting that the true Church is constituted by **faith** and the living encounter with Christ, rather than by external structures or historical continuity.

- "The Church is where the Word is truly preached and the Sacraments rightly administered." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

## Key Works

- The Misunderstanding of the Church (1952)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 3: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (1962)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- The Mediator (1934)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Event, Not Institution**
   - The Church exists wherever the **Word of God** is proclaimed and received in faith.
   - Institutional forms are secondary and can obscure the Church’s true nature.
   - The Church is a spiritual fellowship, not an organization defined by hierarchy or tradition.
   - The essence of the Church is relational, rooted in the encounter between God and humanity.
   - "The Church is not an institution, but an event." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

2. **Unity Grounded in Christ Alone**
   - The **oneness** of the Church is found in its connection to Christ, not in visible uniformity.
   - Denominational divisions do not negate the spiritual unity of believers.
   - True unity is a gift of the Holy Spirit, not a human achievement.
   - The Church’s unity is eschatological, always imperfect in history.
   - "The unity of the Church is a unity of faith, not of organization." (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Holiness as Gift, Not Achievement**
   - The Church’s **holiness** is derived from Christ’s righteousness, not its own purity.
   - The Church remains sinful and dependent on grace.
   - Holiness is a calling, not a possession; the Church is always being sanctified.
   - The Church’s failures do not negate its status as holy in Christ.
   - "The Church is holy because it is the sphere of Christ’s redeeming work." (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Catholicity as Universality of Faith**
   - The **catholic** nature of the Church is spiritual and universal, not institutional.
   - The Church transcends all cultural, national, and denominational boundaries.
   - Catholicity is realized wherever the gospel is faithfully proclaimed.
   - The Church’s universality is grounded in the mission to all peoples.
   - "The Church is catholic because it is sent to all men." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

5. **Apostolicity as Fidelity to the Word**
   - The Church is **apostolic** when it remains faithful to the apostolic witness in Scripture.
   - Apostolic succession is understood as continuity in teaching, not office.
   - The Church’s authority is derived from the gospel, not from institutional lineage.
   - The apostolicity of the Church is dynamic, requiring ongoing reformation.
   - "Apostolicity means faithfulness to the apostolic message, not to an apostolic office." (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **Church** challenged both Protestant and Catholic assumptions by prioritizing the **Word of God** and the existential encounter with Christ over institutional continuity. His emphasis on the Church as event rather than institution influenced later ecclesiological debates, especially within the **ecumenical movement**. Brunner’s work remains significant for those seeking a dynamic, Christ-centered understanding of the Church’s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.
