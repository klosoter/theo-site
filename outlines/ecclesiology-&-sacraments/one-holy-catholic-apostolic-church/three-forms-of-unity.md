# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** within the Reformed tradition. They emphasize the **unity of the visible and invisible Church**, the **marks of the true Church**, and the necessity of **apostolic doctrine** for the Church’s holiness and catholicity. These confessions stress the Church’s spiritual unity in Christ, its sanctification by the Spirit, and its continuity with the apostolic foundation.

- "We believe and profess one catholic or universal Church, which is a holy congregation of true Christian believers, all expecting their salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed by His blood, sanctified and sealed by the Holy Ghost." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church in Christ**
   - The Church is one spiritual body, united to Christ as its head.
   - This unity transcends all human divisions, rooted in **faith and the Holy Spirit**.
   - The visible and invisible Church distinction preserves the reality of true unity.
   - Unity is maintained through the pure preaching of the gospel and administration of the sacraments.
   - "This holy Church is preserved or supported by God, against the rage of the whole world." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

2. **Holiness through Word and Spirit**
   - The Church is sanctified by the **Holy Spirit** and the Word of God.
   - Holiness is not perfection, but being set apart for God in Christ.
   - The means of grace—preaching, sacraments, and discipline—are central to the Church’s sanctification.
   - The Church’s holiness is both a gift and a calling for its members.
   - "I believe that I am and forever shall remain a living member of it." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 54)

3. **Catholicity as Universality**
   - The Church is not confined to one place, time, or people, but is spread throughout the world.
   - Catholicity is grounded in the unity of faith and the work of Christ across all ages.
   - The Church embraces all true believers, regardless of external distinctions.
   - The visible Church is recognized by the marks, but its catholicity is spiritual and global.
   - "This holy Church is not confined, bound, or limited to a certain place or to certain persons." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

4. **Apostolicity in Doctrine and Practice**
   - The Church is founded on the teaching of the **apostles** and prophets, with Christ as cornerstone.
   - Faithfulness to apostolic doctrine is essential for the Church’s identity.
   - The Church is called to preserve and transmit the apostolic faith through the ages.
   - Ministers are to preach only that which agrees with the apostolic Scriptures.
   - "The true Church is to be known by the pure preaching of the gospel." (Belgic Confession, Art. 29)

5. **Marks of the True Church**
   - The Three Forms identify three marks: pure preaching, right administration of sacraments, and faithful discipline.
   - These marks distinguish the true Church from false churches and sects.
   - The presence of these marks assures believers of the Church’s authenticity.
   - Members are called to join themselves to the true Church wherever it is found.
   - "It is the duty of all believers, according to the Word of God, to separate from those who do not belong to the Church." (Belgic Confession, Art. 28)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology, providing a confessional standard for the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church**. Their articulation of the Church’s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity has influenced Reformed churches globally and contributed to ecumenical dialogue. By grounding the Church’s identity in Christ, the Spirit, and the apostolic Word, these confessions continue to serve as a touchstone for Reformed identity and practice.
