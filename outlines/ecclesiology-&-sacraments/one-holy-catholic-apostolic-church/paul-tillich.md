# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **"one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church"** as a dynamic, existential reality rather than a static institution. He interpreted the **Church** as the manifestation of the **Spiritual Community** within history, emphasizing its symbolic and ambiguous nature as both a bearer of the **New Being** in Christ and a participant in human estrangement.

- "The Church is the actualization of the Spiritual Community under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as the Manifestation of the Spiritual Community**
    - The Church is not identical with the **Spiritual Community** but is its historical embodiment.
    - It mediates the **New Being** through word and sacrament.
    - The Church is always ambiguous, containing both divine and demonic elements.
    - Its unity is grounded in participation in the **Christ-reality**, not institutional uniformity.
    - "The Church is the community in which the New Being is manifest under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Holiness as Participation in the New Being**
    - Holiness is not moral perfection but participation in the **New Being** brought by Christ.
    - The Church is holy insofar as it points beyond itself to the ground of being.
    - Holiness is always threatened by the Church’s involvement in historical existence.
    - The Church’s holiness is a matter of faith, not empirical observation.
    - "The holiness of the Church is the holiness of the New Being, not of its empirical existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Catholicity as Universal Mission**
    - Catholicity refers to the Church’s universal relevance and mission, not merely geographical spread.
    - The Church transcends all particularities of culture, nation, and denomination.
    - Its catholicity is realized in the reconciliation of estranged humanity.
    - The universal mission is to actualize the **Kingdom of God** in history.
    - "The Church is catholic in so far as it is the bearer of the message of salvation to all men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Apostolicity as Continuity of Message**
    - Apostolicity is the continuity of the original **kerygma** (proclamation) of Christ.
    - The Church is apostolic when it remains rooted in the foundational event of Christ.
    - Apostolic succession is spiritual, not merely institutional or historical.
    - The authority of the Church derives from faithfulness to the apostolic message.
    - "Apostolicity means the Church is founded upon the event of Christ as witnessed by the apostles." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Unity as Existential Participation**
    - The unity of the Church is existential, not organizational.
    - Unity is grounded in the **Spirit** that transcends denominational boundaries.
    - The Church’s unity is a sign of the reconciliation offered in Christ.
    - Visible divisions reflect the ambiguity of existence, not the essence of the Church.
    - "The unity of the Church is the unity of the Spiritual Community actualized in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic interpretation of the **Church** has deeply influenced modern ecumenical theology and the understanding of ecclesial identity. By emphasizing the **Spiritual Community** and the ambiguous nature of the Church in history, he challenged both Protestant and Catholic conceptions of ecclesiology. His work continues to provoke discussion on the meaning of the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** in a pluralistic and secular age. Tillich’s legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue between theology, philosophy, and culture.
