# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a classic Reformed understanding of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church**, grounding these attributes in Christ’s headship, the purity of doctrine, and the faithful administration of the **Word and sacraments**. He distinguished sharply between the **visible** and **invisible Church**, and rejected Roman Catholic claims that unity, catholicity, and apostolicity are tied to institutional continuity with Rome.

- "The church is one, not in external communion of rites and ceremonies, but in the unity of faith and the Spirit." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Locus XVIII: The Church
- The Necessity and Perpetuity of the Christian Church
- Selected disputations and sermons on ecclesiology
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (for context on Turretin’s ecclesiology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church is Spiritual, Not Merely External**
    - The Church’s unity is rooted in **faith in Christ** and the **Holy Spirit**, not in uniformity of rites or hierarchical structures.
    - Turretin distinguishes between the **visible** and **invisible Church**, locating true unity in the latter.
    - He rejects the Roman Catholic identification of unity with submission to the papacy.
    - Unity is maintained through the **pure preaching of the Word** and right administration of the sacraments.
    "The unity of the church consists in the unity of faith and Spirit, not in external polity." (Institutes)

2. **Holiness as Consecration to God**
    - The Church is holy by virtue of its union with Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
    - Holiness is both **imputed** (in Christ) and **imparted** (in sanctification of members).
    - The visible Church contains both true believers and hypocrites, but its holiness is not nullified thereby.
    - The means of grace—**Word and sacraments**—are central to the Church’s sanctification.
    "The church is called holy because it is separated from the world and consecrated to God." (Institutes)

3. **Catholicity as Universality of the Church**
    - The Church is catholic because it is spread throughout all nations and ages.
    - Catholicity is not tied to any particular see, nation, or external form.
    - The true Church exists wherever the **gospel is rightly preached** and the sacraments rightly administered.
    - Turretin opposes the Roman claim that catholicity is found only in communion with Rome.
    "The church is called catholic because it is diffused through all nations and ages." (Institutes)

4. **Apostolicity as Fidelity to Apostolic Doctrine**
    - Apostolicity is defined by adherence to the **apostolic teaching** found in Scripture.
    - The Church is apostolic when it preserves the doctrine and practices of the apostles.
    - Turretin denies that unbroken episcopal succession is necessary for apostolicity.
    - The Reformed churches are apostolic insofar as they maintain the apostolic gospel.
    "Apostolicity consists not in succession of persons, but in succession of doctrine." (Institutes)

5. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The true Church is identified by the **pure preaching of the Word**, the right administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline.
    - These marks distinguish the true Church from false or apostate assemblies.
    - The presence of these marks, not institutional continuity, is decisive.
    - Turretin uses these criteria to defend the legitimacy of the Reformed churches.
    "The marks of the true church are the pure preaching of the Word and the lawful administration of the sacraments." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** became foundational for later Reformed ecclesiology, especially in distinguishing the visible and invisible Church and in defining the marks of the true Church. His polemical engagement with Roman Catholicism shaped Protestant self-understanding and apologetics. Turretin’s influence persists in confessional Reformed theology, where his careful distinctions and emphasis on doctrinal purity continue to inform debates about the nature and boundaries of the Church.
