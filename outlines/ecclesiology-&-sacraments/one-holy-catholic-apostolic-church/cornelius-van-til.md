# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** through the lens of **Reformed ecclesiology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the Church as the covenant community, grounded in the **self-revelation of the Triune God**, and maintained that the Church’s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity are rooted in its submission to **Scripture as ultimate authority**.

- "The church is the body of Christ, and as such it must manifest the unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity that are found in him." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity Grounded in the Triune God**
    - The Church’s oneness reflects the ontological unity of the **Trinity**.
    - True unity is possible only through submission to **God’s self-revelation**.
    - Denies any unity based on human tradition or institutionalism apart from **Scripture**.
    - The visible and invisible Church distinction is maintained, with unity ultimately spiritual.
    - "Unity in the church is grounded in the unity of the triune God himself." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Holiness through Covenant Relationship**
    - The Church is set apart by virtue of its covenantal relationship with God.
    - Holiness is not intrinsic but derived from union with **Christ**.
    - The means of grace—**Word and Sacrament**—are central to the Church’s sanctification.
    - The Church’s holiness is always eschatological and imperfect in this age.
    - "The church is holy because it is in covenant with the holy God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Catholicity as Faithfulness to the Whole Counsel of God**
    - The Church is catholic insofar as it embraces the fullness of **biblical revelation**.
    - Rejects any notion of catholicity that is merely geographic or institutional.
    - Catholicity is expressed in the Church’s mission to all nations.
    - The Church’s universality is spiritual, not organizational.
    - "The church is catholic because it is founded upon the whole counsel of God and is called to all peoples." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Apostolicity Defined by Scriptural Authority**
    - Apostolicity is rooted in fidelity to the **apostolic teaching** preserved in Scripture.
    - The Church is apostolic as it proclaims and defends the gospel once for all delivered.
    - Apostolic succession is understood as doctrinal, not merely historical or institutional.
    - The Church’s authority is always derivative from the authority of Christ through the apostles.
    - "The church is apostolic only as it stands upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis between Church and World**
    - The Church is called to maintain a clear antithesis with unbelief.
    - The marks of the Church distinguish it from all false assemblies.
    - The Church’s identity is shaped by its opposition to all forms of **autonomous human reasoning**.
    - The Church’s mission is apologetic as well as evangelistic, confronting the world with the claims of Christ.
    - "The church must always be conscious of the antithesis between itself and the world." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** has deeply influenced Reformed ecclesiology, especially in the context of **presuppositional apologetics**. His insistence on the primacy of Scripture and the antithesis between Church and world has shaped generations of theologians and apologists. While not primarily an ecclesiologist, his covenantal and Trinitarian emphases continue to inform discussions on the nature and mission of the Church within confessional Reformed circles.
