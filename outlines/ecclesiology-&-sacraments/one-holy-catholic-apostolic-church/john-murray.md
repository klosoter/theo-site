# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** with a strong emphasis on the **unity of the body of Christ**, the **holiness derived from union with Christ**, and the **continuity of the Church’s mission** throughout redemptive history. He insisted on the visible and invisible distinction, the necessity of **biblical fidelity**, and the Church’s identity as the locus of God’s covenant people. Murray’s ecclesiology is marked by a Reformed commitment to the authority of Scripture and the centrality of the means of grace.

- "The church is the assembly of the people of God, called out from the world, separated unto God, and constituted a holy nation in Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Unity of the Church" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Christian Baptism" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Redemption—Accomplished and Applied"
- "Principles of Conduct"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church is Spiritual and Visible**
    - The Church’s unity is grounded in **union with Christ** by the Holy Spirit.
    - This unity is both an invisible spiritual reality and a visible, historical manifestation.
    - Denominational divisions are lamentable but do not destroy the essential unity of the Church.
    - True unity is expressed in shared confession, worship, and discipline.
    - "The unity of the church is not merely ideal; it is a spiritual and visible reality." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Holiness Rooted in Covenant and Redemption**
    - The Church is holy because it is set apart by God and united to Christ.
    - Holiness is both positional (in Christ) and progressive (sanctification of its members).
    - The Church’s holiness is visible in its doctrine, worship, and discipline.
    - The call to holiness is inseparable from the Church’s identity as God’s people.
    - "The church is holy because it is the community of the redeemed, sanctified in Christ Jesus." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Catholicity as Universality in Christ**
    - The Church is catholic in that it encompasses all true believers across time and space.
    - Catholicity is not institutional uniformity but spiritual unity in the gospel.
    - The Church transcends ethnic, cultural, and national boundaries.
    - The marks of the true Church are found wherever Christ is faithfully proclaimed.
    - "The catholicity of the church consists in its universality in Christ, not in external organization." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Apostolicity Defined by Faithfulness to Apostolic Doctrine**
    - The Church is apostolic as it is founded on the teaching of the apostles.
    - Apostolicity requires continual reformation according to Scripture.
    - The ministry of the Word and sacraments is central to maintaining apostolic identity.
    - Apostolic succession is spiritual and doctrinal, not merely institutional.
    - "Apostolicity is maintained only as the church abides in the doctrine and practice of the apostles." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **The Church as the Covenant Community**
    - The Church is the continuation of the covenant people of God.
    - Membership is defined by covenantal inclusion, signified in baptism.
    - The Church is the sphere of the administration of the means of grace.
    - The visible and invisible distinction safeguards the reality of mixed membership.
    - "The church is the covenant community, the people of God in all ages, united by faith in Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s ecclesiology has shaped Reformed understandings of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** by emphasizing the organic unity and spiritual reality of the body of Christ. His insistence on biblical fidelity and covenantal identity has influenced Presbyterian and broader evangelical thought. Murray’s careful distinction between visible and invisible aspects of the Church continues to inform discussions on church membership, discipline, and ecumenism. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, scripturally grounded doctrine of the Church.
