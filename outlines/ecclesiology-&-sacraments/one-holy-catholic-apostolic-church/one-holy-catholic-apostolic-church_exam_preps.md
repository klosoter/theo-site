### TITLE
The One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic Church: Unity of Christ’s Body amid Visible Division

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How the Church can be confessed as **one, holy, catholic, apostolic** in the Nicene Creed while historically fragmented, sinful, geographically dispersed, and doctrinally contested, and how this bears on authority, sacrament, and salvation.
- Decisive figures: Cyprian of Carthage, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium as conciliar voice), and Edmund Clowney.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic catholic tradition, medieval Roman Catholic theology, Reformation **Reformed ecclesiology**, and modern Roman Catholic ecumenism.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature of **visible and invisible church**, marks of the church, relation of holiness and discipline, extent of catholicity.
  - External: Roman Catholic claims of papal primacy and magisterium, Anabaptist and free church voluntarism, modern liberal and sociological reductions of the church.
  - Contemporary: ecumenism, denominational pluralism, independent churches, online and consumerist “church,” and the relation of church to kingdom and mission.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed account in which the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** is the elect people united to Christ the head, visibly gathered where the **Word is rightly preached and sacraments rightly administered**, distinguished yet not separated into visible and invisible aspects, with no single institutional embodiment exhaustively possessing the notes.

### ESSAY
To confess faith in the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** is to speak about the identity of the people of God in relation to Christ, the Spirit, and the history of redemption. This is not a peripheral matter of institutional arrangements but a core element of **ecclesiology** tightly bound to Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology. Under oral examination, you will be pressed at exactly this point: in what sense can the Church be one when Christendom is fractured, holy when its members sin grievously, catholic when it is culturally provincial, and apostolic when it is chronically tempted to innovation? A defensible position must maintain the strong objectivity of the Creedal notes while fully acknowledging empirical brokenness, without retreating into a merely invisible church or collapsing everything into a single visible institution.

A careful starting point is a conceptual definition. The Church, in its most basic sense, is the **assembly of those effectually called by God out of the world into union with Christ**, under his Word, by his Spirit, ordered toward his glory and the consummation of his kingdom. The four Nicene notes function as predicates of this reality. The Church is **one** in that there is one head, one Spirit, one faith, one baptism, one body. It is **holy** as set apart by God, constituted by union with the holy Christ and indwelt by the Holy Spirit. It is **catholic** in that it is universal in time and space, not limited to one nation or class, and possesses the wholeness of Christ’s saving truth. It is **apostolic** because founded on the apostolic gospel, preserved by apostolic Scripture, and normed by that foundation in all times and places. The theological problem arises from the apparent gap between that confession and the observable realities of schism, heresy, and corruption.

The first decisive figure is Cyprian of Carthage, bishop and martyr in the third century, who framed Catholic instinct for unity and visibility with enduring power. Writing in On the Unity of the Catholic Church in the wake of persecution and schism, Cyprian argued from the image of Christ’s seamless robe that the Church is a single indivisible visible reality. His famous dictum, “He cannot have God for his Father who has not the Church for his mother,” expressed a robust doctrine of **extra ecclesiam nulla salus**, no salvation outside the Church. Cyprian’s ecclesiology was intensely concrete: the Church is located in the episcopally ordered communities in communion with one another, and unity is maintained through communion with the legitimate bishops. For him, schism is not a regrettable administrative anomaly but a grave spiritual rupture that endangers salvation.

Cyprian’s strength is his insistence that the Church is a visible, historical, and institutional reality, not a merely spiritual aggregate of the elect. Under questioning, you must affirm with him that Christ’s body is not a disembodied idea. Word and sacrament presuppose actual gatherings, ordained ministries, and discipline. However, his weakness, when pressed theologically, lies in the tendency to identify the grace of Christ too immediately with a particular visible structure and to treat separation from that structure as necessarily separation from Christ. A Reformed examiner will push: does Cyprian leave room for the possibility that the institutional structure may corrupt itself to such a degree that separation is demanded by fidelity to Christ and his gospel? Cyprian himself faced a relatively early church with no entrenched papal monarchy and no fully developed sacramental system. His key contribution is the powerful claim that unity and visibility are essential, not optional, attributes of the Church, and that schism is deeply anti-ecclesial.

Augustine of Hippo, writing in the context of the Donatist controversy in North Africa, takes Cyprian’s concern for visible unity and sacramental objectivity and subjects it to penetrating theological analysis. The Donatists had argued that the integrity of the Church and the validity of its sacraments depended on the purity and legitimacy of the ministers, particularly in relation to persecution and alleged betrayal. Augustine responded that the Church is a **corpus permixtum**, a mixed body, until the eschaton, in which wheat and tares, good fish and bad, are intermingled. Holiness, in the definitive sense, belongs to Christ and the Spirit, not to the empirical morality of every member or minister. Sacraments derive their efficacy from Christ, not from the moral state of the one who administers them. On this basis Augustine defended the objective validity of baptism outside the Catholic communion, while insisting that those who return to the Catholic Church must be reconciled through the laying on of hands, not re-baptized.

Augustine’s ecclesiology preserves the **holiness of the Church** while making room for real sin and failure. Holiness is first positional and eschatological, grounded in election and justification, and only secondarily manifest in sanctification and discipline. This allowed him to condemn Donatist separatism as a refusal to bear with the imperfect reality of the pilgrim Church. At the same time, Augustine knew that not every group calling itself a church is in fact a church; definitive heresy can so corrupt a community’s confession that it departs from the apostolic foundation. Examiners will probe here: does Augustine’s mixed body concept undermine discipline or relativize holiness? You should respond that his teaching actually intensifies the call to discipline within the Church precisely because discipline is one of the means by which the eschatological holiness of the people of God is anticipated and signaled. Augustine grounds discipline in love of unity, not in a perfectionist separation.

A second objection concerns **catholicity**. Does Augustine’s focus on the global spread of the Catholic Church, opposed to a regional Donatist enclave, commit him to an institutional universalism that later undergirds medieval papalism? Historically, Augustine speaks of the Church spread throughout the world as a mark of authenticity against a narrowly regional sect, and he does not yet elaborate a juridical theory of papal supremacy. His contribution is to anchor **catholicity** in both the spatial extension and doctrinal continuity of the Church, reading Psalm and prophetic imagery of the nations into a vision of the Church that transcends ethnic and geographical boundaries. This notion carries into Reformed thought, where the **catholic Church** is confessed precisely against sectarianism, even while denying that catholicity is identical with submission to the Roman see.

Thomas Aquinas represents the classic medieval synthesis in which the Church is seen through the lens of **sacramental ontology** and hierarchical order. For Aquinas, the Church is the mystical body of Christ but also a structured society with Christ as head and the sacraments as instrumental causes of grace. In the Summa Theologiae he correlates the **seven sacraments** with stages of the Christian life, situating them within the life of the ecclesial body. The Church is one by virtue of the unity of its head, its faith, its sacraments, and its charity. It is holy by participation in the holiness of Christ and the Spirit and by the presence of sanctifying grace in its members, though again as a mixed body this holiness is not empirically uniform. The **catholicity** of the Church is deeply tied to the universality of the Roman communion, structured under the papal office. Crucially, Aquinas contributes to the later Roman doctrine that the Church is the institutional custodian of the deposit of faith, endowed with a teaching office that can define doctrine infallibly under certain conditions.

From a Reformed vantage point, one can affirm Aquinas’s insistence that the Church is more than an aggregate of individuals and that the sacraments are objective means of grace within the covenant community. Aquinas helps us see that the Church is a visible **societas** with ordered ministries and a real sacramental economy. Yet his account risks identifying the **one Church** too tightly with the juridically unified Roman structure. Under exam conditions, you should acknowledge the historical contingency of later papal claims and distinguish Aquinas’s thirteenth-century context from post-Tridentine dogmatics. His basic move, however, presses a real question: can the Creedal confession of one, catholic, apostolic Church be satisfied in a fragmented denominational landscape, or does it call for some concrete structural unity? A Reformed answer must distinguish between necessary **spiritual and confessional unity** and contingent forms of administrative centralization.

John Calvin, standing within the broader Reformation but with his own clear Reformed distinctives, is the pivotal figure in reframing the four notes from within a non-Roman perspective. In the Institutes, particularly book four, Calvin defines the Church as the society of all the elect, but he quickly moves to a robust doctrine of the **visible church** as the mother of believers. Echoing Cyprian but with Augustinian nuance, Calvin insists that outside the visible church there is ordinarily no hope of salvation, because God has placed his means of grace there. However, he carefully distinguishes the **invisible church**, consisting of the total number of the elect known only to God, from the **visible church**, which includes hypocrites and false brothers. He does not posit two churches but two aspects of the one Church. This distinction enables him both to maintain that the Church remains one, holy, catholic, apostolic in its deepest reality and to critique institutional corruption and false teaching.

Calvin’s well-known formulation of the **marks of the church** is decisive: where the Word of God is purely preached and heard and the sacraments are administered according to Christ’s institution, there, he says, a church of God exists, even if it be deficient in many things. Discipline is sometimes treated as a third mark, either essential or at least inseparably attendant. Here the Creedal notes intersect with Reformed criteria. The Church is **one** insofar as it is united by the one gospel and one sacramental confession, rather than by a single juridical head. It is **holy** as the community consecrated by the Word and sacrament, where justification and sanctification are operative. It is **catholic** because the same gospel and sacraments are found among all true churches across the world, not limited to any one nation or institution. It is **apostolic** because it is bound to the apostolic Scriptures as its final norm and because its ministries are ordered to the proclamation of that apostolic message.

Examiners will likely challenge: does the invisible–visible distinction collapse the Creedal confession into an invisible ideal, leaving the empirical church irreparably compromised? Your answer must be that Calvin refuses this move by insisting that the notes and marks truly apply to the visible church. There really are true and false visible churches, and real visible congregations are presently one, holy, catholic, apostolic in principle and in partial manifestation. The invisible–visible distinction is not between real and unreal, but between God’s exhaustive knowledge of his elect and our finite, fallible perception. Moreover, Calvin’s marks prevent an uncontrolled subjectivism: one does not simply declare any gathering of believers to be church; one must ask whether the **pure preaching of the gospel** and the **right administration of the sacraments** are present. This gives Reformed theology an objective yet non-Roman account of ecclesial identity.

Calvin also sharpens the doctrine of **apostolicity**. Against Rome’s claim of apostolic succession in office as a necessary condition, Calvin argues that succession is fundamentally succession in doctrine. A church that retains the apostolic gospel and sacraments possesses authentic apostolic continuity even if it has rejected a corrupt episcopal structure. Here he reverses the direction of argument used at Trent: Roman succession in office is only meaningful if tied to apostolic truth. An examiner might ask how this does not simply authorize schism whenever one party claims greater fidelity to the gospel. The Reformed answer is that separation is a last resort, warranted only when the marks are so compromised that conscience cannot submit without betraying Christ. This places a heavy burden of proof on would-be separatists and recognizes the sinfulness of schism.

The twentieth century Second Vatican Council, particularly its dogmatic constitution Lumen Gentium, stands as a decisive conciliar voice reshaping Roman Catholic ecclesiology in modern terms while reaffirming essential claims. Lumen Gentium famously states that the **one Church of Christ subsists in the Catholic Church**, governed by the successor of Peter and the bishops in communion with him, but also acknowledges that outside the visible confines of this structure there are elements of sanctification and truth which are forces impelling toward Catholic unity. This “subsists in” language was a development from a strict identification of the Church of Christ with the Roman Catholic Church. It introduced a more expansive and nuanced account of **catholicity**, recognizing degrees of communion, the ecclesial character of separated churches and ecclesial communities, and the work of the Spirit beyond Roman boundaries, while maintaining Catholic claims about the fullness of the means of grace and truth in the Roman communion.

From a Reformed stance, Vatican II represents both a softening and a reassertion. On one hand, its recognition of other churches as truly ecclesial communities moves away from a hard exclusivist reading of extra ecclesiam nulla salus. On the other hand, the claim that the fullness of the Church “subsists in” Rome still grounds a strong Roman assertion of being the primary visible realization of the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church**. Under examination, you should be able to articulate this Roman position fairly: the notes are, in their fullest sense, realized where there is sacramental, hierarchical, and doctrinal continuity with the apostolic college as mediated through the papacy and episcopate. Then you must argue that a Reformed understanding locates the fullness of the notes where the apostolic gospel and ordinances are maintained, which may and does occur outside Roman structures.

Vatican II also deepens the notion of the Church as the **people of God**, emphasizing the universal call to holiness. This moves Catholic theology somewhat closer to Calvin’s insistence that holiness is not the exclusive property of a clerical elite but the vocation of the entire body. You can affirm this development as a retrieval of the New Testament’s own language. Yet Vatican II continues to tie the visibility and unity of the Church in an essential way to communion with the Roman pontiff, a claim a Reformed candidate must respectfully deny on the basis that Scripture does not institute such a monarchical office and that apostolic authority is now embodied normatively in Scripture rather than in a single successor.

Finally, Edmund Clowney, as a twentieth-century Reformed theologian within the Westminster and broader Presbyterian orbit, gives a biblical-theological and redemptive-historical account that helps integrate the notes with the storyline of Scripture. Clowney views the Church fundamentally in terms of **union with Christ** and the **covenant people of God**. The Church is the eschatological Israel, gathered from all nations under the reign of the resurrected Lord. For Clowney, the Church’s oneness is grounded in Christ’s own high priestly prayer and effected by the Spirit’s uniting work. Holiness is covenant consecration, linked to both definitive sanctification and the ongoing call to be separate from worldliness. Catholicity corresponds to the Abrahamic promise that in Abraham’s seed all nations will be blessed and is manifested in the multiethnic, transnational character of the Church. Apostolicity is tethered to the once-for-all apostolic witness preserved in Scripture and made living in the Church’s preaching and mission.

Clowney insists that the Church as **covenant community** is both visible and invisible, both organism and organization. His work on the doctrine of the Church underscores the importance of the Church as a worshiping assembly rather than a voluntary association. In contemporary debates about independent churches and online “gatherings,” Clowney’s emphasis confronts the tendency to reduce church to content consumption. Church is not simply a group of Christians listening to sermons but a body gathered under ordained leadership, practicing the sacraments, and ordered according to Christ’s institution. When examiners raise questions about virtual church or multi-site models, you can apply Clowney’s categories: the essence of **ekklesia** is assembly, and while technology can assist, it cannot replace bodily gathering around Word and sacrament.

This leads into contemporary debates. Internally, within Reformed circles, there is ongoing discussion about the extent and nature of **visible unity** required by the confession of one Church. Some argue for a stronger emphasis on institutional union across denominations, others stress spiritual and doctrinal unity despite denominational lines. Another internal debate concerns the precise status of **church discipline** as a mark: is it essential or an inevitable outflow of the Word and sacrament? This directly connects to holiness. Under examination, you must show that holiness as a note includes both definitive consecration and concrete practices of repentance, discipline, and moral transformation. A church that refuses discipline in principle undermines its claim to be holy, even if it holds orthodox doctrine.

Externally, Roman Catholicism, Anabaptist and free church traditions, and modern liberal theology pose distinct alternatives. Roman Catholicism, especially in its post-Tridentine form, claims that the Creedal notes are fully instantiated only within communion with the Roman see. Anabaptist and many free church groups redefine the Church more as a voluntary gathered community of believers marked by visible discipleship, sometimes with a strong emphasis on believer’s baptism and separation from the “worldly” state church. Liberal Protestantism often reduces the Church to an ethical community, a fellowship of moral striving, or a symbol of human solidarity. Against Roman claims, the Reformed position emphasizes **Scripture alone** as the ultimate norm and denies that any single visible institution can claim an exhaustive monopoly on the notes. Against Anabaptist perfectionism, Augustine’s mixed body and Calvin’s invisible–visible distinction safeguard the Church as a place for sinners in process, not only for the visibly pure. Against liberal reductions, the Church is not simply a moral society but a supernatural reality created by the Word and Spirit.

Contemporary challenges force further clarification. Ecumenism presses whether Reformed ecclesiology can account for and pursue visible expressions of unity without sacrificing theological convictions. The answer must be that genuine unity is grounded in shared confession of the **apostolic gospel**, and therefore doctrinal dialogue and convergence on Scripture’s teaching are prerequisite to structural union. Denominational pluralism raises the question whether fragmentation itself is a scandal negating the Creedal confession. Reformed theology should admit that much division is sinful and contrary to Christ’s will, yet maintain that the one Church can subsist under multiple denominational forms, analogous to one body with multiple organs, so long as these bodies share core apostolic doctrine and sacramental practice and recognize one another as true churches.

The phenomena of “networked” and independent churches, online church, and consumerist congregational life pose more recent problems. If the Church is one, holy, catholic, apostolic, then it cannot be simply a brand among many commodities. Clowney’s covenantal and Christological emphasis helps to reassert that the Church belongs to Christ, not to pastors or consumers. Apostolicity demands humility before the given shape of church life in Scripture, not endless pragmatic reinvention. Catholicity challenges cultural parochialism and requires openness to the global and historical Church’s wisdom. Holiness calls for distinctiveness from the entertainment culture that often shapes ecclesial practice.

In sum, a coherent defense of the Creedal notes from a Reformed perspective will affirm with Cyprian that the Church is visible and necessary, with Augustine that it is a mixed yet truly holy body whose unity and catholicity are non-negotiable, with Aquinas that it is a structured society with real sacramental objectivity, while reforming his institutional identification, with Calvin that the essence of the Church is found where the marks of pure Word and right sacrament are present, and with Vatican II and Clowney that the Church is the people of God called to holiness, mission, and global breadth. The **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** is the elect people united to Christ and gathered by the Spirit under the apostolic Word, visibly expressed in local congregations that share that Word and sacramental life across time and space. No single institution perfectly realizes these notes, but they are truly and presently manifest wherever Christ’s gospel is faithfully proclaimed and his ordinances kept.

Before examiners, you must hold together two commitments. First, the Creedal predicates name realities, not ideals: the Church is actually one, holy, catholic, apostolic because Christ is one, holy, catholic, apostolic in his saving lordship. Second, these realities are now partly veiled, eschatologically oriented, and contested; they call the Church to repentance, reformation, and pursuit of visible unity rather than self-satisfaction. A Reformed theology of the Church therefore confesses the Creed with confidence, critiques ecclesial pride and sectarianism, and submits all ecclesial claims to the judgment of the **apostolic Scripture**, trusting that the Spirit will, in the end, present the Church to Christ in the fullness of the glory those notes anticipate.

- Likely examiner questions:
  - How can the Church be one amid denominational division? → One in union with Christ and shared apostolic gospel, though sinfully fragmented institutionally, calling for repentance and principled ecumenism.
  - Does the invisible church make the visible church optional? → No, the distinction is between God’s knowledge and our perception; the visible church is the ordained sphere of means of grace.
  - What does apostolicity mean without apostolic succession in office? → Faithful succession in apostolic teaching and ordinances preserved in Scripture and proclaimed in the Church.
  - Is there salvation outside the visible church? → Ordinarily no, since God has tied salvation to Word and sacrament, yet God is free to work extraordinarily; elements of the Church exist beyond formal structures.
  - How do holiness and the mixed body cohere? → Holiness is definitive in union with Christ and eschatological; the Church is mixed now, yet called to discipline and sanctification that anticipate its final purity.
