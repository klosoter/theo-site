# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** through the lens of **biblical theology**, emphasizing the Church’s organic unity in the unfolding history of **redemption**. He stressed the Church as the eschatological people of God, grounded in **union with Christ**, and distinguished between the **visible and invisible Church** while upholding the Church’s role in the **covenant of grace**.

- "The Church is not an institution for the mere conservation of what has been given, but a living body, growing and advancing towards its appointed end." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Church" (Princeton Theological Review, 1905)
- "The Kingdom of God" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as the Eschatological People of God**
    - The Church is the community gathered by God in the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Its unity is rooted in the **eschatological fulfillment** of God’s promises.
    - The Church anticipates the consummation of the **kingdom of God**.
    - The Church’s holiness and catholicity are grounded in its participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - "The Church is the bearer of the eschatological hope, already participating in the powers of the age to come." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Union with Christ as the Foundation of the Church**
    - The Church’s oneness and holiness derive from its **spiritual union with Christ**.
    - All members are incorporated into Christ by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - This union is both the basis for the Church’s visible fellowship and its invisible reality.
    - The Church’s apostolicity is expressed in its faithfulness to Christ’s teaching and mission.
    - "The Church is the body of Christ, and its life is hid with Christ in God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

3. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
    - Vos maintained the classic Reformed distinction between the **visible Church** (institutional, historical) and the **invisible Church** (the elect).
    - The visible Church contains both true and false members, while the invisible Church is composed only of the regenerate.
    - The marks of the Church—**Word, sacraments, and discipline**—belong to the visible Church.
    - The invisible Church is the true locus of the Church’s unity, holiness, and catholicity.
    - "The invisible Church is the true Church in the deepest sense, known only to God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

4. **Covenant of Grace as the Context for the Church**
    - The Church is the historical outworking of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The unity of the Church across time is grounded in the continuity of the covenant.
    - The Church’s catholicity is seen in the inclusion of all nations in the covenant promise.
    - The Church’s apostolicity is rooted in the covenantal mission to proclaim the gospel.
    - "The Church is the covenant community, the people of God called out and set apart for His purposes." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Apostolicity and the Authority of Scripture**
    - The Church is apostolic insofar as it is founded on the **apostolic teaching** preserved in Scripture.
    - Apostolicity is not merely historical succession but fidelity to the **Word of God**.
    - The Church’s holiness and unity are maintained by submission to apostolic doctrine.
    - The Church’s mission is to continue the apostolic proclamation of the gospel.
    - "The apostolic character of the Church is safeguarded by her adherence to the Scriptures as the supreme rule of faith and life." (The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s biblical-theological approach to the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** has profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology, especially in emphasizing the Church’s eschatological identity and covenantal unity. His distinction between the visible and invisible Church remains influential in contemporary discussions of ecclesial identity and purity. Vos’s work continues to inform the understanding of the Church’s mission, holiness, and apostolic foundation within the broader context of redemptive history.
