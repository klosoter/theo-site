# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen articulated a robust doctrine of the **Church** that emphasized its **spiritual unity**, **holiness**, and **visible and invisible dimensions**. He distinguished between the **universal Church** (the elect) and particular congregations, insisting that the marks of the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** are found where the **Word is rightly preached** and the **sacraments duly administered**.

- "The church of Christ is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; but it is so in Christ alone, and by virtue of its union with him." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Key Works

- The Nature, Power, Deceit, and Prevalency of Indwelling Sin in Believers
- A Brief Instruction in the Worship of God
- Communion with God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Unity of the Church**
    - The **one Church** consists of all the elect united to Christ by the Spirit.
    - Unity is grounded in **union with Christ**, not institutional uniformity.
    - Visible divisions do not destroy the Church’s true unity.
    - The Church’s unity is expressed through shared faith and ordinances.
    - "All believers, throughout the world, are one church, because they have one Head, one Spirit, one faith, and one baptism." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

2. **Holiness Rooted in Union with Christ**
    - The Church is holy by virtue of its connection to Christ’s righteousness.
    - Holiness is both an imputed status and a calling to moral purity.
    - The visible Church contains both true saints and hypocrites.
    - Discipline and the means of grace serve to promote holiness.
    - "The holiness of the church is not absolute, but derived and dependent." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

3. **Catholicity as Universality of the Elect**
    - The Church is catholic because it encompasses all believers in all ages and places.
    - Catholicity is spiritual, not tied to any one nation or institution.
    - The gospel’s spread to all nations fulfills the Church’s catholic character.
    - True catholicity is maintained by fidelity to the Word and Spirit.
    - "The catholic church is the whole company of God’s elect, called and sanctified in Christ Jesus." (Of Schism)

4. **Apostolicity Defined by Faithfulness to Apostolic Doctrine**
    - The Church is apostolic by adhering to the teaching of the apostles.
    - Apostolic succession is spiritual, not merely institutional.
    - The marks of apostolicity are the pure preaching of the gospel and right administration of sacraments.
    - Any church departing from apostolic doctrine forfeits true apostolicity.
    - "Apostolicity consists in a steadfast continuance in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
    - The invisible Church is the totality of the elect known only to God.
    - The visible Church is the gathered community professing faith and partaking in ordinances.
    - Not all in the visible Church are truly regenerate.
    - The distinction safeguards the Church’s purity and discipline.
    - "There is a church invisible, and a church visible; the one consisting of the elect, the other of professed believers." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s ecclesiology shaped **Reformed understandings of the Church’s nature and marks**, especially in distinguishing the visible and invisible Church. His emphasis on **spiritual unity** and **apostolic doctrine** influenced later Puritan and Congregationalist traditions. Owen’s careful articulation of the Church’s holiness and catholicity continues to inform contemporary discussions on church membership, discipline, and ecumenism.
