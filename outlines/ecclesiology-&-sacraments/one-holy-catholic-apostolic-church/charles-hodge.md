# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a robust doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** within the framework of **Reformed ecclesiology**. He emphasized the Church's visible and invisible aspects, its unity in **Christ**, and its foundation upon the **apostolic teaching** as preserved in Scripture, while maintaining a strong polemic against Roman Catholic claims of exclusive catholicity and apostolicity.

- "The true Church consists of all those who profess the true religion, together with their children." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (Chapters on the Church)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians
- The Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the Church)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church is Spiritual, Not Institutional**
   - The Church's unity is grounded in **union with Christ** through the Holy Spirit.
   - Visible divisions do not destroy the essential unity of the **body of Christ**.
   - Denominational diversity is compatible with spiritual oneness.
   - True unity is expressed in shared faith and doctrine, not centralized authority.
   - "The unity of the Church is not organic, but spiritual." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Holiness as Consecration to God**
   - The Church is holy because it is set apart by God and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
   - Holiness is both positional (in Christ) and progressive (sanctification of members).
   - The presence of sin in the Church does not negate its essential holiness.
   - Discipline and the means of grace serve to promote holiness among members.
   - "The Church is holy, not because its members are free from sin, but because they are called to be saints." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Catholicity Rooted in the Gospel, Not Geography**
   - The Church is catholic because it encompasses all true believers across time and space.
   - Catholicity is defined by adherence to the **apostolic faith**, not by institutional continuity.
   - No single visible church or denomination can claim exclusive catholicity.
   - The marks of the true Church are the pure preaching of the Word and right administration of the sacraments.
   - "The Church is catholic, because it is not confined to any one age, nation, or class of men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Apostolicity as Fidelity to Apostolic Doctrine**
   - The Church is apostolic insofar as it holds to the teaching of the apostles as found in Scripture.
   - Apostolic succession is doctrinal, not merely ministerial or institutional.
   - The authority of the apostles is mediated through their writings, not through an unbroken line of bishops.
   - The Reformation restored the Church’s apostolic character by returning to biblical foundations.
   - "Apostolicity consists in adherence to the doctrines taught by the apostles." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Distinction Between Visible and Invisible Church**
   - The visible Church includes all who profess faith and their children, but not all are truly regenerate.
   - The invisible Church consists of the elect united to Christ by faith.
   - The distinction safeguards the Church’s unity and holiness despite visible imperfections.
   - This framework undergirds Presbyterian polity and the practice of church discipline.
   - "The visible Church is the society of professed believers; the invisible Church is the company of the truly saved." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** shaped American Presbyterianism and broader Reformed ecclesiology, emphasizing the primacy of **Scripture** and the spiritual unity of believers. His distinction between the visible and invisible Church became a standard feature in Reformed theology. Hodge’s polemics against Roman Catholic and High Church claims reinforced Protestant identity and the sufficiency of apostolic doctrine as found in the Bible. His influence endures in contemporary discussions of church unity, catholicity, and the marks of the true Church.
