# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** with a focus on the dynamic relationship between the Church’s divine calling and its historical, visible reality. He emphasized the **eschatological tension** between the Church’s identity as the body of Christ and its ongoing struggle with imperfection, warning against both triumphalism and despair. Berkouwer insisted that the Church’s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity are gifts rooted in **Christ and the Spirit**, not achievements of human effort.

- "The Church is not an object of faith, but of confession; she is not the ground of salvation, but the fruit of salvation." (The Church, p. 21)

## Key Works

- The Church (De Kerk) (1957; English trans. 1976)
- The Return of Christ (1952; English trans. 1972)
- Studies in Dogmatics series (esp. Faith and Sanctification, Faith and Perseverance)
- “The Unity of the Church” in Ecumenical Review (1954)
- A Half Century of Theology (1977)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity Rooted in Christ**
   - The Church’s **oneness** is grounded in union with Christ, not institutional uniformity.
   - Visible divisions do not nullify the spiritual unity established by the Spirit.
   - Unity is both a given reality and an ethical imperative for believers.
   - Ecumenical engagement must be shaped by fidelity to the gospel.
   - "The unity of the Church is not a human achievement, but a gift of grace." (The Church, p. 33)

2. **Holiness as Eschatological Calling**
   - The Church’s **holiness** is both a present reality in Christ and a future hope.
   - Holiness is not perfectionism but participation in Christ’s sanctifying work.
   - The Church remains a community of sinners justified by grace.
   - The tension between the Church’s calling and its failures must be acknowledged.
   - "The holiness of the Church is not a static possession, but a calling that points beyond itself." (The Church, p. 77)

3. **Catholicity as Universality in Christ**
   - The Church’s **catholicity** refers to its universality across time and space.
   - Catholicity is realized in the diversity of peoples and cultures united in Christ.
   - True catholicity resists both sectarianism and uniformity.
   - The Church’s mission is to witness to Christ in all the world.
   - "The catholicity of the Church is not a matter of extension, but of confession." (The Church, p. 101)

4. **Apostolicity as Faithfulness to the Gospel**
   - The Church is **apostolic** insofar as it remains faithful to the apostolic witness.
   - Apostolicity is not merely historical succession but doctrinal continuity.
   - The Church’s authority is always normed by Scripture.
   - Renewal and reform are necessary to maintain apostolic faithfulness.
   - "Apostolicity is not a static possession, but a dynamic calling to remain in the truth." (The Church, p. 119)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
   - Berkouwer affirms the distinction but warns against separating the two.
   - The **visible Church** is the historical, empirical community of believers.
   - The **invisible Church** refers to the true people of God known only to Him.
   - The distinction serves to humble the Church and guard against institutionalism.
   - "The distinction between the visible and invisible Church is not a dualism, but a confession of faith in God’s work." (The Church, p. 56)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** has shaped Reformed ecclesiology by emphasizing the Church’s dependence on Christ and the Spirit rather than institutional perfection. His work influenced ecumenical dialogues and encouraged humility and openness in discussions of church unity. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his insistence that the Church’s identity is always a matter of confession, not possession, and that its marks are gifts to be received in faith.
