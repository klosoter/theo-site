# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity, sanctity, universality, and apostolic foundation of the Church as grounded in **Scripture** and shaped by the lordship of **Christ**. He stresses the visible and invisible dimensions of the Church, its mission in the world, and the necessity of doctrinal fidelity and spiritual vitality within the covenant community.

- "The church is the covenant community, the people of God, the body of Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- Evangelical Reunion: Denominations and the One Body of Christ
- Worship in Spirit and Truth

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church is Rooted in Christ**
   - The Church’s **oneness** is grounded in union with Christ as its head.
   - Unity is both a spiritual reality (invisible church) and a visible calling (visible church).
   - Denominational divisions are lamentable but do not destroy the essential unity of the Church.
   - True unity is maintained through shared faith, sacraments, and submission to Scripture.
   - "The unity of the church is not something we create, but something God has already established in Christ." (Evangelical Reunion)

2. **Holiness as Consecration to God**
   - The Church is set apart by God and called to reflect His **holiness** in doctrine and life.
   - Holiness is both a status (in Christ) and a calling (sanctification).
   - The Church’s holiness is expressed in worship, discipline, and obedience.
   - Holiness is maintained through the means of grace: Word, sacraments, and prayer.
   - "God’s people are holy because he has set them apart for himself." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Catholicity as Universality and Inclusiveness**
   - The Church is **catholic** in that it spans all times, places, and peoples.
   - Catholicity is grounded in the universal scope of the gospel and the Spirit’s work.
   - The Church’s catholicity is expressed in its mission and embrace of all believers.
   - Local congregations are true churches but are part of the one universal body.
   - "The church is catholic, not because it is centered in Rome, but because it is the body of Christ throughout the world." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Apostolicity as Faithfulness to Apostolic Teaching**
   - The Church is **apostolic** by adhering to the teaching and mission of the apostles.
   - Apostolicity is maintained through fidelity to Scripture as the apostolic witness.
   - The Church’s leadership and ministry are to be shaped by apostolic patterns.
   - Apostolicity guards the Church from doctrinal error and innovation.
   - "Apostolicity means that the church is founded on the apostles’ doctrine, which is now inscripturated in the New Testament." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
   - The **invisible church** consists of all true believers united to Christ.
   - The **visible church** is the institutional, historical manifestation of the covenant community.
   - Both aspects are necessary for a full understanding of the Church’s identity and mission.
   - The visible church is marked by the preaching of the Word, administration of sacraments, and discipline.
   - "Scripture recognizes both the visible and invisible aspects of the church, and both are important for its life and mission." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** has shaped contemporary Reformed ecclesiology, especially through his triperspectival approach and emphasis on the lordship of Christ over all aspects of church life. His work has encouraged a renewed focus on the unity and mission of the Church while maintaining doctrinal fidelity and practical holiness. Frame’s influence is evident in both academic and pastoral contexts, contributing to ongoing discussions about the nature and calling of the Church in the modern world.
