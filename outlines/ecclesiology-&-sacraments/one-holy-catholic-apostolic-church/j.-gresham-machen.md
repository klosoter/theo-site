# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen vigorously defended a **visible, confessional Church** grounded in **apostolic doctrine** and the historic **marks of the Church**. He insisted that the **oneness, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity** of the Church are inseparable from fidelity to the **gospel** and the authority of **Scripture**, standing firmly against theological liberalism that, in his view, undermined these essential attributes.

- "The Christian movement at its inception was not just a way of life in the modern sense, but a way of life founded upon a message." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- The Presbyterian Conflict (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church’s Oneness Rooted in Truth**
    - The unity of the Church is grounded in **shared doctrinal confession**, not mere institutional or experiential unity.
    - True oneness is maintained by faithfulness to the **apostolic gospel** as revealed in **Scripture**.
    - Machen rejected ecumenism that sacrificed doctrinal clarity for organizational unity.
    - He saw the **confessional standards** as essential to preserving the Church’s unity.
    "Unity that is obtained by the sacrifice of truth is worth nothing." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Holiness as Consecration to the Gospel**
    - The Church is holy because it is set apart by God through the **work of Christ** and the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Holiness is expressed in both doctrinal purity and moral conduct.
    - Machen insisted that abandoning the supernatural elements of Christianity undermines the Church’s holiness.
    - The Church’s distinctiveness is maintained by its faithfulness to the **biblical message**.
    "The Church is holy only as it remains true to the message entrusted to it." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Catholicity Defined by Apostolic Faith**
    - The Church is catholic in that it is universal, embracing all who hold to the **apostolic faith**.
    - Machen emphasized the continuity of the true Church across time and cultures through adherence to the same **gospel**.
    - He rejected the idea that catholicity means mere inclusiveness or institutional breadth.
    - The Church’s universality is spiritual and doctrinal, not simply organizational.
    "The Church is catholic because it is founded upon a message for all men." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Apostolicity as Doctrinal Continuity**
    - Apostolicity is maintained by fidelity to the **apostolic teaching** preserved in **Scripture**.
    - Machen argued that the Church’s authority is derivative, not original, rooted in the apostles’ witness.
    - He opposed any development of doctrine that contradicted the apostolic deposit.
    - The Church’s ministers are called to proclaim and defend the apostolic gospel.
    "The New Testament is the Church’s charter, and the apostolic message is its foundation." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
    - Machen affirmed the classic Reformed distinction between the **visible** and **invisible Church**.
    - The visible Church is marked by the preaching of the Word, administration of the sacraments, and discipline.
    - The invisible Church consists of all true believers united to Christ by faith.
    - The marks of the Church are essential for identifying the true visible Church in history.
    "The visible Church is the company of those who profess the true faith, but only God knows those who are truly His." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s defense of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** shaped American Presbyterianism and the broader Reformed tradition, especially in the context of the fundamentalist-modernist controversy. His insistence on doctrinal fidelity as the basis for the Church’s unity and identity continues to influence confessional churches and seminaries. Machen’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the nature of the Church, the authority of **Scripture**, and the boundaries of Christian fellowship.
