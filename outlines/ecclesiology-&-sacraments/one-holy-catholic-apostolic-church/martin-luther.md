# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther redefined the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** by grounding its identity in the proclamation of the **gospel** and the right administration of the **sacraments**, rather than institutional continuity with Rome. He emphasized the **priesthood of all believers** and the invisible unity of the Church, insisting that holiness and apostolicity are gifts of Christ, not marks of ecclesiastical hierarchy.

- "The true Church is the congregation of saints and true believers." ("The Smalcald Articles")

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Schmalkald Articles (1537)
- On the Councils and the Church (1539)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 41: Church and Ministry II

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church is defined by the gospel**
    - The true Church exists where the **Word of God** is rightly preached.
    - The Church is not identified with any particular institution or hierarchy.
    - The marks of the Church are the gospel and sacraments, not external unity.
    - The Church’s unity is spiritual, rooted in faith in Christ.
    - "Thank God, today a seven-year-old child knows what the Church is, namely, the holy believers and lambs who hear the voice of their Shepherd." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Priesthood of all believers**
    - All Christians share in the spiritual priesthood through faith.
    - No ontological distinction exists between clergy and laity.
    - Ministry is a function, not a higher spiritual status.
    - The Church’s apostolicity is maintained by the faithful proclamation of the Word.
    - "We are all consecrated priests through baptism." (To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation)

3. **The Church is holy by Christ’s righteousness**
    - The Church’s holiness is not moral perfection but imputed by Christ.
    - Sinners remain within the Church, justified by faith alone.
    - Holiness is received, not achieved, through union with Christ.
    - The visible Church contains both true and false believers.
    - "The Church is holy even though in it are present many sinners." (Large Catechism)

4. **Catholicity as universality of faith**
    - The Church is catholic in that it spans all times and places.
    - True catholicity is spiritual, not institutional or geographic.
    - The unity of the Church is grounded in the gospel, not papal authority.
    - The Church transcends all human boundaries and traditions.
    - "The Christian Church exists not only in Rome but in the whole world." (On the Councils and the Church)

5. **Apostolicity through fidelity to Scripture**
    - Apostolic succession is faithfulness to apostolic teaching, not office.
    - The Church is apostolic when it proclaims the gospel as handed down in Scripture.
    - Councils and traditions are subordinate to the authority of the Word.
    - The apostolic Church is recognized by its adherence to the doctrine of Christ.
    - "Whatever does not teach Christ is not apostolic, even though St. Peter or St. Paul does it." (On the Councils and the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of the **Church** shattered the medieval consensus, redefining the four marks as spiritual realities rather than institutional attributes. His emphasis on the **Word and sacraments** as the true marks of the Church shaped all subsequent Protestant ecclesiology. Luther’s teaching on the **priesthood of all believers** and the invisible unity of the Church remains foundational for Reformation and evangelical traditions, challenging both Roman Catholic and radical sectarian models.
