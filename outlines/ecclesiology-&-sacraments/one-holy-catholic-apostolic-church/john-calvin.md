# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **Church** centers on its visible and invisible aspects, emphasizing the marks of the **true Church**: the pure preaching of the **Word**, the right administration of the **sacraments**, and the exercise of **discipline**. He affirms the **unity**, **holiness**, **catholicity**, and **apostolicity** of the Church, while distinguishing the Church’s spiritual essence from its often flawed earthly manifestation.

- "Wherever we see the Word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments administered according to Christ’s institution, there, it is not to be doubted, a church of God exists." (Institutes IV.1.9)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book IV
- Commentaries on Ephesians and 1 Corinthians
- Treatises Against the Anabaptists and Libertines
- Letters (selected correspondence on ecclesiology)
- The Necessity of Reforming the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Visible and Invisible**
   - The **visible Church** consists of all who profess faith and participate in the sacraments.
   - The **invisible Church** is the assembly of the elect known only to God.
   - Both aspects are essential for understanding the Church’s unity and purity.
   - The visible Church may contain hypocrites, but the invisible Church is truly holy.
   - "But as there are many hypocrites mixed with the good, and even many wolves in sheep’s clothing, we must leave to God alone the knowledge of his own." (Institutes IV.1.7)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - The pure preaching of the **Word of God** is the first and chief mark.
   - The right administration of the **sacraments** is essential.
   - **Church discipline** preserves the Church’s holiness and order.
   - These marks distinguish the true Church from false assemblies.
   - "The Church is called apostolic because it is built on the doctrine of the apostles and prophets." (Institutes IV.2.1)

3. **Unity of the Church**
   - The Church is one because it is united to **Christ** as its head.
   - Unity is spiritual, rooted in **faith** and the **Holy Spirit**.
   - External divisions do not destroy the Church’s essential unity.
   - Schism is a grave sin unless separation is necessary for faithfulness.
   - "We must not, therefore, rashly forsake the Church because of the faults of some members." (Institutes IV.1.12)

4. **Holiness and Catholicity**
   - The Church is holy because it is sanctified by the **Spirit** and the **Word**.
   - Its holiness is real but imperfect in this age.
   - The Church is **catholic**—universal—embracing all believers across time and place.
   - Catholicity is not tied to any one institution or nation.
   - "The Church is called catholic, or universal, because there could not be two or three churches unless Christ be torn asunder." (Institutes IV.1.2)

5. **Apostolicity and Continuity**
   - The Church is apostolic by adhering to the **apostolic doctrine**.
   - True succession is faithfulness to the **gospel**, not mere institutional lineage.
   - The Church’s authority is derived from Christ through the apostles’ teaching.
   - Reformation is justified when the Church departs from apostolic truth.
   - "All pastors are to be heard, provided they discharge their office faithfully; but if they turn aside from Christ, they are to be regarded as wolves." (Institutes IV.2.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s ecclesiology profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, providing a robust framework for understanding the Church’s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. His distinction between the visible and invisible Church influenced later Protestant thought and ecumenical discussions. Calvin’s emphasis on the marks of the true Church remains foundational for Reformed confessions and continues to inform debates on church unity and purity.
