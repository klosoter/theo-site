# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He emphasized the Church as the community formed by proclamation and faith in the **kerygma**, rather than as an institution defined by historical continuity or visible marks. For Bultmann, the Church’s unity and apostolicity are realized existentially in the encounter with the **Word of God**.

- "The Church is not a visible institution but the event of faith in the proclamation." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Essays Philosophical and Theological" (1955)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Ecclesiology**
    - The traditional marks of the Church must be interpreted existentially, not as metaphysical realities.
    - The Church’s identity is not found in institutional structures but in the response of faith to the kerygma.
    - Myths about the Church’s holiness or apostolic succession are to be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - The Church is an event, not an object, arising wherever the Word is proclaimed and received.
    - "The real Church is where the Word is heard and accepted in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Unity of the Church**
    - Unity is not institutional but grounded in the shared existential response to the gospel.
    - The Church transcends denominational or historical boundaries.
    - True unity is realized in the act of faith, not in organizational uniformity.
    - The Church is a fellowship of believers who encounter Christ in proclamation.
    - "The unity of the Church is the unity of faith, not of organization." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Apostolicity as Proclamation**
    - Apostolicity is not about historical succession but fidelity to the original kerygma.
    - The Church is apostolic when it proclaims the message of Christ authentically.
    - The authority of the apostles is mediated through the ongoing event of proclamation.
    - Apostolic tradition is dynamic, not static, and must be reinterpreted in each generation.
    - "Apostolicity means the Church is founded anew wherever the gospel is preached." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Holiness as Existential Encounter**
    - Holiness is not a quality possessed by the Church but an event in the encounter with God’s Word.
    - The Church is holy insofar as it is the locus of authentic faith and decision.
    - Institutional or moral purity is secondary to the existential response to the gospel.
    - Holiness is realized in the transformation of individuals by the proclaimed Word.
    - "The Church is holy only as the event of faith in the Word." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Catholicity as Universal Proclamation**
    - Catholicity is not about geographical spread or institutional universality.
    - The Church is catholic wherever the kerygma is proclaimed and received.
    - The universality of the Church is existential, not organizational.
    - The Church transcends all cultural and historical boundaries through the universal call of the gospel.
    - "The Church is catholic in the sense that the Word addresses all men." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of the **one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church** challenged traditional ecclesiology and influenced generations of Protestant theology. His focus on the Church as the event of faith in proclamation shifted attention from institutional continuity to the existential reality of the believing community. While controversial, his approach opened new avenues for dialogue between theology and modern existential philosophy, and his emphasis on the **kerygma** remains a significant reference point in contemporary discussions of ecclesial identity.
