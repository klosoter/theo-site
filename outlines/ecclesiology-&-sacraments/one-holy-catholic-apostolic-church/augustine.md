# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** is foundational for Western Christianity. He emphasized the Church’s visible unity, rooted in **apostolic succession**, and its spiritual holiness, while also distinguishing between the **visible and invisible Church**. Augustine’s ecclesiology was shaped by his opposition to the Donatists, insisting that the Church remains **catholic** and **apostolic** despite the presence of sinners within her visible bounds.

- "The Church is not the Church of good men only, but of both good and bad." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

## Key Works

- On Baptism, Against the Donatists
- The City of God
- Enchiridion
- Sermons on the Creed
- Letters (especially correspondence with Donatists)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Church**
   - The Church is fundamentally **one** because it is the body of Christ.
   - Unity is maintained through **apostolic teaching** and the sacraments.
   - Schism is a grave sin that wounds the body of Christ.
   - The Donatist controversy highlighted the necessity of visible unity.
   - "The Church is one, which is spread abroad throughout the whole world." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

2. **Holiness Despite Sinful Members**
   - The Church is **holy** by virtue of Christ’s sanctifying presence.
   - Holiness is not destroyed by the presence of sinners within the Church.
   - The Church is a corpus permixtum (mixed body) of saints and sinners.
   - Discipline and sacraments serve to nurture holiness among members.
   - "The Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, though as yet it contains evil men mixed with the good." (The City of God)

3. **Catholicity as Universality**
   - The Church is **catholic** because it is universal in space and time.
   - Catholicity is marked by adherence to the apostolic faith everywhere.
   - The true Church is not confined to any one region or ethnic group.
   - The Donatists’ exclusivism was a denial of catholicity.
   - "The Church is called catholic because it is spread throughout the whole world." (Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed)

4. **Apostolicity and Authority**
   - The Church’s authority derives from **apostolic succession**.
   - Apostolic teaching is preserved in the Church’s doctrine and practice.
   - Bishops are successors to the apostles, maintaining continuity.
   - The Creed summarizes the apostolic faith handed down in the Church.
   - "The Church holds the faith which she has received from the apostles." (Enchiridion)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church**
   - The **visible Church** includes all who profess faith and receive the sacraments.
   - The **invisible Church** consists of the elect known only to God.
   - Not all within the visible Church are truly regenerate.
   - Final separation of wheat and tares awaits the eschaton.
   - "Many who are outside appear to be inside, and many who are inside appear to be outside." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s ecclesiology profoundly shaped both **Western Catholic** and **Reformed** understandings of the Church. His distinction between the visible and invisible Church became a cornerstone for later Protestant theology, while his defense of catholicity and apostolicity influenced medieval and modern debates on Church unity. Augustine’s thought remains central to discussions of **ecclesial identity**, especially in contexts of schism and doctrinal controversy.
