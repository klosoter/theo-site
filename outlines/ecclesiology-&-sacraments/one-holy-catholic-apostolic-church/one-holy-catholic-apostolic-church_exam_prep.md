### TITLE
Eschatological Identity and Visible Form: Defending the Church’s Unity, Holiness, Catholicity, and Apostolicity under Word, Sacrament, and Discipline

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the Nicene predicates one, holy, catholic, apostolic name the church’s ontological identity in Christ while demanding concrete, visible form without collapsing into either institutional absolutism or voluntarist fragmentation.
- Decisive figures: Ignatius of Antioch, Cyprian of Carthage, Augustine of Hippo, John Calvin, Joseph Ratzinger.
- Traditions engaged: Patristic Catholic tradition, Augustinian anti-Donatism, Reformation and Reformed confessional ecclesiology, modern Roman Catholic communio ecclesiology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: visible and invisible church, two or three marks, sacramental validity and discipline, the nature of catholicity and intercommunion, polity and ministerial authority.
  - External: Roman primacy and apostolic succession, Orthodox conciliarity, Donatist and Anabaptist purism, modern liberal ecclesiologies.
  - Contemporary: ecumenism and denominationalism, abuse and discipline, digital and multisite “church,” global South catholicity, contested sexual ethics and holiness.
- Position: A Reformed catholic ecclesiology that receives the Nicene predicates as Christological and pneumatological gifts realized through the means of grace, identifies the church visibly by pure preaching, right sacraments, and binding discipline, grounds apostolicity in normative apostolic doctrine rather than necessary tactile succession, and pursues ordered conciliar unity without papal monarchy.

### ESSAY
To confess that the church is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic is to speak first of Christ and only derivatively of ourselves. The predicates are not moralistic goals or sociological descriptors but theological judgments that the risen Lord by the Spirit constitutes a people, gives them a form, and directs them toward an eschatological consummation. The question for defense is whether such predicates can bear weight in history without collapsing into a brittle institutionalism on the one hand or dissolving into spiritualized invisibility on the other. I will argue that the Nicene marks are Christological properties of the church, visible and audible in this age where the Word is purely preached, the sacraments rightly administered, and **discipline** sustained, and that the most coherent account of apostolicity is succession in the apostolic rule of faith, while tactile succession serves a ministerial and prudential role rather than defining the esse of the church.

The early emergence of visible unity and apostolic authority appears sharply in Ignatius of Antioch. Writing on his way to martyrdom in the early second century, Ignatius exhorts churches to gather around their bishop with the presbyters and deacons as the locus of unity against docetism and schism. His insistence that the Eucharist is valid only under the bishop was not a metaphysical theory of consecration but an anti-schismatic strategy to guarantee one table, one body, one confession. He fuses unity and holiness in liturgical catechesis: where the bishop is, there is the church, and where Christ is, there is the church’s life. Apostolicity for Ignatius is not a nostalgia for the past but the living authority of a ministry set in continuity with the apostles’ teaching to guard the flock. The examiner will ask whether Ignatius mandates monoepiscopacy as the essence of unity. The answer is that Ignatius articulates the necessity of ordered oversight for ecclesial unity, not one necessary form in perpetuity. His theological insight is that unity and doctrine are inseparable and must become visible in sacramental communion. This insight is retained by the Reformers in presbyterial synodality even where episcopal singularity is rejected.

Cyprian of Carthage in the mid third century deepened the ontology of unity amid persecution and schism. In On the Unity of the Church, he describes the episcopate as one office shared in a college of bishops, analogizing unity by the seamless garment of Christ. Here the axiom extra ecclesiam nulla salus—outside the church no salvation—receives its classic pre-Augustinian expression. Cyprian’s pastoral context is decisive. The Novatian rigorists were refusing reconciliation to the lapsed after Decian persecution. Cyprian’s sanctity is not a sectarian purity but a holiness of reconciliation by a church with keys to bind and loose. Apostolicity becomes a juridical continuity across sees, including Rome as a primatial point of reference, though Cyprian contests Stephen of Rome on rebaptism and never yields universal jurisdiction. Examiners will press whether Cyprian entails Roman primacy for one, holy, catholic, apostolic. Cyprian’s own ecclesiology resists that inference. He grants Rome an eminent place but insists on the equality of bishops and the sufficiency of conciliar judgment. What matters for our argument is that catholicity is both geographical and sacramental, lodged in a communion of churches sharing one faith and practicing reconciliation by ordained oversight. The Reformed reception will agree with Cyprian on the necessity of ordered ministry and translocal communion while denying that this entails a singular universal see.

The decisive turn that guards holiness without sectarian fracture is Augustine of Hippo’s response to the Donatists. When the Donatists claimed that traditor bishops had invalidated their ministry, Augustine argued that the church in via is a corpus permixtum, a mixed body of wheat and tares until the eschaton. Holiness is first of all consecration by the Spirit through the **means of grace**, not the measurable virtue of the minister or the congregation. In this frame Augustine defended sacramental validity by appeal to Christ as principal minister, which later scholastics will call a form of ex opere operato. But he never reduced grace to mechanics. The church’s holiness is enacted when Christ heals sinners through public ministry and discipline. His catholicity is not bare extensiveness but the plenitude of charity and truth stretching from the apostolic foundation through all nations under the one rule of faith. Augustine thus integrates the four marks: one people knit by charity, holy by consecration, catholic by the gospel’s diffusion and plenitude, apostolic by fidelity to Scripture and the creed. Under examiner pressure about Augustine’s acceptance of state coercion against Donatists, one should distinguish principle from prudence. Augustine’s core ecclesiological principle is that separatist purity destroys unity and distorts holiness. His argument from the mixed body and from Christ as minister remains a crucial guardrail for discipline that heals rather than weaponizes holiness.

John Calvin receives the Nicene predicates into a Reformation architecture keyed to the authority of Scripture and the economy of grace. In the Institutes Book 4, Calvin identifies the church where the **marks of the church** are present: the pure preaching of the Word and the right administration of the sacraments. He frequently adds discipline as indispensable to ecclesial health. This is not a rival list to the Nicene marks but a clarification of their visibility. Unity is not an abstract harmony but liturgical and doctrinal communion around rightly administered baptism and the Supper under the Word. Holiness is not perfectionism but the sanctifying work of the Spirit through those ordinances. Catholicity is the breadth of that same gospel across peoples, tethered to the Scriptures as a sufficient canon and to the ancient creed as a rule. Apostolicity is not primarily tactile succession but succession of doctrine and ministry by lawful calling in the church. Calvin’s distinction between the **visible and invisible church** is often misunderstood. It does not posit two churches. Rather, it asserts one church known infallibly to God by election and known fallibly to us by marks and profession. The distinction refuses Donatist rigor and Rome’s identification of the church with a juridical center. It guards a chastened confidence in visible forms while acknowledging that hypocrisy and failure persist until the last day.

Calvin’s insistence on discipline answers a contemporary objection at its root. Without binding discipline, the predicates collapse into slogans. A church that tolerates abusive shepherds proclaims a false holiness. Calvin’s Geneva, with all its excesses, contended that jurisdictional structures must debar wolves from the table. Reformed confessions followed him, naming Word, sacraments, and censure as the church’s concrete form. This does not annul Augustine’s sacramental realism but ensures that Augustine’s insight is not turned into sacramental quietism. A common examiner challenge is whether discipline is a mark of the church’s being or only of its well-being. The best Reformed answer recognizes a hierarchy of necessity. Where the preached Word and the visible sacraments remain, the church remains as Christ’s embassy, even if discipline is weak. But because the Supper is a communion in Christ’s body, discipline is ordinarily required for the church’s continued visibility as a holy communion. Persistent tolerance of unrepentant scandal undermines the church’s recognizable form.

Joseph Ratzinger, both as theologian and as bishop of Rome, rearticulated Roman Catholic ecclesiology at and after Vatican II in a way that invites serious Protestant engagement. His communio ecclesiology grounds unity in the Eucharist and the episcopate as a college under a primatial head. In Lumen Gentium the council affirmed that the church of Christ subsists in the Catholic Church, a formula Ratzinger defended as both inclusive and determinate. It recognized ecclesial elements outside Rome’s juridical boundaries, yet maintained that the fullness of catholicity is inseparable from apostolic succession and communion with the successor of Peter. Ratzinger’s insistence on the local church gathered around the bishop as a full embodiment of the church, and the reciprocal relation between local and universal, sharpen the theological grammar of unity against mere federation. He shares with Augustine the conviction that holiness is sacramental consecration. He shares with Ignatius and Cyprian the conviction that episcopal oversight is constitutive of visible unity. His proposal offers Protestants a sophisticated alternative to congregational atomism and a concrete answer to the scandal of denominationalism.

Against Ratzinger I defend a Reformed catholicity. Apostolic succession has evangelical value as a sign of historical continuity and a guard against self-constituted ministries. But as Augustine’s anti-Donatism teaches and as Scripture’s own polemics reveal, succession can hand on error as well as truth. A succession that transmits the apostolic rule of faith, visible in creedal confession and the pure administration of the gospel sacraments, is the heart of apostolicity. Tactile succession without this is defective. Where churches hold the apostolic Scriptures as supreme norm and organize ministry to guard and teach them, there we find apostolicity. The Roman claim that one visible head is necessary confuses the sign with the thing signified. The one head is Christ, who rules through his Word and Spirit. Ordered conciliarity can realize that unity in history. Presbyterian synods and Reformed international assemblies, when acting in obedience to Scripture, are not inferior approximations but alternative instantiations of **conciliarity**.

With these figures framing the tradition, we can specify the content of each Nicene predicate as a visible and eschatological attribute. The church is one because Christ is one. This unity is not an aggregation of voluntary associations but a communion produced by union with Christ through the Spirit. Because of **divine simplicity**, God’s saving action is not partitioned. The one Lord speaks one Word and seals one baptism. The unity becomes visible in common confession, common sacraments, and reconciled oversight. The internal debate pits those who absolutize visibility against those who spiritualize unity. Rome’s external critique against the Reformation is that without a visible head unity is impossible. The Reformed answer is that principled unity is grounded in Christ and expressed through confessions and intercommunion. The invisible-visible distinction is not an escape hatch from the obligation of visible unity but a judgment that imperfect visibility does not nullify the reality of the one church. The contemporary fault line is denominational fragmentation. Here the Reformed must repent of needless divisions and pursue visible reunion by shared creeds and tables where fidelity allows. The objection that such unity reduces to lowest-common-denominator coalitions is answered by the insistence that unity is measured by doctrinal fullness, not by minimal propositions. The Nicene Creed, the ecumenical councils on Christ and Trinity, and the clarity of the gospel in justification and sacramental order are non-negotiable instruments of visible unity.

The church is holy because the Holy One sanctifies a people in truth. Holiness is primarily consecration, then transformation. Augustine’s mixed body guards against Donatist rigor and against modern purity cultures alike. Calvin’s insistence on **discipline** insists that holiness is not vacuous. Discipline is medicinal when it restores and judicial when it must exclude. Internal debates here concern whether holiness can be seen apart from moral conformity. The answer is that moral transformation is a necessary fruit of consecration but not its measure. External critique from free-church purism insists that tolerance of sinners corrupts true holiness. Augustine’s reply remains decisive. The church’s holiness is not compromised by penitent sinners but by a refusal to wield the keys. Contemporary wounds, especially clerical abuse and institutional cover-up, test whether holiness is more than rhetoric. Churches must manifest holiness by transparent processes, by protecting the vulnerable, and by honest repentance. The theological point is that holiness must be sacramentally grounded. A church that refuses to baptize into Christ and to fence the table cannot remain visibly holy.

The church is catholic because the gospel is capacious and determinate. Catholicity is universality across space and time and also wholeness of faith. Cyprian anchored catholicity in sacramental communion across sees. Augustine accented catholicity as the plenitude of charity and truth across the world. Calvin redefined catholicity as evangelical plenitude: wherever the apostolic gospel is not obscured and the sacraments administered, there is the catholic church. Internal debates concern whether catholicity requires a determinate institutional center. The Reformed answer is that it requires determinate content publicly guarded, and ordered councils that bind consciences with the Word. External critique from Orthodoxy charges that without sacramental communion organized around apostolic bishops, catholicity is truncated. The Reformed concede that catholicity needs eucharistic intercommunion and ministerial recognition, which we seek through doctrinal reconciliation and mutual recognition of orders where possible. The contemporary stress is the church’s demographic shift to the global South. This exposes Western parochialism and calls for catholicity as polycentric. The gospel must be confessed in many tongues without relativism. Catholicity requires translating the creedal rule into African, Asian, and Latin American idioms while guarding the same substance. It also requires grappling with racial division and nationalism, for catholicity condemns partiality. A church that segregates itself by tribe denies its own predicate.

The church is apostolic because it stands on the foundation laid by Christ’s apostles. The apostolic canon is closed. Apostolic succession in doctrine is the norm that guards preaching and sacrament against novelty. Ignatius and Cyprian saw apostolicity also as ministerial oversight in historic continuity. Augustine refused to make that continuity a talisman that could guarantee grace apart from truth. Calvin radicalized the point against a corrupted late medieval hierarchy. The internal Reformed debate concerns whether ordination by presbytery without bishops breaks apostolicity. The classical Reformed answer is that apostolicity inheres in the church’s call and authorization of ministers by the Word, not in the number of hands. The external Roman answer, especially in Ratzinger, ties apostolicity to episcopal succession in a college under Peter’s successor as a divinely instituted visible principle of unity. My defense grants the prudential wisdom of continuity of orders yet denies its necessity. Scripture knows succession in faith and teaching. Where episcopal succession transmits the gospel purely, it is a great good. Where it does not, it must be reformed.

This architecture integrates adjacent loci. Ecclesiology is a soteriological extension of Christ’s mediatorial kingship. Through **federal theology**, the covenant of grace forms a people gathered by promise, sealed in baptism, and nourished by the Supper. Pneumatology is decisive, since it is the Spirit who unites us to Christ, convicts, and gives gifts for edification. The doctrine of Scripture shapes apostolicity and preaching. The doctrine of God’s **divine simplicity** underwrites the noncompetitive relation of divine agency and ecclesial form. God’s one action in Christ and by the Spirit establishes a church whose unity and holiness do not depend on human aggregation but are not therefore invisible. Christology frames the body’s unity and sanctity. Soteriology grounds why discipline heals and why justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable in the church’s life.

Internal debates must be confronted directly for an oral defense. First, the two or three marks. Some Reformed identify only Word and sacrament. Others, following Calvin and the Belgic Confession, include discipline. The better account distinguishes esse and bene esse without severing them. The church exists where Word and sacrament are present, yet the continued recognizability of the church as holy communion requires discipline. Second, sacramental locus. The Reformed reject transubstantiation yet maintain **sacramental realism**. The presence of Christ is real and spiritual, not local and corporeal, and the Supper is therefore central to unity. Memorialist reductions destroy visibility of holiness and unity. Third, polity. Presbyterian conciliarity is to be preferred because it operationalizes catholicity and unity without one-man monarchy, yet episcopacy can be embraced where it guards the gospel, and congregational autonomy can be honored where it is tethered to translocal accountability.

External debates clarify what we do not say. We reject Donatist rigor that equates holiness with sectarian purity. We reject liberal ecclesiologies that collapse holiness into moral projects unmoored from consecration. We reject free-church voluntarism that makes the church the product of individual choice rather than divine call. We reject Roman claims that locate the formal cause of unity in papal primacy. But we embrace the insistence that unity and sacrament need visible oversight, that catholicity without shared tables is hollow, and that apostolicity requires more than private interpretation.

Contemporary questions press the marks into new territories. Can there be a digital church. The answer is no if by church we mean the gathered body around Word and sacrament, because the sacraments require embodied presence. Digital tools can serve catechesis and communication, but they cannot substitute for baptismal water or table fellowship. Are multisite video churches legitimate. They risk decoupling pastoral presence from sacramental oversight. A pastor must be present to administer and guard the sacraments and to exercise discipline. How do we square catholicity with confessional clarity. Catholicity demands deep rather than shallow consensus. Shared creed and gospel must be thick enough to ground a common table. On sexual ethics, holiness requires conformity to apostolic teaching on chastity and marriage. A body that repudiates the apostolic judgment cannot claim apostolicity. On women’s ordination, the Reformed family is not uniform. We should distinguish the question of polity from the essence of the marks. Denying women’s ordination does not define holiness; ordaining women does not define apostolicity. The criterion remains fidelity to Scripture and the protection of the church’s sacramental life. The test is whether congregations can remain in communion amid disagreement without violating conscience or obscuring gospel clarity.

Finally, how shall one answer the charge that Protestantism has failed the predicate of unity. We answer by admitting real sin and culpable division. We also answer by appealing to the principled unity grounded in the one gospel and the ancient creeds. Visible unity is to be pursued through mutual recognition of baptisms, shared tables where doctrinal agreement sustains it, and robust councils. There is no necessary contradiction between a pluriform institutional landscape and one church, provided structures remain corrigible under Scripture and oriented to common confession and discipline. The unity of the church is not achieved by managerial consolidation but by the one Shepherd’s voice. Our task is to make that unity visible by humble repentance, doctrinal fidelity, and sacramental communion.

The one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church is therefore not a rhetorical flourish but the substance of the church’s being under Christ. Ignatius reminds us that unity is ordered and sacramental. Cyprian that unity must reconcile and span across sees. Augustine that holiness is consecration amid a mixed body and that charity, not sectarianism, marks catholicity. Calvin that visibility is concretely measured by the **marks of the church** and that discipline preserves holiness. Ratzinger that communion and oversight belong together and that a visible universal form is to be desired. From them we learn to refuse a reduction of unity to organizational chart or to formless spirituality, to bind holiness to sacramental reality and to pastoral courage, to insist that catholicity is truth in many tongues, and to ground apostolicity in the apostolic Word ministered by those lawfully called. This is a position that can withstand cross-examination because it binds every claim back to Christ’s own gifts, the Spirit’s power, and the instruments Christ appointed. It is also a position that calls the church to costly obedience: to recover the table as the place of unity, to repair discipline as the practice of holiness, to widen fellowship across nations without abandoning the apostolic canon, and to reform structures for the sake of one body under one Head until the unity that is ours is fully seen in glory.
