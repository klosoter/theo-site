# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s doctrine of the **Church** is shaped by his eschatological and **trinitarian** vision, emphasizing the **Church as the people of God** constituted by the presence of the **Holy Spirit** and oriented toward the coming **Kingdom of God**. For Moltmann, the marks of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church** are dynamic realities rooted in the Church’s participation in God’s mission and its anticipation of the future.

- "The Church is the people of God in the world, open to the future of the kingdom and to the presence of the Spirit." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

1. **Eschatological Orientation of the Church**
    - The Church is defined by its hope in the **coming Kingdom of God**.
    - Its unity and mission are shaped by anticipation of God’s future.
    - The Church is provisional, always open to renewal and reform.

    - Its unity reflects the unity of **Father, Son, and Spirit**.
    - The Church’s holiness is grounded in the sanctifying work of the **Spirit**.
    - Apostolicity is rooted in the sending mission of the **Son and Spirit**.
    - "The Church is the fellowship of believers in the trinitarian sending of God." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Church as the People of God**
    - The Church is not an institution but a community called and gathered by God.
    - Its **catholicity** is expressed in openness to all peoples and cultures.

    - Its unity is demonstrated through engagement in justice and peace.
    - "The Church exists for the kingdom of God and for the world, not for itself." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

5. **Dynamic and Open Ecclesiology**

    - Its structures are provisional and subject to critique.
    - **Catholicity** means openness to ecumenical fellowship and diversity.
    - Apostolicity involves ongoing faithfulness to the gospel amid changing contexts.

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of the **Church** has profoundly influenced contemporary **ecclesiology**, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. His emphasis on the Church’s eschatological orientation and trinitarian foundation has challenged static, institutional models and encouraged a vision of the Church as a dynamic, open, and mission-oriented community. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theological reflection on the Church’s identity, unity, and public witness in a pluralistic world.
