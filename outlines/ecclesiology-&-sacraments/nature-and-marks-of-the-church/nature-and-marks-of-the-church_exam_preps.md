### TITLE
Visible and invisible, one and divided: reformed ecclesiology under the pressure of the marks

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the Church can be confessed as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic while empirically fragmented, sinful, localized, and historically conditioned, and how the **marks of the Church** identify the true Church without collapsing into sectarianism or indifferentism.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Cyprian, John Calvin, John Owen, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium as conciliar “figure”), Abraham Kuyper.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic catholic ecclesiology, medieval and Roman Catholic ecclesiology, magisterial Reformation with a focus on Reformed **federal theology**, post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy, and modern Roman Catholic ressourcement.
- Debates:
  - Internal: within Reformed and wider Protestantism on visible and invisible church, number and content of the **marks of the Church**, and the relation of church and covenant and sacraments.
  - External: Roman Catholic claims of the Church as a visible, historically continuous society under the episcopate and papacy, Anabaptist and free church critiques of territorial and infant church membership.
  - Contemporary: denominational pluralism, ecumenism, evangelical parachurch phenomena, and questions of digital or “online church.”
- Defended position: A classic Reformed account in which the Church is the one covenant people of God, invisible as the totality of the elect united to Christ and visible as concrete congregations gathered under word, sacrament, and discipline, such that the **marks of true preaching, right administration of the sacraments, and faithful discipline** both identify the true Church and bind believers to visible membership without identifying any one institutional body as simply identical with the body of Christ.

### ESSAY
Any attempt to define the nature and marks of the Church must hold together realities that easily fly apart in abstraction. The Church is confessed as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, yet it appears as a fractured, sinful, historically embedded community. It is the body and bride of Christ, yet its members remain simul iustus et peccator. It is said to be indefectible, yet individual congregations and even whole communions can apostatize. The central conceptual problem is how to relate the Church’s **ontology in Christ** to its empirical visibility and institutional form, and then how to articulate the **marks of the Church** that identify where Christ’s Church is truly present in the world.

The patristic debate already set the basic coordinates. Cyprian of Carthage in the third century, writing in the context of persecution and schism, gave classic expression to the conviction that there is no salvation outside the Church. His formula, extra ecclesiam nulla salus, is not a mere institutional slogan but arises from his conviction that Christ has one body and that the Spirit works through the episcopally governed community that confesses the true faith and maintains unity. For Cyprian, the Church is fundamentally a visibly united body gathered around the bishop as the sign of unity. Schism is not just unfortunate but spiritually deadly, because to separate from the bishop who is in communion with the whole Catholic Church is to separate from Christ himself. One could say that for Cyprian the primary **mark of the Church** is unity under the legitimate episcopate. This leads to a strong identification between visible communion and belonging to Christ.

Yet even within Cyprian’s corpus tensions appear that later theology would develop. Cyprian wrestles with the reality of sinners in the Church, even hypocrites and false confessors. He speaks of the Church containing both wheat and tares, and he is forced to distinguish between the Church as it appears and the Church as God knows it in truth. Although he never formulates a full distinction between visible and invisible Church, the seeds are present. An examiner may press whether Cyprian’s extra ecclesiam maxim can be reconciled with a later Reformed affirmation that many outside any given visible communion may be elect. The answer lies in reading Cyprian’s claim Christologically and sacramentally: salvation is bound to Christ and to the means of grace he has instituted, not to a particular institutional shape abstracted from those means. The later Reformed doctrine of **invisible church** is not a denial but a reframing of Cyprian’s insistence that Christ saves as the head of a body, by his Spirit, through visible ordinances.

Augustine, in the Donatist controversy, provides a decisive deepening. Confronted with a rigorist movement that insisted the Church must be a society of the pure, rejecting the ministry of traditor bishops, Augustine distinguishes sharply between the Church as a mixed body in history and the final eschatological separation of the righteous and the wicked. His exegesis of the parable of the wheat and tares leads him to argue that within the visible Church there are many who are sacramentally united but not spiritually united to Christ, while outside its visible bounds there may be some, like catechumens and even the thief on the cross, who belong to Christ by an invisible bond. Here we see clear movement toward a notion of the **invisible church** as the company of the predestined, known only to God. Augustine’s sacramental theology is crucial: the sacraments are valid ex opere operato, so long as they are performed within the Church, even when administered by unworthy ministers. The **mark of the Church** therefore is not the personal holiness of its officers but the right confession of Christ and the unity of charity under a legitimate ministry.

Augustine’s ecclesiology shows both continuity and contrast with a later Reformed view. On the one hand, his emphasis on the Church as the totus Christus, Christ and his members together, and his insistence on the necessity of the means of grace, set a strong objectivist tone. On the other hand, his doctrine of predestination and his acknowledgment that the true number of the elect is hidden press toward a distinction between the empirical and the spiritual body of Christ. Examined on this point, one must insist that later talk of **visible and invisible church** is an Augustinian development rather than a new invention. The danger in Augustine, realized in later medieval and Tridentine Catholicism, is the reification of the institutional Church as the necessary conduit of grace in such a way that the visible juridical structure comes to be identified with the totus Christus. The Reformed response, following Augustine’s other line, insists on the primacy of Christ’s headship and the Spirit’s freedom, with the institution as genuine but ministerial.

The medieval period, crystallized at Trent but more fully systematized in post-Tridentine theology, defines the Church primarily as a visible, hierarchical society. This tradition will later be reformulated in Vatican II’s Lumen Gentium, which functions as a decisive conciliar “figure” for modern ecclesiology. Lumen Gentium affirms that the Church of Christ subsists in the Roman Catholic Church governed by the successor of Peter and the bishops in communion with him. The Church is described as a sacrament, a sign and instrument of communion with God and unity of the human race. Here the **mark of apostolicity** is structurally tied to apostolic succession of bishops and communion with Rome. Holiness and catholicity are interpreted in terms of the fullness of means of salvation given to the Catholic Church, even while acknowledging elements of sanctification and truth outside her visible structure. The Council also retrieves a more robust theology of the people of God and the laity, complicating a simple institutional reading.

In dialogue with Lumen Gentium, a Reformed candidate must be able to grant the genuine depth of the Catholic understanding of the Church as sacramental mystery while resisting the subsistit in identification. The Reformed will say: the Church of Christ is truly present where Christ is present in word and sacrament by the Spirit, not restricted to one juridically defined society. Apostolicity is fundamentally **doctrinal apostolicity**, faithfulness to the apostolic gospel preserved in Scripture, rather than primarily a chain of ordinations. To the challenge that this makes apostolicity invisible and thus unverifiable, the Reformed respond that apostolic doctrine is historically and textually public and that the **marks of the Church** are precisely those public characteristics that manifest apostolic faith: pure preaching, right sacraments, faithful discipline.

It is with Calvin that these marks receive their classical Reformed formulation. Calvin is the central architect of Reformed ecclesiology. In the Institutes, especially book 4, he defines the Church first as the sum of all the elect, both those now living and those who have gone before, united to Christ as their head. This is the **invisible church**, because its limits are not known to us. Second, he speaks of the **visible church** as the multitude who, by the confession of faith, worship God, attend the word and sacraments, and are externally distinguished from the unbelieving world. While these two are distinct, Calvin insists they are not two churches but two aspects of the one Church considered according to God’s knowledge and our perception.

Calvin’s crucial move is to locate the identification of the visible Church not in institutional continuity as such, nor in the moral purity of its members, but in the **marks**. Wherever we see the word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments administered according to Christ’s institution, there we must not doubt that a Church of God exists. Later Reformed theologians, following Bucer, typically add church discipline as a third mark, integral to the other two. Calvin’s marks function to anchor the Church in Christ’s ordinances. They also regulate Christian judgment in a fallen and divided Christendom. In spite of Rome’s condemnations, Calvin can say that under the papacy there remain “vestiges of the Church” because there is still baptism, Scripture, and some preaching of Christ, but that the marks are so corrupted that reformation is required and separation may be justified.

An examiner will likely probe: does Calvin’s ecclesiology license a voluntaristic or individualistic picking and choosing among communions, since any group that approximates the marks may claim to be a church? Calvin’s own practice in Geneva and his extensive work for unity among the Reformed and Lutherans counter this misreading. The point of the marks is not to encourage fragmentation but to provide a theological criterion for unity and separation. Because Christ has attached his promise to the **means of grace**, believers are bound in conscience to join themselves to those congregations where these ordinances are present in integrity. Conversely, when a communion so corrupts word and sacrament that the gospel is fundamentally obscured, separation becomes obedience to Christ.

John Owen develops Calvin’s insights within a more fully articulated **federal theology**, linking ecclesiology to covenant. For Owen, the Church in its largest sense is coextensive with the new covenant people of God, given to Christ in the covenant of redemption and gathered in time by the Spirit through the covenant of grace. This is the invisible Church comprehending all the elect across history. The visible church, more narrowly, is the company of those visibly separated from the world by profession and ordinance. Owen heightens the emphasis on gathered congregations, arguing that the essence of visible church life is the voluntary covenanting together of believers under Christ’s rule to walk in his ordinances. Here ecclesiology is explicitly federal and congregational.

Owen’s articulation sharpens the question of **church polity** and its relation to the nature and marks of the Church. If the Church is defined as congregations in federal covenant, is presbyterian or episcopal structure essential, beneficial, or indifferent? Reformed orthodoxy generally holds church government to be of divine right in its basic features, especially the office of elder and the connectional nature of churches, but does not make any one polity a mark of the true Church. The marks remain word, sacrament, discipline. Owen is jealous to guard the headship of Christ and the sufficiency of his institutions, wary of any accretions that obscure believers’ direct accountability to the Lord in their congregational covenant. Critics charge that this opens the door to endless splitting over secondary matters. Owen’s own distinction between the esse of the Church and its bene esse is crucial. Certain corruptions destroy the being of a church by overthrowing the gospel; other defects simply impair its well-being. This distinction allows one to affirm true churches in other traditions while still contending for purer forms.

Abraham Kuyper, operating in a post-Constantinian and increasingly pluralistic context, brings Reformed ecclesiology into explicit engagement with modernity. Kuyper distinguishes carefully between institute and organism. The Church as institute is the formal, organized community with officebearers, worship, and discipline. The Church as organism is the totality of believers as they live out their faith in every sphere of life. This distinction allows Kuyper to interpret the **catholicity** of the Church not only in terms of geographic spread but as the pervasive, culture-shaping presence of Christ’s body in the world. It also helps address the paradox of denominational fragmentation alongside real spiritual unity. Believers from different communions may in fact participate in one spiritual organism even while divided institutionally. Kuyper’s thought is often pressed into service to justify the proliferation of denominations and parachurch ministries. A careful reading, however, shows that he maintains the primacy of the institutional Church as the place where word and sacrament are administered, and from which the organic life flows.

Engaging Kuyper also positions one to address contemporary questions of parachurch organizations and so-called “online church.” An examiner might ask whether a digital gathering around a livestreamed sermon and virtual communion could constitute a church. On a Reformed reading shaped by Kuyper and classical doctrine, the answer must be no. The Church as institute requires actual assemblies where word is preached to a gathered people, sacraments are materially administered, and discipline is concretely possible. The Church as organism may certainly make use of digital tools, but the **marks of the Church** presuppose embodied life together. Kuyper’s emphasis on sphere sovereignty and the unique competence of different societal institutions reinforces that parachurch bodies, though valuable, must not supplant the visible church’s centrality.

These historical trajectories converge in the confessional Reformed position, which I defend. The Church is the one covenant people of God, decreed in election, constituted in Christ, gathered by the Spirit through the gospel. As **invisible church**, it is the totality of the elect united to Christ across time and space. As **visible church**, it is the totality of those who profess the true religion together with their children and are gathered in congregations under lawfully called officebearers. The four Nicene marks, one, holy, catholic, apostolic, are ontologically true of the invisible Church and analogically and imperfectly instantiated in the visible. The specifically Reformed marks, pure preaching, right sacraments, faithful discipline, identify where the Church is present as institute. They are not optional ideals but Christ’s own signatures.

Internal debates within Reformed theology refine, rather than overthrow, this structure. There are disputes about whether discipline is a third mark or an aspect of the first two, about whether the visible church is coextensive with the covenant community including all baptized children, and about the relation of local congregations to broader assemblies. Federal theology generally argues that the visible church is the external administration of the covenant of grace, so that baptized but unbelieving members are genuinely in covenant as to its external blessings while lacking its internal substance. This has implications for the holiness of the Church. One must say that the Church is holy in its head and in its consecration, and that its visible holiness is real but mixed and anticipatory. The presence of hypocrites does not negate its holiness but reveals the present eschatological tension.

External debates, especially with Roman Catholic and free church traditions, press the Reformed to clarify the balance of visibility and spirituality. Against Rome, the Reformed deny that the essence of the Church is a legal and hierarchical society under the pope, insisting instead that its essence is union with Christ by the Spirit. But against Anabaptist and sectarian strands, they equally deny that the Church is a voluntary association of the regenerate alone, untethered from visible ordinances and generational inclusion. The Reformed insist that because God ordinarily saves in families and through ordered ministry, the Church must be visible, structured, and generational. To the charge, from free church critics, that this leads to a “mixed multitude” undermining discipline, the Reformed respond that discipline and preaching are precisely designed for such a mixed body. The Church is not the eschatological assembly of the perfectly sanctified but the present arena of God’s saving work.

Contemporary pressures come especially from denominational pluralism and ecumenism. How can one confess one Church while belonging to a particular denomination which at times opposes others? Here the invisible-visible distinction and Kuyper’s organism-institute distinction again prove necessary. There is one invisible Church, and that one Church is really, though imperfectly, present in many communions to the extent that the marks are present. Denominations are not theologically primary; local congregations are. Institutional unity across all Christians is an eschatological hope, not a prerequisite for true catholicity. The Reformed should therefore pursue unity in truth, seeking maximal fellowship where the marks and core confession are shared, while honestly acknowledging continued differences in polity, sacramental theology, and secondary doctrines.

A likely examiner objection will be that this construction relativizes the Nicene marks into the Reformed marks, thereby privileging sixteenth century debates over fourth century confession. The proper response is to insist that the Reformed marks are an exegetical and pastoral unpacking of the Nicene marks. The Church is one, but this oneness is not a bare institutional aggregation; it is the unity of those who hear the Shepherd’s voice in the preaching of his word. It is holy, but its consecration is effected and sustained precisely through the sanctifying use of word, sacrament, and discipline. It is catholic, but its universality actualizes itself concretely through the spread of the same gospel and ordinances to all nations. It is apostolic, but its apostolicity is safeguarded through faithful continuation in the apostles’ doctrine publicly proclaimed and visibly sealed. The Reformed marks thus explicate how the Nicene marks become visible and testable.

Finally, the nature and marks of the Church cannot be treated in isolation from other loci. Ecclesiology is inseparable from Christology and the doctrine of the Spirit, since the Church is the body and temple of Christ, constituted by the Spirit’s indwelling. It is tied to **soteriology**, since there is ordinarily no salvation apart from participation in the Church’s ministry of word and sacrament, though God is not absolutely bound by his means. It intersects with **covenant theology**, since the Church is the historical form of the covenant of grace. And it bears on **eschatology**, since the Church is both the firstfruits of the new creation and the pilgrim people on the way. A robust Reformed account insists that Christ has not left his people without clear signs of his presence. In a fragmented ecclesial landscape, the doctrine of the **marks of the Church** is not sectarian triumphalism but a Christocentric confession: wherever his voice is heard in the gospel, wherever his sacraments are faithfully administered, and wherever his discipline calls sinners to repentance, there he is in the midst of his people, and there is his Church.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Church is the one covenant people of God, as **invisible church** the company of all the elect united to Christ and as **visible church** the concrete congregations of professing believers and their children gathered under word, sacrament, and discipline, where the **marks of the Church** identify Christ’s true presence.
- Decisive figures:
  - Cyprian: stressed visible unity under the bishop and extra ecclesiam nulla salus, prioritizing institutional unity as a key mark.
  - Augustine: articulated the mixed nature of the visible church and the hidden company of the predestined, sowing the seeds of the visible–invisible distinction.
  - Calvin: defined the Church as visible and invisible and classically formulated the marks as pure preaching and right sacraments, with discipline implied.
  - John Owen: developed a federal, congregational ecclesiology, distinguishing esse and bene esse and emphasizing gathered churches under Christ’s headship.
  - Vatican II Lumen Gentium: presented a sacramental, hierarchical view in which the Church of Christ subsists in the Roman Catholic Church, tying apostolicity to episcopal succession.
  - Abraham Kuyper: distinguished church as institute and organism, relating ecclesiology to culture and modern pluralism while retaining the primacy of the instituted means of grace.
- Debates:
  - Internal: precise content and number of the marks, scope of the visible church in relation to covenant and baptism, and the status of other communions as true but less pure churches.
  - External: Roman Catholic identification of the Church with a visible hierarchical society under the pope, and Anabaptist or free church insistence on a purely regenerate voluntary fellowship.
  - Contemporary: how to confess one Church amid denominationalism, how to relate church and parachurch, and whether digital gatherings can count as church in light of the marks.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed ecclesiology in which the one Church is invisible in its full extent but truly and necessarily visible where the **marks of pure preaching, right administration of the sacraments, and faithful discipline** are present, so that believers are bound to visible membership yet no single institutional body can be simply equated with the body of Christ.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How do you reconcile one Church with many denominations? By distinguishing the one invisible Church from its multiple visible instantiations and recognizing true, though imperfect, unity wherever the marks are present.
  - Are the Nicene marks sufficient, or do we need Reformed marks? The Nicene marks state what the Church is; the Reformed marks explicate how that Church becomes publicly identifiable in history.
  - What is the relation of invisible and visible Church? They are not two churches but two aspects of the one Church, according to God’s perfect knowledge and our fallible perception.
  - Why is discipline a mark of the Church? Because without corrective and formative discipline the preached word and administered sacraments cannot be guarded in their purity or effect.
  - Can an online gathering be a true church? No, because the marks presuppose an embodied assembly in which word, sacrament, and discipline are materially and personally enacted.
