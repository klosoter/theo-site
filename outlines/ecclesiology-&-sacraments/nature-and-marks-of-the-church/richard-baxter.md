# Richard Baxter (1615–1691)

Richard Baxter developed a distinctive ecclesiology that emphasized the **visible church**, the necessity of **personal faith**, and the practical outworking of **church unity**. He advocated for a **moderate Puritan** vision, stressing the importance of **gospel preaching**, **discipline**, and **sacramental practice** as marks of the true church, while also seeking to avoid sectarianism and uphold catholicity.

- "The church is a society of men professing the Christian faith, united in the worship of God, and governed by Christ’s laws and officers." (The Reformed Pastor)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - Identifies the **pure preaching of the gospel**, **right administration of the sacraments**, and **faithful exercise of discipline** as essential marks.
   - Stresses that these marks are practical and observable.
   - Argues that the presence of these marks, not perfection, defines a true church.
   - Allows for diversity in secondary matters if the marks are present.
   - "Where these essentials are found, there is a true church, though with many infirmities." (The True and Only Way of Concord)

   - Opposes rigid separatism and urges forbearance on non-essential issues.
   - Seeks a middle way between Anglicanism and Separatism.
   - Promotes cooperation among churches for the sake of the gospel.
   - "We must not unchurch those who differ from us in lesser things." (The True and Only Way of Concord)

   - Asserts that church membership requires a credible profession of faith.
   - Emphasizes the need for personal conversion and holiness.
   - Warns against mere formalism or nominal Christianity.
   - Encourages pastoral oversight to discern genuine faith.
   - "The church must consist of visible saints, not merely of those baptized in infancy." (The Reformed Pastor)

## Legacy and Impact

Baxter’s ecclesiology shaped the **Puritan tradition** and influenced later English Nonconformity, especially in his emphasis on the **visible church** and practical unity. His moderate stance provided a model for evangelical cooperation and tolerance amid post-Reformation divisions. Baxter’s focus on the essential marks of the church and pastoral care continues to inform Reformed and evangelical discussions of church identity and practice.
