# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the **eschatological** and **pneumatological** character of the **Church**, grounding its nature in union with the resurrected Christ and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He affirms the classic **marks of the Church**—the pure preaching of the Word, the right administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline—while highlighting their inseparability from the Church’s identity as the community of the new creation.

- "The church is the eschatological people of God, constituted by the Spirit as the body of the exalted Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Church as the New Humanity: The Relevance of Paul's Ecclesiology" (in The Church and the Bible)
- "The Holy Spirit and the Church" (in The Holy Spirit: Works and Gifts)
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Nature of the Church**
   - The Church is fundamentally shaped by the resurrection and exaltation of Christ.
   - Its existence is defined by participation in the **age to come** through the Spirit.
   - The Church is both a present reality and an anticipation of future consummation.
   - The already/not yet tension is central to its identity and mission.
   - "The church is the community of the new creation, already sharing in the powers of the age to come." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Pneumatological Constitution**
   - The Holy Spirit is the agent who unites believers to Christ and to one another.
   - Spiritual gifts are given for the edification and unity of the body.
   - The Spirit’s presence is the distinguishing mark of the true Church.
   - The Church’s life and ministry are inseparable from the Spirit’s ongoing work.
   - "The Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and his people, and so the church is essentially a Spirit-created community." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Marks of the Church**
   - The pure preaching of the **Word** is foundational to the Church’s existence.
   - The right administration of the **sacraments** signifies and seals union with Christ.
   - **Discipline** preserves the Church’s holiness and visible identity.
   - These marks are not merely formal, but are animated by the Spirit’s presence.
   - "The marks of the church are not external badges but the Spirit’s own means of constituting and maintaining the body of Christ." (The Holy Spirit: Works and Gifts)

4. **Union with Christ**
   - All ecclesiological realities flow from union with the risen Lord.
   - The Church’s identity is derivative of Christ’s person and work.
   - Participation in Christ is both individual and corporate, realized in the Church.
   - The sacraments and Word serve as means of deepening this union.
   - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality from which the church derives its life and mission." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
   - The visible Church is the historical, institutional community of professing believers.
   - The invisible Church consists of the elect, truly united to Christ by the Spirit.
   - This distinction safeguards both the Church’s holiness and its mixed character in history.
   - The marks pertain primarily to the visible Church, but their reality is grounded in the invisible.
   - "The distinction between the visible and invisible church is necessary to account for the church’s present imperfection and eschatological hope." (The Church as the New Humanity)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s ecclesiology has shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by emphasizing the **eschatological** and **pneumatological** dimensions of the Church. His work has influenced debates on the role of the Holy Spirit, the nature of spiritual gifts, and the ongoing significance of the classic marks. By rooting the Church’s identity in union with Christ and the Spirit’s work, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for understanding the Church as both a present reality and an eschatological community. His contributions continue to inform discussions on the nature and mission of the Church within confessional Reformed circles.
