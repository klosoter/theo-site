# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther defined the **Church** as the assembly of believers gathered around the **Word of God** and the **right administration of the sacraments**. He rejected the Roman Catholic identification of the Church with its hierarchical structure, instead emphasizing the **priesthood of all believers** and the centrality of **justification by faith** as marks of the true Church.

- "Thank God, a child of seven knows what the Church is, namely, the holy believers and lambs who hear the voice of their Shepherd." (On the Councils and the Church, 1539)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- On the Councils and the Church (1539)
- The Schmalkald Articles (1537)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church is the congregation of saints**
    - The true Church consists of those who have faith in Christ and are sanctified by the Spirit.
    - Visible membership does not guarantee true participation in the Church.
    - The Church is not defined by institutional structures or papal authority.
    - The invisible Church is known to God alone, but is manifest where the Gospel is rightly preached.
    - "The church is not wood and stone, but the company of believing people." (Sermon on the Misuse of the Mass, 1521)

2. **Marks of the Church: Word and Sacrament**
    - The pure preaching of the **Gospel** is the foremost mark of the Church.
    - The right administration of **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are essential.
    - The marks are external and visible, distinguishing the true Church from false assemblies.
    - The sacraments are effective only when joined to the Word and received in faith.
    - "Wherever you hear or see such a word preached, believed, professed, and acted upon, do not doubt that the true ecclesia sancta catholica, a ‘holy Christian people,’ must be there." (On the Councils and the Church, 1539)

3. **Priesthood of all believers**
    - Every Christian has direct access to God through Christ, without need for priestly mediation.
    - All believers share in the spiritual priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices.
    - The distinction between clergy and laity is functional, not ontological.
    - Ministry is a service of the Word, not a higher spiritual status.
    - "All Christians are truly of the spiritual estate, and there is no difference among them except that of office." (To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, 1520)

4. **Church discipline and the keys**
    - The Church possesses the authority to bind and loose sins through the Gospel.
    - Excommunication is a mark of the Church’s holiness and discipline.
    - The keys are exercised through the proclamation of forgiveness and correction.
    - Discipline serves to preserve the purity of the Gospel and the community.
    - "The keys belong to the whole church and to each of its members, though they are exercised publicly by one person." (On the Councils and the Church, 1539)

5. **Distinction between visible and invisible Church**
    - The visible Church contains both true believers and hypocrites.
    - The invisible Church is the fellowship of the elect, known only to God.
    - Outward forms and ceremonies do not guarantee true membership in Christ.
    - Assurance of belonging to the Church rests on faith in the promises of the Gospel.
    - "Many who are numbered among the people of God are not the people of God." (Lectures on Romans, 1515–1516)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of the **marks of the Church** profoundly shaped Protestant ecclesiology, shifting the focus from institutional continuity to the presence of the **Word and sacraments**. His emphasis on the **priesthood of all believers** democratized spiritual authority and challenged the medieval church’s hierarchical claims. Luther’s teaching continues to inform Lutheran and broader Reformation traditions, providing a foundation for distinguishing the true Church amid visible divisions.
