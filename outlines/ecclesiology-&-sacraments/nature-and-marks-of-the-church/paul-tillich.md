# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich reinterpreted the **nature and marks of the Church** through the lens of his **theological method of correlation** and existential analysis. For Tillich, the Church is the **New Being in Jesus as the Christ**, manifesting the **Spiritual Community** that transcends institutional boundaries, and its marks are dynamic expressions of **reunion with the Ground of Being** rather than fixed institutional attributes.

- "The Church is the actualization of the New Being under the conditions of existence." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Life and the Spirit, History and the Kingdom of God
- The Protestant Era
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as the Spiritual Community**
    - The Church is fundamentally a **Spiritual Community** actualizing the **New Being** in Christ.
    - It transcends denominational and institutional forms, focusing on existential participation.
    - The Church mediates the presence of the **Spirit** in history.
    - Its unity is grounded in the **reunion with the Ground of Being**, not external organization.
    - "The Church is the community in which the New Being is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Dynamic Marks of the Church**
    - Tillich rejects static, institutional marks in favor of existential and spiritual criteria.
    - The true marks are **reunion, healing, and transformation** in the lives of individuals and communities.
    - The Church is marked by its openness to the **Spirit** and its power to overcome estrangement.
    - Institutional forms are secondary and always ambiguous.
    - "The marks of the Church are the manifestations of the New Being in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Protestant Principle and Ecclesial Critique**
    - The **Protestant Principle** insists that no finite form can fully embody the divine.
    - The Church must always be self-critical and open to reformation.
    - Idolatry of the Church as an institution is a constant danger.
    - The true Church is always both visible and invisible, historical and transcendent.
    - "The Protestant principle is the critical element in the Church itself." (The Protestant Era)

4. **Sacraments as Existential Symbols**
    - Sacraments are **symbols** that participate in the reality they signify.
    - They mediate the **New Being** but do not possess automatic efficacy.
    - The sacraments are marks only insofar as they actualize reunion with God.
    - Their meaning is existential, not merely ritual or institutional.
    - "The sacraments are real symbols of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Mission of the Church: Healing Estrangement**
    - The Church’s mission is to overcome **existential estrangement** and alienation.
    - It serves as a community of reconciliation and healing in the world.
    - The Church points beyond itself to the **Kingdom of God**.
    - Its authenticity is measured by its power to transform existence.
    - "The Church is the anticipation of the Kingdom of God in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s theology of the Church challenged traditional **ecclesiology** by emphasizing existential and spiritual realities over institutional forms. His focus on the **Spiritual Community** and the dynamic, transformative marks of the Church influenced later ecumenical and postmodern approaches to ecclesiology. Tillich’s work continues to provoke critical reflection on the relationship between the visible Church and the **Kingdom of God**, especially in contexts of pluralism and secularism.
