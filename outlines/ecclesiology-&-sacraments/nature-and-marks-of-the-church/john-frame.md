# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **nature and marks of the Church** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the interplay of **normative, situational, and existential perspectives**. He affirms the classical **marks of the Church**—**preaching of the Word, administration of the sacraments, and church discipline**—while integrating them within a broader theological framework that stresses the Church’s covenantal identity and mission.

- "The church is the covenant community, the body of Christ, called to worship God and to serve him in all of life." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "Evangelical Reunion: Denominations and the Body of Christ"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Understanding of the Church**
   - The Church is understood through **normative** (God’s Word), **situational** (historical context), and **existential** (personal response) perspectives.
   - Each perspective is necessary for a full understanding of the Church’s identity and mission.
   - The marks of the Church are interpreted through this triadic lens, ensuring theological balance.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in ecclesiology.
   - "We must look at the church from the perspectives of God’s norms, the facts of history, and the needs of people." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Emphasis on the Classical Marks**
   - The true Church is identified by the **pure preaching of the Word**, **right administration of the sacraments**, and **faithful exercise of discipline**.
   - These marks are not merely institutional but are vital signs of the Church’s spiritual health.
   - The marks serve as criteria for evaluating the authenticity of any church body.
   - Frame connects these marks to the Church’s covenantal responsibilities.
   - "The marks of the church are not arbitrary; they are essential to its very nature." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Covenantal Community**
   - The Church is fundamentally a **covenant community** established by God’s sovereign grace.
   - Membership in the Church is defined by covenantal commitment, not merely external association.
   - The Church’s unity and holiness are rooted in its covenant relationship with Christ.
   - The sacraments function as covenant signs and seals within the community.
   - "The church is the people of God, bound together by his covenant promises." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Mission and Worship as Central Functions**
   - The Church exists to **worship God** and to **fulfill the Great Commission**.
   - Worship is both the highest calling and the organizing principle of the Church’s life.
   - Mission flows from the Church’s identity as Christ’s body in the world.
   - The marks of the Church are oriented toward equipping the body for worship and witness.
   - "The church’s mission is to glorify God in worship and to make disciples of all nations." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Unity and Diversity in the Body of Christ**
   - The Church is called to visible **unity** while recognizing legitimate diversity in secondary matters.
   - Denominational divisions are lamentable but not necessarily schismatic if the marks are present.
   - True unity is grounded in shared confession and practice of the marks.
   - Frame advocates for **evangelical reunion** based on core gospel commitments.
   - "Unity in the church is grounded in truth and love, not in mere organizational uniformity." ("Evangelical Reunion")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s **triperspectival** approach has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed ecclesiology, offering a nuanced and integrative framework for understanding the **nature and marks of the Church**. His emphasis on covenant, worship, and mission has shaped discussions on church identity and practice, especially within confessional and evangelical circles. Frame’s work continues to encourage churches to pursue both doctrinal fidelity and practical unity, rooted in the historic marks and mission of the Church.
