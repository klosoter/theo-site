# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **Church** rooted in the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing its visible and invisible aspects, the centrality of the **Word and Sacraments**, and the necessity of **discipline**. He distinguished the **marks of the true Church** as the pure preaching of the **Word**, the right administration of the **Sacraments**, and the exercise of **ecclesiastical discipline**, rejecting Roman Catholic claims of exclusive ecclesial authority.

- "The true church is recognized by the pure preaching of the word, the lawful administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, XVIII.2.11)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 3, Topics XVIII–XX)
- The Doctrine of the Church (sections within Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)
- Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for analysis of Turretin’s ecclesiology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Visible and Invisible Church**
    - The **visible church** consists of all who profess faith and their children, while the **invisible church** comprises the elect known only to God.
    - The visible church is mixed, containing both true believers and hypocrites.
    - The invisible church is the body of the truly regenerate.
    - This distinction guards against identifying the church solely with any external institution.
    - "The church is considered in a twofold manner: either as to the external assembly... or as to the internal and mystical communion of the saints." (Institutes, XVIII.5.1)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The pure preaching of the **Word** is the primary mark.
    - The right administration of the **Sacraments** (Baptism and the Lord’s Supper) is essential.
    - The exercise of **discipline** preserves the church’s purity.
    - These marks distinguish the true church from false or apostate assemblies.
    - "Where these marks are found, there is the true church, even if many corruptions remain." (Institutes, XVIII.2.11)

3. **Rejection of Roman Catholic Exclusivism**
    - Turretin denies that the Roman Church is the only true church.
    - He affirms the possibility of true churches existing outside Roman jurisdiction.
    - The church’s essence is not tied to succession or institutional continuity.
    - The Reformed churches possess the true marks and thus are true churches.
    - "We do not deny the existence of the church outside the Roman communion." (Institutes, XVIII.4.7)

4. **Necessity and Authority of the Church**
    - The church is necessary as the ordinary means of salvation.
    - Christ is the only head of the church; all authority is derived from Him.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial.
    - The church’s teaching must be judged by **Scripture**.
    - "The church is the pillar and ground of the truth, but not its rule or judge." (Institutes, XVIII.6.2)

5. **Unity and Catholicity of the Church**
    - The church is one in essence, though diverse in administration and location.
    - True unity is spiritual, grounded in faith and the Holy Spirit.
    - The catholicity of the church transcends national and denominational boundaries.
    - Visible unity is desirable but not essential for the church’s being.
    - "The church is catholic, not because of external extent, but because of the universality of faith and salvation." (Institutes, XVIII.7.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s doctrine of the **Church** became foundational for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional standards and ecclesiological debates. His careful articulation of the **marks of the church** and the visible/invisible distinction influenced both continental and English-speaking Reformed traditions. Turretin’s polemics against Roman Catholicism provided a lasting framework for Protestant identity and ecclesial self-understanding. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of church purity, authority, and catholicity within the Reformed tradition.
