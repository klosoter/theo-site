# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robustly **Reformed ecclesiology**, emphasizing the **visible and invisible Church**, the **means of grace**, and the **marks of the true Church**. He insisted on the Church’s divine institution, its holiness, and the necessity of **discipline** and **pure doctrine** as essential to its identity and mission.

- "The marks of the true church are the pure preaching of the Word, the due administration of the sacraments, and the faithful exercise of discipline." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Divine Institution**
   - The Church is founded by Christ and not a human creation.
   - Its authority and mission derive from the **Word of God**.
   - The Church is both **visible** (institutional, gathered) and **invisible** (spiritual, elect).
   - The Church’s existence is essential to the outworking of **redemption**.
   - "The church is not a voluntary society; it is a divine institution." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - The pure preaching of the **Word** is central and non-negotiable.
   - The right administration of the **sacraments** is essential.
   - The faithful exercise of **discipline** preserves the Church’s holiness.
   - These marks distinguish the true Church from false assemblies.
   - "Where these marks are present, there is the church of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Means of Grace**
   - The Church is the appointed sphere for the **means of grace**.
   - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are the primary means.
   - These means are effectual only by the **Holy Spirit**.
   - Participation in the means is necessary for spiritual growth.
   - "The means of grace are inseparably joined with the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Necessity of Discipline**
   - Discipline is a mark of the Church’s faithfulness.
   - It preserves doctrinal purity and moral integrity.
   - Discipline is an act of love and restoration, not mere punishment.
   - Neglect of discipline leads to the Church’s decline and confusion.
   - "Discipline is indispensable to the purity and well-being of the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity and Holiness**
   - The Church is called to visible unity in truth and love.
   - Holiness is both positional in Christ and to be pursued in practice.
   - Schism and sectarianism are contrary to the Church’s nature.
   - Unity must never be sought at the expense of **truth**.
   - "Unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God is the goal of the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s ecclesiology has shaped contemporary **Reformed theology**, especially in its emphasis on the **marks of the Church** and the necessity of discipline. His careful articulation of the Church’s visible and invisible aspects continues to influence Presbyterian and confessional traditions. Murray’s insistence on the centrality of the means of grace and the authority of Scripture remains foundational for those seeking a biblically faithful doctrine of the Church.
