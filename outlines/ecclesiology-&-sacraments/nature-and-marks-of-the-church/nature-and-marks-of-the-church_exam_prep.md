### TITLE
Locating the Church: Nicene Attributes, Reformed Marks, and the Visibility of Apostolic Communion

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how to define the Church’s nature and recognize its presence by articulating the relation between the Nicene attributes and the Reformed **marks of the church**, while addressing visibility, apostolicity, and unity amid fragmentation.
- Decisive figures: Cyprian of Carthage; Augustine of Hippo; Martin Luther; John Calvin; Yves Congar.
- Traditions: Patristic ecclesiology shaped by episcopacy and catholicity; Reformation debates on **visible and invisible church** and **means of grace**; Reformed confessional theology; modern Roman Catholic ressourcement and communion ecclesiology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: two versus three marks; visibility and invisibility; the place of discipline; apostolicity as doctrinal succession versus tactile succession; pluriformity versus denominational schism.
  - External: Roman Catholic and Orthodox claims about **apostolic succession** and indefectibility; Anabaptist purity and believers-only membership; charismatic and liberal redefinitions of the Church’s essence.
  - Contemporary: ecumenism, global plurality, digital church claims, multisite structures, parachurch dominance, abuse and discipline crises, and how catholicity functions cross-culturally.
- Position: The Church is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic people gathered by the triune God through the **means of grace**; it is recognized by the pure preaching of the Gospel, right administration of the sacraments, and faithful exercise of discipline, with apostolicity as succession in doctrine and mission under Scripture rather than necessary tactile succession.

### ESSAY
Any adequate account of the Church must hold together ontology and recognition: what the Church is and how it can be located. Scripture names the one body, the temple of the Spirit, the household of God, the assembly called by the Father through the Son by the Spirit’s voice in the Gospel. The Nicene attributes—one, holy, catholic, apostolic—name the Church’s God-given identity. The Reformed **marks of the church**—pure preaching, sacraments rightly administered, and faithful discipline—name how this identity becomes visible and testable in history. The central claim defended here is that these two sets belong together: the Nicene attributes describe the Church’s ends and essence, the Protestant marks provide principled criteria of recognition. This claim depends on a trinitarian ontology of the Church as creature of the Word and Spirit and a refusal to confuse divine and ecclesial being. The triune God is simple, immutable, and perfect. The Church is not an extension of the incarnation but a redeemed assembly created ex nihilo by grace through the **means of grace**, living from Christ’s fullness and ordered by the **office of the keys**. Only on that Creator–creature distinction can the holiness, unity, catholicity, and apostolicity of the Church be confessed without collapsing into ideology.

Cyprian of Carthage’s maxim, “outside the Church there is no salvation,” emerges from a third-century fight for unity. In the context of schisms arising from discipline controversies and rebaptism, Cyprian anchored the Church’s unity in the unity of the episcopate: the bishop in each place presides, but the episcopate is one. His theology framed the Church as a visible, sacramentally constituted communion, where unity with the bishop was unity with the Church. Cyprian’s polemical situation, aiming at consolidating the flock against sectarian fragmentation, pressed him to equate catholic unity with a concrete institutional bond. He sharpened the intuition that the Church’s holiness is derivative of God’s holiness and that sacramental life belongs to the Church’s esse. But his solution tilts toward a unilinear institutional model of apostolicity centered on episcopal communion. In later controversies, this emphasis becomes a pivot for arguments about the visibility and indefectibility of the Church.

Augustine’s engagement with the Donatists reframed the center of the topic. Against a rigorist and purity-centered ecclesiology that made the Church’s holiness rest on the minister’s worthiness and the congregation’s spotlessness, Augustine insisted the Church is a corpus permixtum, a mixed body in saeculo. The holiness confessed is real but eschatologically consummated; now, wheat and tares grow together. Augustine redirected holiness from sociological purity to sacramental economy and charity. Sacraments are valid because their giver is Christ, not the minister, and baptism is indelible because it belongs to Christ’s lordship. Unity is Christological and pneumatic, bound by charity; schism is grave because it wounds charity. By this, Augustine undercut the Donatist logic that made purity the essential mark and formal adherence to a party the criterion of the true Church. His method was anti-reductionist: he read Scripture’s images of the Church canonically, and his polemics forged a grammar for distinguishing the Church’s invisible sanctity and its visible wounds without divorcing them. Augustine thereby prepared the classic Protestant distinction between **visible and invisible church**, though he did not formalize it as later Reformed did. Here a likely examiner’s challenge arises: does the mixed-body thesis relativize holiness? The answer is no. It relocates holiness from sociological perfection to the sanctifying action of the Spirit through the Word and sacraments, yielding a discipline hospitable to penitent sinners and unmasking sectarian rigorism as a refusal of grace. Holiness remains a visible calling, enforced through the **office of the keys**, but its locus is not sectarian withdrawal.

Luther radicalized Augustine’s trajectory by returning to the creative primacy of the Word. The Church, he said, is creatura verbi. Where the Gospel is preached in its purity and the sacraments are administered according to Christ’s institution, there is the Church. Luther’s polemical context against late medieval sacramentalism and papal supremacy structured his ecclesiology: the Church’s visibility is not an institutional glow but the public voice of Christ and his instituted signs. The Augsburg Confession concretized this in its seventh article, identifying unity with agreement in Gospel teaching and sacraments. Luther deployed the distinction between the hidden and the manifest church to guard Christ’s lordship against human usurpation: many gather around external claims, but only where Christ speaks do a people come to be. A classic objection is whether such a view dissolves unity into doctrinal affinity. The Lutheran answer was sacramental and evangelical: unity is not affinity but communion in the preached Gospel and baptismal and eucharistic participation. In this construction, church discipline is present but not elevated to an equal mark. Critics accuse this of laxity. The better reading is that discipline is instrumentally for the Gospel’s clarity, not a third essence alongside Word and sacrament.

Calvin extended and stabilized a Reformed account by integrating Augustine’s mixed-body realism, Luther’s creatura verbi, and a biblical polity of elders. In the Institutes and in his Geneva ministry, Calvin insisted that the Church is our mother, the indispensable locus of ordinary salvation, because there the Spirit unites us to Christ through the preached Word and sacraments. Calvin affirmed the one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church and then asked how, in a world of partial faithfulness, Christ’s flock may recognize Christ’s assembly. His answer was the Reformed **marks of the church**: pure preaching of the Gospel, right administration of the sacraments, and the faithful exercise of discipline. These marks do not create the Church; they disclose it. They are not a Protestant substitute for Nicene notes but the historical instruments by which the Nicene Church is made public. Calvin’s addition of discipline, as compared to the Augsburg Confession, was not moralism but a pastoral necessity explained by Matthew 18 and 1 Corinthians 5. The **office of the keys** opens and shuts by the proclamation of forgiveness and the exclusion of obstinate scandal. Without discipline the sacraments are profaned and the Gospel’s holiness is obscured. Calvin further elaborated the **visible and invisible church** distinction. The invisible Church is the assembly of the elect known infallibly to God. The visible Church is the gathered community professing faith and participating in the **means of grace**. This distinction guards charity and patience toward imperfect congregations while refusing Donatist separation and Roman claims of indefectible institutional identity. A predictable examiner pushback is whether the invisible–visible distinction licenses schism by retreating to an invisible ideal. Calvin’s reply, to be owned here, is that the invisible Church corrects presumption, not obligation. The moral weight rests on the visible Church’s marks. Schism is warranted only when the marks are destroyed. Calvin’s pastoral judgments acknowledged gradations: a congregation may be ailing yet truly church if Word and sacrament remain. Where they are absent or perverted beyond recognition, no mere discipline can compensate; departure is duty.

Yves Congar represents a decisive modern Roman Catholic reframing in ressourcement mode. In works like True and False Reform in the Church and his contributions to Lumen Gentium, Congar reconnected Roman ecclesiology with patristic and biblical sources against an exclusively juridical paradigm. He expanded visibility beyond centralized authority to a communion ecclesiology articulated through the people of God, the collegiality of bishops, and the charisms of the laity. He insisted that apostolic succession is not naked institutional continuity but a sacramental and pneumatic transmission of mission, doctrine, and order. Congar affirmed the Nicene attributes robustly and welcomed ecumenical recognition of the Word’s authority and sacramental life in separated communities, while maintaining that the fullness subsists where tactile succession and Petrine ministry secure unity and indefectibility. He thereby sharpened the external debate: is apostolicity essentially tactile succession or essentially fidelity to apostolic doctrine and mission under Scripture, with succession a prudential but non-necessary form? Congar answered with the former; the Reformed tradition, following Augustine’s relocation of sacramental validity to Christ and Calvin’s graduation of visible assemblies by marks, answers with the latter.

These figures frame three unavoidable debate layers. Within Reformed traditions, there is disagreement over whether there are two or three marks. Some situate discipline in the bene esse, not the esse, of the Church. The position defended here follows Calvin and the Belgic Confession: discipline is of the Church’s esse as a structural orientation to holiness; however, its omission through weakness does not annihilate a church if Word and sacrament remain, though it imperils its well-being. A second internal debate concerns apostolicity. Some within the Reformed world flirt with a soft successionism for ecumenical rapprochement. The better path is to distinguish ministerial succession, which can be a good, from the essence of apostolicity, which is the Church’s submission to the apostolic Gospel in Scripture and her participation in apostolic mission. A third internal debate concerns pluriformity and denominationalism. The pluri-formed visibility of the one Church across denominations is tolerable as an emergency dispersion under providence, not a normative expression of unity. Therefore, confessional convergence and visible cooperation are obligatory goods.

The external debates sharpen recognition and identity. Rome and the East identify apostolicity with tactile succession anchored in episcopal ordination back to the apostles. In reply, the Reformed appeal to Scripture’s own criteria. The apostolic deposit is the normative canon. The pastoral letters require sound doctrine, holy character, and competent teaching for office, not a metaphysical line of ordination. In Acts, apostolic mission produces churches by Word and sacrament; the New Testament shows plurality of presbyters as the ordinary local order. The examiner may object that this undervalues catholic consent. The response is that we honor catholic practice where it aligns with Scripture and recognize tactile succession’s prudential value, but we refuse to turn it into a constitutive essence absent clear biblical warrant. Anabaptist and sectarian critiques press in the other direction, making believers-only purity and disciplinary rigor the central marks. Augustine’s corpus permixtum exposes the theological naiveté here. The wheat–tares parable and Paul’s pastoral letters teach disciplined patience and patient discipline, not perfectionism. Charismatic movements sometimes propose charisms as marks. The New Testament treats gifts as edifying but regulated by apostolic norms, which are public Word, ordered sacrament, and accountable oversight. Liberal ecclesiologies that redefine the Church as a moral community of inclusive love apart from dogmatic truth fail at the first Nicene attribute: unity dissolves without doctrinal bonds.

These debates must be calibrated by the Nicene attributes, lest the marks become procedural checklists detached from teleology. Unity is evangelical and sacramental, not merely organizational. Ephesians 4 binds one body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, God and Father, with ministerial offices given to equip for unity in truth and love. The oneness of the Church is grounded in Christ the head and the Spirit’s one baptism. It expresses itself in shared confession, communion in the Lord’s Supper, and mutual accountability. Holiness is Christ’s gift and command. It is not the absence of sinners but the presence of the sanctifying Word and the corrective ministry of **discipline**. Catholicity is not mere global spread but wholeness of faith and gifts across peoples. Pentecost is the charter of catholicity: one Gospel in many tongues. Apostolicity is the Church’s abiding submission to the apostolic Gospel, guarded by Scripture and confessed in creed, and her participation in apostolic mission. Tactile succession may serve apostolicity but does not constitute it; the apostolicity of a congregation without valid episcopal lines can be real if it clings to the apostolic Word and sacraments, a point recognized implicitly when Rome acknowledges elements of sanctification and truth outside its bounds. The examiner will press whether this reduces apostolicity to mere biblicism. The answer invokes the **means of grace**. Apostolicity here is not just a bookish fidelity but the Spirit’s living voice in preaching and the material obedience of baptism and supper under ordained elders. It is a concrete form of life ordered by the apostolic pattern.

From these anchors, one can adjudicate contemporary questions. Denominational fragmentation is a wound, but not proof of the Church’s nonexistence. The remedy is not romantic centralization but catholic retrieval of creedal orthodoxy, confessional convergence, and sacramental hospitality where conscientious agreement exists. Parachurch influence is legitimate only as diaconal or auxiliary; the Church is not the sum of ministries but the assembly gathered Lord’s Day by Word and sacrament. Multisite and digital “church” claims must be tested by the marks. The Lord’s Supper requires a gathered body and qualified oversight. Virtual observances lack the public, covenantal form of the meal and the Matthew 18 accountability presupposed by the **office of the keys**. The examiner may ask whether persecution and dispersion nullify the Supper’s necessity. The answer returns to order and charity: extraordinary providences may temporarily suspend ordinary means without guilt, but the norm remains embodied assembly under elders. Abuse and discipline crises demand a retrieval of discipline as a mark. The point is not punitive zeal but protection of the weak and the integrity of the sacraments. A congregation that consistently refuses to discipline egregious, unrepentant harm imperils its status as a true church; at minimum it is gravely disordered. Global catholicity complicates recognition. Western questions about polity are not absolute. The marks translate across cultures: preaching in indigenous tongues, local administration of baptism and the Supper, elders equipped to shepherd and correct. Catholics and Orthodox may have stronger historical continuity and sacramental form, but where the Gospel is obscured or made dependent on non-evangelical dogmas, apostolicity is compromised.

This doctrinal construction is not a-human. It flows from Christology and soteriology. Christ is head and mediator of the Church. His threefold office supports the Church’s ministries: prophetic Word, priestly sacrament, kingly discipline. The Spirit who unites believers to Christ is the soul of the Church’s life. The Church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial in the absolute sense. The Church cannot legislate articles of faith; she receives the apostolic canon and confesses it. This protects liberty of conscience and binds conscience only to God’s Word. Here the **Creator–creature distinction** keeps ecclesiology from idolatry. If one asked whether the Church’s unity must take a particular polity form, the reply is that Scripture mandates elders and deacons, preaching and sacraments, discipline and prayer. Whether presbyterial, congregational, or episcopal supra-structures are adopted, the essence is there where these Scriptural realities are enacted. This guards against identifying unity with a single global hierarchy. It also cautions Reformed bodies against absolutizing their own polities as if they were the essence, a recurring temptation that undermines catholicity.

A final series of examiner-style objections press hard. If discipline is a mark, are many Protestant congregations false churches? The answer is to distinguish principle from performance. Discipline is of the essence in principle. Its habitual refusal to address manifest, unrepentant wickedness corrodes the marks. But failures of courage or skill do not immediately erase Word and sacrament. We judge case by case whether the Gospel is still preached and the sacraments are still administered according to Christ’s institution, and whether any formal repudiation of discipline is present. What about “mission” as a mark? Mission is not a separate mark but the outward extension of preaching and sacrament. A church may be small and faithful without an impressive program, but indifference to mission signals a decay in the Gospel itself. Does the invisible–visible distinction excuse private judgment? No. It confronts us with humility while pressing us into visible communion. It forbids absolutizing a party while obligating us to pursue as much visible unity as truth allows. Is “no salvation outside the Church” still tenable? Yes, if properly Augustinian and Reformed: ordinarily God saves in the Church through **means of grace**. God is free, but he has bound us to the Church and its ordinances. Does this make sacraments absolutely necessary for salvation? No, but it makes them necessary for obedience and growth; contempt for the sacraments calls faith into question.

When the dust settles, the nature and marks of the Church stand as a reciprocal pair. The Nicene attributes are not rhetorical flourishes; they specify the Church’s God-given identity. The Reformed marks are not late Protestant inventions to justify separation; they are evangelical criteria that render Nicene identity historically recognizable. Cyprian’s urgency for unity, Augustine’s charity and sacramental realism, Luther’s Word-centered visibility, Calvin’s integrated marks and discipline, and Congar’s communion ecclesiology together map the field on which the doctrine must be defended. The position defended is Reformed and catholic. It refuses a sectarian reduction to purity and a Roman reduction to tactile succession. It answers to Scripture’s economy, protects the poor through real discipline, and invites generous recognition of Christ’s work across polities where Gospel and sacraments remain. It situates the Church within the triune God’s saving action without confusing ecclesial life with the life of God. In short: the Church is the visible assembly of the new covenant, gathered by the living Word and sealed by the sacraments, ruled by Christ through elders, disciplined in hope, and sent apostolically into the world until the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic communion is perfected at Christ’s appearing.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Church is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic people gathered by the triune God through the **means of grace**, made visible where the Gospel is purely preached, the sacraments rightly administered, and discipline faithfully exercised, distinguished yet united as **visible and invisible church**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Cyprian: unity through episcopate; extra ecclesiam; strong visibility.
  - Augustine: corpus permixtum; sacramental realism; unity of charity; anti-Donatist criteria.
  - Luther: creatura verbi; Church located by Gospel and sacraments; discipline instrumental.
  - Calvin: three **marks of the church**; **office of the keys**; graded visibility; apostolicity as doctrinal fidelity and mission.
  - Congar: communion ecclesiology; people of God, collegiality; apostolic succession as sacramental form of fullness.
- Debates:
  - Internal: two versus three marks; status of discipline; apostolicity as doctrine versus tactile succession; pluriformity and denominational wounds.
  - External: Roman Catholic and Orthodox indefectibility via **apostolic succession**; Anabaptist purity ecclesiology; charismatic elevation of gifts; liberal reduction to ethics.
  - Contemporary: ecumenism and confessional convergence; digital and multisite claims; parachurch scope; abuse and the necessity of discipline; global catholicity across cultures.
- Defended position: Reformed and catholic synthesis—Nicene attributes define essence; Reformed marks render it recognizable; apostolicity is succession in doctrine and mission under Scripture, with tactile succession useful but non-essential; discipline belongs to the Church’s esse in principle, with graded judgments in practice.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does invisibility excuse schism? No; it humbles and obligates visible unity measured by the marks.
  - Is discipline a mark of essence or well-being? Essence in principle; its omission gravely disorders but does not instantly nullify a church where Word and sacrament remain.
  - What constitutes apostolicity? Fidelity to the apostolic Gospel and mission under Scripture; succession can serve but does not constitute it.
  - How to evaluate digital “church”? Fails the marks’ gathered, accountable form; extraordinary exigencies do not redefine the norm.
  - Extra ecclesiam—still true? Ordinarily yes; God saves through Churchly **means of grace**; contempt for them imperils faith.
