# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **nature and marks of the Church** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. For Bultmann, the Church is not primarily a visible institution but a community constituted by the proclamation of the **kerygma** and the existential response of faith, rather than by traditional **sacramental** or **institutional** marks.

- "The Church is where the word is proclaimed and heard in faith." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (in "Kerygma and Myth," 1941)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Event of Kerygma**
   - The Church exists where the **kerygma** is proclaimed and received in faith.
   - Community is formed by the existential encounter with the Word, not by institutional continuity.
   - The proclamation of Christ is central, rather than visible structures or sacraments.
   - The Church is a dynamic event, not a static entity.
   - "The Church is not an institution but an event in which the Word is proclaimed." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologization of Ecclesiology**
   - Traditional marks of the Church are reinterpreted through existential categories.
   - Myths about the Church's supernatural character are to be understood existentially.
   - The Church's reality is not in its outward form but in the faith-response it evokes.
   - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind ecclesial language.
   - "Demythologizing does not destroy the message but discloses its existential truth." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Existential Faith as the Mark of the Church**
   - The true mark of the Church is the individual's response of faith to the kerygma.
   - Faith is an existential decision, not a doctrinal assent or sacramental participation.
   - The Church is the fellowship of those who live authentically in response to God's call.
   - Institutional or sacramental marks are secondary to the existential encounter.
   - "Faith is not assent to doctrine but an existential self-understanding." ("Faith and Understanding")

4. **Rejection of Institutionalism**
   - The visible, organized Church is a secondary phenomenon.
   - Institutional forms can obscure the existential reality of the Church.
   - True community is spiritual, not organizational.
   - The Church's authority is grounded in the Word, not in hierarchy or tradition.
   - "The Church is not to be identified with any historical or institutional form." ("Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting")

5. **Proclamation over Sacrament**
   - The proclamation of the Word is primary; sacraments are interpreted existentially.
   - Sacraments are meaningful only as expressions of faith, not as objective means of grace.
   - The Church's life centers on preaching, not ritual.
   - The marks of the Church are dynamic acts of proclamation and response.
   - "The sacraments have meaning only as expressions of the faith awakened by the Word." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to the **nature and marks of the Church** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and **ecclesiology**. His emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential response of faith challenged traditional views of the Church as a visible institution. While his demythologizing project remains controversial, Bultmann’s work continues to shape discussions about the Church’s identity in a secular age, especially among those seeking to reconcile Christian faith with modern existential concerns.
