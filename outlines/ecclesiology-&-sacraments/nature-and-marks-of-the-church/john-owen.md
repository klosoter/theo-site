# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen articulated a robust doctrine of the **Church** grounded in **covenant theology**, emphasizing the visible and invisible aspects of the Church and the necessity of **regenerate membership**. He identified the **marks of the true Church** as the pure preaching of the **Word**, right administration of the **sacraments**, and the exercise of **discipline**, all under the headship of **Christ**.

- "The Lord Christ hath instituted no church-state, no church-order, no church-officer, no church-rule, but what is appointed in the Scripture." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Key Works

- The True Nature of a Gospel Church and Its Government
- Of Schism
- The Nature, Power, Deceit, and Prevalency of Indwelling Sin in Believers
- The Works of John Owen, Vol. 15: Church Purity and Unity
- Communion with God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as a Congregation of Visible Saints**
   - The church consists of those who make a credible profession of faith.
   - Membership is not merely external but requires evidence of **regeneration**.
   - The local congregation is the primary manifestation of the church.
   - Separation from the world is essential for the church’s purity.
   - "The church is a society of men called out of the world, or their natural worldly state, by the preaching of the word, to the obedience of faith." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

2. **Christ’s Headship and Authority**
   - Christ alone is the head of the church, ruling by his Word and Spirit.
   - All church power is ministerial and derived from Christ.
   - Human traditions or inventions have no binding authority in the church.
   - Church officers serve as under-shepherds, not lords over the flock.
   - "There is no head of the church but Christ, nor any lawgiver but him." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

3. **Marks of the True Church**
   - Pure preaching of the **Word** is essential for the church’s existence.
   - Right administration of the **sacraments** distinguishes the true church.
   - **Church discipline** maintains purity and order.
   - Unity is grounded in truth, not mere outward conformity.
   - "Where these things are wanting, there is no church of Christ." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

4. **Necessity of Church Discipline**
   - Discipline is a mark of a true church and a means of preserving holiness.
   - It is exercised according to the rule of Scripture, not human preference.
   - Discipline aims at restoration, not mere punishment.
   - The church must guard against both laxity and tyranny in discipline.
   - "Discipline is the power of Christ for the preservation of his institutions in their purity." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

5. **Covenantal Foundation of the Church**
   - The church is constituted by God’s covenant of grace.
   - Membership and privileges are grounded in covenant promises.
   - The ordinances of the church are covenantal signs and seals.
   - The church’s unity is rooted in shared participation in the covenant.
   - "The foundation of the church is laid in the covenant of God." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s ecclesiology profoundly shaped **Reformed and Congregationalist** understandings of the church, especially regarding the necessity of **regenerate membership** and the centrality of Christ’s headship. His articulation of the **marks of the church** remains influential in discussions of church purity and discipline. Owen’s insistence on biblical warrant for all aspects of church life continues to inform debates on church government and practice within the broader Reformed tradition.
