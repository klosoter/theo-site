   - The Church is constituted by the sovereign work of **Christ** through the **Word** and **Spirit**.
   - The Church’s existence and identity are not human constructs but divine acts.
   - The Spirit applies the redemptive work of Christ to gather and sustain the Church.
   - The Church is both visible and invisible, united by faith in Christ.
   - "The church is the fruit of the Spirit’s ministry, not of human ingenuity." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Centrality of the Preaching of the Word**
   - The faithful preaching of **Scripture** is the primary mark of the true Church.
   - The Word creates, nourishes, and governs the Church.
   - Preaching is the means by which Christ rules his people.
   - The Church’s health and growth depend on the centrality of the Word.
   - "Where the Word is truly preached, Christ is truly present among his people." (Devoted to God's Church)

3. **Right Administration of the Sacraments**
   - The sacraments are visible signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are instituted by Christ for the Church’s edification.
   - Proper administration of the sacraments is essential to the Church’s identity.
   - The sacraments must be joined to the preaching of the Word.
   - "The sacraments are Christ’s gifts to his church, confirming his promises to his people." (The Christian Life)

4. **Practice of Church Discipline**
   - Discipline is a mark of the true Church, preserving its purity and witness.
   - Discipline is exercised in love, aiming at restoration and holiness.
   - The authority for discipline comes from Christ, mediated through the Church.
   - Discipline protects the Church from doctrinal and moral error.
   - "Discipline is not an optional extra, but an expression of Christ’s care for his flock." (Devoted to God's Church)

5. **Unity and Holiness of the Church**
   - The Church is called to manifest **unity** as the body of Christ.
   - Holiness is both a gift and a calling for the Church.
   - The unity of the Church is grounded in union with Christ, not mere institutional uniformity.
   - The Church’s holiness is visible in its doctrine, worship, and life.
   - "The church’s unity and holiness are rooted in her union with Christ and her calling to reflect his character." (The Holy Spirit)
