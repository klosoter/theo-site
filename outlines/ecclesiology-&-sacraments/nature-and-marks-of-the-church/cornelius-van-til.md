# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **nature and marks of the Church** through the lens of **Reformed ecclesiology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the Church as the covenant community grounded in the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**, marked by the faithful preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline. For Van Til, the Church’s identity and purity are inseparable from its **confessional fidelity** and antithesis to non-Christian thought.

- "The church is the body of Christ, called out of the world and set apart to be the instrument through which God’s redemptive revelation is made manifest." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Covenant Community**
   - The Church is constituted by God’s sovereign initiative in **covenant grace**.
   - Membership is defined by union with Christ, not merely external association.
   - The Church stands as the visible manifestation of the **kingdom of God** in history.
   - The covenant structure shapes the Church’s worship, discipline, and mission.
   - "The church is the covenant people of God, set apart by his sovereign grace." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - The **pure preaching of the Word** is central and non-negotiable.
   - Right administration of the **sacraments** is essential for ecclesial identity.
   - The exercise of **church discipline** preserves the Church’s holiness and witness.
   - These marks are grounded in Scripture and not in human tradition.
   - "Where the Word is not purely preached, there the church does not exist in its true sense." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Antithesis and Confessional Identity**
   - The Church is defined by its antithesis to the world’s unbelieving systems.
   - Confessional standards serve as a bulwark against theological compromise.
   - The Church’s identity is maintained through doctrinal fidelity and separation from error.
   - The antithesis is not merely ethical but epistemological, rooted in **presuppositional truth**.
   - "The church must always be self-consciously confessional, standing over against the world." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Authority of Scripture in the Church**
   - The Church’s life and doctrine are normed by the **self-attesting Word of God**.
   - Scripture is the ultimate standard for faith, practice, and ecclesiastical order.
   - Human authority in the Church is always ministerial, never magisterial.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture undergirds the Church’s purity and unity.
   - "The church must ever be reformed according to the Word of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetic Witness of the Church**
   - The Church’s existence is itself an apologetic for the truth of Christianity.
   - Corporate worship and discipline display the reality of God’s redemptive work.
   - The Church must engage the world with a **presuppositional defense** of the faith.
   - The unity and holiness of the Church serve as a testimony to the gospel’s power.
   - "The church is called to give a reason for the hope that is in her, always in submission to Christ as Lord." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **nature and marks of the Church** reinforced a robustly confessional and antithetical ecclesiology within the Reformed tradition. His insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the necessity of doctrinal fidelity shaped generations of Reformed theologians and church leaders. Van Til’s integration of apologetics and ecclesiology continues to influence discussions on the Church’s identity, purity, and mission in a pluralistic world.
