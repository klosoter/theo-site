# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Church** centers on its dual nature as both a visible institution and an invisible community of the **elect**. He emphasized the **marks of the Church**—notably unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity—while insisting that the true Church is ultimately defined by **communion with Christ** and the presence of the **Holy Spirit** rather than mere external membership.

- "Many sheep are without, many wolves are within." (Sermon 23)

## Key Works

- On the Unity of the Church (De unitate ecclesiae)
- City of God (De civitate Dei)
- On Baptism, Against the Donatists (De baptismo contra Donatistas)
- Sermons (various, especially on the Psalms and John)
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as a Mixed Body**
    - The visible Church contains both **wheat and tares**, righteous and unrighteous.
    - True membership is ultimately known only to God, not to human observers.
    - The presence of sinners does not invalidate the Church’s authenticity.
    - The Church’s holiness is grounded in Christ, not in the moral perfection of its members.
    - "The Church is not destroyed by the evil, nor is it made up only of the good." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

2. **Unity as a Mark of the Church**
    - The Church’s unity is rooted in **Christ** as its head.
    - Schism and division are grave sins against the body of Christ.
    - Unity is expressed in common faith, sacraments, and ecclesiastical structure.
    - The Donatist controversy sharpened Augustine’s insistence on visible unity.
    - "He cannot have God for his Father who refuses to have the Church for his mother." (Sermon 214)

3. **Catholicity and Apostolicity**
    - The Church is **catholic**: universal in scope and mission.
    - Apostolic succession and teaching are essential to the Church’s identity.
    - The true Church is found where apostolic doctrine and sacramental life are preserved.
    - Catholicity is a mark distinguishing the true Church from schismatic groups.
    - "The Church is called catholic because it is spread throughout the whole world." (City of God)

4. **Holiness Rooted in the Spirit**
    - The Church is holy by virtue of the **Holy Spirit’s** indwelling.
    - Holiness is both a present reality and an eschatological hope.
    - The sacraments are means by which the Spirit sanctifies the Church.
    - The Church’s holiness is not negated by the presence of sinners within.
    - "The Church is holy, even while in this world she contains sinners." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

5. **Sacramental Life and the Church**
    - The sacraments, especially **baptism** and the **Eucharist**, are central to the Church’s life.
    - Validity of sacraments does not depend on the moral state of the minister.
    - Sacramental participation is a mark of belonging to the visible Church.
    - The sacraments are signs of the Church’s unity and means of grace.
    - "The sacraments are holy, even when ministered by the unworthy." (On Baptism, Against the Donatists)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Church** profoundly shaped Western ecclesiology, especially regarding the distinction between the visible and invisible Church. His articulation of the **marks of the Church**—unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity—became foundational for later Christian thought. Augustine’s responses to the Donatist controversy established enduring principles for understanding schism, sacramental validity, and the Church’s mixed nature, influencing both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions.
