# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the **nature and marks of the Church** by grounding them in the shared experience of **religious consciousness** and the communal life of faith. He emphasized the Church as a living fellowship united by the **feeling of absolute dependence** on God, rather than by external marks or institutional structures. For Schleiermacher, the Church is fundamentally a spiritual community, shaped by the inner life of its members.

- "The church is the fellowship of those who are conscious of being in a state of redemption through Christ." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- "The Christian Faith" (Der christliche Glaube)
- "On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers"
- "Brief Outline of the Study of Theology"
- "Christian Ethics"
- Wilhelm Pauck, "The Theology of Schleiermacher: A Condensed Presentation of His Chief Work"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Community of Religious Consciousness**
   - The Church is constituted by the shared **God-consciousness** among believers.
   - It is not primarily an institution but a spiritual fellowship.
   - The unity of the Church arises from the common experience of redemption.
   - The Church is the highest form of religious community, distinct from the state.
   - "The essence of the Church is the fellowship of the Spirit." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Marks of the Church are Spiritual, Not Institutional**
   - Traditional external marks (e.g., sacraments, preaching) are secondary.
   - The true mark is the inward experience of faith and dependence on God.
   - Institutional forms serve the spiritual life but do not define the Church.
   - The Church's boundaries are fluid, shaped by the presence of living faith.
   - "The church is not defined by external organization, but by the spirit that animates it." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Primacy of the Feeling of Absolute Dependence**
   - The core of Christian life is the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
   - This feeling unites believers and forms the basis of the Church.
   - The Church nurtures and expresses this fundamental religious consciousness.
   - The marks of the Church are thus experiential and inward.
   - "The feeling of absolute dependence is the basis of all true church life." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Dynamic and Historical Development of the Church**
   - The Church evolves historically as the expression of Christian consciousness changes.
   - No fixed institutional form is essential to its identity.
   - The marks and nature of the Church adapt to new contexts and cultures.
   - The Church is always in process, shaped by the Spirit in history.
   - "The church is a living organism, ever developing in the course of history." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Church as the Bearer of Redemption**
   - The Church exists to mediate and communicate redemption to its members.
   - It is the community where the consciousness of redemption is fostered.
   - The Church's practices and teachings serve to deepen the sense of salvation.
   - The marks of the Church are those elements that nurture the redeemed life.
   - "The church is the community of the redeemed, in which redemption is realized and extended." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s conception of the **Church** as a spiritual community profoundly influenced modern Protestant ecclesiology, shifting focus from institutional structures to the inner life of faith. His emphasis on **religious experience** and the dynamic, historical nature of the Church paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies. While criticized by some for neglecting traditional marks, his thought remains foundational for understanding the Church as a living, evolving fellowship grounded in shared consciousness of God.
