# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of the **Church** rooted in the Reformed tradition. They emphasize the **marks of the true Church** as the pure preaching of the **Gospel**, the proper administration of the **sacraments**, and the exercise of **church discipline**, distinguishing the true Church from false assemblies.

- "The marks by which the true Church is known are these: if the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised in punishing of sin." (Belgic Confession, Article 29)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 27–29
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 54–56
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads of Doctrine V
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic**
   - The Church is a **spiritual body** gathered by Christ from all times and places.
   - It is **holy** because it is sanctified by the Spirit and set apart for God.
   - The **catholicity** of the Church transcends ethnicity, language, and geography.
   - The Church is **apostolic** in doctrine, holding to the teaching of the apostles.
   - "This holy Church is preserved or supported by God against the rage of the whole world." (Belgic Confession, Article 27)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - The **pure preaching of the Gospel** is essential for the Church’s identity.
   - The **right administration of the sacraments** as instituted by Christ is required.
   - The **exercise of church discipline** maintains holiness and order.
   - These marks distinguish the true Church from sects or false churches.
   - "As for those who are of the Church, we may know them by the marks of Christians." (Belgic Confession, Article 29)

3. **Distinction Between True and False Church**
   - The true Church submits to the authority of Christ and His Word.
   - False churches **reject the Gospel** and corrupt the sacraments.
   - The true Church is recognized by its **faithfulness to the marks**.
   - Believers are called to **separate from false churches**.
   - "We believe, since this holy congregation is an assembly of those who are saved, and that out of it there is no salvation." (Belgic Confession, Article 28)

4. **The Communion of Saints**
   - All believers are members of Christ and share in His gifts.
   - The Church is a **fellowship** where members serve and support one another.
   - Mutual edification and love are essential to the Church’s life.
   - The communion of saints is grounded in union with Christ.
   - "Each one must feel himself bound to use his gifts readily and cheerfully for the advantage and welfare of other members." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 55)

5. **Church Discipline as a Mark of the Church**
   - Discipline preserves the **purity** and witness of the Church.
   - It is exercised with the goal of repentance and restoration.
   - Discipline is a means of guarding the sacraments and doctrine.
   - The absence of discipline is a sign of a false church.
   - "Church discipline is exercised in punishing of sin." (Belgic Confession, Article 29)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the doctrine of the Church in the continental Reformed tradition, providing a clear and enduring standard for identifying the **marks of the true Church**. Their articulation of the Church’s nature and boundaries has influenced Reformed confessional identity and ecumenical dialogue. These documents continue to serve as foundational confessions for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring doctrinal fidelity and unity.
