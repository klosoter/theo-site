# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner viewed the **Church** as a dynamic, spiritual fellowship grounded in the proclamation of the **Word of God** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. He rejected institutionalism and emphasized the Church’s existence as a community of faith, where the **marks of the Church** are found in the authentic preaching of the gospel and the right administration of the **sacraments**.

- "Where the Word is truly preached and the Sacraments are rightly administered, there is the Church." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

## Key Works

- The Misunderstanding of the Church (1952)
- Dogmatics, Vol. III: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (1962)
- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Event of Encounter**
    - The Church exists where there is a genuine encounter between God and humanity through the **Word**.
    - The Church is not primarily an institution but a living fellowship created by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - The community is constituted by faith, not by external organization.
    - The Church is always provisional, dependent on the ongoing action of God.
    - "The Church is not an institution, but an event—the event of the encounter between God and man." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

2. **Primacy of the Word of God**
    - The true Church is marked by the authentic proclamation of the **Word of God**.
    - The Word creates and sustains the Church, not vice versa.
    - Preaching is central, as it mediates the presence of Christ to the community.
    - The authority of the Church derives from its faithfulness to the Word.
    - "The Church is the place where the Word of God is truly preached." (Dogmatics III)

3. **Right Administration of the Sacraments**
    - The sacraments are visible signs of the invisible grace and presence of Christ.
    - Proper administration of **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** is essential to the Church’s identity.
    - Sacraments must be joined to the Word and received in faith.
    - The sacraments are not magical but are effective through the Spirit’s work in the believing community.
    - "Where the sacraments are rightly administered, there is the Church." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

4. **Rejection of Institutionalism**
    - The Church is not defined by hierarchy, tradition, or external organization.
    - Institutional forms are secondary and always subject to reform.
    - The essence of the Church is spiritual, not organizational.
    - The Church must always be vigilant against becoming a mere religious society.
    - "The Church is always in danger of becoming an institution and losing its true character." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

5. **Unity and Fellowship in the Spirit**
    - The Church is a fellowship (koinonia) of believers united by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - True unity is spiritual, not merely organizational or doctrinal.
    - Diversity within the Church is to be embraced as part of its spiritual reality.
    - The Church’s unity is grounded in Christ, not in human agreement.
    - "The unity of the Church is the unity of the Spirit, not of the institution." (Dogmatics III)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **Church** challenged both Protestant and Catholic institutionalism by insisting on the primacy of the **Word** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** in constituting the Church. His emphasis on the Church as a spiritual fellowship influenced later ecumenical discussions and the renewal of ecclesiology in the twentieth century. Brunner’s thought continues to provoke debate about the relationship between the visible and invisible Church, and the true **marks of the Church** in a secular age.
