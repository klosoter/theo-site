# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a covenantal and Reformed doctrine of **baptism**, emphasizing it as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**. They uphold the legitimacy of **infant baptism**, stress the necessity of faith and the **Holy Spirit** for efficacy, and maintain that the sacrament is to be administered only once.

- "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered." (Westminster Confession of Faith 28.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 28: "Of Baptism"
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Q&A 165–167
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q&A 94–95
- The Directory for the Publick Worship of God (sections on baptism)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on sacraments)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Covenant Sign and Seal**
    - Baptism is instituted by Christ as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**.
    - It signifies union with Christ, regeneration, and the promise of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Marks entrance into the visible church and distinguishes the recipient from the world.
    - The benefits signified are received by faith, not automatically conferred.
    "Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ... to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace." (WCF 28.1)

2. **Infant Baptism is Scriptural and Necessary**
    - Children of believing parents are included in the covenant and should be baptized.
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign for believers and their offspring.
    - The efficacy of baptism does not depend on the recipient’s age or understanding.
    - Refusal to baptize covenant children is a serious neglect of God’s ordinance.
    "Not only those that do actually profess faith... but also the infants of one, or both, believing parents, are to be baptized." (WCF 28.4)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Not Essential**
    - The outward element is water, administered in the name of the **Trinity**.
    - Pouring, sprinkling, or immersion are all considered valid modes.
    - The mode is less important than the spiritual reality signified.
    - The Standards explicitly reject the necessity of immersion.
    "Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but baptism is rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person." (WCF 28.3)

4. **Efficacy Depends on the Holy Spirit and Faith**
    - Baptism does not automatically regenerate or save.
    - Its efficacy is tied to the work of the **Holy Spirit** and the faith of the recipient.
    - The grace promised is not inseparably connected to the time of administration.
    - Baptism is a means of grace, but not all who are baptized receive the benefits.
    "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered." (WCF 28.6)

5. **Baptism is to be Administered Once**
    - Baptism is a one-time sacrament and must not be repeated.
    - Re-baptism is unnecessary and contrary to the unity of the sacrament.
    - The validity of baptism does not depend on the character of the minister.
    - Those baptized in the name of the **Trinity**, even outside Reformed churches, are not to be rebaptized.
    "The sacrament of baptism is but once to be administered unto any person." (WCF 28.7)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian understandings of **baptism**, providing a covenantal rationale for **infant baptism** and a nuanced view of sacramental efficacy. Their articulation of the mode and meaning of baptism has influenced confessional documents and church practices worldwide. The Standards remain a foundational reference for debates on baptism within the broader Reformed tradition.
