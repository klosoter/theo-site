# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **baptism** within a broadly **Reformed** framework, emphasizing its role as a **covenant sign** and its connection to the visible church. He affirms both **infant** and **believer’s baptism** as legitimate, focusing on the unity of the covenant community and the symbolic efficacy of the sacrament rather than the precise mode. Frame stresses that baptism’s efficacy is not automatic but is tied to **God’s promises** and the faith of the recipient or their covenant community.

- "Baptism is a sign and seal of God’s covenant, not a guarantee of regeneration." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief" (2013)
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life" (2008)
- "The Doctrine of God" (2002)
- "Baptism in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church" (OPC pamphlet)
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology" (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Covenant Sign and Seal**
    - Baptism marks entrance into the visible **covenant community**.
    - It signifies God’s promises to believers and their children.
    - The sacrament points to the cleansing from sin and union with Christ.
    - Baptism is not a guarantee of salvation but a means of grace.
    - "Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant, not an infallible mark of election." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Legitimacy of Infant and Believer’s Baptism**
    - Frame supports both **paedobaptism** and **credobaptism** as biblically defensible.
    - He emphasizes the continuity of the covenant across Old and New Testaments.
    - The children of believers are included in the covenant and should receive the sign.
    - Believer’s baptism is appropriate for those coming to faith later in life.
    - "Both infant and believer’s baptism are valid expressions of covenant theology." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Mode of Baptism is Non-Essential**
    - Frame argues that the New Testament does not mandate a single mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling).
    - The focus is on the meaning, not the mechanics, of the sacrament.
    - He acknowledges historical diversity in practice within the church.
    - The essential element is the application of water in the name of the Trinity.
    - "Scripture does not prescribe a particular mode of baptism; the meaning is primary." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Efficacy Tied to God’s Promise and Faith**
    - Baptism’s efficacy is not automatic or ex opere operato.
    - The sacrament is effective as a means of grace when received in faith.
    - God’s promise is objectively present, but subjective benefit depends on faith.
    - Baptism calls for a response of trust and obedience from the recipient or their family.
    - "The efficacy of baptism is tied to God’s promise and the faith of the recipient." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Baptism and Church Membership**
    - Baptism is the rite of initiation into the visible church.
    - It marks a person as part of the covenant people, with privileges and responsibilities.
    - Frame links baptism closely to church discipline and the Lord’s Supper.
    - He stresses the communal and ecclesial dimensions of the sacrament.
    - "Baptism is the doorway to the visible church and its fellowship." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **baptism** has influenced contemporary Reformed and evangelical discussions by emphasizing the covenantal and ecclesial dimensions of the sacrament. His willingness to recognize both infant and believer’s baptism as valid has fostered greater unity among Reformed and Presbyterian churches. Frame’s focus on the **means of grace** and the non-automatic efficacy of baptism has shaped pastoral practice and theological education, particularly within confessional Reformed circles. His work continues to be a resource for those seeking a balanced, biblically grounded understanding of baptism’s role in the life of the church.
