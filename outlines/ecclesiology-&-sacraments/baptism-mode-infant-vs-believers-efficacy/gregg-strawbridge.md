# Gregg Strawbridge (1966–2020)

Gregg Strawbridge was a leading advocate for **paedobaptism** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the continuity of the **covenant of grace** and the inclusion of believers’ children in the visible church. He argued that **baptism** is a covenantal sign grounded in God’s promise, not merely a testimony of individual faith, and that its efficacy is rooted in the covenant rather than the act itself.

- "Baptism is not a sign of our faith, but of God’s promise in the covenant." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

## Key Works

- "The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism" (editor and contributor)
- "Infant Baptism: How My Mind Has Changed" (essay)
- "Baptism and the Covenant of Grace" (conference lectures)
- "The Biblical Case for Infant Baptism" (audio and print resources)
- "Covenant and Baptism" (various articles and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Covenant Initiation**
    - Baptism marks entrance into the visible **covenant community**.
    - It parallels **circumcision** as the Old Testament sign of the covenant.
    - The sign is applied to believers and their children, based on covenant continuity.
    - Baptism signifies God’s promise, not the recipient’s subjective faith.
    "Baptism is the new covenant sign and seal, just as circumcision was in the old covenant." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

2. **Infant Baptism is Biblically Mandated**
    - The household baptisms in Acts and the Epistles support the inclusion of children.
    - The Abrahamic covenant’s promise to children is not revoked in the New Testament.
    - Jesus’ welcome of children and Paul’s teaching on holy children affirm their inclusion.
    - The burden of proof lies on those who would exclude children from the sign.
    "Nowhere does the New Testament revoke the inclusion of children in the covenant." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

3. **Mode of Baptism: Pouring or Sprinkling**
    - The Greek term "baptizo" allows for modes other than immersion.
    - Old Testament ritual washings and prophetic imagery favor pouring/sprinkling.
    - The emphasis is on the meaning, not the quantity of water.
    - Early church practice included non-immersion modes.
    "The mode of baptism is not prescribed as immersion, but as a washing with water." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

4. **Efficacy is Covenantal, Not Automatic**
    - Baptism does not regenerate or guarantee salvation ex opere operato.
    - It confers covenantal privileges and responsibilities.
    - The efficacy of baptism is tied to faith, but not limited to the moment of administration.
    - Baptism is a means of grace, not a mechanical cause of regeneration.
    "Baptism is effectual as a means of grace, but not in a mechanical or automatic sense." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

5. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The covenant of grace is one throughout redemptive history.
    - The administration of the sign changes, but the substance remains.
    - Both Old and New Testament believers are saved by faith in Christ.
    - The inclusion of children is a mark of covenant continuity.
    "The unity of the covenant of grace demands the inclusion of believers’ children in the sign." ("The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism")

## Legacy and Impact

Strawbridge’s advocacy for **covenantal infant baptism** has shaped contemporary Reformed and Presbyterian discussions, especially in dialogue with **Baptist** traditions. His editorial and teaching work provided accessible, robust defenses of paedobaptism, influencing pastors, scholars, and laypeople. By emphasizing the biblical and theological foundations of baptism’s mode, subjects, and efficacy, Strawbridge contributed to renewed appreciation for the covenantal structure of Reformed theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing debates over baptism within evangelical and Reformed circles.
