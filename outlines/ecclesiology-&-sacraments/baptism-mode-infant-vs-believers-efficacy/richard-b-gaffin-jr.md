# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **baptism** through the lens of **union with Christ**, emphasizing its role as a sign and seal of the benefits of **redemption** applied by the **Holy Spirit**. He affirms **infant baptism** within the covenantal framework, while maintaining that the efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of administration but to the sovereign work of God. Gaffin upholds the Reformed understanding that baptism signifies both **regeneration** and **incorporation into the church**, but does not guarantee salvation apart from faith.

- "Baptism is not an isolated rite but is integrally related to the totality of the believer’s union with Christ by the Spirit." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment"
- "Redemption and Resurrection: An Exercise in Biblical-Systematic Theology"
- Contributions to "The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century" (ed. Ligon Duncan)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on sacramental theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Sign and Seal of Union with Christ**
    - Baptism points to the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - It is a visible word, signifying the benefits of the **ordo salutis**.
    - The efficacy of baptism is grounded in the Spirit’s application, not in the act itself.
    - Baptism is inseparable from the broader context of covenantal grace.
    - "Baptism signifies and seals the reality of union with Christ, but does not itself effect that union." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Covenantal Basis for Infant Baptism**
    - Children of believers are included in the visible church and covenant community.
    - The promise of the covenant extends to believers and their offspring.
    - Infant baptism is not a guarantee of regeneration, but a sign of covenant inclusion.
    - The practice is rooted in continuity between Old and New Testament administrations.
    - "The children of believers are to be baptized because they are members of the covenant community." (WTJ, "The Covenant Significance of Baptism")

3. **Rejection of Baptismal Regeneration**
    - Baptism does not automatically confer regeneration or saving grace.
    - The sacrament’s efficacy is tied to God’s sovereign timing and the presence of faith.
    - Baptism is not a mechanical means of grace but a divinely appointed sign.
    - The reality signified may precede, coincide with, or follow the rite.
    - "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of its administration." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Mode of Baptism is Secondary**
    - The New Testament does not prescribe a single mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling).
    - The essential element is the application of water in the triune name.
    - The symbolism of cleansing and Spirit-outpouring is primary.
    - Mode should not divide the church or undermine the sacrament’s unity.
    - "The mode of baptism is not essential to its validity or meaning." (WTJ, "Baptism and the New Testament")

5. **Baptism and the Church**
    - Baptism marks entrance into the visible church, not invisible membership.
    - It is a communal act, administered by the church on Christ’s behalf.
    - Baptism obligates recipients to faith and obedience within the covenant community.
    - The church must uphold both the privilege and responsibility of baptism.
    - "Baptism is the rite of initiation into the visible church, the body of Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s theology of baptism has reinforced the **Reformed emphasis on union with Christ** as central to sacramental understanding. His careful articulation of the relationship between **covenant, faith, and sacrament** has shaped contemporary Presbyterian and Reformed discussions, especially regarding the legitimacy and significance of **infant baptism**. Gaffin’s influence persists in both academic and pastoral contexts, providing a robust framework for understanding baptism’s place in the life of the church.
