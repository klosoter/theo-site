# Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531)

Huldrych Zwingli approached **baptism** as a **covenantal sign** rather than a means of **regeneration** or **remission of sins**. He strongly advocated for **infant baptism** as the New Testament counterpart to **circumcision**, emphasizing its symbolic role in marking membership in the **covenant community** rather than its efficacy in conferring grace.

- "Baptism cannot contribute in any way to the washing away of sin." (On Baptism, 1525)

## Key Works

- "On Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism" (1525)
- "Exposition of the Christian Faith" (1531)
- "The Sixty-Seven Articles" (1523)
- "Refutation of the Tricks of the Baptists" (1527)
- Bruce Gordon, "The Swiss Reformation" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Covenant Sign**
   - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of entrance into the **covenant community**.
   - It marks the recipient as belonging to God's people, not as a means of salvation.
   - The rite is fundamentally about **identity** and **community**, not individual regeneration.
   - The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of administration.
   - "Baptism is a sign of the covenant, not the cause of salvation." (On Baptism, 1525)

2. **Infant Baptism Affirmed**
   - Infants are included in the covenant, just as in the Old Testament.
   - Denial of infant baptism undermines the unity of the covenant of grace.
   - The practice is grounded in the continuity between Old and New Testament signs.
   - Baptism of infants is not based on their faith, but on God's promise.
   - "For as children were circumcised, so should they be baptized." (On Baptism, 1525)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Indifferent**
   - The New Testament does not prescribe a specific mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling).
   - The outward form is less important than the inward reality it signifies.
   - Zwingli opposed the Anabaptist insistence on immersion or adult-only baptism.
   - The church has liberty in the administration of the rite.
   - "The matter is not in the water, but in the promise of God." (On Baptism, 1525)

4. **Baptism Does Not Confer Regeneration**
   - Baptism is not the means by which sins are washed away.
   - Faith precedes the benefit of baptism; the sacrament does not create faith.
   - The rite is a public testimony, not an instrument of spiritual transformation.
   - Regeneration is the work of the **Holy Spirit**, not the sacrament itself.
   - "Water cannot wash away sin; only the blood of Christ does that." (On Baptism, 1525)

5. **Baptism and Church Discipline**
   - Baptism marks entry into the visible church, obligating recipients to Christian instruction.
   - The church is responsible for nurturing baptized members in the faith.
   - Baptism is linked to catechesis and ongoing discipleship.
   - The sign of baptism is to be accompanied by teaching and admonition.
   - "Baptism binds us to the church and its discipline." (Exposition of the Christian Faith, 1531)

## Legacy and Impact

Zwingli’s theology of **baptism** decisively shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** understanding of the sacrament as a sign and seal of the covenant rather than a means of grace. His rejection of **baptismal regeneration** and defense of **infant baptism** set him apart from both Roman Catholic and Anabaptist positions. Zwingli’s views influenced later Reformed confessions and contributed to ongoing debates about the nature and efficacy of the sacraments in Protestant theology.
