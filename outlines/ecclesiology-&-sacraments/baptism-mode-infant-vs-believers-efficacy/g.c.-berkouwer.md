# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **baptism** as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing its theological meaning over disputes about mode or age. He maintained a nuanced Reformed position, affirming both **infant baptism** and the necessity of **faith** for the sacrament’s efficacy, while rejecting any notion of automatic regeneration through the rite itself.

- "Baptism is not a magical act but a sign that points to the promises of God and calls for faith." (The Sacraments)

## Key Works

- The Sacraments (vol. 17 of Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- A Half Century of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Sign and Seal of the Covenant**
    - Baptism signifies incorporation into the **covenant community**.
    - It seals the promises of God to believers and their children.
    - The sacrament points beyond itself to the reality of **grace in Christ**.
    - Berkouwer rejects any ex opere operato understanding.
    - "Baptism is a sign that directs us to the faithfulness of God’s promise." (The Sacraments)

2. **Infant Baptism Rooted in Covenant Theology**
    - Infants of believers are included in the covenant and thus proper recipients.
    - The practice is grounded in the continuity of the covenant from Old to New Testament.
    - Baptism does not guarantee regeneration but calls for later personal faith.
    - The church’s responsibility is to nurture baptized children in the faith.
    - "The child is baptized on the basis of the promise, not on the basis of his own faith." (The Sacraments)

3. **Mode of Baptism Not Theologically Central**
    - Berkouwer does not prescribe a single mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling).
    - The focus is on the meaning, not the external form, of the sacrament.
    - The New Testament does not mandate a specific mode.
    - The church should avoid legalism regarding the manner of administration.
    - "The New Testament does not bind us to a particular form of baptism." (The Sacraments)

4. **Efficacy Dependent on Faith, Not Rite**
    - Baptism’s efficacy is not automatic but is received by faith.
    - The sacrament is a means of grace only when embraced in trust.
    - Baptism calls recipients to respond in faith throughout life.
    - The danger of sacramentalism is a persistent concern.
    - "The sacrament does not work apart from faith, but calls for faith." (The Sacraments)

5. **Baptism and the Church’s Witness**
    - Baptism marks entry into the visible church.
    - It is a communal act, not merely an individual experience.
    - The church is called to witness to the meaning of baptism in its teaching and life.
    - The sacrament unites believers across generations and cultures.
    - "Baptism is not a private matter, but a confession before the congregation." (The Sacraments)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **baptism** has shaped modern Reformed discussions by emphasizing the sacrament’s covenantal context and the necessity of faith. His rejection of both sacramentalism and reductionist symbolism provided a balanced alternative in ecumenical dialogues. Berkouwer’s work continues to influence debates on **infant baptism**, the nature of the church, and the relationship between sign and reality in the sacraments.
