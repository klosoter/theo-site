# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til, as a Reformed apologist and theologian, upheld a **covenantal** understanding of **baptism** rooted in the continuity of the **covenant of grace**. He affirmed the legitimacy of **infant baptism** as a sign and seal of the covenant, while emphasizing the **spiritual efficacy** of the sacrament as dependent on the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit, not on the mode or the recipient’s age.

- "Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant, and as such it is to be administered to believers and their children." ("Christianity and Barthianism")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenantal Foundation of Baptism**
    - Baptism is grounded in the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history.
    - The sacrament signifies inclusion in the visible covenant community.
    - The promises of God to believers and their children are central to its administration.
    - The continuity between Old Testament circumcision and New Testament baptism is emphasized.
    - "The children of believers are included in the covenant and therefore are to receive the sign of the covenant." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Legitimacy of Infant Baptism**
    - Infants of believing parents are proper recipients of baptism as covenant members.
    - The practice is not based on presumption of regeneration but on God’s covenant promises.
    - Baptism does not guarantee salvation but marks the child as set apart.
    - The church’s historic practice is defended against individualistic or purely credobaptist approaches.
    - "We baptize infants not because we know they are regenerate, but because God has included them in his covenant." (Christianity and Barthianism)

3. **Spiritual Efficacy Dependent on the Holy Spirit**
    - The outward sign is distinct from the inward grace it signifies.
    - The efficacy of baptism is not automatic or ex opere operato.
    - The Holy Spirit sovereignly applies the benefits signified by baptism.
    - Faith is necessary for the reception of the inward grace.
    - "The sacrament is efficacious only as the Spirit works in and through it." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Mode of Baptism Not Essential**
    - The mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) is not theologically determinative.
    - The Reformed tradition allows for flexibility in the mode.
    - The focus is on the meaning of baptism as union with Christ and cleansing from sin.
    - Scriptural evidence does not mandate a single mode.
    - "It is not the mode but the meaning of baptism that is central to the Reformed understanding." (Essays on Christian Education)

5. **Baptism and the Antithesis**
    - Baptism marks the antithesis between the church and the world.
    - It signifies entrance into the covenant community, set apart from unbelief.
    - The sacrament is a visible boundary marker of the people of God.
    - This antithesis is foundational to Van Til’s apologetic and ecclesiology.
    - "Baptism is a sign of the antithesis between those who are of the covenant and those who are not." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s covenantal approach to **baptism** reinforced the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on the unity of the covenant of grace and the inclusion of children in the visible church. His insistence on the spiritual efficacy of baptism, dependent on the Holy Spirit, shaped generations of Reformed theologians and pastors. Van Til’s thought continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **sacrament**, covenant, and apologetics within confessional Reformed circles.
