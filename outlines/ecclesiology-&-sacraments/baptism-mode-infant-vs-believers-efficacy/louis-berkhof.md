# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, a leading figure in **Reformed theology**, upheld the **covenantal** understanding of **baptism**, emphasizing its role as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**. He defended **infant baptism** as biblically warranted and maintained that the efficacy of baptism is not automatic but is realized through the work of the **Holy Spirit** and faith.

- "Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as such is properly administered to infants as well as to adults." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially chapters on Sacraments and Baptism)
- Manual of Christian Doctrine
- The History of Christian Doctrines
- Summary of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Covenant Sign**
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of **initiation** into the covenant community.
    - It signifies the believer’s union with Christ and the washing away of sins.
    - The sacrament is not merely symbolic but is a means of grace.
    - The promise of the covenant extends to believers and their children.
    - "Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Infant Baptism is Biblically Grounded**
    - The children of believers are included in the covenant, as in the Old Testament.
    - There is continuity between the Old and New Testament people of God.
    - Household baptisms in the New Testament support the practice.
    - Infant baptism does not guarantee regeneration but places the child within the covenant community.
    - "The children of believers are entitled to baptism, since they are included in the covenant." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Efficacy Depends on the Holy Spirit and Faith**
    - Baptism does not automatically confer **regeneration** or salvation.
    - Its benefits are received by faith and the inward work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The sacrament is efficacious only for the elect.
    - The outward sign must be joined with inward grace for true efficacy.
    - "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of its administration." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Mode of Baptism is Not Essential**
    - Berkhof argues that the mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) is secondary.
    - Sprinkling and pouring are legitimate and historically attested.
    - The spiritual meaning of baptism is not dependent on the quantity of water.
    - The New Testament does not prescribe a single mode.
    - "The mode of baptism is not essential to its validity." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Baptism and Church Membership**
    - Baptism admits one to the visible church, not necessarily the invisible church.
    - It marks the recipient as belonging to the covenant community.
    - Baptized infants are to be raised in the faith and called to personal commitment.
    - The church is responsible for nurturing baptized members in the gospel.
    - "Baptism is the door of entrance into the visible church." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s articulation of **Reformed sacramental theology** has shaped generations of pastors and theologians, especially within Presbyterian and Reformed circles. His defense of **infant baptism** and nuanced view of baptismal efficacy remain standard references in theological education. Berkhof’s clarity and fidelity to the **covenant of grace** framework continue to influence contemporary discussions on the sacraments.
