# Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–1562)

Peter Martyr Vermigli, a leading Reformed theologian of the sixteenth century, articulated a nuanced doctrine of **baptism** that emphasized its role as a **sign and seal of the covenant of grace**. He affirmed the legitimacy of both **infant baptism** and **believer’s baptism**, while insisting that the **efficacy** of baptism is not tied to the outward act but to the **work of the Holy Spirit** in the elect. Vermigli’s sacramental theology sought to maintain a clear distinction between the **sign** and the **thing signified**, situating baptism firmly within the framework of **covenant theology**.

- "Baptism is a sign of regeneration, not regeneration itself, and it is efficacious only for those who receive it with faith." (Loci Communes)

## Key Works

- Loci Communes (compiled posthumously from his biblical commentaries and lectures)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians
- Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ
- The Oxford Treatise and Disputations (especially on the sacraments)
- Peter Martyr Vermigli and the European Reformations: Semper Reformanda (ed. Frank A. James III)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Sign and Seal of the Covenant**
   - Baptism is instituted by God as a visible **sign** of the **covenant of grace**.
   - It points to the inward reality of **regeneration** and the forgiveness of sins.
   - The sacrament is not efficacious by its own power but by the **promise of God**.
   - The **seal** assures believers of their inclusion in the people of God.
   - "The sacraments are signs which God has joined to his promises, to confirm our faith." (Loci Communes)

2. **Legitimacy of Infant Baptism**
   - Infants of believers are included in the **covenant community**.
   - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of the covenant in the New Testament.
   - The faith of the community and parents is relevant for the administration of baptism to infants.
   - The practice is grounded in the continuity of God’s covenant dealings.
   - "Infants are baptized because they belong to the covenant, just as in the Old Testament." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Indifferent**
   - The outward mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) is not essential to the sacrament’s validity.
   - The focus is on the **spiritual reality** signified, not the external form.
   - The New Testament does not prescribe a single mode.
   - The church has liberty in determining the mode according to circumstances.
   - "It is not the manner of washing, but the promise of God and faith that make baptism effectual." (Loci Communes)

4. **Efficacy Dependent on Faith and the Holy Spirit**
   - Baptism does not automatically confer grace (rejecting ex opere operato).
   - The **Holy Spirit** works through the sacrament in those who have faith.
   - The benefits of baptism are received only by the elect.
   - The outward sign may be present without the inward grace.
   - "The effect of baptism is not tied to the moment of administration, but to the faith of the recipient." (Loci Communes)

5. **Distinction Between Sign and Thing Signified**
   - Baptism must not be confused with regeneration itself.
   - The **sign** (water) points to the **thing signified** (spiritual cleansing).
   - The two are joined sacramentally but remain distinct.
   - This distinction guards against both sacramentalism and mere symbolism.
   - "We must distinguish between the sign and the thing signified, lest we attribute to the sign what belongs to Christ alone." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

## Legacy and Impact

Vermigli’s theology of **baptism** significantly shaped the Reformed tradition, especially in its articulation of the relationship between **covenant theology** and the sacraments. His careful distinction between the **sign** and the **thing signified** influenced later Reformed confessions and catechisms. Vermigli’s defense of **infant baptism** and his rejection of sacramental automatism provided a mediating position between Roman Catholic and Anabaptist views, helping to solidify the Reformed consensus on baptismal doctrine. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the spiritual efficacy of the sacraments as means of grace.
