# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **baptism** is a **sacrament** instituted by Christ, signifying union with Him, the forgiveness of sins, and regeneration by the **Holy Spirit**. He affirmed the legitimacy of **infant baptism** as a sign of the **covenant of grace**, rejected baptismal regeneration, and insisted that the efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of its administration but to the **Spirit’s sovereign work**. Calvin held that the mode of baptism (immersion or sprinkling) is indifferent, provided the spiritual reality is maintained.

- "Baptism is the sign of initiation by which we are admitted to the fellowship of the church, that being engrafted into Christ we may be reckoned among God’s children." (Institutes IV.xv.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book IV, chapters 14–16
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Acts (especially Acts 2:38–39)
- Short Treatise on the Lord’s Supper (includes remarks on sacraments)
- The Geneva Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Sign and Seal of the Covenant**
    - Baptism is a visible sign of the **covenant of grace** and marks entry into the visible church.
    - It signifies the washing away of sins and union with Christ.
    - The sacrament points to the inward work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Baptism is not merely symbolic but is a means by which God confirms His promises.
    - "Baptism is the sign of a spiritual and invisible washing." (Institutes IV.xv.2)

2. **Infant Baptism is Scripturally Warranted**
    - Children of believers are included in the covenant and should receive the sign of baptism.
    - The analogy with **circumcision** in the Old Testament supports infant baptism.
    - The promise of the covenant is to believers and their children.
    - Baptism does not guarantee regeneration but marks the child as belonging to the covenant community.
    - "Infants are baptized into future repentance and faith, and even though these have not yet been formed in them, the seed of both lies hidden within them by the secret working of the Spirit." (Institutes IV.xvi.20)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Indifferent**
    - Calvin did not prescribe a single mode (immersion, pouring, or sprinkling).
    - The essential element is the spiritual reality, not the external form.
    - The New Testament does not mandate a particular mode.
    - The church has liberty in the mode of administration.
    - "Whether the person baptized is to be wholly immersed, and whether thrice or once, or whether he is only to be sprinkled with water, is not of the least consequence." (Institutes IV.xv.19)

4. **Efficacy Not Tied to the Moment of Administration**
    - The grace signified by baptism is not automatically conferred at the time of the rite.
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of baptism in God’s timing.
    - Faith is necessary for the reception of what baptism signifies.
    - Baptism’s efficacy is grounded in God’s promise, not in the act itself.
    - "The efficacy of baptism does not depend upon the moment in which it is administered, but is extended through the whole course of our life." (Institutes IV.xv.17)

5. **Baptism Does Not Regenerate Ex Opere Operato**
    - Calvin rejected the view that baptism itself regenerates apart from faith.
    - The sacrament is effective only when received in faith.
    - Baptism is a means of grace, not a mechanical cause of salvation.
    - The outward sign must be joined to the inward reality by the Spirit.
    - "We must beware of ascribing to the sign what is proper only to Christ." (Institutes IV.xiv.17)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **baptism** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, establishing the theological rationale for **infant baptism** and clarifying the relationship between the sacraments and the **covenant of grace**. His emphasis on the spiritual efficacy of baptism, rather than its mechanical operation, distinguished Reformed sacramental theology from both Roman Catholic and Radical Protestant views. Calvin’s balanced approach to the mode and meaning of baptism continues to inform Reformed confessions and pastoral practice.
