# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the **Heidelberg Catechism**, **Belgic Confession**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a distinctly Reformed understanding of **baptism**. They affirm the legitimacy of both **infant** and **believer’s baptism**, emphasize the **efficacy** of baptism as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**, and reject both baptismal regeneration and mere symbolism. The mode of baptism is not strictly prescribed, but the focus is on its spiritual significance within the **church**.

- "Baptism is to children of believers as well as to adults, for that the children belong to the covenant and people of God as well as the adults." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 69–74
- Belgic Confession, Articles 33–34
- Canons of Dort, Heads of Doctrine I–V (esp. implications for covenant and sacraments)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Sign and Seal of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Baptism signifies the **washing away of sins** by the blood and Spirit of Christ.
    - It seals God’s promise to believers and their children.
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign.
    - The efficacy of baptism is grounded in God’s promise, not the act itself.
    - "He wants to assure us by this divine pledge and sign that we are as truly cleansed from our sins spiritually as we are bodily washed with water." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 69)

2. **Infant Baptism is Scripturally Warranted**
    - Children of believers are included in the **covenant community**.
    - The promises of the gospel extend to believers and their offspring.
    - Baptism is not based on personal faith but on God’s covenant.
    - The practice is rooted in the continuity of the covenant from Abraham to Christ.
    - "Infants as well as adults are included in God’s covenant and people, and they, no less than adults, are promised deliverance from sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Not Essential**
    - The form (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) is not prescribed as essential.
    - The spiritual reality signified is primary.
    - The Belgic Confession allows for diversity in practice.
    - The focus is on the meaning, not the mechanics, of the sacrament.
    - "It does not matter whether the person baptized is immersed in water or whether water is poured or sprinkled upon him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 34)

4. **Baptism Does Not Automatically Regenerate**
    - Baptism is not a magical act; it does not confer grace ex opere operato.
    - The sacrament points to Christ’s work, not its own power.
    - Faith is necessary to receive the benefits signified.
    - The efficacy of baptism is tied to the Holy Spirit’s work.
    - "For both infants and adults, baptism is only profitable to those who believe." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

5. **Baptism and the Church**
    - Baptism marks entry into the visible church.
    - It is administered by the church’s authority.
    - The sacrament is a means of grace within the covenant community.
    - Baptism binds recipients to the responsibilities and privileges of church membership.
    - "By it we are received into the church of God and set apart from all other people and strange religions." (Belgic Confession, Art. 34)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed doctrine and practice regarding **baptism**, establishing a robust covenantal theology that affirms both infant and believer’s baptism. Their nuanced stance on the mode and efficacy of baptism has influenced Reformed churches worldwide, distinguishing them from both Roman Catholic and Baptist traditions. The enduring authority of these confessions continues to guide Reformed ecclesiology and sacramental theology.
