# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **baptism** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing its role as a covenant sign and seal rather than a mere profession of faith. He defended **infant baptism** as consistent with the continuity of the covenant of grace, while viewing the **efficacy** of baptism as symbolic and judicial rather than regenerative. Kline’s distinctive focus on the **administration of covenant signs** shaped his understanding of both the mode and recipients of baptism.

- "Baptism is a judicial ordeal sign, not a magical rite of regeneration." (By Oath Consigned)

## Key Works

- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Covenant Judgment-Ordeal**
   - Baptism functions as a sign of covenantal judgment and blessing, paralleling Old Testament ordeals.
   - The water signifies both cleansing and the threat of judgment, depending on covenant faithfulness.
   - The rite is not inherently salvific but points to the realities of union or separation from Christ.
   - Baptism’s meaning is rooted in the biblical-theological structure of divine covenants.
   - "The ordeal by water is a judicial ordeal, a sign of the sanctions of the covenant." (By Oath Consigned)

2. **Infant Baptism and Covenant Continuity**
   - The children of believers are included in the visible covenant community, as in Abrahamic administration.
   - Baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign, maintaining the principle of household inclusion.
   - The promise of the covenant is to believers and their children, not merely to individuals on profession.
   - The administration of baptism to infants is warranted by the unity of the covenant of grace.
   - "The principle of household solidarity underlies the administration of the covenant sign to infants." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Mode of Baptism: Not Essential**
   - The mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) is not prescribed as essential to the sacrament’s validity.
   - The focus is on the theological meaning of the sign, not the physical method.
   - Biblical symbolism of water ordeal can be fulfilled in various modes.
   - The New Testament does not mandate a single mode for Christian baptism.
   - "The New Testament does not legislate the mode of baptism, but its meaning as ordeal is clear." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Efficacy: Judicial, Not Automatic**
   - Baptism does not confer regeneration ex opere operato.
   - Its efficacy is tied to the covenant relationship and the faith response of the recipient.
   - The sacrament signifies the realities of judgment or blessing, depending on covenant faithfulness.
   - Baptism is a means of grace only when received in faith; otherwise, it testifies to judgment.
   - "Baptism is efficacious as a sign of the covenant sanctions, not as a mechanical means of grace." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Context**
   - Baptism must be understood in light of Old Testament types, especially the flood and Red Sea.
   - The sacrament points to Christ’s own ordeal and vindication.
   - Typological connections reinforce the continuity of God’s redemptive plan.
   - The redemptive-historical framework governs the meaning and application of baptism.
   - "The typology of the flood and exodus ordeal is foundational for understanding Christian baptism." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and typological approach to **baptism** has significantly influenced Reformed sacramental theology, especially in debates over the legitimacy of **infant baptism** and the nature of sacramental efficacy. His emphasis on the judicial and symbolic character of baptism challenged both traditional Reformed and Baptist perspectives. Kline’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between the **old and new covenants** and the administration of covenant signs in the church.
