# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther viewed **baptism** as a divinely instituted **means of grace**, essential for both infants and adults. He affirmed the validity of **infant baptism**, rejected the necessity of immersion as the only mode, and emphasized the **efficacy** of baptism through faith in God's promise rather than the act itself.

- "Baptism is not simple water only, but it is the water comprehended in God’s command and connected with God’s Word." (Small Catechism)

## Key Works

- Large Catechism (especially "Holy Baptism")
- Small Catechism
- Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Sermons on Baptism
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 36: Word and Sacrament II

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as Means of Grace**
    - Baptism is a sacrament instituted by Christ, conveying **forgiveness of sins**.
    - The efficacy of baptism depends on **God’s promise**, not human merit.
    - Baptism is necessary for salvation, though not absolutely indispensable in cases of impossibility.
    - The Word joined to the water makes baptism effective.
    - "For where God’s Word is, there is also the power of baptism." (Large Catechism)

2. **Infant Baptism Affirmed**
    - Infants are included in the promise of the gospel and should be baptized.
    - Faith is created and sustained by the Holy Spirit, even in infants.
    - Denial of infant baptism is a denial of the universality of grace.
    - Baptism marks infants as members of the **covenant community**.
    - "Children, too, are to be baptized and brought to Christ, who commands them to be brought to Him." (Large Catechism)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Indifferent**
    - Luther did not insist on immersion; pouring or sprinkling is acceptable.
    - The external mode is secondary to the Word and promise.
    - The essential element is the application of water with God’s Word.
    - The church has freedom in the outward ceremony as long as the substance is preserved.
    - "It is not the water indeed that does such great things, but the Word of God which is in and with the water." (Small Catechism)

4. **Efficacy Rooted in God’s Promise**
    - Baptism’s power comes from God’s Word and promise, not the faith or worthiness of the recipient.
    - Faith receives the benefits of baptism, but baptism remains valid even if faith is lacking at the moment.
    - Baptism grants regeneration, forgiveness, and the Holy Spirit.
    - The baptized are called to live in daily repentance, returning to their baptism.
    - "Baptism works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this." (Small Catechism)

5. **Baptism and Ongoing Repentance**
    - Baptism initiates a lifelong process of repentance and faith.
    - The baptized are to daily die to sin and rise to newness of life.
    - The significance of baptism is not a one-time event but a continual reality.
    - Baptism assures believers of God’s ongoing grace and presence.
    - "The old Adam in us should by daily contrition and repentance be drowned and die with all sins and evil desires." (Small Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s theology of **baptism** shaped the Lutheran tradition and influenced broader Protestant sacramental thought. His defense of **infant baptism** and emphasis on the **means of grace** distinguished his views from both Roman Catholicism and the Radical Reformation. Luther’s insistence on the efficacy of baptism through God’s promise remains foundational for confessional Lutheranism and continues to inform ecumenical discussions on the sacraments.
