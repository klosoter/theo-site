# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust defense of **infant baptism**, the **efficacy of the sacrament**, and the **mode of baptism** within the covenantal framework. He upheld the **covenant of grace** as the theological basis for including infants in baptism, rejected the necessity of immersion as the only valid mode, and maintained that baptism is a means of grace, though not automatically conferring regeneration. Turretin’s careful distinctions shaped later Reformed understandings of the sacrament’s significance and administration.

- "Baptism is not to be repeated, because it impresses a spiritual character and seals the covenant of grace once for all." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Vol. 3, Questions 20–21
- The Doctrine of Baptism (sections within Institutes)
- Selected Questions on the Sacraments (various disputations)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (for context and summary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Sign and Seal of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Baptism signifies the believer’s union with Christ and entrance into the visible church.
    - It seals the promises of the **covenant of grace** to recipients, including infants.
    - The sacrament points to the washing away of sins by Christ’s blood and Spirit.
    - Its efficacy is tied to God’s promise, not to the moment or mode of administration.
    - "Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant, not only of the grace offered, but also of the faith by which it is received." (Institutes)

2. **Infant Baptism is Biblically and Theologically Justified**
    - Infants of believing parents are included in the covenant, as in the Old Testament.
    - The continuity of the covenant supports the application of the sign to children.
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign, extending to believers’ offspring.
    - The faith of parents and the covenant community is sufficient ground for infant baptism.
    - "The children of believers are to be baptized, because they are partakers of the covenant and church." (Institutes)

3. **Mode of Baptism: Immersion Not Essential**
    - Turretin argues that **immersion**, **affusion**, and **aspersion** are all valid modes.
    - The essence of baptism lies in the application of water with the Trinitarian formula.
    - Scriptural examples and linguistic evidence do not restrict baptism to immersion.
    - The Reformed tradition allows for flexibility in mode based on circumstance and edification.
    - "The mode is not of the essence of baptism, provided the sign is preserved." (Institutes)

4. **Efficacy of Baptism: Not Ex Opere Operato**
    - Baptism does not automatically confer grace apart from faith.
    - The sacrament is a means of grace, but its efficacy depends on the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith is ordinarily required for the fruit of baptism, though God is not bound by the sacrament.
    - The grace signified may be received before, during, or after the outward act.
    - "The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of its administration, nor to the act itself." (Institutes)

5. **Baptism’s Relation to Regeneration and Salvation**
    - Baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation, but is ordinarily required of believers.
    - It is a means by which God confirms His promises and strengthens faith.
    - Regeneration is signified, not necessarily conferred, in the act of baptism.
    - The unworthy recipient does not receive the grace signified, though the sacrament remains valid.
    - "Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration, not because it regenerates, but because it seals regeneration." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced articulation of **baptism** shaped the confessional standards of later Reformed churches, especially regarding the legitimacy of infant baptism and the non-essential nature of immersion. His careful distinctions between **sign and thing signified**, and between **sacramental efficacy** and mere ritual, provided a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and Anabaptist positions. Turretin’s influence persists in Reformed sacramental theology, particularly in the Westminster Standards and subsequent systematic theology.
