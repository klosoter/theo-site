# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **baptism** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**, emphasizing its symbolic meaning over sacramental efficacy. He rejected traditional debates over **mode** and **infant versus believer’s baptism** as secondary to the existential encounter with the **kerygma** and the call to authentic faith. For Bultmann, baptism’s significance lies in the believer’s response to the proclamation of Christ rather than in ritual or ecclesiastical tradition.

- "Baptism is not a magical rite but the expression of the decision of faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Sacraments**
    - Baptismal practices must be interpreted existentially, not as supernatural acts.
    - The mythological worldview of the New Testament must be translated for modern understanding.
    - Ritual acts are meaningful only as expressions of personal faith.
    - The focus is on the proclamation (kerygma), not on external rites.
    - "The sacrament is not a magical means of grace but a symbolic act of faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Decision over Ritual Mode**
    - The mode of baptism (immersion, sprinkling) is theologically irrelevant.
    - What matters is the individual's existential response to the gospel.
    - Baptism symbolizes dying and rising with Christ as an existential event.
    - The outward act is secondary to inward transformation.
    - "The decisive thing is the existential decision, not the external form." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Sacramental Efficacy**
    - Baptism does not confer grace ex opere operato.
    - The efficacy of baptism is tied to faith, not the act itself.
    - There is no automatic spiritual effect from the ritual.
    - Baptism is a public confession, not a mystical transformation.
    - "Baptism without faith is an empty gesture." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Primacy of Believer’s Baptism**
    - Baptism presupposes a conscious response to the gospel.
    - Infant baptism is problematic, as it lacks existential decision.
    - The New Testament context assumes baptism follows faith.
    - Authentic baptism is linked to personal commitment.
    - "Baptism in the New Testament is always connected with faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Symbolic Interpretation of Baptism**
    - Baptism is a symbol of the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The act points to the reality of new existence in Christ.
    - The meaning is existential, not metaphysical.
    - The ritual dramatizes the call to authentic existence.
    - "Baptism is the sign of the new life which is given in the proclamation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologizing** approach to baptism profoundly influenced modern theology, shifting focus from ritual and ecclesiastical tradition to personal faith and existential response. His views challenged both sacramental and traditional Reformed understandings, prompting renewed debate about the meaning and practice of baptism in the contemporary church. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **faith, symbol, and ritual** in Christian theology.
