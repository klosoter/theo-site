# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos located **baptism** squarely within the framework of **covenant theology**, treating it as a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**. He affirmed **infant baptism** as a legitimate continuation of Old Testament circumcision, while insisting that the true efficacy of baptism depends on the work of the **Holy Spirit** and union with **Christ**, not on the external rite itself.

- "Baptism is not the cause of regeneration, but its sign and seal." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology"
- "The Teaching of the Epistle to the Hebrews"
- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- "The Kingdom of God and the Church"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism as a Covenant Sign and Seal**
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of entrance into the visible **covenant community**.
    - It signifies the promises of the **covenant of grace**, including forgiveness and renewal.
    - The efficacy of baptism is not automatic but is realized through faith.
    - Baptism is administered to both believers and their children as members of the covenant.
    "Baptism is the New Testament counterpart of circumcision, and as such, it marks the entrance into the visible church." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

2. **Legitimacy of Infant Baptism**
    - Children of believers are included in the covenant and thus are proper recipients of baptism.
    - The practice is grounded in the continuity of the covenant across redemptive history.
    - Infant baptism does not guarantee regeneration but places the child within the sphere of covenant promises.
    - The faith of the parents and the covenant community is significant in the administration.
    "The children of believers are not excluded from the covenant, and therefore not from its sign." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

3. **Mode of Baptism is Non-Essential**
    - The New Testament does not prescribe a single mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling).
    - The spiritual reality signified is more important than the physical mode.
    - Reformed tradition allows for flexibility in the mode of administration.
    - The focus is on the meaning of union with **Christ**, not the method.
    "The essence of baptism does not depend on the quantity of water or the manner of its application." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

4. **Efficacy Dependent on the Holy Spirit**
    - Baptism does not effect regeneration ex opere operato.
    - The **Holy Spirit** applies the benefits signified in baptism to the elect in God’s timing.
    - Baptism is a means of grace, but its efficacy is not tied to the moment of administration.
    - Faith is the instrument by which the grace signified is received.
    "The grace signified is not so inseparably bound to the sacrament that it cannot be received apart from it." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

5. **Baptism and Union with Christ**
    - Baptism points to the believer’s union with **Christ** in his death and resurrection.
    - The sacrament signifies cleansing from sin and newness of life.
    - Participation in baptism is a visible declaration of belonging to Christ and his body.
    - The reality of union with Christ is foundational to understanding baptism’s significance.
    "Baptism signifies and seals our ingrafting into Christ and participation in all his benefits." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **baptism** within the context of **covenant theology** has profoundly shaped Reformed sacramental thought, especially regarding the legitimacy and meaning of **infant baptism**. His emphasis on the spiritual efficacy of baptism, grounded in union with Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit, continues to influence contemporary Reformed discussions. Vos’s careful biblical-theological method provides a robust framework for understanding the continuity and fulfillment of the covenant in the New Testament church.
