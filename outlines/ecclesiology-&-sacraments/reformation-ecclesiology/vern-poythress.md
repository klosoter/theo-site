# Vern Poythress (1946–)

Vern Poythress approaches **Reformation ecclesiology** through a robustly **biblical-theological** and **multiperspectival** lens, emphasizing the church’s identity as the **covenant community** under the lordship of Christ. He affirms the **sola Scriptura** principle and the **priesthood of all believers**, while seeking to integrate the Reformation’s insights with contemporary challenges facing the church’s unity, worship, and mission.

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress has extended the **Reformation ecclesiology** tradition by applying his multiperspectival method to contemporary questions of church identity, authority, and mission. His work has encouraged Reformed churches to remain rooted in **sola Scriptura** while engaging thoughtfully with modern challenges. By emphasizing the **covenant community** and the priesthood of all believers, Poythress has contributed to ongoing discussions about the church’s nature and calling in a pluralistic world. His influence is especially notable in the areas of biblical theology and the integration of doctrine with practical church life.
