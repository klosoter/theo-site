# Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–1562)

Peter Martyr Vermigli was a leading architect of **Reformation ecclesiology**, emphasizing the visible and invisible aspects of the **church**, the centrality of **Word and sacrament**, and the necessity of **discipline**. He upheld the **marks of the true church**—pure preaching, right administration of the sacraments, and church discipline—while rejecting medieval sacerdotalism and papal supremacy. Vermigli’s ecclesiology was deeply shaped by his commitment to **Scripture as the ultimate authority** and a Reformed understanding of the church’s spiritual nature.

- "The church is not to be measured by outward pomp, but by the pure doctrine of the gospel and lawful use of the sacraments." (Loci Communes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Visible and Invisible**
    - The church consists of both the visible community and the invisible body of true believers.
    - The visible church is marked by the preaching of the **Word** and administration of the **sacraments**.
    - The invisible church is known only to God and comprises the elect.
    - Vermigli distinguishes between outward membership and inward regeneration.
    - "There is a visible church, but the true and spiritual church is known only to God." (Loci Communes)

2. **Authority of Scripture over Tradition**
    - Scripture is the supreme authority in all matters of faith and church order.
    - Human traditions are subordinate and must be tested by the Word of God.
    - Vermigli rejects papal claims and councils when they contradict Scripture.
    - The church’s legitimacy depends on fidelity to biblical teaching.
    - "We must judge the church by the Word of God, not the Word by the church." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

3. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The true church is identified by the pure preaching of the gospel.
    - Right administration of the sacraments is essential.
    - Proper exercise of church discipline maintains holiness.
    - Vermigli insists these marks distinguish the church from false assemblies.
    - "Where the Word is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered, there is the church." (Loci Communes)

4. **Rejection of Sacerdotalism and Papal Supremacy**
    - Vermigli denies the necessity of a mediating priesthood apart from Christ.
    - He opposes the idea of the pope as the head of the universal church.
    - All believers share in the priesthood of Christ through faith.
    - Church authority is ministerial, not magisterial or autocratic.
    - "Christ alone is the head of the church; all others are ministers." (Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ)

5. **Necessity of Discipline and Order**
    - Church discipline is vital for maintaining purity and witness.
    - Elders and ministers are responsible for teaching and correction.
    - Discipline is exercised according to biblical principles, not arbitrary power.
    - Vermigli views discipline as a mark of the church’s faithfulness.
    - "Without discipline, the church cannot remain in the truth of the gospel." (Loci Communes)

## Legacy and Impact

Vermigli’s **Reformation ecclesiology** profoundly shaped the development of Reformed and Anglican church structures, especially through his influence in England and Zurich. His articulation of the **marks of the church** and insistence on **Scripture’s authority** became foundational for later Reformed confessions. Vermigli’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the visible and invisible church, the centrality of Word and sacrament, and the necessity of church discipline within Protestant ecclesiology.
