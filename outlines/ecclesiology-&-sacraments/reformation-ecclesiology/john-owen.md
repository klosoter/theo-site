# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen’s **Reformation ecclesiology** is marked by a robust defense of the **visible and invisible church**, the **regulative principle of worship**, and the autonomy of local congregations under the headship of **Christ alone**. He opposed both Roman Catholic hierarchy and Erastian state control, advocating for a **gathered church** composed of professing believers and governed by **Scripture**.

- "The only authority of the church is that which is derived from Christ, and exercised according to his mind and will revealed in the Scriptures." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Key Works

- The True Nature of a Gospel Church and Its Government
- Of Schism
- Discourse Concerning Evangelical Love, Church Peace, and Unity
- The Duty of Pastors and People Distinguished
- Communion with God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Exclusive Headship Over the Church**
   - Christ alone is the supreme authority in the church, excluding all human or civil mediation.
   - All church power is ministerial and declarative, not magisterial.
   - The church’s government must be derived from Christ’s commands in Scripture.
   - Any ecclesiastical structure not instituted by Christ is illegitimate.
   - "There is no head of the church but Christ, nor can any man or order of men be so called without usurpation." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

2. **The Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
   - The invisible church consists of all true believers united to Christ by faith.
   - The visible church is the outward assembly of professing believers and their children.
   - Membership in the visible church does not guarantee saving faith.
   - The purity of the visible church is maintained through discipline and sound doctrine.
   - "The church of Christ is to be considered as visible and invisible, as it is professing or believing." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

3. **Congregational Autonomy**
   - Each local congregation possesses the right to govern itself under Christ.
   - Elders are chosen by the congregation and are accountable to it.
   - No external authority (civil or ecclesiastical) may impose governance on a local church.
   - Inter-church councils are advisory, not binding.
   - "The Lord Christ hath given to each particular church all that power and authority which is needful for its own edification." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

4. **Regulative Principle of Worship**
   - Worship must be ordered strictly according to what is prescribed in Scripture.
   - Human inventions or traditions in worship are to be rejected.
   - Simplicity and purity in worship are essential to honor God’s will.
   - The sacraments are to be administered as Christ instituted them.
   - "Nothing belongs to the worship of God in the church but what is of his own institution." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

5. **Church Discipline and Purity**
   - Discipline is necessary to maintain the holiness of the church.
   - The keys of the kingdom are exercised through the congregation and its officers.
   - Excommunication is a last resort for unrepentant sin.
   - Restoration and reconciliation are the goals of discipline.
   - "The power of discipline is given unto the church for the preservation of its purity and order." (The True Nature of a Gospel Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s **Reformation ecclesiology** profoundly shaped English Congregationalism and later Baptist polity, emphasizing the **autonomy of the local church** and the sufficiency of Scripture for church order. His rigorous defense of the **regulative principle** and the distinction between the visible and invisible church influenced Reformed and evangelical traditions. Owen’s ecclesiology remains a touchstone for debates on church government, purity, and the relationship between church and state.
