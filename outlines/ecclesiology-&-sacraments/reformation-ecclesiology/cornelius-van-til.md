# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **Reformation ecclesiology** through the lens of his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics** and **Reformed confessionalism**. He emphasized the **antithesis** between the church and the world, the necessity of a **Scripture-governed church**, and the organic unity of the **covenant community**. Van Til maintained that the church’s identity and authority are inseparable from its submission to the **self-attesting Word of God**.

- "The church must always be self-consciously Reformed, standing upon the foundation of the Word of God as its only ultimate authority." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Antithesis in Ecclesiology**
    - The church is fundamentally distinct from the world due to its regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
    - The antithesis shapes the church’s mission, worship, and discipline.
    - Ecclesiastical compromise with secular thought undermines the church’s witness.
    - The church must maintain a clear boundary in doctrine and practice.
    - "The church must be self-consciously antithetical to all forms of unbelief." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority**
    - The church derives its authority solely from the self-attesting Scriptures.
    - All ecclesiastical traditions and practices must be tested by the Word of God.
    - The Reformation principle of sola Scriptura remains central to true church life.
    - Human autonomy in church governance is rejected in favor of divine revelation.
    - "Scripture is the final court of appeal in all matters of faith and life." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenantal and Organic Nature of the Church**
    - The church is the visible manifestation of the covenant people of God.
    - There is an organic unity between Old and New Testament people of God.
    - The church’s life is corporate, not merely individualistic.
    - The covenant structure shapes worship, discipline, and mission.
    - "The church is the covenant community, called to manifest the kingdom of God in history." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Confessional Identity and Reformed Tradition**
    - The church must be confessional, holding to historic Reformed creeds and confessions.
    - Confessions serve as secondary standards under Scripture, guarding doctrinal purity.
    - The Reformation’s recovery of confessionalism is essential for ecclesial faithfulness.
    - Confessional standards provide unity and clarity in the church’s witness.
    - "A confessional church is a church that stands on the shoulders of the Reformers." (Essays on Christian Education)

5. **Apologetic Task of the Church**
    - The church is called to defend the faith from within a Reformed, presuppositional framework.
    - Apologetics is not optional but integral to the church’s mission.
    - The church’s defense must be consistent with its theological foundations.
    - The church must expose the inadequacy of all non-Christian worldviews.
    - "The church must always be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in her, presupposing the truth of God’s revelation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **Reformation ecclesiology** reinforced the centrality of the **antithesis** and the necessity of a consistently **Scripture-governed church**. His influence shaped Reformed churches’ understanding of their confessional identity and apologetic responsibility. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment of many Reformed communities to uphold the authority of Scripture and the distinctiveness of the covenant community in the modern world.
