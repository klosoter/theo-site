His covenantal understanding of the church influenced later Reformed theology, including the development of federal theology. Bullinger’s emphasis on the marks of the church and the authority of Scripture provided a lasting framework for Reformed ecclesiology, ensuring his continued relevance in discussions of church doctrine and practice.
