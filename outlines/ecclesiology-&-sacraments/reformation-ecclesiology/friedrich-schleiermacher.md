# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **ecclesiology** in light of his emphasis on **religious experience** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**. He viewed the **church** as the communal expression of shared faith, rather than as a visible institution defined by doctrine or sacraments, thus departing significantly from **Reformation** models that prioritized the marks of the true church.

- "The church is the fellowship of believers, united by the common spirit of piety." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Schleiermacher: A Guide for the Perplexed (Rae Murray, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as the Fellowship of Believers**
    - The church is constituted by the shared **religious consciousness** of its members.
    - Emphasizes inward **piety** over external forms or institutional structures.
    - The unity of the church is spiritual, not organizational.
    - Downplays traditional **marks of the church** (preaching, sacraments) in favor of communal experience.
    - "The church is essentially a communion of those who share the same faith." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - True religion is rooted in the **feeling of absolute dependence**.
    - The church arises naturally from the communal sharing of this experience.
    - Institutional forms are secondary to the lived experience of faith.
    - The church is dynamic, shaped by the evolving consciousness of its members.
    - "Religion is neither knowledge nor a set of actions, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

3. **Reinterpretation of Sacraments**
    - Sacraments are symbolic expressions of communal faith, not means of grace in themselves.
    - Their value lies in fostering unity and shared religious feeling.
    - Rejects a strictly **Reformed** or **Lutheran** view of sacramental efficacy.
    - Sacraments serve to express, not create, the church’s spiritual reality.
    - "The sacraments are the language of the church’s common life." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Flexible View of Church Authority**
    - Authority in the church is derived from the consensus of the faithful.
    - Rejects hierarchical or magisterial models of governance.
    - Emphasizes the role of the community in shaping doctrine and practice.
    - The church’s authority is persuasive, not coercive.
    - "The church has no other authority than that which arises from the common spirit." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ecumenical and Inclusive Vision**
    - The boundaries of the church are porous, reflecting the diversity of religious experience.
    - Advocates for unity based on shared piety rather than doctrinal uniformity.
    - Open to the possibility of truth in other Christian traditions and even religions.
    - Sees denominationalism as a historical, not essential, feature of the church.
    - "The church is always becoming, never finished, as the spirit of piety grows." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s **ecclesiology** marked a decisive shift from classical **Reformation** models, prioritizing the subjective and communal aspects of faith over institutional or doctrinal definitions. His thought laid the groundwork for modern **liberal theology** and influenced later discussions on the nature of the church, religious pluralism, and ecumenism. While often criticized by confessional traditions, his emphasis on experience and community continues to shape contemporary theological discourse.
