# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **Reformation ecclesiology** through a robustly biblical and redemptive-historical lens, emphasizing the centrality of **Word and sacrament**, the **priesthood of all believers**, and the church’s identity as the eschatological people of God. He highlights the continuity of the **Reformed tradition** with the New Testament vision of the church, focusing on the Spirit’s role in constituting and sustaining the body of Christ.

- "The church is the new covenant community, constituted and continually sustained by the Spirit through the Word." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment
- "The Church as the New Humanity: The Relevance of Paul’s Ecclesiology" (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. Hill & Letham)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on ecclesiology and Reformation theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as the Eschatological Community**
    - The church is the inaugurated new creation, grounded in Christ’s resurrection.
    - Ecclesiology is inseparable from **union with Christ** and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The church’s identity is shaped by its participation in the already/not yet of redemption.
    - The visible and invisible church distinction is essential for understanding its nature.
    - "The church is the new humanity, the community of the Spirit, already participating in the age to come." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Primacy of Word and Sacrament**
    - The church is gathered and sustained by the ministry of the Word and the sacraments.
    - Preaching is the primary means by which Christ rules and nourishes his people.
    - The sacraments are visible words, confirming the promises of the gospel.
    - The Reformation’s emphasis on these marks remains foundational for ecclesiology.
    - "The Reformation rightly saw the preaching of the Word and the administration of the sacraments as the marks of the true church." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Priesthood of All Believers**
    - Every believer shares in Christ’s priestly office, offering spiritual sacrifices.
    - There is a fundamental equality among members of the church in Christ.
    - Ministry is not restricted to a clerical class but involves the whole body.
    - This doctrine safeguards the church from sacerdotalism and clericalism.
    - "The priesthood of all believers is integral to the Reformation’s understanding of the church." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Orientation**
    - Ecclesiology must be grounded in the unfolding drama of redemption.
    - The church’s structure and mission are shaped by the history of salvation.
    - The Reformation recovered the biblical-theological focus on Christ as the center.
    - The Spirit’s work in the church is both corporate and eschatological.
    - "A redemptive-historical approach is essential for a biblical understanding of the church." (Westminster Theological Journal)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Israel**
    - The church is the continuation and fulfillment of the people of God in Christ.
    - There is both continuity (covenant, promises) and discontinuity (newness in Christ) with Israel.
    - The Reformation clarified the church’s identity in relation to Old Testament Israel.
    - The unity of the covenant people is maintained through Christ and the Spirit.
    - "The church is the true Israel, constituted by the Spirit in union with Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed ecclesiology**, especially in its redemptive-historical and pneumatological dimensions. His emphasis on the centrality of **Word and sacrament** and the church’s eschatological identity has influenced generations of pastors and theologians. Gaffin’s careful articulation of the **priesthood of all believers** and the church’s continuity with Israel continues to inform Reformed discussions on the nature and mission of the church. His scholarship remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, confessionally Reformed understanding of ecclesiology.
