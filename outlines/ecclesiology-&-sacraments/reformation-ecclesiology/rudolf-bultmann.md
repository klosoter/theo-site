# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann’s approach to **Reformation ecclesiology** is shaped by his existentialist interpretation of the New Testament and his program of **demythologization**. While not a Reformation theologian himself, Bultmann critically engaged with **Lutheran** and broader Protestant traditions, emphasizing the church as the community of proclamation rather than an institutional or sacramental body. For Bultmann, the essence of the church lies in the existential encounter with the **kerygma**—the proclaimed word of Christ.

- "The Church is not an institution but an event—the event of the proclamation in which faith is awakened." (Faith and Understanding)

## Key Works

- Faith and Understanding
- Theology of the New Testament
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Essays Philosophical and Theological
- New Testament and Mythology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Ecclesial Concepts**
   - The church must be understood apart from mythological or supernatural frameworks.
   - Ecclesiology is reinterpreted through existential categories, not metaphysical ones.
   - Traditional Reformation emphases on **Word and Sacrament** are re-read as existential events.
   - The church’s reality is actualized in the response of faith, not in visible structures.
   - "Demythologizing does not mean eliminating the biblical message but interpreting it existentially." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation of the **gospel** is the constitutive act of the church.
   - The church exists wherever the kerygma is heard and responded to in faith.
   - Institutional continuity is secondary to the existential encounter with Christ.
   - The Reformation’s focus on preaching is radicalized into an event of decision.
   - "The real Church is where the Word is proclaimed and accepted in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Understanding of Faith and Community**
   - Faith is a personal, existential response, not adherence to doctrine or ritual.
   - The church is a fellowship of those who have encountered the existential call of Christ.
   - Community is formed by shared response to the kerygma, not by sacramental participation.
   - The Reformation’s priesthood of all believers is interpreted as existential equality before the Word.
   - "Faith is not assent to propositions but an existential self-understanding." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critical Engagement with Reformation Traditions**
   - Bultmann affirms the Reformation’s critique of ecclesiastical authority.
   - He challenges both Catholic and Protestant institutionalism as missing the existential core.
   - The Reformation’s emphasis on sola fide is reinterpreted as existential trust.
   - Sacraments are seen as symbolic acts pointing to the existential event, not as means of grace.
   - "The Reformation rightly saw the Church as the congregation of believers, not as an institution." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

5. **Church as Event, Not Institution**
   - The church is constituted by the event of proclamation, not by historical continuity.
   - There is no ontological or mystical reality to the church apart from the Word-event.
   - The church’s unity is found in the shared existential encounter, not in polity or tradition.
   - The Reformation’s break with Rome is seen as a move toward authentic existential community.
   - "The Church happens where the Word is proclaimed and faith is awakened." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologized** approach to ecclesiology has profoundly influenced modern Protestant thought, especially in the interpretation of the church as a community of proclamation. His critical engagement with **Reformation ecclesiology** has challenged both confessional and liberal traditions to reconsider the nature of the church in light of the existential encounter with the gospel. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for debates about the relationship between faith, proclamation, and the visible church. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the meaning of **Word and Sacrament** in contemporary theology.
