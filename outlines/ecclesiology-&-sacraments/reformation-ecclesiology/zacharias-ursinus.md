# Zacharias Ursinus (1534–1583)

Zacharias Ursinus, a principal author of the **Heidelberg Catechism**, articulated a **Reformed ecclesiology** that emphasized the visible and invisible church, the centrality of the **Word and sacraments**, and the necessity of **church discipline**. He maintained that the true church is marked by the pure preaching of the **gospel**, the right administration of the **sacraments**, and the faithful exercise of **discipline**, all under the authority of **Christ as head**.

- "The church is the congregation of those who are called by the Word and Spirit of God, that they may be members of Christ and obtain eternal life." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as the Congregation of the Elect**
    - The church consists of those effectually called by the **Word and Spirit**.
    - Distinguishes between the **visible** and **invisible church**.
    - The invisible church is known only to God; the visible is gathered in local assemblies.
    - Membership is grounded in union with **Christ**.
    - "The church is the assembly of those who are called, or the congregation of the faithful." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The pure preaching of the **gospel** is essential.
    - Right administration of the **sacraments** (Baptism and the Lord’s Supper) is required.
    - Faithful exercise of **church discipline** is necessary.
    - These marks distinguish the true church from false assemblies.
    - "Where these marks are found, there is the true church; where they are wanting, there is no church." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

3. **Authority of Christ as Head of the Church**
    - Christ alone is the supreme head and ruler of the church.
    - All church authority is derived from and subordinate to Christ.
    - Human traditions must not supplant Christ’s commands.
    - The church’s government is ministerial, not magisterial.
    - "Christ is the only head of the church, and all ministers are but his servants." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

4. **Necessity and Nature of Church Discipline**
    - Discipline preserves the purity of doctrine and life.
    - It is a mark of the true church and a means of restoration.
    - Discipline is exercised according to Christ’s commands in Scripture.
    - Excommunication is a last resort for unrepentant offenders.
    - "Without discipline, the church cannot long continue in purity." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

5. **Means of Grace in the Church**
    - The **Word** and **sacraments** are the primary means by which God communicates grace.
    - The church is the appointed steward of these means.
    - Preaching and sacramental administration must be according to Christ’s institution.
    - The Spirit works through these means to build up the body.
    - "The means by which the church is gathered and preserved are the preaching of the gospel and the administration of the sacraments." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Ursinus’s **Reformed ecclesiology** shaped the identity and practice of the continental Reformed churches, especially through the enduring influence of the Heidelberg Catechism. His clear articulation of the marks of the church and the authority of Christ as head provided a theological foundation for later Reformed confessions and church orders. Ursinus’s emphasis on the means of grace and church discipline continues to inform Reformed understandings of church life and ministry. His legacy endures in the catechetical and confessional traditions of Reformed Christianity.
