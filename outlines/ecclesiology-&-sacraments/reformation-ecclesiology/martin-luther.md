# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s **Reformation ecclesiology** redefined the nature and authority of the **church** by grounding it in the proclamation of the **Word of God** and the right administration of the **sacraments**. He rejected the exclusive claims of the **papacy**, emphasizing the **priesthood of all believers** and the visible church as a community gathered around the gospel.

- "The true treasure of the church is the most holy gospel of the glory and grace of God." (95 Theses)

## Key Works

- 95 Theses (1517)
- Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (1520)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- On the Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- The Schmalkald Articles (1537)
- Luther’s Large Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church is Defined by the Gospel**
   - The church exists where the **Word of God** is rightly preached.
   - The gospel, not institutional hierarchy, is the foundation of the church.
   - The marks of the true church are the proclamation of the gospel and the sacraments.
   - The visible church is not identical with any single institution.
   - "Wherever you hear or see this word preached, believed, professed, and lived, do not doubt that the true ecclesia sancta catholica, a ‘holy Christian people,’ must be there." (On the Councils and the Church)

2. **Priesthood of All Believers**
   - Every Christian has direct access to God through Christ.
   - There is no spiritual distinction between clergy and laity in essence.
   - All believers share in the ministry of the gospel.
   - Ordination is a function of the community, not a sacramental act conferring special grace.
   - "We are all consecrated priests through baptism." (To the Christian Nobility)

3. **Rejection of Papal Supremacy**
   - The pope is not the head of the universal church by divine right.
   - Church authority is subject to the authority of Scripture.
   - Councils and popes can err and have erred.
   - The church is not bound to Roman jurisdiction.
   - "A simple layman armed with Scripture is to be believed above a pope or a council without it." (Address to the Christian Nobility)

4. **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
   - Only **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are true sacraments instituted by Christ.
   - Sacraments are effective when joined to the promise of the gospel.
   - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on God’s word, not the worthiness of the minister.
   - The church is built up through the right administration of the sacraments.
   - "The church is the congregation of saints, in which the gospel is rightly taught and the sacraments rightly administered." (Augsburg Confession, Article VII, with Luther’s influence)

5. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
   - The visible church contains both true believers and hypocrites.
   - The invisible church consists of the elect known only to God.
   - The true church is ultimately defined by faith, not external membership.
   - Outward forms and ceremonies do not guarantee the presence of the church.
   - "Many who are numbered with us are not of us." (On the Councils and the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s **Reformation ecclesiology** shattered the medieval consensus on church authority and laid the groundwork for Protestant understandings of the **church** as a community gathered by the Word and sacraments. His emphasis on the **priesthood of all believers** and the authority of Scripture over church tradition profoundly shaped subsequent Protestant theology and church practice. Luther’s vision continues to influence debates about church unity, authority, and the marks of the true church.
