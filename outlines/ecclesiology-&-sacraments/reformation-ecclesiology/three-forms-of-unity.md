# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a distinctly **Reformed ecclesiology** rooted in the authority of **Scripture**, the centrality of the **means of grace**, and the marks of the **true church**. These confessions emphasize the visible and invisible aspects of the church, the necessity of **church discipline**, and the church’s role in preserving **pure doctrine** and worship. Their ecclesiology is both polemical against Rome and Anabaptism and constructive for Reformed identity.

- "The marks by which the true Church is known are these: if the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised in punishing of sin." (Belgic Confession, Article 29)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 27–32
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 54–56, 65–85
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine and Rejection of Errors
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- The Church in the Theology of the Reformers by Paul Avis (secondary reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic**
    - Affirms the unity and universality of the church across all times and places.
    - The church is gathered, protected, and preserved by Christ through His Spirit and Word.
    - The invisible church consists of the elect, while the visible church is the congregation of professing believers and their children.
    - The church is called to manifest holiness and apostolicity in doctrine and life.
    - "This holy Church is preserved or supported by God, against the rage of the whole world." (Belgic Confession, Article 27)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The pure preaching of the **gospel** is essential.
    - The proper administration of the **sacraments** as instituted by Christ is required.
    - The faithful exercise of **church discipline** distinguishes the true church.
    - These marks serve to distinguish the true church from false churches and sects.
    - "As for the false Church, it ascribes more power and authority to itself and its ordinances than to the Word of God." (Belgic Confession, Article 29)

3. **Authority of Scripture in Church Life**
    - Scripture is the only rule for faith, worship, and church government.
    - Human traditions and inventions are rejected as binding on conscience.
    - Church offices and practices must be regulated by the Word of God.
    - The church is always subject to reformation according to Scripture.
    - "We believe that this true Church must be governed by that spiritual polity which our Lord has taught us in His Word." (Belgic Confession, Article 30)

4. **The Means of Grace and the Church’s Ministry**
    - The church is the appointed steward of the **means of grace**: Word and sacraments.
    - The ministry of the Word is central for the gathering and upbuilding of the church.
    - Sacraments are to be administered only by lawful ministers in the context of the church.
    - The church is responsible for catechesis and the nurture of believers in the faith.
    - "Through these means, the Holy Spirit works faith in our hearts." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 65)

5. **Church Discipline and Order**
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church and necessary for its purity.
    - Church government is to be exercised by ordained elders and deacons.
    - Discipline aims at repentance, restoration, and the honor of Christ’s name.
    - The church is to maintain order and peace through biblically prescribed offices and procedures.
    - "All things must be managed according to the Word of God; all tyranny and human inventions are to be resisted." (Belgic Confession, Article 30)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided a foundational and enduring framework for **Reformed ecclesiology** in continental Reformed churches and beyond. Their articulation of the marks of the church, the authority of Scripture, and the necessity of discipline has shaped confessional identity and church practice for centuries. These documents continue to serve as standards of doctrine, worship, and polity, ensuring the church’s ongoing fidelity to the Reformed tradition. Their influence extends globally, uniting diverse Reformed communities around a shared vision of the church’s nature and mission.
