# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray’s approach to **Reformation ecclesiology** is marked by a robust commitment to the **visible and invisible church distinction**, the **means of grace**, and the **centrality of the Word and sacraments**. He emphasized the church’s divine institution, its spiritual unity, and the necessity of **biblical church government** rooted in the Reformed tradition, particularly **Presbyterian polity**.

- "The church is not a voluntary association; it is the institution which Christ has erected and endowed with his authority." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Unity of the Church" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Church: Its Identity, Function, and Resources" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Christian Baptism" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "The Form of Government" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Redemption—Accomplished and Applied" (especially sections on the application of redemption in the context of the church)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Divine Institution**
    - The church is established by Christ’s authority, not human initiative.
    - Its existence and structure are grounded in **biblical revelation**.
    - The church is both a spiritual organism and a visible institution.
    - Membership in the visible church is a covenantal privilege and responsibility.
    - "The church is not a voluntary society but a divine institution." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
    - The invisible church consists of all the elect united to Christ.
    - The visible church is the community of professing believers and their children.
    - This distinction safeguards the church’s spiritual unity while recognizing human imperfection.
    - The visible church is the sphere of the **means of grace**.
    - "The distinction between the visible and invisible church is necessary to maintain the purity of the church’s doctrine and life." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Means of Grace and the Centrality of Word and Sacrament**
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are the primary means by which God communicates grace.
    - The ministry of the Word is central to the church’s life and mission.
    - The sacraments are effectual signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
    - Proper administration of the means of grace is a mark of the true church.
    - "The means of grace are the divinely appointed channels through which Christ nourishes his people." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Biblical Church Government (Presbyterian Polity)**
    - Church government must be regulated by Scripture, not tradition or pragmatism.
    - Presbyterian polity, with its plurality of elders, reflects biblical patterns.
    - Authority in the church is ministerial and declarative, not legislative.
    - Discipline is essential for the church’s purity and witness.
    - "The government of the church must be derived from the Word of God and not from human invention." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity and Holiness of the Church**
    - The church’s unity is grounded in union with Christ and the work of the Spirit.
    - Visible unity is expressed in common confession, worship, and discipline.
    - Holiness is both a gift and a calling for the church’s members.
    - The church’s witness depends on its faithfulness to truth and purity of life.
    - "The unity and holiness of the church are inseparable from its identity as the body of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **Reformation ecclesiology** has profoundly shaped conservative Reformed and Presbyterian thought, especially in North America. His insistence on the **biblical foundations** of church government and the means of grace continues to influence discussions on church practice and identity. Murray’s careful distinctions and theological clarity have provided a durable framework for understanding the church’s nature, mission, and authority within the broader Reformed tradition.
