# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s approach to **Reformation ecclesiology** centers on the church as a dynamic community created by the **Word of God** and sustained by the **Holy Spirit**. He emphasizes the church’s provisional and imperfect nature, rejecting institutionalism and insisting that the true church is wherever the **gospel is rightly preached** and the **sacraments are rightly administered**. Brunner’s ecclesiology is deeply shaped by his commitment to **Christocentrism** and the priority of divine revelation over human structures.

- "Where the Word is, there is the Church; and where the Church is, there is the Word." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Key Works

- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Volume III: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (1962)
- The Misunderstanding of the Church (1952)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- The Mediator (1934)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Creation of the Word**
   - The church exists where the **Word of God** is proclaimed and heard.
   - The church is not a human organization but a divine event.
   - The proclamation of the gospel is constitutive for the church’s existence.
   - The church’s authority is derivative, grounded in God’s self-revelation.
   - "The Church is the congregation of those who hear and respond to the Word of God." (Dogmatics III)

2. **Rejection of Institutionalism**
   - The visible church is always provisional and fallible.
   - No institutional form can guarantee the presence of the true church.
   - Structures serve the proclamation, not the other way around.
   - The church must always be reformed according to the Word.
   - "The Church is always in need of reformation because it is always in danger of becoming an institution." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

3. **Centrality of Christ and the Spirit**
   - **Christ** is the sole foundation and head of the church.
   - The **Holy Spirit** actualizes the church through the Word.
   - The church is a fellowship of faith, not a religious society.
   - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and to one another.
   - "The Church is the work of the Holy Spirit, who brings men into fellowship with Christ." (Dogmatics III)

4. **Marks of the Church: Word and Sacrament**
   - The **right preaching of the gospel** is the primary mark.
   - The **right administration of the sacraments** is essential.
   - These marks distinguish the true church from mere assemblies.
   - The sacraments are signs of Christ’s presence, not magical rites.
   - "Where the Gospel is rightly preached and the Sacraments rightly administered, there is the Church." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Ecclesial Humility and Openness**
   - The church must acknowledge its own imperfection and sinfulness.
   - True unity is spiritual, not organizational or doctrinal uniformity.
   - The church is called to serve the world, not dominate it.
   - Openness to reform and correction is a sign of faithfulness.
   - "The Church is not an end in itself, but a sign and instrument of the coming Kingdom." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s **Reformation ecclesiology** challenged both Protestant and Catholic traditions to reconsider the nature and mission of the church in light of the **Word of God** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. His emphasis on the church as a provisional, Spirit-created community influenced later ecumenical discussions and shaped 20th-century Protestant thought. Brunner’s critique of institutionalism and his call for continual reformation remain significant for contemporary ecclesiology, especially in contexts wrestling with the relationship between church structure and gospel proclamation.
