# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed ecclesiology** rooted in the authority of **Scripture**, the distinction between the **visible and invisible church**, and the centrality of **Word and sacrament** as the means by which Christ builds His church. He emphasized the church’s spiritual nature, its governance by **presbyterian polity**, and its mission as the ordained instrument for the proclamation of the **gospel** and administration of the **means of grace**.

- "The Church, according to the Scriptures, is the company of those who profess the true religion, together with their children." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on the Church and Sacraments)
- Discussions in Church Polity
- The Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the church)
- Commentaries on the Epistle to the Ephesians (relevant for ecclesiological themes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Visible and Invisible**
    - The **invisible church** consists of all true believers united to Christ.
    - The **visible church** is the community of professing believers and their children.
    - Membership in the visible church does not guarantee salvation, but grants access to the means of grace.
    - The distinction safeguards both the purity and catholicity of the church.
    "The distinction between the visible and invisible Church is not only scriptural, but necessary to any consistent view of the subject." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Scriptural Authority in Ecclesiology**
    - The **Bible** is the only infallible rule for the doctrine, government, and worship of the church.
    - Human traditions and ecclesiastical decrees are subordinate to Scripture.
    - The church’s legitimacy depends on its faithfulness to biblical teaching.
    - Reformation ecclesiology rejects innovations not warranted by Scripture.
    "The Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Presbyterian Polity**
    - Church government is to be exercised by elders (presbyters) in graded courts.
    - Authority is representative, not hierarchical or congregational.
    - **Presbyterian polity** reflects apostolic practice and safeguards unity and discipline.
    - The church is governed by Christ through ordained officers, not by individual autonomy.
    "The government of the Church is not a democracy, but a theocracy administered by presbyters." (Discussions in Church Polity)

4. **Means of Grace: Word and Sacrament**
    - The **preaching of the Word** and administration of the **sacraments** are the primary means by which Christ builds His church.
    - Sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant, not mere symbols.
    - The church’s ministry is spiritual, not political or civil.
    - The means of grace are effectual only by the work of the Holy Spirit.
    "The Church is the divinely appointed channel for the communication of the means of grace." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Unity and Purity of the Church**
    - The church’s unity is grounded in union with Christ and the truth of the gospel.
    - Purity is maintained through discipline and doctrinal fidelity.
    - Visible unity is desirable but must not compromise doctrinal truth.
    - Schism is justified only when the gospel is fundamentally compromised.
    "Unity in the Church is to be sought only in connection with purity of doctrine and worship." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s **Reformed ecclesiology** shaped generations of Presbyterian thought in America, especially through his influence at Princeton Theological Seminary. His robust defense of **presbyterian polity** and the authority of Scripture in church life became foundational for conservative Reformed churches. Hodge’s careful distinction between the visible and invisible church remains a standard reference point in ecclesiological discussions. His work continues to inform debates on church government, the means of grace, and the nature of church unity within the broader Reformed tradition.
