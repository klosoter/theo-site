# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a **Reformed ecclesiology** that emphasized the visible and invisible aspects of the **church**, the primacy of **Word and Sacrament**, and the necessity of **discipline**. He defended the **marks of the true church** and the church’s authority under the supreme headship of **Christ**, while rejecting Roman Catholic claims of papal supremacy and infallibility.

- "The church is not constituted by external succession, but by the true doctrine of the gospel and the lawful use of the sacraments." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Volume 3, Topics 18–20
- The Doctrine of the Church in the Reformed Tradition (secondary, ed. John H. Leith)
- Reformation Thought: An Introduction by Alister E. McGrath (secondary, for context)
- The Church: Contours of Christian Theology by Edmund P. Clowney (secondary, for Reformed ecclesiology context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as Visible and Invisible**
   - Distinguishes between the **visible church** (professing believers and their children) and the **invisible church** (the elect).
   - Asserts that the visible church contains both true and false members.
   - The invisible church is known only to God and consists of the regenerate.
   - This distinction safeguards the doctrine of election and the purity of the gospel.
   - "The church is considered in a twofold manner: either as visible and external, or as invisible and internal." (Institutes, 18.1.1)

2. **Marks of the True Church**
   - Identifies the **pure preaching of the Word**, right administration of the **sacraments**, and faithful **discipline** as the marks.
   - Rejects the necessity of apostolic succession for the church’s legitimacy.
   - Emphasizes doctrinal purity over institutional continuity.
   - These marks distinguish the true church from false assemblies.
   - "The true church is recognized by the pure preaching of the word, the lawful administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline." (Institutes, 18.2.4)

3. **Authority of Scripture over Church Tradition**
   - Asserts the **supremacy of Scripture** as the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
   - Church councils and traditions are subordinate to the Word of God.
   - Rejects the infallibility of the church or pope.
   - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial.
   - "The church is the keeper, not the judge, of the Scriptures." (Institutes, 18.6.5)

4. **Christ as the Only Head of the Church**
   - Denies any earthly vicar of Christ, including the pope.
   - Christ alone governs and preserves his church by his Spirit and Word.
   - All church authority is derived from and limited by Christ’s headship.
   - The unity and catholicity of the church are grounded in union with Christ.
   - "Christ is the only universal head of the church, both in dignity and in efficiency." (Institutes, 18.7.2)

5. **Necessity and Limits of Church Discipline**
   - Discipline is essential for the church’s purity and witness.
   - Excommunication is a last resort, always aiming at restoration.
   - The power of the keys is ministerial, not absolute.
   - Discipline must be exercised according to Scripture, not human tradition.
   - "Discipline is necessary for the preservation of doctrine and morals in the church." (Institutes, 18.30.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s **Reformed ecclesiology** became foundational for later Reformed confessions and church polity, especially in the continental tradition. His careful distinctions between the visible and invisible church, and his articulation of the marks of the true church, shaped Protestant identity in opposition to Roman Catholicism. Turretin’s influence persists in modern Reformed discussions of church authority, discipline, and the relationship between Scripture and tradition. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, confessional understanding of the church’s nature and mission.
