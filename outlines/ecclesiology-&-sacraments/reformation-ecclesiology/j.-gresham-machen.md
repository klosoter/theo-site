# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen’s approach to **Reformation ecclesiology** emphasized the necessity of a **confessional church**, the primacy of **Scripture** as the rule for faith and practice, and the church’s distinctiveness from both secular culture and theological liberalism. He championed the **visible/invisible church distinction** and insisted on the church’s role as the pillar and ground of **gospel proclamation**. Machen’s ecclesiology was deeply shaped by his commitment to the **Reformed tradition** and his opposition to doctrinal compromise.

- "A church is supposed to be a body of people united to seek together a common object, and that object, according to the New Testament, is the propagation of a message." (Christianity and Liberalism)

- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Presbyterian Conflict (1937)
- Selected articles and addresses on church and doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scripture in Church Life**
    - The church derives its authority from **Scripture alone** (sola Scriptura).
    - All doctrine and practice must be tested by the Word of God.
    - Rejects any ecclesiastical authority that supersedes or contradicts Scripture.
    - Upholds the **Westminster Confession** as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
    - "The Bible is the church’s charter; to reject it is to destroy the church." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Confessional Integrity**
    - The church must maintain clear, historic **confessions of faith**.
    - Confessional standards guard against doctrinal drift and theological liberalism.
    - Ministers and members are called to affirm and uphold these confessions.
    - Confessionalism is not optional but essential for true unity.
    - "Indifference about doctrine makes no heroes of the faith." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Visible and Invisible Church Distinction**
    - The **visible church** consists of professing believers and their children.
    - The **invisible church** is the true body of the elect known only to God.
    - The distinction safeguards against identifying the church merely with external organization.
    - Both aspects are necessary for a biblical understanding of the church.
    - "The visible church is not identical with the true church of Christ, but it is the appointed means for the gathering of the elect." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

4. **Church as Guardian of the Gospel**
    - The church’s primary mission is the **proclamation and defense of the gospel**.
    - Faithful preaching and teaching are central to the church’s life.
    - The church must resist cultural accommodation and doctrinal compromise.
    - The purity of the gospel message is the church’s greatest treasure.
    - "The responsibility of the church is to witness to the truth in the midst of error." (Christianity and Liberalism)

5. **Separation from Apostasy**
    - The church must separate from those who deny essential doctrines.
    - Machen advocated for ecclesiastical separation when confessional integrity is lost.
    - True unity is grounded in shared truth, not institutional loyalty.
    - The formation of new ecclesiastical bodies may be necessary for faithfulness.
    - "There must be separation from those who deny the gospel, for the sake of the gospel." (The Presbyterian Conflict)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s **Reformation ecclesiology** shaped the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and influenced conservative Presbyterianism in America. His insistence on **confessional fidelity** and the authority of Scripture continues to inform debates over church identity and mission. Machen’s legacy endures in the ongoing struggle for doctrinal purity and the church’s distinct witness in a secularizing culture.
