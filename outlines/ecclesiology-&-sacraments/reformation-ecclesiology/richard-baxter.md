# Richard Baxter (1615–1691)

Richard Baxter’s **Reformation ecclesiology** emphasized the visible and invisible **church**, the necessity of **gospel preaching**, and the centrality of **church discipline** and **sacramental practice**. He sought a **middle way** between rigid Presbyterianism and episcopacy, advocating for a practical, **pastorally-oriented polity** that prioritized the unity and edification of believers.

- "The church is not a mere shadow or name, but a society of living members, united to Christ their Head." (The Reformed Pastor)

## Key Works

- The Reformed Pastor
- The Saints’ Everlasting Rest
- A Christian Directory
- The True and Only Way of Concord of All the Christian Churches
- Reliquiae Baxterianae

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Church as a Mixed Body**
    - The visible church contains both regenerate and unregenerate members.
    - Emphasizes the distinction between the **visible** and **invisible church**.
    - Membership is based on profession of faith, not infallible evidence of regeneration.
    - The church’s health depends on faithful preaching and discipline.
    - "The church is a garden, not a wilderness; yet there are weeds among the flowers." (The Reformed Pastor)

2. **Primacy of Gospel Preaching**
    - The preaching of the **Word** is the chief mark of a true church.
    - Ministers are called to shepherd souls through clear exposition and application.
    - Preaching is the ordinary means by which God gathers and sanctifies His people.
    - The church’s vitality is measured by the faithfulness of its teaching ministry.
    - "Preaching is the great instrument by which the Spirit works." (The Reformed Pastor)

3. **Moderate Church Polity**
    - Advocated for a **middle way** between episcopacy and Presbyterianism.
    - Supported a form of church government led by elders, but with flexibility.
    - Opposed rigid uniformity, urging for practical unity among Protestants.
    - Emphasized the importance of local church autonomy under Christ’s headship.
    - "I am for unity, but not for tyranny; for order, but not for bondage." (The True and Only Way of Concord)

4. **Necessity of Church Discipline**
    - Discipline is essential for the purity and witness of the church.
    - Advocated for pastoral admonition and, when necessary, exclusion from communion.
    - Discipline should be exercised with charity and a view to restoration.
    - The goal is the spiritual health of both individuals and the congregation.
    - "Discipline is the hedge of the church, without which it will soon be overrun." (The Reformed Pastor)

5. **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
    - Affirmed only two sacraments: **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - Sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant, not mere symbols.
    - Participation requires credible profession of faith.
    - The sacraments nourish faith and strengthen the church’s unity.
    - "The sacraments are Christ’s appointed means for confirming and conveying grace." (A Christian Directory)

## Legacy and Impact

Baxter’s **ecclesiology** shaped English Puritanism and influenced later evangelical thought, especially regarding the **marks of the church** and the role of pastoral ministry. His emphasis on practical unity and moderation provided a model for later attempts at Protestant cooperation. Baxter’s writings remain a resource for those seeking a balanced, biblically grounded vision of the church that avoids both sectarianism and authoritarianism.
