# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s **ecclesiology** is foundational for the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing the distinction between the **visible and invisible church**, the centrality of the **Word and sacraments**, and the necessity of **church discipline**. He taught that the church is the ordinary means by which God gathers and preserves His people, and insisted on its purity through faithful preaching and right administration of the sacraments.

- "Wherever we see the Word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments administered according to Christ’s institution, there, it is not to be doubted, a church of God exists." (Institutes IV.1.9)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (Book IV)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians
- Ecclesiastical Ordinances (1541)
- Selected Letters (esp. correspondence on church order)
- Sermons on Ephesians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The true church is identified by the **pure preaching of the Word** and the **right administration of the sacraments**.
    - Church discipline is a necessary third mark for maintaining holiness.
    - The church’s authority is derivative, not autonomous, and must be exercised under **Scripture**.
    - The visible church contains both elect and hypocrites, but remains the locus of God’s covenant.
    "The pure ministry of the Word and the pure mode of celebrating the sacraments are, as it were, a guarantee that we may safely embrace as a church all who by confession of faith, by example of life, and by participation in the sacraments, profess the same God and Christ with us." (Institutes IV.1.8)

2. **Distinction Between Visible and Invisible Church**
    - The visible church is the outward community of professing believers and their children.
    - The invisible church consists of the **elect** known only to God.
    - Both aspects are necessary for a full understanding of the church’s nature.
    - The visible church, despite its imperfections, is still called holy because of its union with **Christ**.
    "But because, as yet, God’s elect are mingled with the reprobate, and the tares grow together with the wheat, it is necessary to recognize the visible church as containing both." (Institutes IV.1.7)

3. **Necessity of the Church for Salvation**
    - The church is the ordinary means by which God brings people to **salvation**.
    - Calvin calls the church the “mother” of all believers.
    - Separation from the church is equated with spiritual disaster.
    - The Spirit ordinarily works through the church’s ministry of Word and sacrament.
    "For those to whom God is Father, the Church must also be Mother." (Institutes IV.1.1)

4. **Church Polity and Offices**
    - Calvin advocated a system of church government with pastors, teachers, elders, and deacons.
    - He rejected both papal monarchy and radical congregationalism.
    - Church offices are instituted for the edification and order of the body.
    - The plurality of elders and shared leadership guard against tyranny.
    "No church will be found which has not its ministry." (Institutes IV.3.2)

5. **Discipline and the Lord’s Supper**
    - **Church discipline** is essential for maintaining the church’s purity.
    - The Lord’s Supper must be protected from profanation by unworthy participants.
    - Excommunication is a necessary, though sorrowful, means of correction.
    - Discipline is always to be exercised with the goal of restoration.
    "The discipline of the church is like a bridle to restrain and tame those who rage against the doctrine of Christ." (Institutes IV.12.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s **Reformation ecclesiology** profoundly shaped the development of **Reformed confessions**, Presbyterian polity, and the global Protestant understanding of the church. His emphasis on the **marks of the church** and the necessity of discipline influenced later ecclesiastical structures and practices. Calvin’s vision of the church as both visible and invisible continues to inform contemporary debates on church unity, purity, and authority.
