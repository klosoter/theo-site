### ESSAY
Reformation ecclesiology is the rearticulation of the church’s nature, authority, and structure under the conviction that Christ rules his people by his **Word and Spirit** rather than by a monarchical papacy or by the autonomous choice of self-constituting communities. It asks what counts as the church’s essence and what binds congregations together as one holy catholic and apostolic church when inherited late medieval structures are rejected. The Reformation answer centered on **marks of the church**, on the spiritual yet visible **covenant community** that Christ gathers by preaching, sacraments, and discipline, and on **ministerial authority** that is real and divine in origin yet always derivative and accountable. The field is defined by two strategic opponents. On one side, Roman Catholicism, crystallized in the Counter-Reformation, identified the church as a public society with visible unity under bishops in succession from the apostles, especially under the Roman pontiff, in which sacramental communion and hierarchical continuity constitute apostolicity. On the other side, the Radical Reformation insisted that visible purity and voluntary commitment define the church, with separation from a compromised world and the ban as central. The magisterial Reformers insisted that the gospel creates the church, not vice versa, and that the essence of the church is the presence and operation of Christ through his ordained means. This is not an abstract thesis but a comprehensive reconfiguration of how salvation, authority, and community interlock across loci, from **federal theology** to the **means of grace**.

Martin Luther’s reorientation is foundational. Born of the late medieval struggle between papal monarchy and conciliar claims, Luther insisted that the church is creatura verbi, the creature of the Word. This axiom governs his sacramental revisions, his redefinition of ministry, and his recalibration of visibility. In The Babylonian Captivity of the Church and later in On the Councils and the Church, he depicts the church as wherever the gospel is purely preached and the sacraments properly administered. His full list of marks included the Word, Baptism, the Lord’s Supper, the keys, the ministry, prayer and praise, and the holy cross. But the conceptual center is crisp: Christ’s presence is attached to the instituted **means of grace**, and the public proclamation and administration of these means identify the church’s location in the world. Crucially, Luther refuses both a merely inward invisibility and a merely institutional visibility. The sinners in the church do not negate its reality, because the church’s holiness is alien and given in Christ. Yet the church is not reducible to invisible election; it gathers in assemblies where the gospel sounds and the sacraments are given. This configuration depends on two theological commitments. First, the Christological conviction that Christ himself is active through the preached Word, so that preaching is not human advice but divine address. Second, the pneumatological conviction that the Spirit unites hearers to Christ through faith, so the church’s cohesion is spiritual yet mediated. His two kingdoms doctrine, often misunderstood, preserves the church’s ministry from the coercions proper to civil authority, even if in practice the German context entailed princely oversight. Examiners will rightly press whether this oversight collapsed into Erastianism. The doctrinal answer is that Luther’s locus of authority remained **ministerial**, not magisterial: the keys are exercised in preaching and absolution, and the church’s power is to forgive and to bind through the gospel. Where princes intruded, the intrusion did not define Lutheran doctrine but compromised it in practice.

John Calvin develops Luther’s thesis with greater architectural precision and with a thicker account of polity and discipline. In Institutes book 4, Calvin gives the classic Reformed formula. The church is the mother of believers because she is the sphere of the **means of grace**, the Spirit’s appointed economy for engrafting and nourishing saints. The church’s **marks** are pure preaching of the Word and right administration of the sacraments, to which Calvin often adds discipline as a necessary implication of the other two. Unlike Luther’s more diffuse enumeration, Calvin’s marks are tied to the economy of salvation: where the created means for union with Christ are faithfully operated, the church is present. Calvin’s visible and invisible distinction is no sleight of hand but a disciplined disaggregation of two biblical ascriptions. The invisible church names the totality of the elect known to God; the visible church names the historical congregations in which Christ is truly present through Word and sacraments. Thus, defect and mixture do not empty a church of its reality, because the church’s holiness is forensic and sanctifying in Christ, not a sociological purity. At the same time, the visible church is not merely any assembly labeling itself Christian. Without the gospel rightly preached and sacraments rightly administered, the institutional shape has lost its essence. This is the framework within which Calvin’s robust account of **ministerial authority** and **presbyterian** rule sits. Christ is the sole head of the church, but he governs by officers he gives, pastors and teachers for Word ministry, and elders for governance, with deacons to administer mercy. The consistory is the concrete form of shared spiritual oversight, and discipline is medicinal, ordered to the restoration of sinners and the maintenance of the Lord’s table. Critics will test whether discipline becomes Donatism. Calvin’s response is instructive. Donatism made the church’s being and sacramental efficacy depend on the purity of ministers. Reformed discipline does the opposite: it presupposes the objective integrity of the means of grace and uses discipline to keep the congregation’s profession of the gospel uncontradicted by public, impenitent scandal. Discipline is not perfectionism; it is the church’s ordinary care for truth and love, inseparable from the Supper’s communion.

Calvin’s refutation of Cardinal Sadoleto shows how this ecclesiology contests Rome’s claim to catholicity. The question was not whether reformers enjoyed institutional continuity under Rome; they denied papal jurisdiction. The question was whether the gospel heard in Scripture or the Roman see determined the church’s identity. Calvin insists that apostolicity is succession in doctrine and sacrament, not in a juridical chain. Councils are honored when they bind consciences with Scripture, not by their mere decree. This does not dissolve catholicity into subjectivism. It anchors catholicity in the catholic rule of truth and in shared **means of grace** across space and time, the only unity the New Testament promises. Thus Calvin can both condemn Rome’s doctrinal corruptions and concede that God has his people within Roman bounds, because the Spirit is not bound to perfect institutions.

Martin Bucer stands between Luther and Calvin as the mediator who made discipline ecclesiologically essential. In Strasbourg and later in England, Bucer argued in On the Kingdom of Christ that the spiritual government of Christ over his church is exercised through pastoral oversight that is personal, communal, and purposive, oriented to forming a people ordered to love of God and neighbor. Bucer deepened the connection between sacramental communion and communal holiness, so that fencing the table and catechetical discipline were not mere appendages to preaching but modes of Christ’s shepherding. His practical genius lay in crafting structures that made discipline normal rather than extraordinary, congregational yet collegial. Bucer’s influence on Geneva’s consistory and on Cranmer’s reforms shows how the Reformation’s ecclesiology was institutional, not merely doctrinal. It produced forms of life that cohered with its theology of **Word and Spirit**, which is why English and Scottish Presbyterianism absorbed Bucer’s insights into **ministerial** parity, elder rule, and restorative discipline.

Menno Simons exemplifies the Radical Reformation’s alternative. For him, the church is a gathered community of confessors, a visible society of the regenerate who walk in obedience and separate from the world. Menno’s insistence on believers’ baptism and the ban aimed to realize a community without coercion, bonded by manifest holiness. The conceptual strength of this position is its protest against nominalism and its witness that membership in Christ demands real repentance. Yet its weakness is ecclesiological idealism. By making visible moral purity too near the essence of the church, it tilts toward sectarian fragmentation. In practice, the ban and shunning that maintain purity often suppress the very gospel that calls sinners to restoration. Reformed examiners should avoid caricature. Menno and the Schleitheim stream did not deny grace but sought a church form that did not domesticate Jesus’ commands. The Reformed critique appeals to the economy of grace in history: the **covenant community** includes wheat and tares until the harvest, and the goal of discipline is communion, not visible perfection. The division with the Magisterial Reformers lies in how the church’s holiness is defined and secured, and whether civil order can be cooperated with without religious coercion.

Robert Bellarmine represents the Counter-Reformation’s most sophisticated case that the Reformers destroyed the church. For Bellarmine, the true church is a visible society like a polity, with public profession of true doctrine, participation in the same sacraments, and subjection to lawful pastors, especially the Roman pontiff as visible head. Apostolic succession secures indefectibility and doctrinal continuity; the council of Trent’s sacramental definitions anchor the church’s mediation of grace. The debate with the Reformers thus concentrates on visibility, authority, and apostolicity. Bellarmine denies the invisible church as a distinct referent, arguing that the church’s holiness and unity are always publicly identifiable, and he treats private interpretation as the seed of dissolution. The Reformers countered that visibility is real but ministerial and ordered to the gospel, and that apostolicity is measured by Scripture’s doctrine, not by a chain of ordinations. The issue is not whether succession matters but what it succeeds in. The Reformed answer is that properly ordained ministry is essential to the church’s good order, yet its form and continuity serve the truth. Succession without truth succeeds only a chair, not the apostles.

Within the magisterial tradition, internal debates sharpened the doctrine. Luther’s relative reticence about excommunication and his reliance on civic enforcement generated a long-running Lutheran ambivalence about whether discipline pertains to the church’s being or well-being. Meanwhile, Reformed churches treated discipline as at least essential to the church’s well-being and often as among its **marks**. The Westminster standards treat discipline as one of the keys and require church censures to maintain communion, while acknowledging varying degrees of purity across churches. Polity disagreements also mattered. Presbyterians grounded jure divino governance in the New Testament’s pattern of plural elders, graded courts, and synodal authority. They argued that Acts 15 shows a binding council with ministerial authority, that Titus 1 and Acts 14 show plural presbyters in each city, and that Matthew 18’s promise of Christ’s presence to the church’s judgment assumes a corporate body beyond the local congregation. Congregationalists argued for the sufficiency of the local congregation’s power of the keys and treated associations as advisory. Episcopalians insisted on historic episcopacy as a form of good order. The present defense is presbyterian, not as a condition of church being but as the normative, apostolic pattern: parity of elders safeguards **ministerial** rather than monarchical rule, graded assemblies check local abuses, and connectionalism realizes catholicity without papal monarchy. Examiners will press the scriptural warrant. The presbyterian case points to the Jerusalem council’s doctrinal decree delivered to multiple churches, to Timothy’s and Titus’s appointment of elders with parity, to the sanction of 1 Corinthians 5 for corporate discipline, and to Hebrews 13’s obedience to leaders in the plural.

The Reformation’s visible and invisible distinction is frequently attacked as a rationalization for division. But the distinction is in service of catholicity, not relativism. It honors biblical ascriptions that the church is a chosen people known to God and a gathered assembly under the means Christ appointed. It explains why separated communions can share one Lord, one faith, one baptism, notwithstanding grievous faults, and it provides a grammar for assessing churches without either declaring that only one institution is the church or collapsing truth into private experience. It also explains the Reformed judgment about Rome. The Reformed orthodox often said that Rome, as a system, obscures and corrupts the gospel so gravely that it cannot be called a true church simpliciter, yet within Rome God preserves his people by the remnants of truth and sacrament. This is not fence-sitting but a precise application of the **marks**. Where the Word is denied in essentials, the form of church remains but its identity is impaired. The marks carry gradations: churches are more or less pure. That same grammar guards against Donatism. The church’s reality does not rise and fall with every pastor’s sin or every congregation’s defect, because its being rests on Christ’s promise to operate through ordained means, not on human achievement.

This ecclesiology is not modular. It interlocks with soteriology, sacramentology, and covenant theology. The identification of preaching and sacraments as **means of grace** that unite to Christ presupposes that grace is not a substance but God’s favor and fellowship given in Christ and applied by the Spirit. It presupposes a sacramental realism in which Christ is truly present in the Supper for believers, not by local change but by spiritual feeding through faith. It presupposes a **federal theology** in which the church is the **covenant community** gathered under the new covenant promise, continuous with Israel as to grace and distinct as to administration. This is why infant baptism belongs to Reformed ecclesiology. The church is not a club of self-selected adults but the household of God, and the promise is to you and your children. Baptism publicly seals incorporation into the visible church, to be answered with faith as the Spirit gives. Anabaptist objections that such a church is indistinct from the world misunderstand the covenantal frame. The covenant cuts and gathers, and discipline preserves the table without making visible perfection a condition of being. Critics will ask whether this covenantal ecclesiology produces complacency. The antidote is disciplined catechesis and meaningful membership that tie **means of grace** to real discipleship.

Reformation ecclesiology confronts modern stress tests. Denominational fragmentation tempts either a return to Rome or a cynical pluralism. The Reformed solution doubles down on the **marks** as criteria of unity. Churches that preach the gospel and administer the sacraments can recognize one another as true churches, even while contending for greater purity and for biblically warranted polity. Ecumenism must be doctrinally principled, aiming for concord without sacrificing truth. The rise of parachurch ministries obscures the primacy of the church. The Reformed stance is appreciative but subordinating: para-ministries serve the church’s mission, but they do not exercise the keys or administer sacraments. The multisite and online church phenomenon presses the definition of assembly. The ecclesia is an actual gathering under Word and sacrament, ordered by **ministerial** oversight. Livestreamed preaching can edify, but the church’s constitutive acts require embodied presence, accountable membership, and table fellowship under elders. Abuses of authority demand transparent accountability. Here the presbyterian system’s graded courts and plurality of elders are not bureaucratic but theological embodiments of Christ’s non-tyrannical rule. The remedy for abuse is not the dissolution of authority but its reform according to Christ’s **ministerial** pattern.

Ordination debates should be treated in principle, not culture war terms. The Reformation reasserted that Christ gives officers for the church’s upbuilding, with the teaching office tied to the ministry of the Word and sacraments and elder rule. The Reformed tradition grounds qualifications not in talent or charisma but in scriptural criteria. The question of women’s ordination must be answered in this frame. Catholicity is not served by inventing offices contrary to apostolic instruction. The church’s flourishing is served by the full deployment of gifts in biblically ordered roles. Examiners might ask whether this view marginalizes women or suppresses gifts. The robust answer is that the church is a body with many members and that office is not the only or highest form of service. The Reformation’s insight remains: authority in the church is service under Christ’s yoke and by his **Word and Spirit**.

Finally, the Reformation’s ecclesiology offers a chastened confidence. It refuses Bellarmine’s identification of the church with a juridical corpus under a visible head, because such identification risks binding consciences to human claimants. It refuses Menno’s perfectionist separatism, because such separatism risks dissolving the church into endlessly purifying cells. It insists that Christ’s promise to build his church rests on his appointed **means of grace** and that his church is indefectible though every particular congregation is fallible. The **marks of the church** remain the operational criteria in a fragmented age. Pure preaching is not rhetorical flair but the proclamation of Christ crucified according to Scripture. Right sacraments are not bare signs but Christ’s own seals that effect what they signify in those who believe. Faithful discipline is not power but love, the pastorally administered **keys of the kingdom** that bind and loose for the sake of communion. The **ministerial authority** that exercises the keys is real because it is Christ’s gift and limited because it is Christ’s. The **covenant community** gathered around the Lord’s table is visible and imperfect, yet genuinely holy because it is set apart by the Word and inhabited by the Spirit. Here is the position to own and defend before any examiner: the Reformed church is catholic by truth, reformed by Scripture, and ordered by presbyterian polity so that Christ, not princes or popular will, rules his people. When pressed about unity, succession, or discipline, the defense returns to the same lodestar. The church is where Christ is at work by his **Word and Spirit**. He has not left himself without witness, and his people will be known by the voice they heed, the table they share, and the life together they discipline in love.

### RECAP NOTES

  - Bucer: discipline essential to pastoral rule, consistory, shaping Reformed and English practice.
  - Menno Simons: believers’ church, ban and separation, visible purity as defining trait.
  - Bellarmine: church as visible society under papal headship, succession and indefectibility.
- Debates:
  - Internal: marks and discipline’s status, presbyterian versus congregational versus episcopal polity, church and magistrate, visible and invisible church.
  - External: Roman visibility and succession versus apostolicity by truth, Radical purity and separation versus covenantal holiness.
  - Contemporary: denominationalism and principled ecumenism, online and multisite assembly, parachurch scope, abuse and accountability, ordination patterns.
- Defended position: Reformed and presbyterian; the church’s essence is the presence of Christ by the **means of grace** with three marks, connectional **ministerial authority**, and catholicity grounded in truth rather than papal succession, rejecting both Erastian control and separatist perfectionism.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Is the visible and invisible distinction a cover for division? It safeguards biblical ascriptions and catholicity without collapsing truth into one institution.
  - Is discipline Donatist? No, it is medicinal and presupposes the objective efficacy of the means of grace.
  - How is apostolicity preserved without succession? By succession in doctrine and ministry ordered to Scripture’s truth and right sacraments.
  - What warrants presbyterian polity? Plural elders, graded assemblies, and binding synodal action evident in the New Testament pattern.
  - Is Rome a true church? Rome’s system corrupts essentials, yet God preserves his people within by remaining truth and sacrament; churches are more or less pure.
