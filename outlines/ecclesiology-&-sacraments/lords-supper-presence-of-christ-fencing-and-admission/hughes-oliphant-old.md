## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, not physically but by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Supper is a means of grace, effecting communion with the risen Lord.
    - Old draws on **Calvin** and the **Reformed tradition** to articulate this presence.
    - The focus is on participation in Christ rather than mere remembrance.
    "The Reformed tradition has always insisted that Christ is present in the Supper, but present spiritually." (Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church)

2. **Fencing the Table**
    - The Lord’s Table must be approached with reverence and self-examination.
    - Ministers are responsible to warn against unworthy participation.
    - Fencing serves both to protect the sanctity of the sacrament and to shepherd souls.
    - Old emphasizes pastoral care in the practice of fencing, not mere exclusion.
    "The fencing of the table is an act of pastoral care, not simply an act of discipline." (Worship: Reformed According to Scripture)

3. **Admission to Communion**
    - Admission is grounded in credible profession of faith and **baptism**.
    - The church exercises discernment, not arbitrary exclusion.
    - Old upholds the historic Reformed practice of **catechesis** before admission.
    - The goal is to nurture genuine participation in Christ’s body.
    "Admission to the Lord’s Table is a matter of pastoral discernment, guided by the Word and the Spirit." (Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church)

4. **Formative Role of the Supper**
    - The Supper shapes the identity and piety of the church.
    - Participation forms believers in gratitude, humility, and unity.
    - Old highlights the Supper’s role in the rhythm of **Lord’s Day worship**.
    - The sacrament is both a sign and a means of **sanctification**.
    "The Lord’s Supper is at the heart of the church’s worship and the believer’s sanctification." (Worship: Reformed According to Scripture)

5. **Continuity with Historic Reformed Practice**
    - Old draws on **patristic** and Reformed sources to inform contemporary practice.
    - He stresses the importance of liturgical continuity and theological depth.
    - The Supper is celebrated with reverence, following historic forms.
    - Old advocates retrieval of classic Reformed liturgies for today’s church.
    "Our celebration of the Lord’s Supper must be rooted in the wisdom of the church through the ages." (The Patristic Roots of Reformed Worship)
