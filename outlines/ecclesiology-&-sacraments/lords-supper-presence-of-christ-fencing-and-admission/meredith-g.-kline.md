# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **Lord’s Supper** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing its function as a covenant renewal ceremony rather than a metaphysical transformation of the elements. He stressed the **real presence of Christ** as covenantal and spiritual, not corporeal, and advocated for careful **fencing of the table** in line with the church’s responsibility to uphold the integrity of the covenant community.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a covenant meal, a sacramental sign and seal of the redemptive grant of Christ’s kingdom." ("By Oath Consigned")

- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Renewal as Central Function**
    - The Lord’s Supper is primarily a covenant renewal ceremony, echoing Old Testament covenant meals.
    - Participation signifies ongoing allegiance to the **covenant Lord**.
    - The Supper is a means by which the church corporately reaffirms its identity as the people of God.
    - The meal is not merely commemorative but actively engages participants in covenantal realities.
    - "The sacrament is a renewal of the oath of allegiance to the Lord of the covenant." (By Oath Consigned)

2. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is present in the Supper by the Holy Spirit, not physically or locally in the elements.
    - The efficacy of the Supper depends on the Spirit’s work, not on any change in the bread and wine.
    - The Supper mediates covenant blessings to believers through faith.
    - The focus is on union with the risen Christ, not on the elements themselves.
    - "The presence of Christ in the sacrament is covenantal and spiritual, not corporeal." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Fencing the Table as Covenant Guardianship**
    - Admission to the Supper is restricted to those who credibly profess faith and are members of the covenant community.
    - The church has a duty to guard the table, excluding those under discipline or without a credible profession.
    - Fencing the table protects the sanctity of the covenant and the purity of the church.
    - The practice reflects the seriousness of covenant obligations and blessings.
    - "The church must exercise discipline in the administration of the sacrament, for it is a covenantal act." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Admission Based on Covenant Status**
    - Only those who have received the covenant sign (baptism) and are in good standing may partake.
    - Admission is not based on subjective experience but on objective covenant membership.
    - The Supper is not a means of individualistic piety but of corporate covenant renewal.
    - The church’s role is to discern and affirm covenant status, not to judge hearts.
    - "Participation in the Lord’s Supper is a privilege of covenant membership." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Typological and Eschatological Dimensions**
    - The Supper points back to the Passover and forward to the Messianic banquet.
    - It is a foretaste of the consummation of the covenant in the kingdom of God.
    - Typology shapes the understanding of the meal’s significance in redemptive history.
    - The Supper is both a memorial and a pledge of future glory.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is an anticipation of the eschatological fulfillment of the covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to the **Lord’s Supper** has influenced Reformed sacramental theology, especially regarding the **spiritual presence of Christ** and the church’s responsibility in fencing the table. His emphasis on covenant renewal and typology has shaped discussions on the meaning and administration of the Supper in Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Kline’s work continues to inform debates on the relationship between covenant membership, discipline, and sacramental participation.
