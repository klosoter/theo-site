# Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–1562)

Peter Martyr Vermigli advanced a **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **spiritual presence of Christ** and a robust distinction from both Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran consubstantiation. He upheld the necessity of **fencing the table** and careful **admission to the sacrament**, insisting on the importance of faith for proper participation and warning against unworthy reception.

- "We do not deny that Christ is truly present in the Supper, but we affirm that he is present spiritually, not physically." (Loci Communes)

## Key Works

- Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (especially on chapter 11)
- The Oxford Disputation on the Eucharist of 1549
- Peter Martyr Vermigli and the European Reformations: Semper Reformanda (ed. Frank A. James III)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not in a corporeal or local manner.
    - The believer partakes of Christ by the **Holy Spirit** through faith.
    - The elements remain bread and wine; there is no change in substance.
    - The **sacramental union** is real but spiritual, not physical.
    - "The body of Christ is in heaven, but by faith we are lifted up to him." (Loci Communes)

2. **Rejection of Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation**
    - Denies the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation as unbiblical and philosophically incoherent.
    - Rejects Lutheran consubstantiation, arguing against the ubiquity of Christ’s human nature.
    - Affirms that Christ’s body is locally in heaven, not on earth.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency of the **means of grace** without a physical presence.
    - "We must not confound the sign with the thing signified." (Loci Communes)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Participation**
    - Only those who receive by faith truly partake of Christ’s benefits.
    - The sacrament is efficacious for believers, but not for unbelievers.
    - Faith is the instrument by which the soul feeds on Christ.
    - Unworthy reception brings judgment, not blessing.
    - "Without faith, the sacrament is received to condemnation." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

4. **Fencing the Table and Church Discipline**
    - The church must guard the table from open and notorious sinners.
    - Ministers have a duty to warn and, if necessary, exclude the unrepentant.
    - Admission to the Supper requires credible profession of faith.
    - Fencing the table preserves the holiness of the sacrament and the church.
    - "It is the office of pastors to keep the holy things from dogs and swine." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

5. **Covenantal and Memorial Aspects**
    - The Supper is a **covenant meal** that signifies and seals union with Christ.
    - It is a memorial of Christ’s death, but more than a bare remembrance.
    - The rite strengthens faith and assures believers of God’s promises.
    - The Supper is a means of grace within the context of the covenant community.
    - "The Supper is a remembrance, but also a spiritual nourishment for the faithful." (Loci Communes)

## Legacy and Impact

Vermigli’s articulation of the **spiritual presence** in the Lord’s Supper became foundational for later **Reformed sacramental theology**, influencing figures like Calvin and the Reformed confessions. His careful attention to **fencing and admission** shaped Reformed church polity and pastoral practice. Vermigli’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the necessity of faith, the spiritual efficacy of the sacraments, and the church’s responsibility to guard the table.
