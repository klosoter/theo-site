# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** that emphasizes the **spiritual presence of Christ**, the necessity of **worthy reception**, and the importance of **fencing the table** through pastoral oversight. Admission to the Supper is reserved for those who profess faith and are not under church discipline, reflecting the Standards’ concern for the purity of the church and the proper administration of the **means of grace**.

- "The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent." (Westminster Confession of Faith 29.5)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 29 (“Of the Lord’s Supper”)
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Q&A 168–177
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q&A 96–97
- The Directory for the Publick Worship of God (sections on the Lord’s Supper)
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
   - Christ is truly, but spiritually and not physically, present to the faith of believers in the Supper.
   - The elements remain bread and wine, but believers feed on Christ by faith.
   - The Supper is a means of grace, effectual only for those who receive it in faith.
   - The real presence is not local or corporal, but by the Holy Spirit’s work.
   - "The body and blood of Christ are... spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses." (WCF 29.7)

2. **Fencing the Table**
   - Ministers are required to warn against unworthy participation.
   - The church must guard the table from those who are ignorant or scandalous.
   - Public admonition and examination may precede the Supper.
   - Fencing serves to protect both the purity of the sacrament and the souls of participants.
   - "All ignorant and ungodly persons... are unfit to enjoy communion with him; so are they unworthy of the Lord’s table." (WLC 173)

3. **Admission by Profession and Discipline**
   - Only those who profess faith in Christ and are not under discipline may be admitted.
   - The session (elders) oversees admission to the Supper.
   - The unrepentant or scandalous are to be barred from participation.
   - Admission is not automatic with baptism, but requires credible profession.
   - "Such as are found to be ignorant or scandalous... ought not to be admitted to the Lord’s Supper." (Directory for Publick Worship)

4. **Worthy Reception**
   - Self-examination is required before coming to the table.
   - Worthy receivers partake by faith, discerning the Lord’s body.
   - The Supper is not a mere memorial, but a spiritual feeding on Christ.
   - Unworthy participation brings judgment rather than blessing.
   - "It is required of them that would worthily partake... that they examine themselves." (WSC 97)

5. **Sacramental Union and Efficacy**
   - The elements are signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
   - There is a sacramental union between the sign and the thing signified.
   - The efficacy of the Supper depends on the work of the Spirit, not the elements themselves.
   - The Supper strengthens faith, assures believers, and fosters communion with Christ and one another.
   - "Worthy receivers... do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified." (WCF 29.7)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have shaped the **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper** in Presbyterian and many other Protestant churches, emphasizing the necessity of faith, the spiritual presence of Christ, and the pastoral responsibility to fence the table. Their teaching on admission and discipline has influenced church polity and sacramental practice for centuries. The Standards’ careful articulation of the Supper as a means of grace continues to guide theological reflection and pastoral ministry in the Reformed tradition.
