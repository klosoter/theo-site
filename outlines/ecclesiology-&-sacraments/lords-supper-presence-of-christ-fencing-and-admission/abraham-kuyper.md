# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached the **Lord’s Supper** with a robust emphasis on the **covenantal presence of Christ**, maintaining a Reformed distinction from both Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran consubstantiation. He stressed the importance of **fencing the table** and **church discipline** as means to preserve the sacrament’s sanctity, while also advocating for the Supper as a means of grace for the covenant community.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not for the world, but for the congregation of the Lord, and must be fenced accordingly." (Our Worship)

    - The sacrament is a communal act, reinforcing the bonds of the church.
    - Admission is tied to credible profession of faith and covenant status.
    - "Only those who belong to the covenant may partake of the covenant meal." (Our Worship)

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church has a duty to guard the table from unworthy participation.
    - Elders are responsible for examining and admitting communicants.
    - Fencing protects both the holiness of the sacrament and the souls of participants.
    - Discipline is exercised to prevent scandal and hypocrisy at the table.
    - "The table must be fenced, lest the holy be given to the profane." (Our Worship)

4. **Means of Grace**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a true means of grace, nourishing believers spiritually.
    - The efficacy of the Supper depends on the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith is the instrument by which grace is received in the sacrament.
    - The Supper strengthens assurance and sanctification in the life of the believer.
    - "The sacrament is a channel through which grace flows to the faithful." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

5. **Church Discipline and Admission**
    - Admission to the table is inseparable from the exercise of church discipline.
    - The elders must discern the spiritual condition of prospective communicants.
    - Discipline is restorative, aiming to bring sinners to repentance and renewed fellowship.
    - The purity of the church is maintained through careful admission practices.
    - "Discipline and admission to the Lord’s table are two sides of the same coin." (Our Worship)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s theology of the **Lord’s Supper** reinforced the centrality of the sacrament in Reformed worship and highlighted the importance of **covenantal boundaries** and church discipline. His emphasis on the spiritual presence of Christ and the communal nature of the Supper influenced Dutch Reformed practice and broader neo-Calvinist thought. Kuyper’s careful articulation of fencing and admission continues to shape discussions on sacramental theology and church polity within Reformed circles.
