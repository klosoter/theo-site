# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Lord’s Supper** through his distinctive **multiperspectivalism**, emphasizing the real spiritual presence of **Christ** while upholding the importance of **covenant community** and **fencing the table**. He affirms that the Supper is a means of grace, not merely a memorial, and that proper **admission** and **self-examination** are vital for the church’s health and witness.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a covenantal meal in which Christ is spiritually present to bless his people." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief" (2013)
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life" (2008)
- "Worship in Spirit and Truth" (1996)
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God" (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
   - Christ is truly, though not physically, present in the Supper by the Holy Spirit.
   - The Supper is more than a memorial; it is a means of grace for believers.
   - The presence is covenantal, rooted in God’s promises to his people.
   - Participation involves real communion with the risen Lord.
   - "Christ is present in the Supper, not physically, but by his Spirit, to bless those who partake in faith." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Multiperspectival Approach to the Sacrament**
   - The Lord’s Supper must be understood through normative (biblical), situational (historical), and existential (personal) perspectives.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in sacramental theology.
   - It encourages the church to consider doctrine, context, and individual faith together.
   - Multiperspectivalism shapes both theology and practice of the Supper.
   - "We must look at the Lord’s Supper from every angle Scripture gives us." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Fencing the Table**
   - The church has a duty to guard the Supper from unworthy participation.
   - Fencing is an act of pastoral care, not legalism.
   - Self-examination and church discipline are necessary for proper admission.
   - The goal is to protect both the purity of the church and the well-being of individuals.
   - "Fencing the table is a loving act, intended to protect both the church and the individual from harm." ("Worship in Spirit and Truth")

4. **Admission to the Table**
   - Admission is for those who credibly profess faith in Christ and are baptized.
   - The church must balance openness with discernment regarding communicants.
   - Children’s participation is considered in light of their profession and understanding.
   - The Supper is a sign of unity, so admission reflects the boundaries of the covenant community.
   - "Admission to the table is for those who have made a credible profession of faith." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Means of Grace and Covenant Renewal**
   - The Lord’s Supper is a means by which God strengthens faith and assures believers.
   - It is an act of covenant renewal, reminding the church of God’s promises.
   - The Supper nourishes believers spiritually as they receive Christ by faith.
   - Regular participation is vital for the ongoing life of the church.
   - "The Supper is a means of grace, a covenant renewal ceremony in which God assures us of his promises." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **spiritual presence** and his multiperspectival method have influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on the Lord’s Supper, especially regarding the balance of doctrinal fidelity and pastoral sensitivity. His emphasis on **fencing the table** and thoughtful admission practices has shaped church policies in many conservative Presbyterian and Reformed contexts. Frame’s work continues to provide a robust theological framework for understanding the Lord’s Supper as both a means of grace and a covenantal act.
