# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the **Lord’s Supper** as a covenantal means of grace, emphasizing the **spiritual presence of Christ** and the sacramental union between sign and reality. He maintained a Reformed understanding of **fencing the table** and **admission** to the Supper, insisting on the necessity of faith and proper ecclesiastical oversight to preserve the sacrament’s integrity.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a means of grace in which Christ communicates Himself to the believer in a spiritual, not a corporeal, manner." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on sacraments and covenant)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but His presence is spiritual, not physical.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates the believer’s communion with Christ during the sacrament.
    - The Supper is a participation in Christ’s benefits, not a repetition of His sacrifice.
    - The mode of presence is covenantal, rooted in union with Christ.
    - "The presence of Christ is real, but it is spiritual and appropriated by faith." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

2. **Means of Grace and Covenant Context**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a divinely instituted means of grace within the covenant of grace.
    - It confirms God’s promises and strengthens faith through visible signs.
    - The sacrament is inseparable from the Word and the covenant community.
    - Participation is a covenantal act, not a mere memorial.
    - "The sacraments are the seals of the covenant, confirming the promises to the believer." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church has a duty to guard the sacrament from profanation.
    - Only those who make a credible profession of faith should be admitted.
    - Fencing protects both the holiness of the Supper and the spiritual well-being of participants.
    - Discipline is exercised pastorally, not legalistically.
    - "Admission to the table is not a right, but a privilege for those who discern the Lord’s body." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

4. **Admission and Ecclesiastical Oversight**
    - Admission is regulated by the visible church under Christ’s authority.
    - Elders are responsible for examining communicants’ faith and life.
    - The Supper is for the covenant community, not for the world at large.
    - Proper admission maintains the church’s purity and witness.
    - "The oversight of the table belongs to the elders, who act as stewards of the mysteries of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

5. **Faith as the Instrument of Reception**
    - Faith is necessary for receiving the benefits of the Supper.
    - The sacrament does not confer grace ex opere operato.
    - Unbelievers receive only the outward elements, not the reality signified.
    - The efficacy of the Supper is tied to the Spirit’s work in the heart.
    - "Without faith, the sacrament is empty of saving benefit, though the sign remains." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **spiritual presence of Christ** and covenantal context of the Lord’s Supper has shaped Reformed sacramental theology in the twentieth century and beyond. His careful attention to the relationship between sign and reality, as well as his insistence on ecclesiastical oversight and fencing, provided a robust framework for understanding the Supper’s role in the life of the church. Vos’s influence endures in both academic and pastoral settings, especially among those committed to a confessional Reformed approach to the means of grace.
