# Joachim Jeremias (1900–1979)

Joachim Jeremias approached the **Lord’s Supper** as a central act of the early Christian community, emphasizing its roots in **Jewish Passover tradition** and the significance of **Christ’s presence** as understood through historical context. He argued that the Supper was both a **memorial** and a **proclamation** of Christ’s redemptive work, with the practice of **fencing and admission** reflecting the ethical and communal boundaries of the early church. Jeremias’s scholarship focused on reconstructing the original meaning and setting of the Supper to clarify its theological implications.

- "Jesus did not merely institute a memorial meal; he gave a meal with eschatological significance, a pledge of the coming kingdom." (The Eucharistic Words of Jesus)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Roots in Jewish Passover**
   - The Lord’s Supper is best understood against the background of the Jewish Passover meal.
   - Jesus intentionally adapted Passover elements to institute the Supper.
   - The meal’s structure and symbolism reflect continuity with Jewish tradition.
   - The eschatological hope of Israel is carried forward in the Christian rite.
   - "The Last Supper was a Passover meal, and its form and content are determined by this fact." (The Eucharistic Words of Jesus)

2. **Presence of Christ as Eschatological and Proclamatory**
   - Christ’s presence is not physical but is realized through proclamation and communal participation.
   - The Supper anticipates the final consummation in the kingdom of God.
   - The act of eating and drinking proclaims the Lord’s death until he comes.
   - The Supper is a foretaste of the messianic banquet.
   - "The meal is a pledge of the coming salvation, a foretaste of the messianic feast." (The Eucharistic Words of Jesus)

3. **Memorial and Proclamation**
   - The Supper is a memorial (anamnesis) that recalls and makes present the saving work of Christ.
   - It is an act of thanksgiving and proclamation of the gospel.
   - The community is called to remember and declare the Lord’s death.
   - The memorial aspect is inseparable from the eschatological hope.
   - "Do this in remembrance of me means: celebrate this meal as a memorial of my redemptive death." (The Eucharistic Words of Jesus)

4. **Fencing and Admission Reflect Early Church Practice**
   - Participation in the Supper was restricted to the baptized and those in good standing.
   - Ethical and communal discipline was exercised to preserve the meal’s sanctity.
   - The Supper functioned as a boundary marker for the true community.
   - Exclusion from the meal signified exclusion from the benefits of Christ.
   - "Admission to the Lord’s Supper was regulated by the earliest Christian communities to safeguard its meaning." (Jerusalem in the Time of Jesus)

5. **Communal and Covenantal Dimensions**
   - The Supper establishes and renews the covenant community.
   - It expresses fellowship with Christ and with one another.
   - The meal is a sign of unity and mutual responsibility within the body.
   - The covenantal aspect is rooted in Jesus’ words over the cup.
   - "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you." (The Eucharistic Words of Jesus)

## Legacy and Impact

Jeremias’s research profoundly shaped modern understanding of the **Lord’s Supper** by grounding its meaning in the historical and Jewish context of Jesus’ ministry. His work influenced both scholarly and ecclesial discussions about the nature of **Christ’s presence** and the practice of **fencing and admission** in the church. By emphasizing the communal and eschatological dimensions of the Supper, Jeremias provided a framework that continues to inform contemporary liturgical theology and ecumenical dialogue. His insistence on historical context remains a standard in New Testament studies.
