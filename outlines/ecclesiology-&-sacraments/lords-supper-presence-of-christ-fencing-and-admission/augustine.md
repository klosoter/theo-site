# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** emphasizes the **spiritual presence of Christ** rather than a physical or local presence in the elements. He underscores the necessity of **faith** for proper participation, and insists on the importance of **church discipline** in the admission and exclusion of communicants, anticipating later practices of **fencing the table**.

- "If you receive it well, you are what you receive." (Sermon 272)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- Sermons (especially Sermons 227, 272, 273)
- Tractates on the Gospel of John
- The City of God
- Letter 54 (To Januarius)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is present in the Supper **spiritually**, not physically or locally.
    - The bread and wine are **signs** that point to a deeper reality.
    - The true reception of Christ occurs **by faith**.
    - The Supper is a **means of grace** for believers.
    - "For if you receive it well, you are what you receive." (Sermon 272)

2. **Sacramental Sign and Reality**
    - The elements are **visible signs** of an invisible grace.
    - There is a distinction between the **sign (sacramentum)** and the **thing signified (res sacramenti)**.
    - The sign is not to be confused with the reality it points to.
    - The Supper communicates grace to those who approach in faith.
    - "This is the bread which you see on the altar; sanctified by the word of God, it is the body of Christ." (Sermon 227)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Participation**
    - Only those with **true faith** receive the benefit of the sacrament.
    - Unbelievers may receive the sign but not the reality.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ in the Supper.
    - The Supper is not efficacious ex opere operato.
    - "Why do you prepare your teeth and stomach? Believe, and you have eaten." (Tractate on John 25.12)

4. **Fencing and Admission to the Table**
    - The church must exercise **discipline** regarding who may partake.
    - Participation is reserved for those in **communion with the church**.
    - Unrepentant sinners are to be excluded from the Supper.
    - Admission reflects the unity and holiness of the body of Christ.
    - "Let a man examine himself, and so eat of that bread." (Sermon 227)

5. **Communion and Ecclesial Unity**
    - The Supper is a sign of the **unity of the church**.
    - Participation expresses and strengthens **fellowship among believers**.
    - The sacrament is not merely individual but corporate.
    - Exclusion from the table signifies broken fellowship with the body.
    - "One bread, one body: so are we, the many, one body." (Sermon 272)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s teaching on the **spiritual presence** and the necessity of faith in the Lord’s Supper profoundly shaped both Western and Reformed sacramental theology. His distinction between **sign and reality** influenced later debates on the nature of Christ’s presence and the efficacy of the sacraments. Augustine’s emphasis on church discipline and the unity of the body provided a foundation for later practices of fencing the table and admission to communion. His thought remains a touchstone for discussions of the Lord’s Supper in both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
