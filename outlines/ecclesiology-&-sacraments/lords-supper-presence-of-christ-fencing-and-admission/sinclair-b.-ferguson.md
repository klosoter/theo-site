# Sinclair Ferguson (1948–)

Sinclair Ferguson articulates a robustly **Reformed** understanding of the **Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **real spiritual presence of Christ** and the necessity of **fencing the table** according to biblical and confessional standards. He insists that the Supper is a means of grace for believers, administered with pastoral care, and that **admission** is governed by faith and repentance, not mere external membership.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not a bare memorial, but a means by which Christ communicates himself to his people." (The Holy Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (1996)
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction (1981)
- The Whole Christ: Legalism, Antinomianism, and Gospel Assurance (2016)
- “The Reformed View” in The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism (2003)
- “The Lord’s Supper” in New Dictionary of Theology (1988)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Real Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Affirms that Christ is truly, though spiritually, present in the Supper.
    - Rejects both Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Zwinglian memorialism.
    - Emphasizes union with Christ as the foundation for participation.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates Christ’s presence to believers at the table.
    - "Christ is present in the Supper, not physically but by the Spirit, to nourish faith." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Means of Grace for Believers**
    - The Supper is a divinely appointed means of grace, strengthening faith.
    - Participation is for those who are united to Christ by faith.
    - The benefits of the Supper are received through the exercise of faith.
    - The sacrament assures believers of Christ’s promises and their union with him.
    - "The sacraments are not empty signs, but effectual means of grace to those who believe." (The Christian Life)

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church must guard the table to protect both the integrity of the sacrament and the souls of participants.
    - Fencing is an act of pastoral care, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - Only those who profess faith and are not under church discipline should be admitted.
    - The warnings of 1 Corinthians 11 are taken seriously in practice.
    - "To admit the unrepentant or unbelieving is to endanger them and dishonor Christ." (The Whole Christ)

4. **Admission Based on Faith and Repentance**
    - Admission is not automatic by virtue of church membership or baptism alone.
    - A credible profession of faith and evidence of repentance are required.
    - The Supper is for those who discern the Lord’s body and examine themselves.
    - Pastoral oversight is necessary to discern readiness for participation.
    - "The table is for sinners, but for penitent sinners who trust in Christ." (The Whole Christ)

5. **Covenantal Context of the Supper**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a covenant meal, rooted in God’s redemptive promises.
    - Participation signifies and seals membership in the covenant community.
    - The Supper looks back to Christ’s sacrifice and forward to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
    - The covenantal framework shapes both the theology and practice of admission.
    - "The Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, nourishing us for the journey." (The Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s teaching on the **Lord’s Supper** has reinforced a confessional Reformed approach within contemporary evangelicalism, emphasizing both the richness of Christ’s presence and the pastoral necessity of fencing the table. His work has shaped pastors and churches to uphold the sacrament as a true means of grace, not a mere memorial. Ferguson’s clarity and fidelity to the Westminster Standards continue to influence discussions on sacramental theology and church practice.
