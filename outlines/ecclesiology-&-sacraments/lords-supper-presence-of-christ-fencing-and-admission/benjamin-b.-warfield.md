# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the **Lord’s Supper** from a classic **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the **spiritual presence of Christ** rather than a physical or merely symbolic presence. He upheld the importance of **fencing the table** and **admission to the Supper** as matters of church discipline, rooted in a high view of the sacrament’s significance for the believer’s union with Christ.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a means of grace, not by any physical change in the elements, but by the Spirit’s use of them to strengthen faith." (Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Works

- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- "The Lord’s Supper" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Significance of the Westminster Standards as a Creed"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"
- "Calvin and Calvinism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is present in the Supper by the Holy Spirit, not physically or locally.
    - The Supper is a true means of grace, effectual for those who receive by faith.
    - Warfield rejects both transubstantiation and mere memorialism.
    - The believer is spiritually nourished through union with the risen Christ.
    - "The Reformed doctrine is that Christ is present and gives himself to his people, not in the elements, but in the action of the Holy Spirit." ("The Lord’s Supper")

2. **Means of Grace**
    - The Supper is a divinely instituted ordinance for the strengthening of faith.
    - It conveys grace to believers, not by the elements themselves, but through faith.
    - Participation requires self-examination and discernment of the body.
    - The efficacy of the Supper is inseparable from the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is a means of grace only to those who partake in faith." ("The Lord’s Supper")

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church has a duty to guard the sacrament from profanation.
    - Only those who make a credible profession of faith should be admitted.
    - Fencing is an act of pastoral care and discipline, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - The purity of the church and the honor of Christ are at stake in admission.
    - "It is the duty of the church to guard the table of the Lord from the unworthy." ("The Westminster Assembly and Its Work")

4. **Admission to the Supper**
    - Admission is based on a credible profession, not presumed regeneration.
    - The church exercises judgment, but ultimate knowledge belongs to God.
    - The Supper is for the edification of the body, not a private privilege.
    - Warfield supports the historic Reformed practice of communicant membership.
    - "The church must judge as best it can, but it cannot read the heart." ("The Significance of the Westminster Standards as a Creed")

5. **Relation to the Covenant**
    - The Supper is a covenant meal, signifying and sealing the benefits of Christ.
    - It is a continuation of the covenantal structure established in Scripture.
    - The sacrament points to the believer’s participation in the new covenant.
    - Warfield sees the Supper as confirming God’s promises to His people.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is the covenant meal of the New Testament church." ("The Lord’s Supper")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **spiritual presence** in the Lord’s Supper reinforced the classic Reformed position against both Roman Catholic and Zwinglian views. His careful defense of **fencing the table** and proper admission practices shaped Presbyterian and broader Reformed sacramental theology in the twentieth century. Warfield’s influence endures in discussions of the Lord’s Supper as a means of grace, emphasizing both doctrinal fidelity and pastoral responsibility.
