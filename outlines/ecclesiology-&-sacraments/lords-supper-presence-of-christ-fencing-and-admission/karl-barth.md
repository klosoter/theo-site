# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** centers on the dynamic, personal **presence of Christ** through the Holy Spirit, rather than a metaphysical change in the elements. He emphasizes the Supper as an act of divine **self-giving** and a communal event, with careful attention to **fencing** and **admission** as matters of ecclesial responsibility and obedience to Christ’s command.

- "The Lord’s Supper is the repetition of the one unique sacrifice of Christ, not in substance but in proclamation and remembrance." (Church Dogmatics IV/4)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/4: Fragment on Baptism
- The Theology of the Reformed Confessions (Barth, 1922)
- The Teaching of the Church Regarding Baptism (1943)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presence of Christ is Pneumatological**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but by the **Holy Spirit**, not by a change in the elements.
    - Rejects both **transubstantiation** and a merely symbolic view.
    - The Supper is a unique event of encounter with the living Lord.
    - The presence is personal and relational, not spatial or material.
    - "Christ is present in the Lord’s Supper as the One who comes to us in the power of the Holy Spirit." (Church Dogmatics IV/4)

2. **Remembrance as Proclamation**
    - The Supper is fundamentally an act of **remembrance** and proclamation of Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice.
    - The church participates in Christ’s self-offering through obedient remembrance.
    - The event is not a repetition but a proclamation of the finished work.
    - The focus is on Christ’s action, not human ritual.
    - "We remember Him, not as absent, but as the living Lord who speaks and acts." (Church Dogmatics IV/4)

3. **Fencing the Table as Obedience**
    - Admission to the Supper is a matter of **obedience** to Christ’s command.
    - The church must exercise discernment regarding participants’ faith and repentance.
    - Fencing is not about exclusion but about honoring the Supper’s seriousness.
    - The church acts as steward, not owner, of the sacrament.
    - "The Church is responsible for the right administration of the Lord’s Supper, which includes the proper admission of participants." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Communal and Covenantal Dimension**
    - The Supper is a **communal meal** that expresses and strengthens the unity of the church.
    - Participation is a sign of belonging to the covenant community.
    - The Supper calls for reconciliation among believers.
    - The church’s unity is grounded in Christ’s reconciling work.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is the event in which the Church is constituted as the community of those reconciled in Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Sacrament as Divine Initiative**
    - The Supper is primarily God’s act, not human achievement.
    - The efficacy of the sacrament depends on God’s promise and presence.
    - Human faith responds to, but does not create, the reality of Christ’s presence.
    - The sacrament is a means of grace, not a magical rite.
    - "It is God who acts in the sacrament, and we are those who receive." (Church Dogmatics IV/4)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s theology of the **Lord’s Supper** has shaped modern Reformed and ecumenical discussions, especially regarding the **presence of Christ** and the church’s responsibility in admission and fencing. His pneumatological emphasis provided a robust alternative to both Roman Catholic and Zwinglian positions. Barth’s insistence on the Supper as a divine act and a communal event continues to influence contemporary sacramental theology and church practice.
