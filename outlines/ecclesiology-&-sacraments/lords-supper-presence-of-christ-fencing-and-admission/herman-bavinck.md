# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **real spiritual presence of Christ** and the necessity of **faith** for proper participation. He upheld the importance of **fencing the table** and **church discipline** in admission, insisting that the Supper is a means of grace for believers and not a mere memorial. Bavinck’s approach balanced the mystery of Christ’s presence with the covenantal and ecclesial dimensions of the sacrament.

- John Bolt, "Bavinck on the Lord’s Supper" (secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Real Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, not physically but spiritually, by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Supper is more than a memorial; it is a real communion with the risen Lord.
    - The mode of presence is mysterious and transcends human explanation.
    - Faith is the means by which believers partake of Christ’s body and blood.
    - "Christ is present in the Lord’s Supper, not locally or physically, but by the Holy Spirit and through faith." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

2. **Means of Grace for Believers**
    - The Lord’s Supper strengthens faith and assures believers of their union with Christ.
    - It conveys the benefits of Christ’s atoning work to those who receive in faith.
    - The sacrament is efficacious only for those who are regenerate.
    - Participation is not automatic; it requires spiritual discernment.
    - "The sacrament does not work ex opere operato but is effective only through faith." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

3. **Fencing the Table and Church Discipline**
    - Admission to the Supper is restricted to professing believers in good standing.
    - The church has a duty to guard the table from open and scandalous sinners.
    - Fencing the table protects the holiness of the sacrament and the church.
    - Discipline is exercised pastorally, aiming at repentance and restoration.
    - "The church must exercise discipline in admitting to the Lord’s table, lest the sacrament be profaned." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

4. **Covenantal and Ecclesial Context**
    - The Supper is a covenant meal, signifying and sealing membership in the body of Christ.
    - It is administered within the gathered church under ordained leadership.
    - The Supper expresses and strengthens the unity of the church.
    - Admission is tied to visible membership and confession of faith.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, administered in the fellowship of the church." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

5. **Distinction from Roman Catholic and Zwinglian Views**
    - Rejects transubstantiation and the idea of a repeated sacrifice.
    - Opposes a purely symbolic or memorialist interpretation.
    - Affirms the unique, once-for-all nature of Christ’s sacrifice.
    - Emphasizes the sacramental union between sign and reality.
    - "The Reformed view maintains the real, spiritual presence of Christ, distinct from both Rome and the memorialists." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of the **real spiritual presence** in the Lord’s Supper has shaped modern Reformed sacramental theology, providing a mediating position between Lutheran and Zwinglian extremes. His emphasis on the covenantal and ecclesial dimensions of the Supper continues to inform contemporary discussions on church membership and discipline. Bavinck’s careful balance of mystery, faith, and ecclesial practice has made his work a standard reference for Reformed pastors and theologians.
