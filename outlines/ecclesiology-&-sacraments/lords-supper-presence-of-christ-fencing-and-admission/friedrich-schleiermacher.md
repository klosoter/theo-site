# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **Lord’s Supper** through the lens of **religious experience** and **Christian community**, rather than metaphysical debates about the **real presence**. He emphasized the Supper as a symbolic act that fosters a sense of **communion with Christ** and unity among believers, while downplaying traditional notions of **fencing** and strict **admission** based on doctrinal orthodoxy.

- "The Lord’s Supper is the most intimate communion of the Redeemer with the community, and of the community with Him." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- On the Glaubenslehre: Two Letters to Dr. Lücke
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- The Life of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presence of Christ as Spiritual Communion**
   - Christ’s presence in the Lord’s Supper is not physical or local, but spiritual and mediated through the Holy Spirit.
   - The Supper serves as a means for believers to experience deeper fellowship with Christ.
   - The focus is on the transformation of the community, not on the elements themselves.
   - The act is primarily a memorial and a celebration of Christ’s ongoing influence.
   - "The presence of Christ is not in the elements, but in the community’s consciousness of Him." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Symbolic and Memorial Understanding**
   - The bread and wine are symbols that point to spiritual realities rather than effecting change in themselves.
   - The Supper is a memorial that recalls Christ’s life and work, fostering gratitude and dependence.
   - Participation is about inward disposition, not outward ritual.
   - The efficacy of the Supper depends on the faith and receptivity of the participants.
   - "The Lord’s Supper is a symbolic representation of the Redeemer’s influence on the community." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Communal Emphasis**
   - The Supper is an act of the gathered church, expressing unity and shared faith.
   - It strengthens the bonds of Christian fellowship and mutual love.
   - The communal aspect is central, surpassing individualistic or mystical interpretations.
   - The Supper is a visible sign of the church’s ongoing relationship with Christ.
   - "It is the most intimate act of the Christian community, signifying its unity with Christ and with itself." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Open Admission and Minimal Fencing**
   - Schleiermacher opposed strict doctrinal or moral fencing of the table.
   - Admission is based on a general confession of Christian faith, not detailed orthodoxy.
   - The Supper is a means of grace for all who seek communion with Christ.
   - Exclusion is reserved only for those who openly reject the community or its faith.
   - "No one should be excluded who desires to participate in the life of the Christian community." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Subjective Religious Experience**
   - The Supper’s significance lies in the subjective experience of the believer.
   - It is a means of cultivating religious feeling and dependence on Christ.
   - The ritual is valuable insofar as it deepens personal and communal piety.
   - The Lord’s Supper is not efficacious apart from the participant’s inner disposition.
   - "The effect of the Lord’s Supper is realized only in the consciousness of the believing participant." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **Lord’s Supper** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical debates about **real presence** to the experiential and communal dimensions of the sacrament. His emphasis on **subjective religious experience** and open admission influenced later liberal and ecumenical movements, encouraging broader participation and minimizing doctrinal barriers. While criticized by confessional traditions for downplaying objective grace, his thought remains foundational for contemporary discussions on sacramental theology and church unity.
