# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **Lord’s Supper** through his broader framework of **symbolism** and **sacramental realism**, emphasizing the existential encounter with the **New Being** in Christ. He rejected both a purely memorialist view and a literalist understanding of **real presence**, instead interpreting the sacrament as a dynamic symbol mediating the **divine-human encounter** and fostering participation in the **Spiritual Community**.

- "The sacrament is the appearance of the New Being under the conditions of existence, and as such it is a real presence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Symbols Participating in the Reality They Represent**
    - The **Lord’s Supper** is not merely a sign but a symbol that participates in the reality of the **New Being**.
    - Symbols, for Tillich, make present what they signify, mediating the presence of Christ existentially.
    - The bread and wine are not changed in substance but serve as vehicles for the **divine-human encounter**.
    - The sacrament’s efficacy depends on its power to open participants to the ground of being.
    - "A sacrament is a symbolic act which mediates the Spiritual Presence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

2. **Presence of Christ as Existential and Spiritual, Not Substantial**
    - Christ’s presence is real but not physical or local; it is mediated through the act of faith.
    - The **real presence** is understood as the presence of the **New Being** in the community.
    - The Lord’s Supper actualizes the relationship between the believer and the **Spiritual Presence**.
    - This presence is accessible to those open to the depth dimension of reality.
    - "The presence of the Christ is not a magical presence but a Spiritual Presence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

3. **Fencing the Table: Existential Readiness over Ecclesiastical Boundaries**
    - Admission to the Lord’s Supper is not primarily about external church membership.
    - The decisive factor is the existential openness to the **New Being** and the seriousness of participation.
    - Tillich warns against both legalistic exclusion and indiscriminate admission.
    - The sacrament calls for self-examination in light of the encounter with the divine.
    - "The sacrament is effective only for those who are existentially prepared to receive it." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

4. **Communal Dimension: The Lord’s Supper and the Spiritual Community**
    - The sacrament is an act of the **Spiritual Community**, not just of individuals.
    - Participation in the Lord’s Supper expresses and deepens the unity of the community in Christ.
    - The communal aspect reflects the reconciliation and new creation brought by the **New Being**.
    - The Lord’s Supper is a sign of the community’s participation in the divine life.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is the sacrament of the Spiritual Community as a whole." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

5. **Sacramental Participation as Anticipation of Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The Lord’s Supper points forward to the ultimate fulfillment of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - It is a foretaste of the final reconciliation and communion with God.
    - The sacrament sustains hope and orients the community toward the eschatological future.
    - Participation is both remembrance and anticipation of the consummation of all things in Christ.
    - "The sacrament anticipates the fulfillment of history in the Spiritual Presence." (Systematic Theology, vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of the **Lord’s Supper** has influenced modern theology by reframing sacramental presence in existential and symbolic terms. His emphasis on **symbolic mediation** and the **Spiritual Presence** provided a bridge between traditional doctrines and contemporary existential concerns. While his views have been critiqued for their ambiguity regarding objective presence, they remain significant for ecumenical dialogue and for those seeking a non-magical yet real understanding of sacramental participation.
