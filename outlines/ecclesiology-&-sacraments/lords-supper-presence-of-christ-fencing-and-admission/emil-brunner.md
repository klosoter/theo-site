# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **Lord’s Supper** from a mediating position between **Reformed** and **Lutheran** views, emphasizing the real but **spiritual presence of Christ** rather than a physical or merely symbolic presence. He stressed the importance of **faith** for participation, the communal aspect of the Supper, and the necessity of **fencing the table** to preserve its integrity, while critiquing both transubstantiation and memorialism.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not a magical rite, but a personal encounter with the living Christ, mediated through faith." ("The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation")

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (Dogmatics, Vol. III)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not in a physical or material sense.
    - The presence is mediated by the Holy Spirit and appropriated by faith.
    - Rejects both transubstantiation and mere symbolism.
    - The Supper is a real encounter with the risen Lord.
    - "The presence of Christ is real, but it is a presence in the Spirit, not in the elements." (Dogmatics III)

2. **Faith as the Means of Participation**
    - Only those who approach in faith truly receive Christ in the Supper.
    - The efficacy of the sacrament depends on the recipient’s response.
    - Unbelievers partake only of bread and wine, not of Christ’s benefits.
    - The Supper strengthens faith and deepens union with Christ.
    - "Without faith, the sacrament is an empty sign." (Dogmatics III)

3. **Communal and Covenantal Nature**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a celebration of the new covenant community.
    - It expresses and reinforces the unity of the church in Christ.
    - Participation is both personal and corporate, involving mutual responsibility.
    - The Supper points forward to the eschatological banquet.
    - "The Supper is the fellowship of the reconciled, the sign of the new humanity." (Dogmatics III)

4. **Fencing and Admission to the Table**
    - The church must exercise discernment regarding who may partake.
    - Admission is for those who profess faith and repentance.
    - The Supper should not be administered indiscriminately.
    - Fencing the table protects the sacrament from profanation.
    - "The church must guard the table, lest the Supper become a mockery." (Dogmatics III)

5. **Critique of Sacramentalism and Memorialism**
    - Rejects magical or automatic views of sacramental efficacy.
    - Opposes a purely memorialist or subjective understanding.
    - The Supper is neither a bare remembrance nor a mystical transformation of elements.
    - True meaning lies in the dynamic encounter with Christ through faith.
    - "Neither magic nor mere memory, but encounter: that is the Lord’s Supper." (Dogmatics III)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **Lord’s Supper** influenced 20th-century ecumenical discussions by offering a mediating position between traditional **Reformed** and **Lutheran** views. His emphasis on the **spiritual presence** and the necessity of faith contributed to renewed appreciation for the sacrament’s existential and communal dimensions. Brunner’s thought continues to shape conversations on sacramental theology, especially regarding the balance between objective grace and subjective appropriation.
