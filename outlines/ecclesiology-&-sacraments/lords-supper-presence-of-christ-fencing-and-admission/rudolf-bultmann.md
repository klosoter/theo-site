# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Lord’s Supper** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation, rejecting traditional notions of **real presence** and sacramental efficacy. For Bultmann, the significance of the Supper lies in its proclamation of the **kerygma** and its call to authentic faith, rather than in any objective transformation of the elements or metaphysical presence of Christ. He was critical of **fencing** and strict **admission** practices, emphasizing personal response over ecclesiastical boundaries.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not a magical rite, but a proclamation of the saving event." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Lord’s Supper** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially in its emphasis on **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His rejection of traditional sacramentalism influenced many liberal and neo-orthodox theologians, sparking ongoing debate about the meaning of presence and participation in the Supper. While his views are often criticized by confessional traditions, Bultmann’s focus on the **kerygma** and personal faith continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature and practice of the Lord’s Table.
