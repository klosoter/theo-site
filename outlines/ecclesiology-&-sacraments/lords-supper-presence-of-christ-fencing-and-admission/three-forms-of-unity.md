# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a distinctly **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper**. They affirm the **real spiritual presence of Christ** in the Supper, while rejecting both transubstantiation and a merely symbolic view. The confessions also emphasize **fencing the table** and proper **admission** to the sacrament, requiring self-examination and church oversight.

- "Whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup with a believing heart, as he ought, is united with Christ through the working of the Holy Spirit." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 76)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 75–82
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 33–35
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV and V
- The Forms for the Administration of the Lord’s Supper (liturgical forms used in Reformed churches)
- The Ecumenical Creeds (as referenced in the Three Forms)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Affirms that Christ is truly, yet spiritually, present in the Supper by the Holy Spirit.
    - Denies transubstantiation and consubstantiation, distinguishing the Reformed view from Roman Catholic and Lutheran positions.
    - Emphasizes that believers truly partake of Christ’s body and blood through faith.
    - The Supper is a means of grace, not a mere memorial.
    - "Yet we do not go wrong when we say that what is eaten and drunk by us is the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ." (Belgic Confession, Art. 35)

2. **Necessity of Faith for Participation**
    - Only those who trust in Christ receive the benefits of the Supper.
    - Unbelievers eat and drink judgment upon themselves.
    - Faith is the instrument by which Christ is received in the sacrament.
    - The Supper strengthens faith already present in the believer.
    - "But those who do not believe this eat and drink judgment on themselves." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 81)

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church must guard the sacrament from profanation.
    - Only those who profess faith and show repentance may be admitted.
    - Discipline is exercised to exclude the unrepentant and scandalous.
    - The Form for the Lord’s Supper includes warnings and calls for self-examination.
    - "Therefore, according to the command of Christ and of the apostle Paul, we admonish all who know themselves to be defiled with the following gross sins to abstain from the table of the Lord." (Form for the Lord’s Supper)

4. **Self-Examination Before Participation**
    - Communicants are called to examine themselves regarding faith, repentance, and love.
    - The Catechism lists three areas: recognizing sin, trusting Christ, and desiring to live gratefully.
    - Self-examination is a prerequisite for worthy participation.
    - The church provides instruction to aid in this process.
    - "Let each one examine his heart to be sure that he trusts in Jesus Christ alone for his salvation." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 81)

5. **Covenantal and Communal Dimensions**
    - The Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace.
    - Participation expresses union with Christ and with the body of believers.
    - The Supper calls for unity, love, and mutual accountability within the church.
    - Admission is not merely individual but involves the oversight of the church community.
    - "By this same Spirit we are also united as members of one body in true brotherly love." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 76)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the Reformed understanding of the Lord’s Supper for centuries, providing a robust framework for the **spiritual presence of Christ** and the practice of church discipline. Their careful articulation of fencing and admission has influenced Reformed liturgy and pastoral practice globally. These confessions continue to serve as doctrinal standards for many Reformed and Presbyterian churches, ensuring theological clarity and ecclesial integrity in the administration of the sacrament.
