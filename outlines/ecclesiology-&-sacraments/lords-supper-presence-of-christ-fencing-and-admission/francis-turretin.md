# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **spiritual presence of Christ** and the necessity of **fencing the table** to preserve the sacrament’s integrity. He rejected both **transubstantiation** and **consubstantiation**, insisting that believers truly partake of Christ by faith, while also upholding strict criteria for **admission** to the Supper to safeguard the church’s holiness.

- "The presence of Christ in the Supper is not physical or local, but spiritual and real, communicated by the Holy Spirit to the faith of believers." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 19.11.8)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 3, Topics 19–20)
- The Doctrine of the Holy Supper (various disputations within the Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)
- The Lord’s Supper in Reformed Theology (secondary: Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not physically or locally.
    - The presence is mediated by the **Holy Spirit** and received by faith.
    - The elements remain bread and wine; there is no change in substance.
    - The Supper is a means of grace, effectual for believers only.
    - "We maintain that Christ is present in the Supper, not by transubstantiation, but by the Spirit and by faith." (Institutes, 19.11.8)

2. **Rejection of Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation**
    - Denies the Roman Catholic view of the substance of bread and wine changing.
    - Rejects the Lutheran notion of Christ’s body being “in, with, and under” the elements.
    - Affirms the continued physical absence of Christ’s human nature from earth.
    - Upholds the integrity of Christ’s two natures and the doctrine of the ascension.
    - "The body of Christ is in heaven, not on earth, and is received spiritually, not carnally." (Institutes, 19.11.10)

3. **Efficacy of the Sacrament**
    - The Supper conveys grace only to those who partake in faith.
    - The sacrament is not efficacious ex opere operato (by the mere act).
    - The benefits are inseparable from union with Christ.
    - The Supper strengthens assurance and sanctification in believers.
    - "The efficacy of the Supper depends not on the elements, but on the Spirit and faith." (Institutes, 19.12.6)

4. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church must guard the sacrament from profanation.
    - Admission requires credible profession of faith and repentance.
    - Ministers have the duty to warn and, if necessary, withhold the elements from the unworthy.
    - Fencing protects both the purity of the church and the souls of communicants.
    - "It is the office of pastors to keep the holy table from being defiled by the ungodly." (Institutes, 19.13.2)

5. **Admission to the Lord’s Supper**
    - Only those who understand the gospel and show evidence of faith should be admitted.
    - Self-examination is required before partaking.
    - The church exercises discipline to ensure worthy participation.
    - Admission is not a right, but a privilege for those in covenant with Christ.
    - "None ought to be admitted to the Supper who are manifestly ignorant or scandalous." (Institutes, 19.13.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **spiritual presence** and rigorous approach to **fencing and admission** shaped the confessional standards of Reformed churches, notably influencing the Westminster Standards and later Reformed orthodoxy. His careful distinctions between Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed views provided a systematic defense of the Reformed sacramental position. Turretin’s emphasis on church discipline and the means of grace continues to inform contemporary Reformed practice and theological education.
