# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **Lord’s Supper** with a strong emphasis on the **eschatological presence of Christ**, situating the sacrament within the broader framework of **union with Christ** and the benefits of his **resurrection**. He affirms a **real spiritual presence** in the Supper, while upholding the necessity of **fencing the table** and a robust theology of **admission** that is consistent with Reformed confessional standards.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a means by which the ascended Christ, through his Spirit, communicates himself and his saving benefits to believers." (Calvin and the Sabbath, 1998)

## Key Works

- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment" (1998)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- "Word and Spirit: Selected Writings in Biblical and Systematic Theology" (2019)
- Contributions to "The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century" (multiple volumes)
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal on sacramental theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Presence of Christ**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a participation in the benefits of the **resurrected and ascended Christ**.
    - Christ is present by the **Holy Spirit**, not physically or locally.
    - The Supper anticipates the **eschatological consummation** and the marriage supper of the Lamb.
    - The meal is a foretaste of the final **kingdom reality** believers will enjoy.
    - "The Supper is an eschatological event, a pledge of the consummation to come." (Word and Spirit)

2. **Union with Christ as Central**
    - Participation in the Supper is grounded in **union with Christ** by faith.
    - The benefits of the Supper flow from the believer’s incorporation into Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The sacrament is not efficacious apart from the Spirit’s work in uniting believers to Christ.
    - The Supper strengthens and confirms this union, not creating it ex nihilo.
    - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality signified and sealed in the Lord’s Supper." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Spiritual Efficacy and Means of Grace**
    - The Supper is a true **means of grace**, conveying Christ and his benefits to believers.
    - The efficacy of the Supper is not automatic but is received by faith.
    - The Spirit uses the elements to nourish and strengthen the faith of the elect.
    - The Supper is inseparable from the ministry of the **Word**.
    - "The sacraments are subordinate to and dependent on the Word for their efficacy." (Word and Spirit)

4. **Fencing the Table and Admission**
    - Proper administration requires **fencing the table** to guard against unworthy participation.
    - Admission is for those who make a credible profession of faith and are not under church discipline.
    - Elders have a responsibility to discern and oversee participation in the Supper.
    - Fencing is an act of pastoral care, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - "The church must exercise discipline in admission to the Supper, not as an act of exclusion but of loving oversight." (Westminster Confession into the 21st Century)

5. **Confessional and Biblical Fidelity**
    - The theology of the Supper must be governed by **Scripture** and the **Reformed confessions**.
    - Gaffin upholds the Westminster Standards’ articulation of the Supper’s meaning and practice.
    - He rejects both **Roman Catholic transubstantiation** and mere memorialism.
    - The Supper is a covenantal sign and seal, not an autonomous ritual.
    - "The Reformed confessions provide a faithful summary of the biblical teaching on the Lord’s Supper." (Word and Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has reinforced the **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper** by integrating it with his hallmark emphasis on **union with Christ** and eschatology. His careful articulation of the **spiritual presence** and the necessity of fencing the table has shaped contemporary Presbyterian and Reformed practice. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the ongoing commitment to confessional fidelity and the pastoral administration of the sacraments in Reformed churches.
