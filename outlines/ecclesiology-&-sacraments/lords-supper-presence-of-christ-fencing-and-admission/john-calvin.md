# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a distinctive view of the **Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **real spiritual presence** of Christ rather than a physical or merely symbolic presence. He stressed the importance of **faith** for receiving the benefits of the sacrament, and advocated for careful **fencing of the table** and **church discipline** regarding admission, to preserve the sacrament’s sanctity and the church’s purity.

- "The bread is truly offered to us as a symbol of Christ’s body, but at the same time the reality is also joined to it." (Institutes IV.17.10)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book IV, chapters 14–17
- Short Treatise on the Lord’s Supper
- Commentaries on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 11)
- The Geneva Catechism
- Selected Letters (esp. correspondence with Bullinger and Cranmer)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not physically or locally.
    - The Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ, enabling true communion.
    - The Supper is more than a memorial; it is a means of grace.
    - The mode of presence is “spiritual,” not corporeal or merely symbolic.
    - "We must hold that Christ, in the Supper, is truly given to us, and is received by us." (Institutes IV.17.19)

2. **Necessity of Faith for Reception**
    - Only those with faith receive the true benefits of the Supper.
    - Unbelievers eat only bread and wine, not Christ himself.
    - Faith apprehends Christ’s promises and presence in the sacrament.
    - The efficacy of the Supper is not automatic or ex opere operato.
    - "The flesh of Christ is like a rich and inexhaustible fountain, which is given to us in the Supper, but only faith draws from it." (Short Treatise)

3. **Fencing of the Table**
    - The church must guard the table from open sinners and the unrepentant.
    - Elders and pastors are responsible for proper administration.
    - Fencing protects both the sacrament’s honor and the congregation’s well-being.
    - Discipline is an act of pastoral care, not mere exclusion.
    - "It is not lawful to admit to the Lord’s table those who are manifestly unworthy." (Institutes IV.12.5)

4. **Admission and Church Discipline**
    - Admission to the Supper is tied to church membership and discipline.
    - The church exercises authority to admit or withhold the sacrament.
    - Restoration and repentance are always the goal of discipline.
    - The Supper is a visible sign of unity and purity in the church.
    - "The discipline of the church ought to be such that no profane person may approach the sacred table." (Geneva Catechism)

5. **Covenantal and Communal Dimensions**
    - The Supper is a sign and seal of the **New Covenant** in Christ.
    - Participation expresses union with Christ and with one another.
    - The Supper strengthens faith and fosters communal holiness.
    - The sacrament is both individual and corporate in significance.
    - "We are made partakers of Christ’s body, so that he may live in us and we in him." (Institutes IV.17.12)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s theology of the **Lord’s Supper** shaped the Reformed tradition’s distinctive stance on the **real presence** and the pastoral practice of **fencing the table**. His emphasis on faith, discipline, and the spiritual benefits of the sacrament influenced Reformed confessions and liturgies across Europe. Calvin’s careful balance between the Supper’s mystery and its pastoral administration continues to inform contemporary debates on sacramental theology and church discipline.
