# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **Lord’s Supper** with a strong emphasis on its **covenantal** and **ecclesiological** dimensions, rejecting both a purely symbolic view and any notion of a physical or local presence of Christ. He stressed the **spiritual presence of Christ** in the Supper, the necessity of **self-examination** for worthy participation, and the church’s responsibility in **fencing the table** to preserve the integrity of the sacrament.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not a magical event, but a communion in which faith is essential for the reception of Christ’s benefits." (The Sacraments)

## Key Works

- The Sacraments (vol. 2 of Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Church (vol. 17 of Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification
- General Editor’s Preface to the Dutch Reformed Church’s liturgical forms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not physically or locally.
    - The presence is mediated by the **Holy Spirit** and received by faith.
    - The Supper is a means of grace, not a repetition of the sacrifice.
    - Rejects both transubstantiation and mere memorialism.
    - "The presence of Christ is real, but it is spiritual and related to faith." (The Sacraments)

2. **Covenantal and Ecclesial Context**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a covenant meal for the church.
    - Participation signifies union with Christ and with one another.
    - The Supper is inseparable from the life and discipline of the church.
    - Admission is not merely individual but ecclesially regulated.
    - "The Supper is not a private matter, but a celebration of the covenant community." (The Sacraments)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Participation**
    - Faith is essential for receiving the benefits of the Supper.
    - The elements do not confer grace ex opere operato.
    - Unbelievers do not receive Christ, though they partake of the elements.
    - The Supper calls for self-examination and repentance.
    - "Without faith, the sacrament is empty of its saving significance." (The Sacraments)

4. **Fencing the Table and Church Discipline**
    - The church must guard the table to preserve its sanctity.
    - Admission is for those who profess faith and are not under discipline.
    - Fencing is an act of pastoral care, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - The integrity of the Supper is tied to the church’s holiness.
    - "The church’s responsibility is to ensure that the Supper is not profaned." (The Church)

5. **Rejection of Sacramental Automatism**
    - The Supper is not effective apart from faith and the Spirit’s work.
    - There is no automatic or mechanical impartation of grace.
    - The sacrament’s efficacy is tied to the Word and the promise of Christ.
    - The Supper must be understood within the broader context of the gospel.
    - "The sacrament is never detached from the living Word and the faith it calls forth." (The Sacraments)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of the **spiritual presence** in the Lord’s Supper has shaped Reformed sacramental theology in the twentieth century, especially in ecumenical dialogues. His careful balance between the Supper’s objective reality and the necessity of faith has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to the sacrament. Berkouwer’s emphasis on the church’s responsibility in **fencing and admission** continues to inform discussions on church discipline and the meaning of communion within the Reformed tradition.
