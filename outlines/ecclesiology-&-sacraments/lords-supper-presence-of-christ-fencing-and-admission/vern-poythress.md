# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the **Lord’s Supper** with a robustly **Reformed** and **multiperspectival** framework, emphasizing the real spiritual presence of Christ while upholding the importance of **fencing the table** and biblically regulated **admission**. He insists that the Supper is a means of grace, rooted in **covenant theology**, and that participation requires **faithful self-examination** within the context of the church’s pastoral oversight.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a covenantal meal, and its meaning is inseparable from the context of the covenant community." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Key Works

- The Lord’s Supper as a Sign and Seal (Westminster Theological Journal articles)
- Symphonic Theology
- Inerrancy and Worldview
- "The Church as a Family: The Lord’s Supper and Church Discipline" (online essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Affirms that Christ is truly, spiritually present in the Supper, not physically or merely symbolically.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates Christ’s presence to believers through faith.
    - Participation is a real communion with Christ, not a bare memorial.
    - The Supper is a means of grace, nourishing believers spiritually.
    - "Christ is present by the Spirit, and believers truly commune with him in the Supper." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

2. **Covenantal Context**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a covenant meal, signifying and sealing the benefits of the New Covenant.
    - Participation is reserved for those within the visible church, under the covenant promises.
    - The Supper reaffirms the believer’s union with Christ and with one another.
    - The meal points back to the Passover and forward to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
    - "The Supper is a covenantal sign, rooted in God’s promises and fulfilled in Christ." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

3. **Fencing the Table**
    - The church has a duty to guard the table, ensuring only professing believers partake.
    - Fencing protects the holiness of the ordinance and the spiritual well-being of participants.
    - Pastors must warn against unworthy participation, in line with 1 Corinthians 11.
    - Fencing is an act of pastoral care, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - "Fencing the table is a necessary aspect of shepherding God’s flock." (The Church as a Family: The Lord’s Supper and Church Discipline)

4. **Admission and Self-Examination**
    - Admission is based on credible profession of faith and baptism.
    - Self-examination is required, focusing on repentance and faith in Christ.
    - The church provides instruction and oversight to guide proper participation.
    - Unrepentant or excommunicated persons are barred from the table.
    - "Admission to the Supper is not a private matter, but a communal and pastoral responsibility." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **Multiperspectival Approach**
    - Applies his multiperspectival method to the Supper, integrating normative (biblical), situational (ecclesial), and existential (personal) perspectives.
    - Recognizes the Supper’s doctrinal, communal, and experiential dimensions.
    - Emphasizes that no single perspective exhausts the Supper’s meaning.
    - Encourages holistic reflection on the Supper’s significance for faith and practice.
    - "Multiperspectivalism helps us appreciate the richness of the Lord’s Supper in the life of the church." (Symphonic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectival** approach has enriched Reformed discussions of the Lord’s Supper, offering a nuanced account of Christ’s presence and the church’s responsibility in fencing and admission. His work bridges biblical theology, systematic reflection, and pastoral application, shaping contemporary Presbyterian and Reformed practice. By emphasizing the covenantal and communal nature of the Supper, Poythress has contributed to a deeper appreciation of its role in the life of the church.
