# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a **Reformed doctrine of the Lord’s Supper**, emphasizing the **spiritual presence of Christ** rather than a physical or merely symbolic presence. He upheld strict **fencing of the table** and **admission** practices, insisting on the necessity of **faith** for proper participation and the church’s responsibility to guard the sacrament’s integrity.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a seal of the covenant of grace, and a means of grace only to believers." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. III, chapters on the sacraments)
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the sacraments)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
   - Christ is truly present in the Supper, but not physically or corporeally.
   - The presence is mediated by the Holy Spirit and apprehended by faith.
   - Rejects both transubstantiation (Roman Catholic) and consubstantiation (Lutheran).
   - The Supper is a means of grace, nourishing believers spiritually.
   - "The presence of Christ is not in the elements, but in the ordinance, and is enjoyed by faith." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Necessity of Faith for Participation**
   - Only those with genuine faith receive the benefits of the Supper.
   - Unbelievers partake only of the outward elements, not of Christ himself.
   - The sacrament does not confer grace ex opere operato.
   - Faith is the instrument by which Christ is received in the Supper.
   - "Without faith, the Lord’s Supper is not a means of grace." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Fencing the Table**
   - The church has a duty to guard the sacrament from profanation.
   - Elders must examine communicants for credible profession of faith.
   - Public warnings are to be given against unworthy participation.
   - The discipline is pastoral, not punitive, aiming at the soul’s good.
   - "It is the duty of the church to exclude the openly ungodly from the Lord’s table." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Admission to the Lord’s Supper**
   - Admission is based on a credible profession of faith and life.
   - The church exercises discernment, not infallibility, in admitting communicants.
   - Baptism is a prerequisite for participation in the Supper.
   - The goal is to maintain the purity and unity of the visible church.
   - "The church is bound to admit to the Lord’s table all who make a credible profession of faith." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal and Memorial Aspects**
   - The Supper is a sign and seal of the **covenant of grace**.
   - It is a memorial of Christ’s death and a proclamation of the gospel.
   - Participation involves communion with Christ and with other believers.
   - The Supper points forward to the eschatological feast in glory.
   - "It is at once a commemorative, a confirmatory, and a prophetic ordinance." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **spiritual presence** in the Lord’s Supper shaped American Presbyterian and broader Reformed sacramental theology. His careful defense of **fencing the table** and admission standards influenced church polity and pastoral practice in the 19th and 20th centuries. Hodge’s work remains a standard reference for understanding the Reformed approach to the sacraments, balancing doctrinal clarity with pastoral sensitivity.
