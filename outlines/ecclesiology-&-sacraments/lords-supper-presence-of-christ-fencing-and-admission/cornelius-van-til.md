# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Lord’s Supper** through the lens of **Reformed confessionalism**, emphasizing the real spiritual presence of Christ and the necessity of **covenant faithfulness** in admission to the table. He maintained that the sacrament is a means of grace, inseparable from the **covenant community**, and that proper **fencing** is essential to uphold the integrity of the church and the glory of Christ.

- "The Lord’s Supper is a covenantal meal, and as such it presupposes the reality of the covenant relationship between God and his people." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is truly present in the Supper, not physically but spiritually, by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Supper is a means by which believers commune with the risen Lord.
    - The presence is covenantal, rooted in the promises of God to his people.
    - Participation requires faith, which is itself a gift of grace.
    - "The presence of Christ in the Supper is real, but it is spiritual and covenantal, not corporeal." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Context of the Lord’s Supper**
    - The Supper is administered within the visible church as the covenant community.
    - Admission is based on credible profession of faith and covenant membership.
    - The sacrament signifies and seals the benefits of the covenant of grace.
    - The church must guard the table to maintain covenant integrity.
    - "The sacraments have meaning only within the context of the covenant community." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Necessity of Fencing the Table**
    - Elders are responsible to ensure only professing believers partake.
    - Fencing protects the church from profanation of Christ’s ordinance.
    - It is an act of pastoral care, not legalism.
    - The practice upholds the holiness of the sacrament and the discipline of the church.
    - "To admit all indiscriminately to the Lord’s Table is to deny the very nature of the church as a covenant people." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Means of Grace and Spiritual Nourishment**
    - The Supper is a divinely appointed means of grace for the strengthening of faith.
    - It is not a mere memorial but an effectual sign and seal.
    - The Spirit uses the elements to communicate Christ and his benefits.
    - Faith is the instrument by which believers receive spiritual nourishment.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is a means by which the Spirit applies the benefits of redemption to believers." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Admission Based on Confessional Integrity**
    - Admission requires a credible profession of faith and understanding of the gospel.
    - The church must examine and instruct candidates before admission.
    - Open communion undermines the confessional witness of the church.
    - The Supper is for those who discern the body and are united to Christ by faith.
    - "The church must maintain its confessional standards in the administration of the sacraments." (Essays on Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **Lord’s Supper** reinforced the centrality of the covenant and the necessity of guarding the sacrament’s integrity within the Reformed tradition. His emphasis on the spiritual presence of Christ and the role of the church in **fencing the table** has shaped contemporary Reformed practice and ecclesiology. Van Til’s covenantal framework continues to influence discussions on sacramental theology, church discipline, and the nature of the visible church.
