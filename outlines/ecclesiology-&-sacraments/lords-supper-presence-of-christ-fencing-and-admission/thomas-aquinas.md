# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** grounded in the framework of **transubstantiation**, affirming the **real presence of Christ** in the Eucharist. He emphasized the necessity of **worthy reception** and the importance of **ecclesial authority** in **fencing the table** and determining **admission** to the sacrament.

- "Because Christ's true body is in this sacrament not by way of quantity, but by way of substance, therefore Christ's body is in this sacrament by the power of the sacrament, and not locally." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.76, a.5)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part III, Questions 73–83
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 61–63
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV, Distinctions 8–13
- De Veritate, Question 29
- Selected Eucharistic Hymns (e.g., "Adoro te devote")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Transubstantiation as the Mode of Presence**
    - The **substance** of bread and wine is changed into the **substance of Christ’s body and blood**.
    - The **accidents** (appearances) of bread and wine remain, but the underlying reality is transformed.
    - This change occurs by the power of **God’s Word** and the action of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - The doctrine safeguards the **real presence** without physical or local change.
    - "The whole substance of the bread is changed into the body of Christ, and the whole substance of the wine into the blood of Christ." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.75, a.4)

2. **Real Presence of Christ**
    - Christ is **truly, really, and substantially present** in the Eucharist.
    - The presence is not merely symbolic or spiritual, but actual and objective.
    - Christ is present under each species and in every part of the species.
    - The mode of presence is **sacramental**, not physical or spatial.
    - "Christ’s body is present in this sacrament by the power of the sacrament, and not locally." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.76, a.5)

3. **Worthy Reception and Spiritual Benefit**
    - Only those in a state of **grace** should receive the sacrament.
    - Unworthy reception constitutes **sacrilege** and brings judgment.
    - The sacrament confers **grace** and strengthens union with Christ for the worthy.
    - **Faith** and **charity** are necessary dispositions for fruitful participation.
    - "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.80, a.4)

4. **Fencing the Table and Ecclesial Discipline**
    - The Church has the authority to **exclude** manifest sinners from communion.
    - **Priests** are responsible for discerning and enforcing proper admission.
    - Fencing protects the **holiness** of the sacrament and the spiritual welfare of the congregation.
    - Public scandal or grave sin warrants exclusion until repentance.
    - "The dispensing of this sacrament belongs to the priest, to whom it pertains to judge who should receive and who should be excluded." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.82, a.6)

5. **Admission to the Sacrament**
    - **Baptism** is a prerequisite for admission to the Eucharist.
    - Catechetical instruction and confession are required for first communicants.
    - The Church may set additional requirements for admission (e.g., fasting, confession).
    - Admission is ultimately governed by **ecclesiastical authority** and canon law.
    - "None are to be admitted to this sacrament unless they are first cleansed from sin by confession." (Summa Theologiae, III, q.80, a.11)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **real presence** and his articulation of **transubstantiation** became definitive for Roman Catholic theology and a central point of debate in the Reformation. His careful distinctions regarding **worthy reception** and the Church’s authority in **fencing the table** shaped later sacramental practice and canon law. Aquinas’s influence endures in both theological reflection and liturgical norms concerning the Lord’s Supper.
