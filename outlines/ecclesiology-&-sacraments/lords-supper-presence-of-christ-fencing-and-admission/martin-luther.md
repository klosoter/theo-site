# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** is marked by his affirmation of the **real presence** of Christ “in, with, and under” the elements, rejecting both transubstantiation and mere symbolism. He insisted on the necessity of **faith** for worthy reception, upheld **fencing the table** to protect the sacrament’s integrity, and emphasized the means of grace for the believer, while maintaining a strong distinction from both Roman Catholic and Reformed positions.

- "This Sacrament is the Gospel." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Small Catechism (1529)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Sermons on the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ (1526)
- Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper (1528)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Real Presence of Christ**
   - Christ’s body and blood are truly present “in, with, and under” the bread and wine.
   - Rejects transubstantiation but affirms a sacramental union.
   - The presence is not dependent on the faith of the recipient but on Christ’s word.
   - The elements remain bread and wine, but are united with Christ’s body and blood.
   - "Why should I not be able to say that the bread is Christ’s body...?" (Babylonian Captivity)

2. **Means of Grace**
   - The Lord’s Supper is a means by which God delivers forgiveness of sins.
   - Participation strengthens faith and assures believers of God’s promises.
   - The efficacy of the sacrament rests on God’s word, not human merit.
   - The Supper is for the comfort of troubled consciences.
   - "Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins." (Small Catechism)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Worthy Reception**
   - Faith is required to receive the benefits of the sacrament.
   - Unbelievers receive Christ’s body and blood to their judgment, not blessing.
   - The words “for you” require all to believe personally.
   - Faith clings to the promise attached to the elements.
   - "He is truly worthy and well prepared who has faith in these words: ‘Given and shed for you.’" (Small Catechism)

4. **Fencing the Table**
   - The sacrament should not be given to the openly unrepentant or unbelieving.
   - Pastors are responsible for guarding the table from profanation.
   - Discipline is necessary to preserve the sanctity of the Supper.
   - Admission is tied to catechesis and confession of faith.
   - "We must not give the sacrament to those who do not know what they seek or why they come." (Large Catechism)

5. **Distinction from Roman Catholic and Reformed Views**
   - Rejects transubstantiation and the sacrificial character of the Mass.
   - Opposes Zwinglian memorialism and Calvin’s spiritual presence.
   - Maintains the physical presence without philosophical speculation.
   - Insists on the plain words of institution as the basis for doctrine.
   - "We take our stand on the words of Christ and let all others go." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of the **real presence** shaped Lutheran sacramental theology and set a clear boundary between Lutheran, Reformed, and Roman Catholic understandings of the Lord’s Supper. His insistence on **fencing the table** and the necessity of faith for worthy reception influenced later Protestant practices of church discipline and catechesis. Luther’s teaching remains foundational for Lutheran liturgy and continues to provoke ecumenical dialogue on the nature of Christ’s presence and the proper administration of the sacrament.
