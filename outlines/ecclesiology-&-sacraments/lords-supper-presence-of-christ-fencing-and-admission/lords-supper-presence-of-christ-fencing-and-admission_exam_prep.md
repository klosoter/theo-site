### ESSAY
The Lord’s Supper is the sacrament of the New Covenant in which Christ has bound the church to proclaim his death and to be nourished by his body and blood until he comes. The conceptual hinge is twofold. First, the mode of Christ’s presence: not whether Christ is present, but how the ascended Lord is given to his people under the signs of bread and wine. Second, the church’s authority to admit, exclude, and warn at the Table: not whether the Supper welcomes sinners, but how the church exercises the **keys of the kingdom** so that the Supper is a **means of grace** and not judgment. Any adequate defense must link sacramentology to Christology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, and **federal theology**, because presence and admission both flow from the ascension, the ministry of the Spirit, the nature of the visible church, and the structure of the **covenant of grace**.

Augustine set the grammar for Latin sacramental theology by differentiating sign and thing signified, sacramentum and res. In his preaching and letters he insists that a sacrament is a visible word, a sign that truly conveys what it signifies to those who possess faith and charity. The sign of bread is the body of Christ, and the church becomes what it receives as the totus Christus is knit together by participation. Yet Augustine refuses a simplistic identity between sign and res. The res may be absent from the unworthy communicant; such a person receives the sacramentum but not the virtus of the sacrament. In Tractates on John and Sermon 272 he speaks of a spiritual eating by faith that differs from bodily chewing. He thus creates space for a robust realism of participation without collapsing it into material alteration or merely mental recollection. At the same time, Augustine’s strong ecclesial frame locates admission within the life of the visible church, where discipline purifies love and guards against profanation of holy things. This Augustinian architecture anchors the later Reformed distinction between sacramental sign and thing signified, and it underwrites the thesis that unworthy reception is possible and perilous, since “he that eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment” in the language of 1 Corinthians 11.

In the medieval period the question of the mode of presence crystallized around the controversies initiated by Paschasius Radbertus, who pressed a realistic identity of consecrated bread with Christ’s historical body, and Ratramnus, who argued for a more spiritual realism. Lateran IV canonized **transubstantiation**, and Thomas Aquinas provided its metaphysical articulation. In Summa Theologiae III, questions 73 to 83, Aquinas argues that after consecration the underlying substance of bread and wine is replaced by the substance of Christ’s body and blood while the accidents remain. The whole Christ is present under each species due to the integrity of his risen body and the doctrine of concomitance. The sacrament confers grace ex opere operato in that the sacramental sign, as instrument of Christ’s humanity, causes grace in the recipient who places no obstacle of mortal sin. Aquinas preserves Augustine’s sacramentum-res distinction by admitting that the wicked receive the sacrament but not the fruit of the sacrament. He affirms manducatio impiorum in a precise sense: the impious ingest the sacrament and thus the body sacramentally is present to them, but they do not receive its grace. Because Christ’s body is locally present under the species in a unique, non-quantitative mode, Christ’s presence at the altar can be adored. Aquinas’s gains are conceptual clarity and a coherent account of sacramental causality; the cost, from a Reformed vantage, is a construal of presence as a change in the elements that demands a local mode inconsistent with the ascension and a sacramental efficacy that weakens the role of faith as the instrument of union with Christ.

Martin Luther repositions the center of the debate by rejecting **transubstantiation** while defending a robust real presence. In The Babylonian Captivity of the Church and Against the Heavenly Prophets, he insists that the words “This is my body” are literal and that Christ’s body is truly eaten by all who receive the bread, whether believers or not. He describes the relation between sign and thing as **sacramental union**: Christ’s body and blood are truly present in, with, and under the bread and wine by virtue of the institution and promise. He rejects substance-accident metaphysics as unnecessary and prefers the performative force of Christ’s word. Luther’s Christology shoulders the load: because of the communicatio idiomatum and what later Lutherans term the genus maiestaticum, the human nature of Christ participates in the divine attributes such that his body is ubiquitous. The ascension does not relocate Christ in a way that precludes bodily presence at the Supper. For Luther, 1 Corinthians 10 teaches a real communion of the body of Christ and 1 Corinthians 11 establishes manducatio impiorum: the impious mouth-eat the body to their judgment. On admission, Luther retains pastoral care and discipline but eschews sacerdotalism; the Supper belongs to the baptized, catechized faithful, with warnings against unrepentance. His polemical force is directed as much against Zwingli’s memorialism as against Rome’s metaphysics. Luther yields a powerful defense of divine promise and the concreteness of Christ’s gift; yet the Reformed object that ubiquity confuses the natures and undermines the reality of Christ’s **ascension and session**.

Huldrych Zwingli sharpens the other edge. Against both Rome and Wittenberg, he contends that the Supper is fundamentally a memorial ordinance and a public oath of allegiance. In his Friendly Exegesis and at Marburg he stresses the symbol’s commemorative and didactic function. The presence of Christ for Zwingli is moral and spiritual, not sacramental; faith ascends to Christ in heaven without any special presence in the elements. John 6 is about faith, not the Supper. His political ecclesiology, with civic oversight of the church, leads to a communal table keyed to unity and remembrance rather than to sacramental feeding. Zwingli’s gains include a salutary insistence on the ascension and the primacy of faith; his losses, from the Reformed catholic perspective, include attenuation of the Supper as a **means of grace** that objectively strengthens believers by communicating Christ’s benefits.

John Calvin synthesizes and corrects. In Institutes 4.17 and his Short Treatise on the Holy Supper, Calvin rejects both **transubstantiation** and memorialism. Christ is truly given in the Supper, not corporally and locally, but by the Spirit’s power. The key is a robust doctrine of the **ascension and session** combined with a thick pneumatology. Christ’s body remains in heaven at the right hand of the Father, and this location is not metaphorical. The Spirit bridges the distance by uniting believers to the ascended Christ so that we feed on his body and blood. The Reformed call this the **real spiritual presence**: real because it is the res, the very body and blood of Christ that nourish us, spiritual because the mode is by the Spirit through faith, not by local inclusion. Calvin rejects manducatio impiorum in the Lutheran form; the wicked receive the sacrament and its sign, and even the sacramental encounter with Christ as judge, but do not receive Christ’s life-giving flesh. The feeding is inseparable from union with Christ, and union is by faith alone. 1 Corinthians 10 speaks of a participation in the body of Christ that cannot be reduced to cognition; 1 Corinthians 11 warns that profanation brings judgment, which presupposes a holy reality not reducible to memory. Calvin’s **sacramental union** differs from the Lutheran: the Spirit conjoins sign and thing not locally but by covenantal promise, secured by the extra Calvinisticum that preserves the integrity of Christ’s natures and the genuine locality of his glorified body. This Christology guards against collapsing divine majesty into human nature while retaining a high sacramental realism. In Geneva Calvin’s ecclesiology complements his sacramentology. The Supper belongs to the visible church as a **means of grace** administered by ministers and elders. The Consistory barred scandalous persons from the Table, insisting that public repentance precede admission. This is **fencing the table**: explaining the meaning of the Supper, warning the unrepentant, and restricting admission to those under discipline and in credible fellowship. Calvin’s practice already anticipates Westminster’s doctrine of the **keys of the kingdom** applied sacramentally.

George Gillespie represents the mature Westminster articulation of admission and discipline. In Aaron’s Rod Blossoming and in the Assembly debates, he defends the divine right of elders to govern admission by the **keys of the kingdom**, deriving authority from Matthew 16, Matthew 18, and 1 Corinthians 5 and 11. The Supper is not a private devotional moment but an act of the church gathered, and the elders’ duty is to guard Christ’s ordinance from profanation. The Directory for Public Worship commends explicit **fencing the table** in preaching and in the invitations, including warning against hypocrisy and unbelief, and commands that the scandalous and the ignorant be kept back until catechized and repentant. Admission is not a reward for moral perfection but a judgment of credible profession and non-scandalous life in submission to the church’s discipline. Gillespie pushes back against Erastian magistracy and against an indiscriminate open table. His position grounds the later Reformed and Presbyterian practice of close communion: the Table is open to baptized, credibly professing believers who are members in good standing of true churches and are not under censure.

The defended position receives its formal shape from Calvin’s sacramental realism and Gillespie’s polity. Christ is truly present and given, not by local inclusion of his glorified body into the elements, nor by a bare memorial that renders the Supper a cognitive exercise, but by the Spirit, who unites believers to the ascended Christ and makes the bread and wine instruments of his gracious self-communication. Because the Supper is a **means of grace** within the **covenant of grace**, its admission is covenantally regulated. Baptism admits to the visible church; the Supper nourishes those who profess faith and are under discipline. The elders, by the **keys of the kingdom**, must frame the ordinance with instruction and warning and must refuse admission to the scandalous and impenitent. This is not clericalism but pastoral obedience to 1 Corinthians 5, which commands purging leaven for the sake of the new lump, and to 1 Corinthians 11, which warns of judgment upon profanation.

Three layers of debate challenge and refine this stance. Externally, Roman Catholic theology demands a response at the level of presence and efficacy. We reject **transubstantiation** not because we deny strong presence, but because it binds presence to a change of substance that competes with the ascension and encourages adoration of the host as localized Christ. The Reformed will confess that the Supper is more than symbol, that it exhibits the reality to believers, and that grace is conferred through it, while denying that grace is conferred ex opere operato irrespective of faith. When pressed with Aquinas’s insistence that the wicked eat Christ sacramentally, we answer that Augustine’s sign-res distinction, properly framed by union with the ascended Christ, explains both the reality of sacramental encounter and the impossibility of salvific feeding apart from faith. To the examiner’s inevitable query whether we thereby reduce the Supper to faith itself, the answer is no: the Spirit binds the promise to the sign by divine institution such that the Supper is an objective **means of grace**; faith is the receiving instrument, not the cause of presence.

The Lutheran critique fixes on two claims: that we undermine the words of institution and deny manducatio impiorum in the proper sense. We answer that we uphold the words by uniting the sign and the thing, but we clarify the mode in light of Christ’s **ascension and session**. The ascended Christ’s body is locally in heaven, and the Spirit joins us to him there. The genus maiestaticum as Lutherans deploy it risks implying **ubiquity** of the human nature and thereby confounding the natures or evacuating the ascension into metaphor. We affirm communication of attributes at the level of the person and the communicatio idiomatum in predication, but we deny that divine attributes are predicated of the human nature in such a way as to make it omnipresent. The examiner who alleges Nestorian separation should be met with the extra Calvinisticum: the Logos is not confined to the flesh, the natures remain distinct, and yet the person is one. On manducatio impiorum, we grant that the wicked receive the sacrament to their judgment, but because feeding is a mode of participation in Christ’s life given by the Spirit, and the Spirit is not divided from faith, the unbeliever does not truly feed on Christ. He profanes holy things and meets Christ as judge, which explains 1 Corinthians 11, without granting salvific participation.

To memorialism the Reformed response is sharper. The Supper is not bare remembrance. 1 Corinthians 10 asserts participation in the body and blood of Christ. The union signified and sealed is not mental but covenantal and pneumatic. The Supper strengthens faith, confirms promises, and increases assurance because Christ is present and gives himself. Memorialism, in reducing presence to thought, attenuates the Supper into didactics and abolishes its status among the **means of grace**. We gladly affirm that it is a remembrance and a proclamation, but we insist that proclamation is sacramental communication of Christ’s benefits to believers.

Internally, Reformed debates center on the nature of the **real spiritual presence**, the question of paedocommunion, the scope of admission, and practices surrounding the elements and frequency. The Westminster Confession identifies a **sacramental union** such that the names and effects of the thing signified are predicated of the sign. Christ is “spiritually present to the faith of believers” and “the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present.” The question of manducatio impiorum divides those who, following Calvin, deny that the wicked feed on Christ in any sense, and those who, influenced by Bucer and some strands of Reformed orthodoxy, maintain a judicial manducation in which Christ is present to the wicked as judge. The better view maintains Calvin’s line: the wicked eat the sacrament and incur judgment because they profane that which is holy and because the Supper’s form binds Christ’s pledge to the sign. But feeding on Christ is an act of union wrought by the Spirit through faith and thus belongs to believers alone.

On paedocommunion, appeal is made to the unity of covenant sacraments. Yet the Reformed insistence on **worthy reception** grounded in 1 Corinthians 11’s requirements of self-examination, discerning the body, and judging oneself presses toward communicants who can credibly profess faith. Infant status in the **covenant of grace** is real and signified by baptism, but the Supper is for nourishment by conscious appropriation. Augustine’s own practice and the broad medieval and Reformation consensus of delayed communion to the catechized support this. To the objection that 1 Corinthians addressed only a particular abuse, we respond that Paul grounds the warning in the nature of the Supper and the necessity of discerning the Lord’s body; the moral logic is not incidental.

On open versus close communion, some argue that barring is inhospitable and confuses grace with works. But the Supper is not the table of the church’s hospitality; it is the Lord’s Table where he distributes his body and blood. The **keys of the kingdom** are given not to an amorphous crowd but to the church’s officers to bind and loose. The biblical pattern requires separation from scandalous sin in 1 Corinthians 5 to preserve the new lump, then requires discernment at the Supper in 1 Corinthians 11. Close communion is not closed sectarianism, because admission extends to baptized, credibly professing members in good standing of other true churches. It is not perfectionism, because credible profession does not demand sinlessness but submission to Christ’s rule. The elders’ jurisdiction is ministerial and declarative, not magisterial; they announce Christ’s judgments and shepherd consciences with warnings and comfort. To the pastoral objection that strict fencing traumatizes the weak, the answer is to pastor with tenderness: fence by explaining the gospel, invite the repentant, and make clear that bruised reeds are welcome, while still barring the impenitent for their good and Christ’s honor.

Contemporary debates test the doctrine. Online communion appeared during pandemic restrictions. But the Supper is an ecclesial act of the assembled body. Paul’s logic in 1 Corinthians 10 emphasizes one bread and one body, and 11 rebukes divisions when you come together. The sign of common loaf and cup, the sharing of an action under ordained ministry, and the public nature of admission and discipline cannot be replicated by dispersed individuals. We conclude that virtual communion is not a valid administration. On elements, the ordinary signs are bread and wine. The Reformed can allow pastoral accommodations for medical necessity without redefining the sign; however, habitual substitution of grape juice for wine should be resisted as a principle lest the sign’s integrity erode. Intinction, the practice of dipping bread into wine, distorts the double sign that accentuates Christ’s poured-out blood and the act of drinking as appropriation; better to maintain the distinct actions that the Lord instituted. Frequency is a prudential matter; Calvin desired weekly communion to establish the Supper as a regular **means of grace**, but the confession leaves liberty to sessions.

The ecclesial act of **fencing the table** requires three movements. First, catechesis that communicates the Supper’s nature as **means of grace**, the necessity of faith and repentance, and the eschatological hope it proclaims. Second, pastoral warning that unrepentant sin and unbelief are incompatible with worthy reception, a warning framed by the gospel that Christ receives sinners who come to him. Third, juridical oversight by elders who admit those in good standing and exclude those under discipline or manifestly ignorant. This practice flows from Matthew 18’s pattern of discipline and from 1 Corinthians 5’s command to remove the wicked man. The Supper is where godly discipline culminates in restoration or, tragically, in temporary barring for the soul’s sake.

The coherence of this position across loci is crucial. Christology determines presence. The Reformed commit to the extra Calvinisticum and the reality of the ascension so that the presence in the Supper is mediated by the Spirit. Pneumatology determines the mode. The Spirit, who unites us to Christ in all **means of grace**, uses signs to communicate the res to faith. Ecclesiology determines admission. The visible church is a covenant society with officers tasked to guard word and sacrament. **Federal theology** situates the Supper as the covenant meal for those who have been incorporated into Christ by faith. Sanctification and assurance are nourished at the Table as the Spirit seals promises and strengthens weak believers. There is no contradiction between strong presence and strict admission, because the holiness of Christ’s presence is why admission matters. Fencing is not an overlay of moralism but the recognition that this holy feast can be to judgment if profaned.

Anticipated objections can be answered succinctly. If Christ is in heaven, how can he be present here? Because the Spirit lifts us to the ascended Christ; presence is not only local inclusion but covenantal encounter. If strict fencing undermines grace, why did Jesus eat with sinners? He ate to call them to repentance. The Lord’s Table is the sign and seal of that repentance and faith, not its substitute. If the wicked can be present in body, does that not imply manducatio impiorum in the Lutheran sense? It implies sacred encounter and judgment upon profanation, not saving feeding. If ecumenical charity urges broad intercommunion, why restrict? Because the Supper is also an expression of visible unity in truth; admission without shared confession regarding the gospel and discipline creates a lie. If children belong to the covenant, why withhold? Because the Supper’s form requires self-examination and discerning the body. The same covenant logic that extends baptism to infants extends catechesis to children and then communion upon credible confession.

The decisive figures frame this synthesis. Augustine contributes the sign-res grammar and the idea that sacraments confer what they signify to believers, with a clear path to understanding unworthy reception. Aquinas enshrines a local presence and **ex opere operato** causality that we reject on Christological and biblical grounds while learning from his insistence that the sacrament is more than mental sign. Luther compels us to take the promise with concrete seriousness and to confess a real presence that judges and saves. Zwingli warns us not to blur the ascension or to magic the Supper into a quasi-pagan rite, yet he shows the limits of memorialism as a doctrine of nourishment. Calvin supplies the constructive heart: the **real spiritual presence** of the ascended Christ by the Spirit to faith. Gillespie supplies the juridical backbone: the **keys of the kingdom** regulate admission as an exercise of love for Christ’s name and his sheep.

The final test is pastoral. A church that announces Christ crucified and risen must set the Table each Lord’s Day, fence it with gospel warnings and invitations, admit those who profess Christ and live under his rule, and exclude the impenitent until they repent. In that gathered act the Spirit communicates the body and blood of Christ to believers, sealing remission of sins and strengthening them for obedience. That is not a mere ordinance; it is communion with the living Lord and one another, a participation in the body of Christ, and a foretaste of the marriage supper of the Lamb. To guard it with discipline and receive it with faith is not legalism but love, for in this holy meal the church meets her Lord.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Lord’s Supper is a **means of grace** where believers truly feed on the body and blood of the ascended Christ by the Spirit through faith, and the church, by the **keys of the kingdom**, must practice **fencing the table** to admit baptized, credibly professing, non-scandalous communicants.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: sign-res, sacramental realism tied to faith; unworthy receive sacrament, not the res.
  - Thomas Aquinas: **transubstantiation**, local presence, **ex opere operato** efficacy; manducatio impiorum sacramentally.
  - Martin Luther: **sacramental union**, ubiquity, manducatio impiorum; fierce rejection of memorialism.
  - Huldrych Zwingli: memorialist accent, ascension priority, Supper as oath and remembrance.
  - John Calvin: **real spiritual presence** by the Spirit, extra Calvinisticum, denial of manducatio impiorum, Geneva’s fencing.
  - George Gillespie: Westminster discipline, **fencing the table**, close communion by elder oversight.
- Debates:
  - Internal: mode of **real spiritual presence**, manducatio impiorum, paedocommunion, close versus open communion, elements and frequency.
  - External: Roman **transubstantiation** and **ex opere operato**, Lutheran ubiquity and oral manducation, free-church memorialism, Orthodox epiclesis.
  - Contemporary: online communion, trauma-sensitive fencing, intercommunion, wine versus grape juice, intinction.
- Defended position: Westminster Reformed account of presence and admission; the Spirit unites communicants to the ascended Christ for true feeding; elders exercise admission and discipline; close communion, no paedocommunion, no virtual communion.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - If Christ is locally in heaven, how is he present at the Supper? By the Spirit’s covenantal action uniting us to him; presence is real, not local.
  - Do the wicked eat Christ? They receive the sacrament to judgment but do not savingly feed on Christ.
  - Why fence the table if grace is free? Because the Supper is the Lord’s holy ordinance and Scripture commands guarding it for his honor and the flock’s good.
  - Why not paedocommunion? Because the Supper’s form requires self-examination and discerning the body.
  - Is online communion valid? No, the Supper is an act of the assembled body with one bread under ordained oversight.
