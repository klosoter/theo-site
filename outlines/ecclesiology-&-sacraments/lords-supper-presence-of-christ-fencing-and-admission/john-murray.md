# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **Lord’s Supper** with a strong emphasis on its role as a **means of grace**, affirming the **real spiritual presence of Christ** while rejecting both transubstantiation and mere memorialism. He advocated for careful **fencing of the table** and maintained that **admission** should be governed by the church’s responsibility to uphold the integrity of the sacrament and the purity of the visible church.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual Presence of Christ**
   - Christ is truly, though spiritually, present in the Supper, not merely symbolically.
   - The believer partakes of Christ by faith through the operation of the Holy Spirit.
   - The sacrament is a means by which the benefits of Christ’s redemptive work are communicated.
   - Rejects both Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Zwinglian memorialism.
   - "The presence of Christ is real and effectual, but it is spiritual, not corporeal." ("The Theology of the Lord’s Supper")

2. **Means of Grace**
   - The Lord’s Supper is a divinely appointed means for the strengthening of faith.
   - Participation brings spiritual nourishment and growth in union with Christ.
   - The efficacy of the sacrament is inseparable from the Word and the work of the Spirit.
   - The Supper is not efficacious ex opere operato but through faith.
   - "The Lord’s Supper is a means of grace, not by any power inherent in itself, but by the blessing of Christ and the working of his Spirit in those who receive it by faith." ("Christian Baptism")

3. **Fencing the Table**
   - The church has a duty to guard the sacrament from profanation.
   - Only those who make a credible profession of faith should be admitted.
   - Elders are responsible for examining and discerning communicants.
   - Fencing protects both the individual and the church from judgment.
   - "It is the solemn responsibility of the church to guard the table of the Lord." ("The Theology of the Lord’s Supper")

4. **Admission to the Supper**
   - Admission is not a private right but a privilege regulated by Christ’s ordinance.
   - The visible church must exercise discipline in admitting communicants.
   - Baptism is a prerequisite for participation in the Lord’s Supper.
   - The church must balance charity with fidelity to Christ’s commands.
   - "Admission to the Lord’s Table is not a matter of individual discretion but of ecclesiastical oversight." ("Christian Baptism")

5. **Covenantal Context**
   - The Supper is a covenant meal, signifying and sealing the benefits of the new covenant.
   - Participation expresses and strengthens the unity of the body of Christ.
   - The sacrament is rooted in the redemptive work of Christ and the promises of God.
   - The Lord’s Supper anticipates the consummation of the covenant at Christ’s return.
   - "The Lord’s Supper is the covenant feast of the people of God, sealing to them the blessings of redemption." ("The Covenant of Grace")

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s robust articulation of the **spiritual presence of Christ** in the Lord’s Supper has shaped Reformed sacramental theology in the twentieth century, especially within Presbyterian and confessional Reformed circles. His careful attention to the **fencing of the table** and the church’s responsibility in admission practices continues to influence ecclesiastical procedures. Murray’s work remains a standard for those seeking a biblically grounded, confessionally faithful approach to the sacraments.
