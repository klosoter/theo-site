# Zwingli, Huldrych (1484–1531)

Zwingli’s doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** is marked by a strong emphasis on its **memorial** character, denying any **real presence** of Christ in the elements. He insisted that the Supper is a symbolic act of remembrance, not a means of conveying **grace** or a site of **sacramental union**, and advocated for careful **fencing** and **admission** to preserve the purity of the church.

- "This is my body means the same as 'This signifies my body.'" (On the Lord’s Supper, 1526)

## Key Works

- "On the Lord’s Supper" (1526)
- "Friendly Exegesis" (1527)
- "Sixty-Seven Articles" (1523)
- "Exposition of the Christian Faith" (1531)
- Ulrich Zwingli: Selected Works, ed. Samuel M. Jackson

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Memorialism over Real Presence**
   - The Supper is a **commemorative ordinance**, not a means of conveying Christ’s body or blood.
   - Christ is present **spiritually** to faith, but not physically or substantially in the elements.
   - The words "This is my body" are interpreted as **figurative**.
   - The focus is on remembrance and proclamation of Christ’s death.
   - "The eating is nothing else than the remembrance of the death of Christ." (On the Lord’s Supper, 1526)

2. **Rejection of Sacramental Efficacy**
   - The elements do not **confer grace** or effect union with Christ.
   - Faith alone is the means by which believers receive spiritual benefit.
   - The Supper is not a **means of regeneration** or sanctification.
   - The act is a public testimony of faith, not a mystical participation.
   - "Nothing is effected by the eating of the bread and drinking of the wine." (On the Lord’s Supper, 1526)

3. **Strict Fencing of the Table**
   - Admission is reserved for those who **profess faith** and live uprightly.
   - The church must guard against **unworthy participation**.
   - Discipline is necessary to maintain the Supper’s integrity.
   - The Supper is not for the **impenitent** or those outside the visible church.
   - "No one should come to the table who is not of the number of the faithful." (Exposition of the Christian Faith, 1531)

4. **Covenantal Community Focus**
   - The Supper is a sign of **Christian unity** and communal remembrance.
   - Participation affirms membership in the **covenant people**.
   - The act is corporate, not individualistic.
   - The church’s purity is maintained through shared discipline and confession.
   - "We are all one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." (Friendly Exegesis, 1527)

5. **Scriptural Authority in Practice**
   - All aspects of the Supper must be governed by **Scripture alone**.
   - Human traditions and innovations are rejected.
   - The words of institution are interpreted in their biblical context.
   - The church’s practice is reformed according to the **Word of God**.
   - "We must hold to the clear teaching of Scripture and not to the inventions of men." (Sixty-Seven Articles, 1523)

## Legacy and Impact

Zwingli’s **memorialist** view of the Lord’s Supper decisively shaped the Reformed tradition’s approach to the sacrament, especially in contrast to both **Lutheran** and **Roman Catholic** positions. His strict fencing of the table influenced later Reformed practices of church discipline and admission to the Supper. While his denial of any real presence was controversial, it established a clear alternative within Protestant sacramental theology. Zwingli’s emphasis on **Scripture alone** and the communal nature of the Supper continues to inform Reformed ecclesiology and worship.
