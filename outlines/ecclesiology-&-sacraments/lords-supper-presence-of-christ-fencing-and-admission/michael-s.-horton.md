# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton approaches the **Lord’s Supper** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the **real spiritual presence of Christ** and the importance of **Word and sacrament** in the life of the church. He upholds the necessity of **fencing the table** and careful **admission** to the Supper, grounding these practices in covenant theology and the church’s responsibility to maintain the integrity of the means of grace.

- "The Lord’s Supper is not merely a memorial but a means by which Christ communicates himself to us by the Spirit through faith." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology
- A Better Way: Rediscovering the Drama of God-Centered Worship
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples
- "Union with Christ" (in various essays and articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Real Spiritual Presence of Christ**
    - Affirms that Christ is truly present in the Supper, not physically but by the Holy Spirit.
    - Rejects both **transubstantiation** and mere memorialism, aligning with classic Reformed teaching.
    - Emphasizes that believers are genuinely nourished by Christ through faith.
    - Connects the Supper to the ongoing ministry of the ascended Christ.
    - "Christ is present in the Supper, not by coming down to us physically, but by raising us up to himself spiritually." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Means of Grace**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a divinely instituted means by which God communicates grace.
    - Stresses the inseparability of **Word and sacrament** in the church’s life.
    - Argues that the Supper strengthens faith and assures believers of their union with Christ.
    - Maintains that the efficacy of the Supper depends on the Holy Spirit’s work, not the minister’s action.
    - "The sacraments are visible words, confirming and sealing the promises of the gospel." (A Better Way)

3. **Covenant Context**
    - Grounds the Lord’s Supper in the framework of **covenant theology**.
    - Sees the Supper as a renewal of the covenant community’s relationship with God.
    - Emphasizes the communal and ecclesial dimensions of participation.
    - Connects fencing and admission to the church’s covenantal responsibilities.
    - "The Supper is not a private act but a covenant meal for the people of God." (People and Place)

4. **Fencing the Table**
    - Advocates for the church’s duty to guard the table from unworthy participation.
    - Bases fencing on biblical warnings (e.g., 1 Corinthians 11) and pastoral care.
    - Sees fencing as an act of love and discipline, not exclusion for its own sake.
    - Encourages clear teaching and examination before admission to the Supper.
    - "Fencing the table is an expression of the church’s care for the spiritual well-being of its members." (A Better Way)

5. **Admission to the Supper**
    - Requires a credible profession of faith and self-examination for participation.
    - Supports the role of elders in discerning who may partake.
    - Opposes open communion apart from faith and repentance.
    - Stresses the formative role of the Supper in shaping Christian identity and discipleship.
    - "Admission to the Lord’s Table is not a right but a gracious privilege for those united to Christ by faith." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed sacramental theology**, especially regarding the Lord’s Supper. His work has renewed interest in the **means of grace** and the church’s responsibility in both fencing and admission to the table. Horton’s accessible yet robust articulation of the **real spiritual presence** has influenced pastors, theologians, and laypeople, helping to recover a richer understanding of the Supper in evangelical and Reformed circles.
