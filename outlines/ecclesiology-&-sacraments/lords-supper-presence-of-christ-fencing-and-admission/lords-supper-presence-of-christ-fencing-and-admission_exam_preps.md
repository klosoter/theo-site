### ESSAY
The doctrine of the Lord’s Supper raises a double question: who is present and who may come. These two concerns, **presence** and **admission**, must be treated together because Scripture itself binds them. If Christ truly gives himself in the Supper, then to partake unworthily is to “eat and drink judgment” by profaning the body and blood of the Lord. The nature of Christ’s presence is not a speculative problem isolated from the church’s life; it is the dogmatic ground of **fencing the table**, of discipline, and of pastoral care. My thesis is that a classic Reformed account of a **spiritual yet real presence**, received through faith by the Holy Spirit, best accounts for the biblical data, coheres with **Christology** and **ecclesiology**, and provides the only stable foundation for serious but evangelical admission practices.

To establish that, it is useful to trace how the conceptual center of eucharistic theology shifted at key turning points. Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Bavinck are decisive not because they simply offered different variants of “presence,” but because each reoriented what it meant to speak of this sacrament as a gift of Christ to his church, and thereby implicitly or explicitly shaped admission practices.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430) is the fountainhead of Western sacramental reflection. His central conceptual contribution is the distinction between **sign and thing signified**, grounded in his broader theology of signs and in his doctrine of the church. For Augustine, the sacrament is a “visible word” that signifies and seals the reality of Christ and his body, but it is not simply a bare sign. The Lord’s Supper is a sacramentum that bears and offers the res, the thing signified, which is Christ himself and the unity of his mystical body. His famous exhortation, “be what you see and receive what you are: the body of Christ,” shows how presence and ecclesiology are interwoven. The communicant truly receives Christ but only as incorporated into the body by the Spirit.

This leads Augustine to a crucial double distinction: between **sacramental presence** and **saving participation**, and between the visible and invisible church. All receive the sacramentum outwardly; only the elect receive the res unto salvation. Thus he anticipates the later Reformed insistence that the efficacy of the sacrament is tied to the Spirit’s sovereign work and to faith. At the same time, Augustine insists that even wicked communicants receive the body and blood in a certain sense, but to their judgment, because they handle the holy sign of a reality they contradict by their life. Examiners will ask whether Augustine teaches that unbelievers “receive Christ” in the Supper. The best answer is that, for Augustine, their contact is with the sacrament as a holy sign of Christ and his body; they are in dangerous proximity to the holy, but they do not have communion with Christ in the saving sense. This is the seed of a theology that can take seriously both the objectivity of the sacrament and the necessity of discipline.

Admission and fencing in Augustine’s practice are shaped by his robust doctrine of the visible church as a mixed body. He does not advocate a rigorist table for only the demonstrably godly; yet he disciplines notorious sinners and warns against profanation. His reading of 1 Corinthians 11 binds the reality of judgment to the holiness of what is offered. This accommodation of a mixed table under pastoral oversight becomes an important background for later Reformed discussions of “communicant membership” and the distinction between credible profession and perfect sanctity.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), as the greatest medieval scholastic of the West, decisively reshapes the language of presence with his account of **transubstantiation**. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the questions on the Eucharist, Aquinas deploys Aristotelian categories of substance and accidents to articulate a maximal realism: by the consecration, the substance of bread and wine ceases, and the whole substance of Christ’s body and blood is present under the appearances. This is not mere localization, as if Christ left heaven, but a unique sacramental mode of presence grounded in his glorified body and the power of the words of institution. For Aquinas, the Eucharist contains Christ substantially and truly.

Aquinas connects this presence to three effects: union with Christ, growth in charity, and the signification and causation of ecclesial unity. Here one sees both continuity and contrast with Augustine. Augustine’s sign–thing framework becomes, in Aquinas, a metaphysical account of how the sign bears the thing. Yet Aquinas emphasizes that the sacrament has **instrumental causality** ex opere operato: rightly administered, it confers grace by virtue of Christ’s institution, though the recipient’s disposition determines whether this grace is received rightly or as judgment. Unbelievers and the unrepentant truly receive Christ’s body sacramentally but without the fructifying effect of grace.

Roman Catholic discipline follows from this ontology. Because what is present is the very body of Christ, the sacrament itself must be reverenced. This yields practices of eucharistic adoration, reservation, and processions. Regarding admission, the Council of Trent will codify the need for confession prior to communion for those conscious of mortal sin and will reinforce episcopal and pastoral responsibility for excluding manifest public sinners. Examiners will often ask whether transubstantiation is necessary to safeguard real presence or to justify fencing. A Reformed answer must affirm Aquinas’s seriousness about the objectivity and holiness of the sacrament, while rejecting his metaphysical construction as inconsistent with a proper account of Christ’s ascension and the integrity of the sign. If the bread ceases to be bread, the sacrament as a true sign is undermined, and Christ’s human nature risks being construed as ubiquitous in a way that strains **Chalcedonian Christology**.

The Reformation reconfigures the whole field by relocating the conceptual center of the Supper from the sacrament’s metaphysical structure to the **promise of the word** and the mode of reception. Yet the Reformers profoundly disagree about how to articulate real presence. Martin Luther (1483–1546) is decisive as the leading opponent of both Zwinglian memorialism and transubstantiation. In his attack on what he sees as “fanatics,” Luther insists on the simple, literal force of Christ’s words, “This is my body.” He rejects the Aristotelian machinery of substance and accidents, yet he affirms an equally robust presence: the body and blood of Christ are truly present “in, with, and under” the bread and wine. The later label **sacramental union** captures Luther’s conviction that the elements and Christ’s body enter into a real though ineffable union by virtue of the word.

Luther’s Christological commitments underpin this. He develops a communicatio idiomatum in which the attributes of the divine nature may be truly predicated of the human nature of Christ in the unity of the person, including omnipresence. The right hand of God is everywhere; therefore Christ’s glorified body can be truly present at many altars simultaneously. From a Reformed standpoint, this is a crucial fault line. To preserve the integrity of **two-natures Christology** and the finitude of Christ’s human nature, the Reformed deny the ubiquity of the body and instead locate the presence in the action of the Spirit who lifts the church to Christ in heaven.

Luther is keenly aware of the danger of unworthy reception. In his catechetical work and sermons, he emphasizes catechesis, confession, and absolution before communion. Yet he does not favor creating an inner circle of elite communicants. His stress falls on faith in the word and the comfort of consciences. The Supper is primarily a gift for sinners, not a reward for the mature. This frames one side of an ongoing internal Protestant debate: is discipline at the table more about guarding the sacrament from profanation or about guarding weak consciences and the integrity of the church’s witness without lapsing into sectarian rigorism?

John Calvin (1509–1564) is the most decisive architect of the Reformed account of the Lord’s Supper and of the corresponding practices of admission. Against both Zwinglian memorialism and Lutheran sacramental union, Calvin articulates a doctrine of **spiritual real presence** grounded in union with Christ and the work of the Spirit. In the Institutes, especially book 4, Calvin insists that in the Supper believers truly partake of Christ’s flesh and blood unto life, but not by a crude eating with the mouth. The “substance of the sacrament” is Christ himself, who remains bodily in heaven according to his human nature. The mode of presence is not local but spiritual: the Spirit binds us to Christ and causes his life to flow into us. The bread and wine are true signs and seals of this communion; through them, when accompanied by the word and received in faith, Christ communicates himself.

This position has several advantages Calvin exploits in controversy. First, it preserves the integrity of Christ’s ascension and the finitude of his human body. Second, it allows a robust affirmation of **sacramental efficacy** without collapsing into ex opere operato. The Supper genuinely nourishes faith, yet only as faith grasps Christ through the Spirit. Third, it roots sacramental theology in **covenant** and **union with Christ**, integrating the Supper with justification, sanctification, and ecclesiology.

Calvin’s view of unworthy reception is nuanced. Following Augustine, he distinguishes between the sacramental sign and the saving reality. In one sense, all communicants receive the same Christ offered; in another, the wicked receive only as a savor of death. They do not enjoy union, yet they still incur guilt for profaning sacred things and contradicting with their life what they profess with their mouth. This theological spine supports a serious doctrine of fencing. For Calvin, the Supper is given to the visible church, but the elders, as guardians of the mysteries, must bar those whose life and confession openly contradict Christ.

Calvin’s practice in Geneva was controversial. He clashed with the city council over his refusal to dispense the Supper to those under discipline. He argued that ministers would profane Christ by placing the holy things into manifestly unrepentant hands. This is not perfectionism; Calvin accepts a mixed table of weak and struggling believers. But scandalous sinners, unrepentant in doctrine or life, are to be barred. Examiners may press whether this confuses the visible and invisible church or whether it trespasses on the magistrate’s role. The Reformed answer is that **church discipline** in admission is an exercise of the keys of the kingdom entrusted to elders, distinct from civil punishment, and that it rests on Christ’s explicit commands about reconciliation and excommunication. The Lord’s Supper is a church ordinance, not a civic right.

Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) is decisive because he restates classic Reformed eucharistic doctrine with modern clarity and integrates it with a rich ecclesiology. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck affirms with Calvin that Christ is really present and really given in the Supper, but not corporeally. He stresses **covenant fellowship**: God in Christ gives himself to his people, and they, in faith, respond in gratitude and obedience. Bavinck pushes against any reduction of the Supper to subjectivism by insisting on its objective character as a means of grace appointed by God. At the same time, he warns against overobjectivizing the sacrament as if it conferred grace mechanically.

On admission and fencing, Bavinck stands within the Dutch Reformed tradition that developed careful practices of public profession, catechetical preparation, and supervised access. He affirms **close communion** in principle: participation is for those who, by credible profession and life, belong to the visible church and are not under discipline. Yet he is acutely sensitive to the pastoral dimension. Elders must avoid both indiscriminate open tables, which deny the sanctity of Christ’s ordinance, and legalistic barriers that turn the Supper into a badge of spiritual achievement.

With these figures in place, we can map the internal, external, and contemporary debates that a Westminster oral exam will probe. Externally, Reformed theology stands between Roman Catholic transubstantiation and Lutheran sacramental union on one side, and various memorialist or purely symbolic views on the other. The Reformed insist on **real presence** without local presence, on spiritual communion without material mutation. An examiner may press whether “spiritual presence” is simply a dodge for absence. The reply must be that for the New Testament, “spiritual” does not mean unreal but means wrought by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the bond of union between the ascended Christ and his body on earth; to call Christ spiritually present is to say he is present as the life-giving last Adam, the quickening Spirit, working through ordained means.

Against Rome, the Reformed reject the necessity or coherence of transubstantiation, arguing that Scripture nowhere forces such an explanation and that it jeopardizes **sacramental signification** and the reality of Christ’s ascension. Against Lutheranism, they deny the ubiquity of Christ’s human body and argue that Luther’s Christology endangers the distinction of natures. Against memorialism, they insist that the Supper is not simply a subjective act of remembering but a divinely appointed means by which Christ himself strengthens faith through real self-communication. This external positioning is not mere polemic; it provides the dogmatic environment within which discipline makes sense. If the Supper is only a memorial, fencing the table looks like oppressive gatekeeping. If it is a re‑sacrifice or a quasi-automatic channel of grace, discipline risks becoming a juridical control of grace by the hierarchy. Only if the Supper is a real means of union with Christ given to the church as steward do the keys and the guarding of the table have their proper evangelical shape.

Internally, Reformed debates focus on two related matters: the nature of presence and the criteria for admission. On presence, disputes arise between more “Calvinian” and more “Zwinglian” strands. Some within the tradition have downplayed sacramental efficacy, speaking of the Supper almost exclusively as a memorial or public testimony. Others, following Calvin and Bavinck, emphasize that Christ truly feeds his people there in a way irreducible to bare remembering. The Westminster Standards align clearly with the latter, speaking of the Supper as a means whereby Christ “really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually” is received and fed upon by faith. In an exam, one must articulate clearly how this differs from both Rome and Zwingli, and how it undergirds an expectation that the Supper will actually strengthen weak believers.

On admission, internal debates have surfaced historically in controversies over communicant membership, the relationship between baptism and the Supper, and recent arguments over paedocommunion. Classic Reformed practice has required a **credible profession of faith**, catechetical instruction, and a life not marked by scandal as conditions for admission. The Supper is the sacrament of ongoing **covenant renewal** and nourishment, not the initiating sacrament. Thus infants are baptized but not admitted to the table until they can examine themselves in the sense of 1 Corinthians 11 and discern the Lord’s body. Advocates of paedocommunion argue that in 1 Corinthians 11 Paul addresses abuses of adults, not children as such, and that the Passover pattern suggests covenant children should share in the meal. A Westminster candidate should respond that Paul’s commands to self-examination and discerning the body, together with the nature of faith as conscious trust in Christ, indicate a level of cognitive and spiritual maturity incompatible with infant communion. Moreover, the Reformed distinction of sacraments follows the logic of **initiation and nourishment**: baptism corresponds to birth, the Supper to feeding. To obscure that distinction is to blur the order of grace.

Contemporary debates significantly stress-test these doctrines, especially around admission and fencing. One axis is the question of an “open table” versus “closed” or “close” communion. Many evangelical churches practice open communion, inviting any self-identified believer present to partake, often with minimal or no fencing language. They appeal to the universality of the body of Christ and the danger of erecting human barriers around divine grace. At the other extreme, some traditions restrict communion to formal members in good standing of that particular congregation or denomination. A Reformed position that best matches Westminster documents is a form of **guarded evangelical communion**: the Supper is for all baptized believers who make a credible profession of faith in the biblical gospel and who are not under discipline, normally in the context of membership in a true church. The session bears responsibility to warn and, where possible, to supervise access.

Here examiners will press with pastoral scenarios. What about a visiting believer from another evangelical church, perhaps with weaker doctrine? What about those struggling with doubt or ongoing sin? The candidate must display both doctrinal clarity and pastoral realism. The standard is not sinlessness but repentance and faith. Those under church discipline for scandalous, unrepentant sin should be barred. Those who are weak yet penitent should be invited and encouraged that the Supper is precisely for those who know their need.

Another contemporary pressure point is ecumenical eucharistic hospitality. In the context of divided churches, some advocate a radically open communion as a sign of unity that might lead toward institutional reconciliation. A Reformed response must insist that the Supper both expresses and deepens existing unity in the truth; it cannot function as a substitute for doctrinal consensus on the gospel and the nature of the church. Admission cannot be detached from **confessional** and **covenantal** commitments without hollowing out the meaning of the sacrament itself.

A further contemporary concern relates to discipline and modern sensibilities about inclusion. To fence the table and to exercise admission control appears harsh or exclusionary in an age that identifies love with affirmation. Yet 1 Corinthians 11 and the broader New Testament witness compel the church to recognize the Supper as both gift and danger. To allow manifestly unrepentant persons to commune is to expose them to judgment and to bear false witness about the holiness of Christ. The Lord’s Supper is a sign and seal of union with Christ and his body; to admit those who openly deny that union in belief or practice is to lie sacramentally. Thus fencing is an act of love, ordered toward repentance and restoration.

Finally, the relationship of fencing to civil membership and public morality must be clarified. In a post‑Christendom setting, the Lord’s table can no longer be treated as a general civic rite. This actually clarifies the church’s position: admission is not a matter of nationality or heritage but of **covenant membership**. The church must disentangle itself from cultural assumptions that everyone has a presumptive right to the sacraments. The sacraments belong to Christ and are administered by his church according to his word. Elders must therefore be prepared to explain graciously why some are invited to the table and others are lovingly asked to refrain, and to connect this practice to the gospel rather than to moralism.

In sum, the Lord’s Supper as the sacrament of Christ’s real spiritual presence cannot be detached from questions of admission and discipline. Augustine’s sign–thing distinction and ecclesiology frame the basic problem of mixed communion. Aquinas’s transubstantiation pushes real presence to metaphysical maximalism and undergirds a strong sacramental discipline, but at a doctrinal cost. Luther’s sacramental union preserves the gift character of the Supper yet strains Christology and leaves admission somewhat less sharply defined. Calvin’s spiritual presence and his Geneva practice of fencing exemplify a model in which union with the ascended Christ, wrought by the Spirit through faith, sets the terms for both participation and exclusion. Bavinck then consolidates this into a mature Reformed synthesis where **means of grace**, **covenant**, and **church discipline** interlock.

The position I defend, in line with Reformed confessional standards, is that in the Lord’s Supper Christ is truly, spiritually, and covenantally present, giving himself to believers as they receive by faith what the signs signify. This presence is not localized in the elements by a change of substance, nor is it reduced to mere subjective recollection. Because Christ thereby renews and seals covenant fellowship with his people, the church is bound to guard the table through careful admission and fencing. The keys of the kingdom are exercised not to hoard grace but to protect Christ’s honor, the church’s integrity, and the souls of communicants. Any account of the Supper or of admission that neglects either side of this unity of presence and discipline will ultimately fail both doctrinally and pastorally.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Lord’s Supper is a **means of grace** in which the ascended Christ is **really and spiritually present**, giving himself to his people through bread and wine as signs and seals of his body and blood, to be received by faith, within a churchly practice of guarded admission and **fencing the table**.
- Decisive figures and stances: Augustine – sign and thing signified, mixed church, judgment on unworthy eating; Aquinas – **transubstantiation** and substantial presence, strong objectivity and discipline; Luther – **sacramental union**, bodily presence grounded in communicatio idiomatum, pastoral emphasis on faith; Calvin – **spiritual real presence**, union with the ascended Christ by the Spirit, robust practice of fencing; Bavinck – synthetic Reformed account tying spiritual presence to **covenant fellowship** and ordered admission.
- Debates: Internal – degree of sacramental efficacy, spiritual presence versus memorialism, criteria for communicant membership and paedocommunion; External – Roman Catholic transubstantiation and ex opere operato, Lutheran ubiquity and sacramental union, Zwinglian or evangelical memorialism; Contemporary – open versus close communion, paedocommunion, ecumenical eucharistic hospitality, and discipline in a culture that resists exclusion.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed **spiritual yet real presence** of Christ in the Supper, received only by faith through the Spirit, integrated with **covenant theology** and a serious practice of admission and church discipline that guards both Christ’s holiness and the good of souls.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How is Reformed spiritual presence different from mere symbolism? It affirms that Christ himself truly communicates his crucified and risen life to believers through the Supper as a divinely appointed means of grace, not as a subjective memory but as Spirit‑wrought communion.
  - Why reject transubstantiation if you affirm real presence? Because it undermines the integrity of the sign, lacks biblical warrant, and conflicts with a proper account of Christ’s ascension and the finitude of his human nature.
  - On what basis do you fence the table? On Christ’s commands in 1 Corinthians 11 and Matthew 18, the holiness of the sacrament as seal of union with Christ, and the elder’s responsibility as stewards of the mysteries to protect both Christ’s honor and the communicant.
  - Why not paedocommunion? Because the Supper, unlike baptism, requires self-examination and discerning the body, which presuppose conscious faith, and because it functions as nourishment following covenant initiation, not as initiation itself.
  - Is fencing unloving or exclusionary? No, it is an expression of covenant love that refuses to let people lie sacramentally about their union with Christ or eat and drink judgment to themselves.
