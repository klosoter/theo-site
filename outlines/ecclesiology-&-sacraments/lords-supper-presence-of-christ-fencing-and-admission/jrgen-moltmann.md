# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann views the **Lord’s Supper** as an eschatological sign of the coming **Kingdom of God**, emphasizing the communal and anticipatory dimensions of Christ’s presence. He rejects both a purely symbolic and a narrowly localized view of **real presence**, instead highlighting the transformative fellowship of the table as a foretaste of the **eschaton** that shapes the church’s identity and openness.

- "The Lord’s Supper is the feast of the liberated, and its table is open to all who are invited by Christ." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Presence of Christ**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a sign of the future **Kingdom of God** realized in the present.
    - Christ’s presence is not localized but experienced in the community gathered in hope.
    - The meal anticipates the final reconciliation and renewal of all things.
    - Participation in the Supper is participation in the coming new creation.
    - "The Eucharist is the anticipation of the feast in God’s kingdom." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

2. **Communal and Open Table**
    - The Eucharist forms and expresses the inclusive community of Christ.
    - Fencing the table is seen as contrary to the open invitation of Jesus.
    - The Supper is a sign of reconciliation, not exclusion.
    - Admission is based on Christ’s invitation, not institutional boundaries.
    - "The table of Jesus is open to all who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Transformative Fellowship**
    - The Lord’s Supper enacts liberation from sin and social barriers.
    - The meal is a protest against injustice and a call to solidarity.
    - The presence of Christ transforms participants into agents of reconciliation.
    - The Eucharist empowers the church for mission in the world.
    - "The Eucharist is the sacrament of the messianic people’s liberation." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

4. **Critique of Traditional Fencing**
    - Moltmann critiques restrictive admission practices as inconsistent with the gospel.
    - He challenges the notion of the Supper as a reward for the righteous.
    - The focus is on grace and hospitality rather than moral or doctrinal qualifications.
    - The church is called to embody Christ’s radical welcome.
    - "The Lord’s Supper is not the meal of the perfect, but of those who are called." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

5. **Sacramental Participation and Memory**
    - The Supper is a memorial of Christ’s passion and a participation in his resurrection life.
    - Remembering Christ is inseparable from anticipating his return.
    - The act of sharing bread and wine unites believers with Christ and one another.
    - The Eucharist is both remembrance and hope, shaping Christian identity.
    - "In the Lord’s Supper, memory and hope are united in the presence of Christ." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of the **Lord’s Supper** has influenced ecumenical discussions by reframing the meal as an open, eschatological event rather than a boundary marker. His emphasis on the **real presence** as communal and transformative has challenged exclusivist practices and inspired movements toward greater inclusivity. Moltmann’s vision continues to shape contemporary debates on the nature of sacramental participation and the mission of the church in the world.
