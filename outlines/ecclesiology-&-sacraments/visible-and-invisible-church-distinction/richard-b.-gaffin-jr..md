# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. articulates the **visible and invisible Church distinction** within a robustly **Reformed ecclesiology**, emphasizing the eschatological and redemptive-historical dimensions of the Church. He maintains that the **visible Church** is the historical, institutional community marked by the means of grace, while the **invisible Church** consists of the elect united to Christ by the Spirit, highlighting the tension and unity between the two.

- "The distinction between the visible and invisible church is not a separation but a differentiation within the one church of Christ." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

## Key Works

- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit"
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment"
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (in Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Church: Organic and Organized" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Visible and Invisible Church as Distinct but United**
    - The **visible Church** is the historical, gathered community professing faith and participating in the sacraments.
    - The **invisible Church** comprises the elect, known only to God, united to Christ by the Spirit.
    - The distinction is conceptual, not ontological; both refer to the one Church in different respects.
    - The unity of the Church is grounded in Christ and realized eschatologically.
    - "The visible/invisible distinction is not a division into two churches but a distinction within the one church." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

2. **Eschatological Orientation of the Church**
    - The Church exists in the tension between the "already" and the "not yet" of redemptive history.
    - The invisible Church anticipates the consummation, when the distinction will be obsolete.
    - The visible Church is provisional, awaiting the final revelation of the sons of God.
    - This eschatological perspective shapes the Church’s mission and identity.
    - "The church is the community of the age to come, existing in the present age." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Means of Grace in the Visible Church**
    - The visible Church is marked by the preaching of the Word, administration of the sacraments, and discipline.
    - These means are the ordinary instruments by which God gathers and builds up his people.
    - Participation in the visible Church is essential for spiritual growth and assurance.
    - The means of grace bridge the visible and invisible aspects of the Church.
    - "The means of grace are the divinely appointed channels by which the benefits of Christ are communicated to his people." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

4. **Organic and Organized Nature of the Church**
    - The Church is both an organism (the body of Christ) and an organization (institution with offices and structure).
    - The visible/invisible distinction maps onto this organic/organized reality.
    - The Church’s organization serves the life and growth of the organism.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the Church’s faithfulness and witness.
    - "The church is both an organism and an organization, and both aspects are essential to its identity." ("The Church: Organic and Organized")

5. **Covenantal and Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - The Church is constituted by the covenant of grace, spanning both Old and New Testaments.
    - The visible/invisible distinction is rooted in the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - The Church’s identity is inseparable from its place in God’s saving purposes.
    - This framework guards against both institutionalism and individualism.
    - "The church is the covenant community, defined by God’s redemptive action in history." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **visible and invisible Church distinction** has shaped contemporary Reformed ecclesiology, especially in its eschatological and redemptive-historical dimensions. His work has influenced debates on the nature of the Church, the means of grace, and the relationship between the Church’s present and future realities. By grounding the distinction in union with Christ and the covenant, Gaffin has provided a nuanced and biblically rich framework that continues to inform both academic and pastoral discussions.
