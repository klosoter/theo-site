# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a clear distinction between the **visible** and **invisible Church**. They emphasize that while the **visible Church** is the congregation of professing believers and their children, the **invisible Church** consists of the true elect known only to God. This distinction safeguards the doctrines of **election**, **covenant**, and the **marks of the true Church**.

- "We believe and profess one catholic or universal Church, which is a holy congregation of true Christian believers, all expecting their salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed by His blood, sanctified and sealed by the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Visible Church as the Congregation of Professing Believers**
    - The visible Church is identified by the gathering of those who profess faith and their children.
    - It is marked by the preaching of the **Word**, administration of the **sacraments**, and exercise of **discipline**.
    - Membership is external and can include hypocrites or non-elect.
    - The visible Church is the sphere where God ordinarily works salvation.
    - "We believe that we ought diligently and circumspectly to discern from the Word of God what is the true Church." (Belgic Confession, Art. 29)

2. **Invisible Church as the Elect Known Only to God**
    - The invisible Church consists of the totality of the elect throughout all ages.
    - Membership is internal, spiritual, and effected by the Holy Spirit.
    - Only God knows with certainty who belongs to the invisible Church.
    - The invisible Church is the true body of Christ, united to Him by faith.
    - "This Church hath been from the beginning of the world, and will be to the end thereof; which is evident from this, that Christ is an eternal King, which, without subjects, He cannot be." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

3. **Marks of the True Church**
    - The true visible Church is recognized by the pure preaching of the gospel.
    - Right administration of the sacraments is essential.
    - Faithful exercise of church discipline is required.
    - These marks distinguish the true Church from false churches.
    - "The marks by which the true Church is known are these: if the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised in punishing of sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 29)

4. **Unity and Catholicity of the Church**
    - There is one universal, catholic Church, despite visible divisions.
    - The unity of the Church is grounded in Christ and the work of the Spirit.
    - Visible congregations are local manifestations of the one Church.
    - The invisible Church is not divided, even if the visible Church appears fractured.
    - "This holy Church is preserved or supported by God, against the rage of the whole world; though she sometimes for a while appears very small." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

5. **Necessity of Belonging to the Visible Church**
    - Outside the visible Church, there is ordinarily no salvation.
    - Believers are called to join themselves to the visible congregation.
    - The visible Church is the means by which God gathers His people.
    - Separation from the visible Church is a grave matter unless it has become a false church.
    - "Out of it [the Church] there is no salvation." (Belgic Confession, Art. 28)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology, especially in Dutch and continental traditions. Their articulation of the **visible and invisible Church distinction** has provided a framework for understanding church membership, discipline, and the assurance of salvation. This distinction continues to influence Reformed confessional identity and ecumenical dialogue, ensuring that the Church’s unity and purity remain central concerns in Reformed theology.
