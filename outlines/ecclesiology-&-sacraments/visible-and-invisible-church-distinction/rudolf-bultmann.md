# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **visible and invisible Church distinction** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He emphasized the Church as a community of authentic faith response rather than an institutional or empirical body, prioritizing the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with Christ over traditional ecclesiological categories.

- "The Church is not a visible institution but the fellowship of those who respond in faith to the word of God." (Faith and Understanding)

## Key Works

- Faith and Understanding
- Theology of the New Testament
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- New Testament and Mythology
- Essays Philosophical and Theological

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Ecclesiology**
    - The Church must be understood apart from mythological or institutional trappings.
    - Focuses on the existential meaning of being part of the Church.
    - Rejects a purely empirical or sociological definition of the Church.
    - Sees the Church as constituted by proclamation and response.
    - "The real Church is where the word is proclaimed and accepted in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The Church is formed by the proclamation of the **kerygma**.
    - The visible community is secondary to the existential encounter with the message.
    - Faith, not institutional membership, defines true participation in the Church.
    - The invisible Church is the fellowship of authentic believers.
    - "The Church is the place where the kerygma is heard and believed." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Church Membership**
    - Membership in the Church is an existential decision, not a matter of external affiliation.
    - The invisible Church consists of those who respond authentically to Christ.
    - The visible Church is a necessary but imperfect expression of the true community.
    - Emphasizes personal faith over sacramental or organizational boundaries.
    - "The Church is invisible because faith itself is invisible." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Institutionalism**
    - Institutional forms can obscure the true nature of the Church.
    - The visible Church is susceptible to legalism and traditionalism.
    - True ecclesial life is dynamic, rooted in the ongoing event of faith.
    - The distinction warns against equating the Church with any historical organization.
    - "The Church is not to be identified with any institution or tradition." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The Church lives in anticipation of the eschaton, not as a completed reality.
    - The invisible Church points to the future fulfillment of God's promise.
    - The visible Church is provisional and always in need of renewal.
    - The distinction underscores the tension between present reality and future hope.
    - "The Church is a pilgrim community, awaiting its consummation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential and **demythologizing** approach to the **visible and invisible Church** distinction has profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology, especially in its emphasis on faith and proclamation over institutional forms. His work challenged traditional ecclesiological categories, prompting ongoing debates about the nature of the Church in the context of modernity. While controversial, his focus on the **kerygma** and authentic faith response continues to influence contemporary discussions on ecclesiology and the meaning of Christian community.
