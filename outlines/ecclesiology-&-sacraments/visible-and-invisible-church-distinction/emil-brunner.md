# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner distinguished sharply between the **visible** and **invisible Church**, emphasizing the existential reality of faith over institutional forms. For Brunner, the **invisible Church** consists of those truly united to Christ by faith, while the **visible Church** is the historical, empirical community that proclaims the Word and administers the sacraments, yet is always mixed and imperfect.

- "The Church is the fellowship of faith, not an institution; it is the invisible communion of those who truly believe, which is only imperfectly represented in the visible congregation." ("The Misunderstanding of the Church")

## Key Works

- "The Misunderstanding of the Church" (1952)
- "Dogmatics, Volume III: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation" (1962)
- "The Divine-Human Encounter" (1943)
- "Truth as Encounter" (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Invisible Church**
    - The **invisible Church** is the true fellowship of believers united to Christ by faith.
    - Membership in the invisible Church is not identical with participation in the visible institution.
    - The invisible Church is known only to God and is not coterminous with any earthly organization.
    - The reality of the Church is grounded in the existential encounter with Christ, not in external forms.
    - "The real Church is invisible, because it is constituted by faith, which cannot be seen." ("The Misunderstanding of the Church")

2. **Critical View of the Visible Church**
    - The **visible Church** is a necessary but imperfect expression of the invisible fellowship.
    - It includes both true believers and nominal Christians, leading to a mixed community.
    - The visible Church is prone to institutionalization and legalism, which can obscure the gospel.
    - Its structures and sacraments are valid only insofar as they serve the proclamation of the Word.
    - "The visible Church is always a mixture, a provisional form, and never the final reality." ("Dogmatics III")

3. **Word and Sacrament as Signs**
    - The **Word** and **sacraments** are outward signs pointing to the inner reality of faith.
    - Their efficacy depends on the existential response of faith, not on the act itself.
    - The visible Church administers these means, but they do not guarantee inclusion in the invisible Church.
    - The sacraments are not magical but relational, serving to awaken and confirm faith.
    - "The sacraments are signs of the reality of the Church, not its substance." ("Dogmatics III")

4. **Existential Encounter with Christ**
    - True membership in the Church is defined by personal encounter with the living Christ.
    - The Church exists where Christ is present in faith, not merely where ecclesiastical forms are found.
    - The invisible Church is created and sustained by the Holy Spirit's work in the heart.
    - Institutional belonging is secondary to the existential relationship with Christ.
    - "The Church is where Christ is present by His Spirit, not where an institution claims His name." ("Truth as Encounter")

5. **Rejection of Ecclesiastical Exclusivism**
    - No single visible Church can claim to be the exclusive community of salvation.
    - The invisible Church transcends denominational and institutional boundaries.
    - Unity is found in faith in Christ, not in organizational uniformity.
    - The visible Church must always be reformed according to the gospel.
    - "The unity of the Church is not an institutional unity, but the unity of faith in Christ." ("The Misunderstanding of the Church")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s distinction between the **visible** and **invisible Church** challenged ecclesiastical triumphalism and emphasized the primacy of faith and the work of the Holy Spirit. His existential approach influenced later Protestant ecclesiology, particularly in the **Neo-Orthodox** tradition. Brunner’s thought continues to provoke discussion on the nature of the Church, the limits of institutional authority, and the meaning of true Christian fellowship.
