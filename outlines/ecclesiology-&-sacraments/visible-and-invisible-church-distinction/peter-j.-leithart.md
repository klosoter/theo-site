# Peter Leithart (1959–)

Peter Leithart challenges the traditional **visible and invisible Church distinction**, arguing for a more integrated and **sacramental ecclesiology**. He emphasizes the **historical, embodied nature of the Church**, contending that the Church’s visible and institutional reality cannot be separated from its spiritual identity.

- "The church is not two things, one visible and one invisible, but one thing with both visible and invisible aspects." (The Kingdom and the Power)

## Key Works

- The Kingdom and the Power: Rediscovering the Centrality of the Church
- The Baptized Body
- The End of Protestantism: Pursuing Unity in a Fragmented Church
- Against Christianity
- "The Church: Sacramental or Social?" (First Things, 2017)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critique of the Traditional Distinction**
   - Argues that the classic **visible/invisible Church** distinction is a post-Reformation construct that undermines ecclesial unity.
   - Claims this distinction leads to a dualism that separates spiritual reality from historical community.
   - Insists that the New Testament presents the Church as a single, concrete body.
   - Sees the distinction as contributing to Protestant fragmentation.
   - "The visible/invisible distinction is not only unscriptural but also ecclesiologically disastrous." (The Kingdom and the Power)

2. **Sacramental Ecclesiology**
   - Emphasizes that the Church is a **sacramental community**, where outward signs and inward grace are inseparable.
   - Argues that baptism and the Lord’s Supper unite the Church’s visible and spiritual realities.
   - Rejects the notion that sacraments are merely external markers of an invisible reality.
   - Sees the Church’s life as fundamentally embodied and enacted in history.
   - "The church is a public, visible, and sacramental body, not a mystical society hidden from view." (The Baptized Body)

3. **Ecclesial Unity**
   - Stresses that the Church is one, both visibly and spiritually, across time and space.
   - Critiques denominationalism as a symptom of the visible/invisible split.
   - Calls for a recovery of the Church’s catholicity and unity in practice.
   - Views schism as a denial of the Church’s true nature.
   - "We must confess one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church, not two churches divided by visibility." (The End of Protestantism)

4. **Historical Embodiment**
   - Argues that the Church’s identity is inseparable from its historical, institutional form.
   - Sees the Church as a political and social reality, not just a spiritual fellowship.
   - Emphasizes the importance of the Church’s public witness and communal practices.
   - Rejects privatized or purely spiritualized notions of ecclesial membership.
   - "The church is a city set on a hill, a visible society whose life is lived before the world." (Against Christianity)

5. **Biblical Theology of the Church**
   - Grounds his ecclesiology in a narrative, biblical-theological approach.
   - Reads the Church as the fulfillment of Israel’s story, both visibly and spiritually.
   - Argues that biblical language about the Church does not support a strict visible/invisible dichotomy.
   - Emphasizes the Church’s role as the new humanity in Christ, manifest in history.
   - "Scripture knows nothing of a church that is invisible except to God; the church is a people called out and gathered in the world." ("The Church: Sacramental or Social?")

## Legacy and Impact

Leithart’s critique of the **visible and invisible Church distinction** has sparked significant debate in contemporary ecclesiology, especially among Reformed and evangelical theologians. His work has challenged churches to reconsider the nature of **ecclesial unity** and the importance of sacramental and embodied practices. While controversial, his proposals have contributed to renewed interest in the Church’s public and historical identity, influencing discussions on catholicity and the future of Protestantism.
