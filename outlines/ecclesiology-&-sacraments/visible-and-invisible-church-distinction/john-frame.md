# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **visible and invisible Church distinction** with a critical yet appreciative stance, emphasizing the unity and practical outworking of the **covenant community**. He affirms the biblical basis for distinguishing between the **outward, institutional church** and the **spiritual body of true believers**, but warns against over-separating these realities, stressing the importance of the church’s visible expression in the world.

- "The distinction between the visible and invisible church is useful, but it must not be pressed to the point of separating what God has joined together." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Visible/Invisible Distinction**
    - Recognizes the biblical warrant for distinguishing between the church as God sees it (**invisible**) and as humans see it (**visible**).
    - Sees the distinction as helpful for understanding issues like **hypocrisy** and **apostasy**.
    - Emphasizes that the **visible church** includes both believers and unbelievers.
    - Argues that the **invisible church** consists only of the elect, known perfectly to God.
    "The invisible church is the company of those who are truly united to Christ, while the visible church is the community as it appears to us." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Cautions Against Over-Separation**
    - Warns that overemphasizing the distinction can lead to neglect of the **visible church’s** importance.
    - Stresses that Scripture does not sharply separate the two, but often addresses the church as a single entity.
    - Argues that practical ministry must focus on the **visible community**.
    - Maintains that the distinction is a tool, not a division.
    "We must not think of the invisible church as a separate entity from the visible church." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Emphasis**
    - Frames the church in terms of **covenant membership** and responsibilities.
    - Sees the visible church as the locus of **covenant signs** (e.g., baptism, Lord’s Supper).
    - Argues that covenant membership entails both privileges and obligations, regardless of election.
    - Emphasizes the church’s role as a **covenant community** in the world.
    "The visible church is the covenant community, called to live out its identity in history." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Multiperspectival Approach**
    - Applies his **triperspectivalism** to ecclesiology, integrating **normative (God’s perspective), situational (historical reality), and existential (personal faith)** aspects.
    - Argues that the visible/invisible distinction reflects different perspectives on the same church.
    - Encourages holding the distinction in tension rather than choosing one over the other.
    - Uses this approach to critique both institutionalism and individualism.
    "The visible and invisible church are not two churches, but two perspectives on the one church." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Unity and Mission of the Church**
    - Stresses the **unity** of the church as both visible and invisible.
    - Argues that the church’s mission is carried out through its visible structures.
    - Warns that neglecting the visible church undermines **discipleship** and **witness**.
    - Calls for visible unity among believers as a testimony to the world.
    "The unity of the church is both a spiritual reality and a visible mandate." (Evangelical Reunion)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s nuanced treatment of the **visible and invisible Church distinction** has influenced contemporary Reformed ecclesiology by urging a balanced, covenantal, and practical approach. His **triperspectivalism** has provided a framework for integrating biblical, theological, and pastoral concerns, shaping how many pastors and theologians think about the church’s identity and mission. Frame’s work continues to challenge the church to maintain both doctrinal fidelity and visible unity in a fragmented age.
