# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **church government** from a perspective that emphasizes the **biblical foundations** of **Presbyterian polity**, while also critiquing traditional models in light of **biblical authority** and **situational flexibility**. He affirms the importance of **church offices** and **discipline** but urges that all structures serve the **lordship of Christ** and the **edification of the church**.

- "Church government is a means, not an end; its purpose is to serve the ministry of the Word, the sacraments, and discipline." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (especially chapters on the church and authority)
- Evangelical Reunion: Denominations and the Body of Christ
- Worship in Spirit and Truth (sections on church order)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (discussions of authority and church structure)
- Perspectives on Church Government: Five Views (Frame contributes to the Reformed/Presbyterian perspective)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scriptural Authority in Church Government**
   - Church polity must be grounded in **biblical revelation**, not merely tradition.
   - Scripture provides principles, but not exhaustive details, for **church offices** and **discipline**.
   - The **regulative principle** applies to church government as well as worship.
   - All church authority is **ministerial and declarative**, not magisterial.
   - "The only ultimate authority in the church is the Word of God." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Presbyterian Polity as Biblically Normative but Not Exclusive**
   - Frame affirms **Presbyterianism** as most faithful to biblical patterns.
   - Recognizes elements of truth in other polities (e.g., congregational, episcopal).
   - Emphasizes the **plurality of elders** and **connectionalism**.
   - Stresses that polity should serve the church’s mission, not hinder it.
   - "Presbyterian government is, I believe, the best system, but not the only legitimate one." (Evangelical Reunion)

3. **Offices Rooted in Christ’s Gifts to the Church**
   - **Elders** and **deacons** are the primary continuing offices.
   - All office-bearers serve under the **headship of Christ**.
   - Office functions are defined by **Scripture** and the needs of the body.
   - The distinction between **teaching and ruling elders** is helpful but not absolute.
   - "The offices of the church are gifts of Christ to his people for their edification." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Church Discipline as Loving Restoration**
   - Discipline is an essential mark of the true church.
   - Its goal is **restoration**, not punishment or exclusion.
   - Must be exercised with **humility**, **patience**, and **transparency**.
   - Discipline is always subject to the authority of **Scripture** and the **gospel**.
   - "Church discipline is an act of love, aiming to restore the sinner and protect the flock." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Flexibility and Contextualization in Church Structures**
   - Church government should adapt to **cultural** and **historical** circumstances.
   - No single polity is universally mandated in every detail.
   - The **lordship of Christ** allows for diversity in non-essentials.
   - Structures must always serve the **unity and mission** of the church.
   - "We must not absolutize any particular form of church government beyond what Scripture requires." (Evangelical Reunion)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has significantly influenced contemporary **Reformed ecclesiology** by insisting on the primacy of **biblical authority** while advocating for practical flexibility in church government. His **multiperspectival approach** has encouraged churches to evaluate their structures in light of Scripture, context, and the lordship of Christ. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on **Presbyterian polity**, church offices, and discipline, especially among those seeking a balance between tradition and biblical fidelity.
