- Decisive figures: John Calvin; George Gillespie; Jerome; Richard Hooker; John Owen; James Bannerman.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic testimony on bishop and presbyter; Reformed and Scottish Presbyterian development; English debates at the Westminster Assembly; Anglican episcopal defense; Independent or Congregational arguments.
- Debates:
  - Internal: two-office vs three-office; jure divino vs prudential elements; power of order and jurisdiction; scope and form of **church discipline**; relation of session, presbytery, assembly.
  - External: episcopacy and royal supremacy; congregational autonomy; Erastian control; Roman claims of sacramental succession.
  - Contemporary: abuse and procedural justice; women in office; multi-site and network churches; parachurch and **connectionalism**; open vs close communion and **fencing the table**; civil reporting and the **spirituality of the church**.
- Position defended: Presbyterian polity is by Christ’s appointment in its essentials—plural eldership, **connectionalism** in **graded courts**, ruling and teaching elders in one order, deacons distinct, and real **discipline** through the keys—ministerial and declarative, jure divino in substance, with prudential freedom in circumstances.

### ESSAY
Church government is the ordering of Christ’s rule in the visible church through **office and ordinance**, where the Head grants the keys of the kingdom to officers who teach, govern, and administer discipline for the edification and unity of the flock. Presbyterian polity claims that the essentials of this order are not human contrivances but Christ’s own **jure divino polity**: a plurality of elders in each congregation, parity among those elders with distinct labors in Word and rule, a separate diaconate for mercy, and **connectionalism** through **graded courts** that exercise real yet spiritual jurisdiction. The aim is not power for its own sake but the ordered ministry of the Word and sacrament under the **spirituality of the church**, where authority is **ministerial not magisterial**, bound to Scripture and serving the Lord who alone is King and Lawgiver of the church.

John Calvin is decisive because he reconnected ecclesiology to Christ’s kingly office and Scripture’s concrete patterns, not merely to inherited structures. In Geneva’s reforms and in Institutes book four, he argues that Christ governs through ordinary and perpetual offices that are ordered to Word and discipline. Calvin distinguished extraordinary officers given for the church’s foundation from ordinary ones given for its ongoing life. His typical listing included pastors, doctors, elders, and deacons. The pastor exercises the ministry of Word and sacrament; the doctor or teacher labors in doctrinal instruction for the church’s catechesis; elders exercise governance and **discipline** in consistory; deacons exercise care for the poor. Calvin’s practical achievement was the consistory, a weekly court of pastors and elders that admonished, rebuked, and when necessary suspended communicants from the table for scandalous sin. The consistory embodies two Calvinian commitments that lodge at the core of Presbyterian polity. First, **discipline as a mark of the church** alongside Word and sacrament. Second, the keys of the kingdom are exercised corporately by elders, not monopolized by a single prelate nor dispersed to raw congregational will. Calvin’s ongoing conflict with Geneva’s civil council exposes the Erastian pressure: magistrates attempted to claim the final say over excommunication. Calvin refused, insisting the keys are spiritual and belong to the church’s officers by Christ’s gift, while honoring the magistrate’s duty to protect true religion. This careful construal of **spiritual jurisdiction** shields the church from both prelatic monopolies and civil usurpation. Examiners may ask whether Calvin’s fourfold scheme demands a perpetual fourth office of doctor as distinct from pastor. Calvin speaks of doctors as ordinary and perpetual, yet in practice he often subsumed didactic labor under the pastoral office. The Presbyterian tradition, following Calvin’s own elasticity, recognizes the teacher as an emphasis within the one order of elders rather than a separate standing office in every congregation.

If Calvin articulated the grammar, George Gillespie forged the polemical steel. As a young Scottish divine at the Westminster Assembly, Gillespie confronted both Erastian and Independent challenges. His Aaron’s Rod Blossoming is a sustained defense of **church power** as ministerial and declarative, grounded in Scripture and belonging to assemblies of elders. Against Erastians like John Selden and Thomas Coleman, Gillespie insisted that Christ gave to the church officers the key of discipline, including excommunication and absolution, by the power of the Word. The civil magistrate may protect and promote true religion but does not possess the keys. Gillespie’s argument rested on exegesis and pattern. From Matthew 16 and 18 he located the keys in the apostolic-presbyteral office, distinguished from civil power by its end and means. From Acts 14 and Titus 1 he drew the norm of plurality of elders in every church. From Acts 15 he argued for the prototype of **graded courts**, where a doctrinal and practical controversy rose beyond the local assembly to a broader council of apostles and elders, and the decrees were delivered to the churches as binding determinations of faith and practice. Gillespie’s crucial move was to show that such assemblies operate with Christ’s authority when they minister the Word in declarative judgments, yet they are bound to Scripture and fallible, hence revisable by further light. Here lies the hallmark of Presbyterian authority: not a coercive sovereignty but a derivative stewardship. Examiners will press whether Acts 15 is descriptive or normative. Gillespie’s answer persists: a single occurrence can be exemplary if it exhibits apostolic practice conforming to prior principles. The unity of the church under one Lord, the presence of elders, the representative character of the assembly, and the delivery of decrees to multiple churches together form an intentional pattern. He does not claim that every detail is binding, but that the escalatory logic from local to broader court for common causes of the church is part of the church’s constitution by Christ.

Presbyterianism stands in conscious conversation with the patristic period, particularly Jerome, whose comment on Titus 1 proved a fulcrum for Reformed polemic. Against the claim that episcopal monarchy is apostolic in essence, Jerome observes that in the apostolic age bishop and presbyter were one and the same, and the later elevation of the bishop above presbyters was a prudential development for unity. Presbyterians seized this testimony to dislodge the claim that prelacy is of the essence of the church. If the New Testament uses bishop and presbyter interchangeably, and if later monarchical bishoprics arose by custom, then parity of elders is not an innovation but a return to form. Examiners may object that Ignatius mentions bishops distinct from presbyters. Yet even Ignatius’s episcopos in small city-churches is better interpreted as the leading presbyter among a college, not a separate order by divine right; and Jerome’s sober historical judgment remains that the orders were one in the apostolic period. The Presbyterian case does not deny honorable oversight or primus inter pares dynamics, but it denies that Christ instituted a separate order of successors with unilateral jurisdiction over presbyters and congregations.

Richard Hooker supplies the external Anglican challenge with a sophisticated defense of episcopacy grounded in reason, antiquity, and the church’s legislative authority. In Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, Hooker argues that Scripture does not bind the church to any one immutable polity beyond the essentials of Word and sacrament. The church, guided by reason and tradition, can adopt episcopacy for its beauty and order, and the crown as supreme governor has rightful care of the external polity of the realm’s church. Hooker’s force lies in displacing the jure divino claim and normalizing royal supremacy. A Presbyterian reply must concede that Scripture leaves much to prudence and that uniformity of all contingencies is not required. Yet Presbyterianism maintains that certain features—plural eldership, real jurisdiction in elders, and connectional councils—are not contingencies but Christ’s own instituted patterns. Hooker’s account of royal supremacy strains against the **spirituality of the church** by locating decisive jurisdiction in the state. The Westminster divines, with Gillespie prominent, answered that the church’s power is unique in its end and means, directed to spiritual life by the Word, and therefore irreducible to civil authority. When Hooker insists episcopacy is merely expedient, Presbyterianism counters that the parity of presbyters is mandated by the New Testament’s terminology, practice, and theological rationale that places Christ’s lordship over all shepherds without a prelate standing above fellow elders.

From the other flank, John Owen articulates the Independent case for congregational autonomy. In The Nature of a Gospel Church, Owen affirms a plurality of elders and a true power of **discipline**, yet reserves final jurisdiction to the gathered congregation. Associations of churches can advise but not bind. Owen’s best argument is that the whole church is entrusted with discipline in passages like Matthew 18 and 1 Corinthians 5, and that the priesthood of all believers demands consent. The Presbyterian rejoinder grants that the congregation participates meaningfully in discipline through testimony, consent, and reception of judgments, but grounds jurisdiction in the elders who are charged to rule well. The “tell it to the church” of Matthew 18 is performed through representation by officers as the church’s mouth. In Corinth, Paul addresses the body because they must submit to the censure, but he also lays pastoral responsibility at the feet of leaders who must guard the table. Presbyterian **connectionalism** resists the pathologies of congregational isolation, which can conceal abuse or entrench injustice, by opening avenues of appeal from a session to a presbytery and assembly. Examiners may press whether Presbyterianism silences the congregation. The opposite is the point: structured participation under **graded courts** ensures due process and corporate safety, rather than leaving vulnerable members to the charisma or dominance of a local majority or narrow eldership without review.

James Bannerman synthesizes the classic Presbyterian doctrine of the church’s power with heightened clarity on the nature and limits of jurisdiction. In The Church of Christ, he distinguishes the power of order from the power of jurisdiction. The power of order concerns Word and sacrament, vested in ministers. The power of jurisdiction concerns government and **discipline**, vested in courts of elders. These are not two churches but two aspects of one ministry under Christ. Bannerman’s key axiom is that all **church power** is spiritual, ministerial, and declarative. It binds the conscience only insofar as it declares Christ’s Word, and it operates with moral and ecclesial sanctions, never civil coercion. Bannerman secured the doctrine that the church is independent in her own sphere even while she is subject to the magistrate in all civil matters. He thereby armed Presbyterianism against both Erastian encroachment and Roman claims of magisterial power that arrogates temporal sword. Bannerman also sealed the place of ruling elders as a perpetual and divine institution grounded in texts like 1 Timothy 5 which speaks of elders who rule well, especially those who labor in the Word. The presbyterate is one order with different labors; hence the Presbyterian two-office view maintains parity within the eldership even as it differentiates teach-and-rule from rule-only responsibilities. This avoids clericalism by constituting governance as a shared work of teaching and ruling elders together.

The biblical case for Presbyterian polity is cumulative rather than formulaic. We see the plurality of elders set as a norm in Acts 14 and Titus 1. James’s instruction presupposes elders in the local congregation who pray and shepherd. The interchange of episcopos and presbyteros unfolds across the New Testament, supporting **parity of elders**. 1 Timothy 5 distinguishes labor in Word and teaching from general rule within the one eldership, attesting the two-office structure with diversity of function. The diaconate emerges in Acts 6 as an office of mercy that protects the ministry of the Word. Matthew 16, 18 and John 20 assign the keys to officebearers who exercise binding and loosing in discipline and doctrine. Acts 15 exhibits the transition to broader courts when the peace and truth of the churches are at stake, and the pattern of decree reception demonstrates binding authority ministerially exercised. Objections that Timothy and Titus are monarchical bishops fail because their roles are extraordinary apostolic delegates in frontier mission, not fixed diocesan bishops. The two or three witnesses pattern of Matthew 18 does not collapse into privatized arbitration but culminates in telling the church where the church speaks through its officers.

Internal Presbyterian debates sharpen without unraveling the essentials. The two-office versus three-office discussion considers whether pastor-teacher is distinct from ruling elder as separate offices or as one office with two kinds of labor. The position defended here follows Bannerman’s reading: one presbyterate, with teaching and ruling elders, and the diaconate distinct. The teacher or doctor is an emphasis, not a separate standing office everywhere, though the church may set apart doctors in seminaries and presbyterial teaching bodies as a prudential expression of the didactic labor. Another internal debate concerns jure divino claims. Presbyterianism need not claim that every feature of its polity is immutably mandated; rather, the essentials—plural eldership, real jurisdiction of elders, and **graded courts** for common causes—are divinely instituted, while the number and procedures of courts, frequency of meetings, and rules of order are **circumstances** regulated by Christian prudence. The discipline debate asks whether fencing the table is pastoral counsel or juridical act. The Presbyterian answer is both: the session bears responsibility to examine, admit, warn, and in cases of scandal to suspend, yet it does so under the gospel’s aim of restoration and the church’s unity, avoiding a legalistic fencing that ignores the weak and penitent. Another internal strain considers the **spirituality of the church**. Properly defined, it restricts church courts from pronouncing on civil policy except where Scripture speaks to moral law, while requiring the church to disciple consciences with the whole counsel of God.

External debates proceed on three fronts. First, episcopacy. We answer Hooker’s prudentialism with the New Testament’s parity and with Jerome’s historical judgment that separate episcopal order is a later development, lawful at best but not necessary, and dangerous when it claims jure divino status. Second, congregationalism as in Owen. We affirm congregational participation but maintain that Christ gave jurisdiction specifically to elders. The congregation is thus protected by elders and courts, not ruled by plebiscite. Third, Erastianism argues that the state must control discipline to secure civil order. We answer with Calvin and Gillespie that the keys are spiritual by nature and end. The magistrate cannot pronounce excommunication nor command admission to the Lord’s table. When civil offenses occur, the church must report to the state without relinquishing spiritual care, since the two powers are coordinate under God, not collapsed.

Contemporary challenges test whether Presbyterian polity is flexible and just. In cases of abuse, Presbyterian discipline must foreground transparency, due process, and external review. The structure of **graded courts** is a gift: victims can appeal beyond a conflicted session to a presbytery; officers can be investigated by peers not beholden to local pressures; and sessions can receive guidance in complex cases. Presbyteries must exercise real oversight rather than performative reviews of minutes. Mandatory reporting to civil authorities in cases of criminal conduct honors Romans 13 without ceding the church’s own duty to discipline sin. A second pressure concerns women in office. Presbyterian polity construes 1 Timothy 2 and 1 Timothy 3 to restrict the eldership to qualified men, while recognizing an extensive diaconal ministry for women in mercy, catechesis, and prayer consistent with the church’s confession and practice. The aim is fidelity to scriptural qualifications, not the suppression of gifts, and the presbytery must cultivate women’s ministries robustly while maintaining the ordinance of office. A third pressure is the multi-site or network church that bypasses geographic **connectionalism**. Presbyterianism insists that session authority is tied to a determinate congregation, not a brand; that presbyteries are territorial to ensure real mutual oversight; and that parachurch ministries must be ordered in service to the church, not as substitute polities. A fourth pressure concerns communion practice. Presbyterian discipline guards the table by pastoral examination and public warning, invites all penitent believers under Christ to the table as members of an evangelical church, and suspends those under censure. Closed communion that collapses catholicity into denominational identity is rejected, yet indiscriminate admission ignores **fencing the table**.

An examiner might ask whether Presbyterianism risks bureaucracy over care. The right response is to show how **ministerial not magisterial authority** disciplines to life. Discipline is medicinal, aimed at repentance and restoration. The forms of process protect the weak and the accused, because truth and justice are ordered to love. Far from bureaucratic, sessions and presbyteries exercise brotherly admonition, graduated censures, and careful restoration. Remember that 2 Corinthians commends restoration lest grief swallow up the penitent. Presbyterial review exists not to suppress local shepherding but to ensure it shares Christ’s meekness and equity.

Another examiner might press whether Presbyterianism undermines pastoral leadership by insisting on **parity of elders**. The answer is that parity resists clerical dominance while preserving pastoral primacy in Word and sacrament. The pastor is primus inter pares by gift and labor, not by juridical caste. Ruling elders bring the wisdom of the people to the governance of the church, exemplifying the organic unity of laity and clergy. This parity empowers mission by distributing oversight rather than concentrating it in a solitary rector.

A final doctrinal connection must be made to the broader loci. Ecclesiology is not modular. Presbyterian polity flows from Christology and **federal theology**. The resurrected Mediator reigns as head and husband of the church, administering the covenant of grace by Word, sacrament, and discipline. The keys constitute an administration of the covenant, binding and loosing in accord with the gospel. The church’s courts do not usurp Christ; they are the instruments by which he shepherds consciences through his Word. Likewise, the doctrine of Scripture’s sufficiency governs polity. We do not require explicit commands for every procedural detail; rather, we infer patterns, offices, and structures by good and necessary consequence. This hermeneutic authorizes Presbyterianism to call its essentials divinely warranted while leaving circumstances to prudence.

The position defended is thus clear. Presbyterian polity is of divine right in substance: Christ instituted the rule of the church by a plurality of elders with real jurisdiction, joined in **connectional** councils for common causes, with deacons serving in mercy. This rule is spiritual, ministerial, and declarative. The presbyterate is one order with distinct labors in teaching and ruling, and the diaconate is distinct. **Discipline** is a mark of the church and a necessary exercise of the keys, ordered to repentance and the church’s purity. The church is free from the control of the civil magistrate in spiritual matters, yet bound to obey the magistrate in civil matters and to report crimes. Anglican episcopacy, while it can be tolerated as a prudential structure when it does not claim divine right, fails where it asserts a distinct order abovepresbyters by Christ’s institution or where it collapses into royal supremacy. Congregational autonomy rightly honors congregational engagement but errs by denying elders and broader courts true jurisdiction. Presbyterianism alone guards the balance of Christ’s headship, scriptural sufficiency, corporate accountability, and pastoral care.

Should the examiner ask for the shortest biblical proof, one might say this. Christ gave the keys to his church’s officers to bind and loose by the Word. The New Testament shows elders in every church, identified with bishops, some laboring in Word and doctrine, all called to rule well. Churches consult and bind together in council for common causes. As Calvin structured and Gillespie defended, as Jerome attested and Bannerman clarified, Presbyterian polity is not a tradition in search of a text but Scripture’s pattern drawn out to its coherent form. It allows us to discipline without tyranny, to govern without erasure of the people, to consult without capitulating to the state, and to pursue mission without neglecting justice. In such an order, Christ exercises his royal office through humble stewards, and the flock is shepherded by a government that is truly ecclesial, truly spiritual, and truly his.

### RECAP NOTES

- Decisive figures:
  - Calvin: fourfold office scheme in Geneva, consistory, keys and **spiritual jurisdiction**, anti-Erastian.
  - George Gillespie: Westminster defense of **jure divino polity**, Acts 15 pattern for **connectionalism**, keys against Erastianism and Independency.
  - Jerome: witness that bishop and presbyter were one in the apostolic age, later episcopacy by custom.
  - Richard Hooker: prudential defense of episcopacy and royal supremacy, opposed by Presbyterian claims of divinely instituted parity and church independence.
  - John Owen: Independent congregationalism with elder-led congregations, final jurisdiction in congregation; Presbyterian reply upholds elder jurisdiction with congregational participation and appeals.
  - James Bannerman: clarified **church power** as ministerial and declarative; power of order and jurisdiction; parity and ruling elders jure divino.
- Debates:
  - Internal: two-office vs three-office; jure divino essentials vs prudential circumstances; nature and aims of **discipline**; scope of the **spirituality of the church**.
  - External: episcopacy and royal supremacy; congregational autonomy; Erastian control; Roman magisterial claims.
  - Contemporary: abuse and due process under **graded courts**; women and office; multi-site networks vs territorial **connectionalism**; parachurch alignment; communion practice and **fencing the table**; civil reporting and pastoral care.
- Defended position: Presbyterian polity is jure divino in essentials—plural eldership with parity, real jurisdiction in elders, connectional courts, distinct diaconate, and genuine discipline—exercised spiritually and declaratively under Christ’s headship.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Where is graded connection taught? Acts 15 as an exemplary pattern of elders in council delivering binding determinations to multiple churches.
  - Are bishops distinct from presbyters? New Testament interchange and Jerome’s judgment point to one order; later monarchical episcopacy is by custom, not divine right.
  - Does congregational consent vanish? No; elders hold jurisdiction while congregations participate and courts ensure appeals and justice.
  - Is the doctor a separate office? Ordinary didactic labor is within the one presbyterate; the church may prudentially designate teachers without creating a new standing order.
  - How does spirituality of the church relate to civil reporting? The church disciplines spiritually and always reports crimes to the civil magistrate, respecting both jurisdictions under God.
