# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not develop a systematic doctrine of **church government** or advocate for **Presbyterian polity** in the traditional sense. His focus on **demythologization** and the **existential interpretation** of the New Testament led him to view **church offices** and **discipline** primarily through the lens of the early Christian community’s proclamation rather than as divinely mandated structures. For Bultmann, the significance of church order lies in its service to the **kerygma**, not in adherence to a particular ecclesiastical form.

- "The New Testament does not present us with a fixed and binding church order, but with a variety of forms which serve the proclamation." (Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (especially sections on ecclesiology)
- Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting
- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth)
- Faith and Understanding (essays on church and proclamation)
- Jesus and the Word

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
   - The church exists to proclaim the **kerygma** of Christ’s death and resurrection.
   - Institutional forms, including **offices** and **discipline**, are secondary to this proclamation.
   - The structure of the church is historically contingent and not divinely prescribed.
   - The authority of church leaders derives from their service to the Word, not from office itself.
   - "The church is where the Word is proclaimed and heard in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization of Ecclesiastical Structures**
   - Early Christian descriptions of church order are shaped by their cultural context.
   - Modern faith must reinterpret these structures existentially, not legalistically.
   - The meaning of **elders**, **deacons**, and other offices is not fixed but adaptable.
   - Church government is a human response to the need for order in the proclamation community.
   - "The forms of church order are not themselves objects of faith." (Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Community**
   - The church is fundamentally a community of faith responding to the existential call of the gospel.
   - Offices and discipline serve to foster authentic encounter with the Word.
   - The true unity of the church is found in shared faith, not in uniform polity.
   - Discipline is meaningful only as it relates to the individual's response to the kerygma.
   - "Community arises where men hear the Word and respond in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Historical Relativity of Church Polity**
   - New Testament evidence shows diversity in church structures (e.g., Pauline vs. Johannine communities).
   - No single form, such as **Presbyterian polity**, is mandated for all times and places.
   - The church must be free to adapt its government to new historical and cultural situations.
   - The essence of the church is not institutional but existential and theological.
   - "The New Testament church order is not a law but a witness to the faith of the community." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Function of Discipline in the Proclamation Community**
   - Discipline is not an end in itself but serves the integrity of the proclamation.
   - The goal is restoration and authentic faith, not mere conformity to rules.
   - Exclusion or correction is justified only insofar as it serves the gospel.
   - The church’s authority is always provisional and subject to the Word.
   - "Discipline in the church is meaningful only as it serves the proclamation of the gospel." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **church government** has influenced modern theology by relativizing traditional forms such as **Presbyterian polity** and emphasizing the primacy of the **kerygma**. His existential and historical-critical perspective challenged the church to reconsider the theological necessity of specific offices and structures. While not a direct contributor to debates on polity, his work has shaped discussions on the nature and function of church order in the contemporary world. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing efforts to ground ecclesiology in the proclamation of the gospel rather than in fixed institutional forms.
