# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **church government** through the lens of his broader **theological method**, emphasizing the symbolic and existential significance of ecclesial structures rather than prescribing a particular polity such as **Presbyterianism**. For Tillich, the **church** is the manifestation of the **Spiritual Community**, and its offices and discipline serve as expressions of the church's participation in the **New Being** rather than as divinely mandated forms. He critiqued rigid institutionalism, advocating for forms of governance that facilitate the church's mission as a bearer of **revelation** and **grace**.

- "The church is not identical with any of its historical forms, but is manifest in them as the Spiritual Community." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Spiritual Community**
   - The church is fundamentally the manifestation of the **Spiritual Community** rather than a specific institutional form.
   - Institutional structures, including offices and discipline, are provisional and symbolic.
   - The church's true essence is its participation in the **New Being** brought by Christ.
   - No single polity (e.g., Presbyterian) is divinely mandated; all are historically conditioned.
   - "The church is the community in which the Spiritual Presence is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Symbolic Function of Offices**
   - Offices in the church symbolize functions necessary for the life of the community.
   - Leadership is justified by its service to the **Spiritual Community**, not by apostolic succession or hierarchy.
   - The distinction between clergy and laity is functional, not ontological.
   - All offices are subject to critique and reform in light of the church's mission.
   - "The offices are symbols of the functions which the Spiritual Community must fulfill." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Discipline as Existential Concern**
   - Church discipline is not merely legalistic but addresses the existential estrangement of persons from the community.
   - The goal of discipline is reconciliation and restoration, not exclusion.
   - Discipline must be exercised in the spirit of **grace** and **forgiveness**.
   - The church's authority is always provisional and open to the judgment of the **Spiritual Presence**.
   - "Discipline is the attempt to overcome estrangement within the community." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Critique of Institutionalism**
   - Tillich warns against identifying the church with its institutional form.
   - Institutionalization can lead to the loss of the church's prophetic and spiritual character.
   - Structures must serve the dynamic life of the **Spiritual Community**.
   - The church is always in danger of becoming a "religious society" rather than the bearer of the **New Being**.
   - "The church must always be reformed in the light of its Spiritual Community." (The Protestant Era)

5. **Unity and Diversity in Polity**
   - The unity of the church is spiritual, not institutional or organizational.
   - Diversity of polities (Presbyterian, Episcopal, Congregational) reflects historical and cultural contexts.
   - No single form exhausts the meaning of the church as the body of Christ.
   - The church's unity is grounded in its participation in the **New Being**, not in uniformity of governance.
   - "The unity of the church is the unity of the Spiritual Community, not of its organizational forms." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich's approach to **church government** has influenced ecumenical discussions by shifting the focus from institutional forms to the church's existential and spiritual reality. His critique of rigid polity and emphasis on the **Spiritual Community** have encouraged theologians to see church offices and discipline as dynamic and reformable. While not prescribing a specific polity, Tillich's thought challenges churches to evaluate their structures in light of their mission as bearers of **revelation** and **grace**. His work remains a significant resource for those seeking a theological rationale for flexibility and reform in church governance.
