# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **church government** through the lens of **ecclesiology** rooted in the eschatological self-understanding of the church. He critiqued both **Presbyterian polity** and other forms of church order by emphasizing the church’s provisional nature and its orientation toward the coming **kingdom of God**, arguing that all church structures, including **offices** and **discipline**, must serve the unity and mission of the church as a sign of God’s future reign.

- "The unity of the church is not simply a given but a task to be realized in the anticipation of the eschatological consummation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on ecclesiology and church order)
- "The Church" in Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- "The Concept of the Church" in The Idea of God and Human Freedom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Foundation of Church Order**
    - Church government derives its authority from the anticipated **kingdom of God**.
    - All forms of polity, including **Presbyterian**, are provisional and oriented toward the church’s eschatological fulfillment.
    - The church’s structures must reflect its calling as a sign of the coming unity of humanity in Christ.
    - No single polity is absolutely normative; all are subject to critique in light of the church’s future.
    - "The church is a provisional reality, anticipating the unity of all mankind under God’s rule." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Unity as the Goal of Church Government**
    - The primary function of church offices and discipline is to foster visible **unity**.
    - Divisions in polity (e.g., Presbyterian vs. Episcopal) are secondary to the imperative of unity.
    - Church government should be evaluated by its capacity to serve reconciliation and mission.
    - The office of ministry is justified by its service to the unity and edification of the body.
    - "The unity of the church is the decisive criterion for the legitimacy of its order." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Office Rooted in the Ministry of Christ**
    - Church offices are grounded in the continuing ministry of the exalted Christ.
    - The **presbyterial** office is one historical form among others, not divinely mandated in its specifics.
    - The authority of office-bearers is derivative and must be exercised in service, not domination.
    - Office exists to build up the community and witness to Christ’s lordship.
    - "The ministry of the church is a participation in the ministry of Christ, not an autonomous authority." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Discipline as Eschatological Witness**
    - Church discipline is necessary to maintain the church’s integrity as a sign of the kingdom.
    - Discipline must be restorative, aiming at reconciliation and the renewal of fellowship.
    - The exercise of discipline is provisional, anticipating the final judgment of God.
    - All disciplinary action must be accountable to the gospel and the church’s mission.
    - "Discipline in the church is a sign of its anticipation of the final judgment and reconciliation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Critical Engagement with Historical Polities**
    - Pannenberg critically assesses **Presbyterian** and other polities in light of the church’s universal mission.
    - He rejects any absolutizing of historical forms, insisting on continual reform.
    - The church must be open to structural change as it seeks faithfulness to its calling.
    - Historical forms are valuable but must not hinder the church’s witness to the world.
    - "No historical form of church order can claim finality; all are subject to the judgment of the gospel." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s **ecclesiology** has significantly influenced contemporary theology by challenging the finality of any one form of church government, including **Presbyterian polity**. His insistence on the eschatological and provisional character of all church structures has encouraged ongoing ecumenical dialogue and reform. By rooting church offices and discipline in the mission and unity of the church, he has shaped discussions on the purpose and limits of church authority in the modern era.
