# Thomas Cartwright (1535–1603)

Thomas Cartwright was a leading advocate for **Presbyterian polity** in the English Reformation, arguing that the **government of the church** should be structured according to the New Testament model of **elders** and **synods** rather than episcopal hierarchy. He emphasized the necessity of **church discipline** and the distinct offices of **minister**, **elder**, and **deacon** as essential to the church’s spiritual health and biblical faithfulness.

- "The government that Christ hath prescribed in his word is that which is to be received in his church." (A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte)

## Key Works

- A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte (1573)
- The Second Replie of Thomas Cartwright (1575)
- The Rest of the Second Replie (1577)
- The Directory of Church Government (attributed, circulated among Puritans)
- Peter Lake, Moderate Puritans and the Elizabethan Church (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity as Biblical Mandate**
   - Church government must be patterned after the **apostolic model** found in Scripture.
   - Authority resides in assemblies of **elders** rather than individual bishops.
   - Local congregations are governed by a plurality of elders, with broader assemblies for appeals.
   - The **parity of ministers** and elders is essential to avoid hierarchical abuses.
   - "The government of the church ought to be by pastors, teachers, and elders, not by bishops." (A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte)

2. **Distinct and Biblical Church Offices**
   - The offices of **minister**, **elder**, and **deacon** are divinely instituted.
   - Each office has distinct responsibilities: ministers for preaching, elders for governance, deacons for mercy.
   - No office should be merged or confused with another.
   - The office of bishop is not distinct from that of elder in the New Testament.
   - "There is but one kind of elder in the church, though divers functions." (A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte)

3. **Necessity of Church Discipline**
   - **Church discipline** is a mark of the true church.
   - Discipline must be exercised by the local session of elders, not by civil magistrates or bishops.
   - Excommunication and restoration are to be handled according to biblical procedures.
   - Discipline preserves the purity and witness of the church.
   - "Without discipline, the church cannot long continue in purity." (The Second Replie)

4. **Authority of Synods and Assemblies**
   - Broader assemblies (presbyteries, synods) are necessary for resolving disputes and maintaining unity.
   - Decisions of assemblies are binding when grounded in Scripture.
   - Synods provide a check against local abuses and errors.
   - The unity of the church is fostered through representative government.
   - "Matters of greater weight are to be determined by assemblies of the faithful." (A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte)

5. **Rejection of Episcopal Hierarchy**
   - The episcopal system lacks biblical warrant and leads to corruption.
   - Bishops as a separate order are a human invention, not a divine ordinance.
   - Episcopal authority undermines the priesthood of all believers and the role of elders.
   - The church must be reformed according to the Word, not tradition.
   - "The office of bishop, as it is now used, hath no ground in the word of God." (A Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgifte)

## Legacy and Impact

Cartwright’s advocacy for **Presbyterian polity** shaped the Puritan movement and provided a theological foundation for later Reformed and Presbyterian churches in England and beyond. His insistence on biblical offices and discipline influenced the Westminster Assembly and the development of Reformed ecclesiology. Though he never saw his vision fully realized in England, Cartwright’s arguments remain central to debates on church government and the marks of the true church. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to **biblical church order** among Reformed and Presbyterian bodies.
