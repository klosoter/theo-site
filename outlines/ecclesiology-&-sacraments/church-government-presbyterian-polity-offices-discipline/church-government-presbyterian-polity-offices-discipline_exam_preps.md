- Decisive figures: John Calvin, John Knox, George Gillespie, Samuel Rutherford, Charles Hodge, Thomas Witherow.  
- Traditions: Reformed and **Presbyterian** confessional tradition, with reference to patristic patterns of **presbyterial** oversight and contrast with **episcopal** and **congregational** polities.  
- Debates:  
  - Internal: nature and number of offices, parity among elders, status of deacons, binding power of higher courts, relation of church and state in discipline.  
  - External: episcopacy and apostolic succession, congregational autonomy and pure democracy, Erastian state-control models.  
  - Contemporary: gender and office, parachurch and network models, discipline amid abuse crises and consumer mobility.  
- Defended position: Presbyterian polity, with a plurality of elders in graded courts and a real yet ministerial power of **discipline**, is the form of church government most consonant with Scripture, classic Reformed ecclesiology, and the coherent confession of **Christ’s mediatorial kingship**.

### ESSAY
Church government is not an optional wrapper around an otherwise complete gospel; it is one of the ordinary means by which the exalted Christ rules, protects, and corrects his flock. To defend **Presbyterian polity**, its **offices**, and its **discipline**, one must show that the visible structure of the church is an ordered expression of Christ’s spiritual kingdom, not a humanly negotiable management scheme. The conceptual core is this: Christ as head of the church exercises his **royal office** by a ministerial and declarative government vested not in solitary prelates, nor in raw congregational majorities, but in a plurality of presbyters gathered in graded assemblies, using the keys of the kingdom in a way regulated by Scripture and subordinated to the word.

John Calvin is decisive because he reframed the question of polity around the three offices of Christ and the fourfold ministry of the church. In the Institutes, especially book 4, he argues that Christ’s continuing rule is exercised through offices instituted in the apostolic age and normatively binding. Calvin distinguishes extraordinary offices such as apostle and evangelist from enduring ones: pastor, doctor or teacher, elder, and deacon. His method is characteristically biblical-theological and anti-speculative: he reads the New Testament pattern of **presbyterial** rule as a normative model under the general equity of Christian liberty. For Calvin, there is a real authority in the eldership and their **consistory**, but this authority is ministerial, not magisterial; they bind and loose only by declaring what Christ has already spoken in Scripture.

Calvin’s Geneva therefore embodies a key Presbyterian axiom: the government of the church is neither monarchical nor democratic but **presbyterial**, lodged in a body of elders of equal authority though diverse in labor. The consistory, composed of ministers and lay elders, exercises **church discipline**, including excommunication, with a view to both the purity of the church and the salvation of the sinner. Examiners will often press the charge that this is merely a sixteenth-century civic arrangement baptized with biblical proof texts. The answer is that Calvin’s own arguments appeal repeatedly to the New Testament college of presbyters in Acts 14 and 20, the interchangeable language of presbyter and overseer in Titus 1 and 1 Timothy 3, and the collegial government of Jerusalem in Acts 15. Moreover, Calvin explicitly rejects the Erastian subordination of discipline to the state, insisting that the church as church must have her own spiritual jurisdiction, distinct from civil power, yet ordered and limited by the word.

John Knox, deeply shaped by Calvin yet working in a different national context, extends these insights into a more explicitly **Presbyterian** system. In the First Book of Discipline and the Scots Confession, Knox and his colleagues articulate a national church governed by sessions, presbyteries, synods, and a general assembly. What Calvin sketches in quasi-city-state terms, Knox and the early Scottish Reformers implement as a graded series of courts with real authority. Knox’s historical context includes resistance to both Roman episcopacy and English-style state-controlled episcopacy; his theological method is polemical and covenantal. Christ’s lordship over the church entails not only that Rome cannot bind consciences by human traditions, but also that the crown may not usurp spiritual jurisdiction.

Knox’s conceptual contribution is to marry the doctrine of Christ’s kingship with a robust doctrine of church courts. For him, the **session** of the local congregation is not a mere advisory committee; it is the primary court of Christ where elders watch for souls and administer discipline. The presbytery and higher courts are not parachurch conferences but further exercises of the same key-bearing authority, ensuring catholicity and mutual accountability of congregations. This graded structure answers two objections examiners may raise. First, is this not an illegitimate extension beyond the simple gatherings of the New Testament? Knox answers by appeal to the need for wider assemblies when the peace of the church is endangered, as the Jerusalem Council demonstrates. Second, does this not threaten the autonomy and priesthood of believers? Knox replies that the priesthood of all believers establishes parity of access to Christ and the word, not parity of office or the abolition of ordained oversight. The **priesthood of all believers** flourishes under ordered eldership that guards the table and pulpit.

George Gillespie and Samuel Rutherford, both Westminster divines, crystallize Presbyterian polity into confessional and constitutional form. Gillespie’s Aaron’s Rod Blossoming and his lesser-known manuscript arguments at the Assembly contend that church power is distinct from both civil power and congregational consent. His method is scholastic and exegetical, carefully distinguishing types of power: the power of order given to ministers of the word, the power of jurisdiction shared by all elders in the courts, and the derived consent of the people in calling officers and receiving discipline. Gillespie’s crucial move is to insist on **parity of elders** in rule. Though teaching elders labor in word and doctrine and are therefore worthy of double honor, they do not form a higher order with superior jurisdiction. Ruling elders share the same key-bearing authority in assemblies; ministerial precedence is functional, not ontological.

Samuel Rutherford, especially in The Due Right of Presbyteries, addresses the external debates more directly. He contests episcopacy by denying that bishops as a separate superior order are of apostolic right. Rutherford reads the New Testament pattern as one of a plurality of elders in each city or congregation, with no evidence that a single bishop held jurisdiction over multiple congregations. He also contends against Erastianism by articulating **distinct yet coordinated jurisdictions** of church and state. The magistrate may protect and outwardly establish the church but may not assume the power of the keys. Discipline, excommunication, and admission to the Lord’s Supper belong to the church, administered by her officers. Rutherford thus grounds Westminster’s classic statement that church censures are spiritual and that synods and councils derive their authority ministerially from Christ through the word, not from civil grant.

Together, Gillespie and Rutherford shape the Westminster Form of Presbyterial Church Government and the related sections of the Confession and Directory. They define the ordinary and perpetual offices as pastor or teaching elder, ruling elder, and deacon. They locate church power in courts that are truly authoritative yet ministerial, with the people exercising important yet non-constitutive consent. Internal Reformed debates today often circle precisely around the lines they drew. Are ruling elders really of the same office as teaching elders, or are they fundamentally lay representatives? If all elders are presbyters in office, why reserve some functions such as preaching and sacraments to the ministers? A coherent Presbyterian answer, drawn from Gillespie’s categories, is that there is one office of elder in terms of jurisdictional authority, but a diversity of gifts and ordinary labors within that one office. The same presbyterial authority that binds and looses is shared; the special labor in word and sacrament is tied to **vocation and fitness**, not to a higher sacramental rank.

Charles Hodge, in the nineteenth century, represents a mature American Presbyterian articulation, now under pressure from revivalism, democratic culture, and denominational pluralism. In his Discussions in Church Polity and in his commentary on the Westminster Confession, Hodge defends Presbyterian government as jure divino in its essential features, yet allows considerable latitude in circumstances according to the **regulative principle** applied to church government. His method is exegetical, historical, and confessional, but he is also acutely aware of the American suspicion of authority. Hodge’s contribution is twofold. First, he strongly affirms the doctrine of **graded courts** as essential to presbyterianism, insisting that church power is inherently joint and not individual. No minister rules alone; authority resides in the session, presbytery, synod, and assembly. Second, he clarifies that while the form of Presbyterian polity is of divine right in substance, the exact mapping of congregations to presbyteries, and the detailed rules of procedure, are prudential applications.

Hodge also helps frame several internal debates examiners will probe. How binding are higher courts on lower courts, given that Christ alone is head of the church and that all assemblies need to be subject to Scripture? Hodge responds that higher courts are not infallible and may be disobeyed when clearly contrary to Scripture, but in all things indifferent or doubtful their determinations demand submission for the sake of peace and order, lest each congregation become a law unto itself. Does this not threaten Christian liberty? Hodge appeals to **Christian liberty** as freedom from human doctrines imposed as necessary to salvation, not as freedom from all ecclesiastical order. Submission to church courts in lawful things is an exercise of liberty under Christ, not its negation. The alternative is ecclesiastical anarchy which, in practice, empowers the strong and charismatic rather than protecting the weak.

Thomas Witherow, a nineteenth-century Irish Presbyterian, is less known yet crucial for understanding the defense of presbyterianism against both episcopacy and congregationalism. In The Apostolic Church: Which Is It, he distills six marks of the New Testament church government that collectively point to a Presbyterian rather than episcopal or independent model: the parity of elders, the presence of a plurality of elders in each congregation, the distinction between teaching and ruling elders without hierarchy, the inclusion of the people in church government, and the authoritative nature of broader assemblies. Witherow’s method is tightly exegetical and historical, seeking to let the New Testament pattern speak rather than preloading it with seventeenth-century controversies. His work is especially valuable in contemporary debates because it shows that presbyterianism can be argued not simply from tradition but from **biblical patterns** of shared rule and connectionalism.

Against episcopacy, these figures collectively argue that the New Testament knows no superior order of single bishops ruling over presbyters and congregations. Examiners may challenge this by pointing to early second-century evidence in Ignatius for a monoepiscopal structure. The classic Presbyterian reply, following Calvin and Hodge, is that Ignatius witnesses to a postapostolic development that may have had prudential warrant in some contexts but cannot claim dominical institution. Further, the New Testament identity of presbyter and overseer, and the consistent language of plural elders in each church, weighs structurally against reading Ignatius back into the inspired pattern. Presbyterian polity does not deny that historical churches have been preserved under episcopal governments, but insists that normatively Christ has given a different pattern.

Against congregationalism, the Presbyterian tradition insists that while the congregation must consent to the choice of its officers and participates in discipline by receiving or rejecting censured members, the actual judicial authority to bind and loose is vested in the elders acting together. Here Witherow and Hodge respond to the argument that Matthew 18 gives final authority to the congregation: the text’s “tell it to the church” is best read as “to those who govern the church,” with the congregation represented through its elders. Even if “church” includes the whole assembly, the Presbyterian reading emphasizes that Scripture elsewhere clearly assigns oversight and rule to elders who will give account, and this fiduciary responsibility cannot be reduced to executing congregational majorities. Theologically, Presbyterian polity guards against both clericalism and majoritarian tyranny by embedding the keys in a plurality of office bearers accountable to each other and to broader courts.

A third external opponent, more acute in the Reformed world, is Erastian state control. Gillespie and Rutherford, and later Hodge, argue that while the magistrate may call synods, protect them, and execute their lawful decisions in the civil sphere, he may not dictate doctrine or discipline as such. This is grounded in the distinction between the **spiritual kingdom** of Christ and the temporal power of the sword. Discipline is an exercise of spiritual censure that affects sacramental privilege and church membership, not civil status. Examiners will ask whether this creates a dangerous dualism. A coherent answer is that this distinction protects Christ’s lordship in the visible church while still affirming the magistrate’s duty, under natural and revealed law, to promote true religion. The church declares, the state enforces within its own sphere; confusion of the two leads either to persecution or to ecclesiastical abdication.

Contemporary debates test Presbyterian polity in new ways. One is the question of gender and office. Classic presbyterianism, represented by Calvin, Knox, Rutherford, and Hodge, understands the eldership and ordained ministry as restricted to qualified men, based on texts such as 1 Timothy 2 and 3 and the symbolic headship structure tied to **covenantal representation**. Examiners may press whether this can be upheld today without undermining the church’s witness. The Presbyterian answer, consistent with its polity principles, is that office is not a matter of dignity or worth, but of representational order instituted by Christ; to innovate here for cultural reasons is to reshape the very sign-language of the church’s government. Nonetheless, at the level of **church discipline** and participation, women exercise significant influence and gifts under elder oversight, and the plurality of elders is meant in part to guard them from abuse.

Another contemporary challenge is the rise of parachurch organizations and informal networks that function de facto as supracongregational courts without ordination or ecclesiastical responsibility. A Presbyterian defense, drawing on Rutherford and Hodge, stresses that Christ gave the power of the keys to his church, not to free-floating ministries. Teaching, coordination, and cooperation between churches may take place through such bodies, but they must not be allowed to supplant presbyteries and assemblies in matters of ordination, discipline, and doctrinal adjudication. Where parachurch structures determine who is platformed, credentialed, or ostracized, they are functionally exercising church power without the **instituted offices** and safeguards Christ provided.

The scandal of abuse and the widespread breakdown of trust in institutions push another set of questions. Does Presbyterian polity, with its courts and procedures, actually protect the vulnerable or provide cover for predators? Here the internal logic of Presbyterian discipline must be laid bare. Properly functioning sessions and presbyteries, following the Westminster and later books of discipline, are bound to investigate credible allegations, to protect the accused from mob justice, but also to prioritize the safety of the flock over institutional reputation. The plurality of elders and the connectional nature of the courts should, in principle, prevent a single charismatic leader from silencing victims. When Presbyterian bodies have failed here, it has been in violation of their own polity, not because of its principles. The solution is deeper submission to the biblical **ethic of discipline** that seeks restoration for the repentant, removal for the impenitent, and public clarity for the watching world.

Discipline itself is perhaps the sharpest edge where polity, soteriology, and sacramentology meet. Calvin, Knox, Gillespie, and Hodge all insist that discipline is an integral mark of the true church, alongside word and sacrament. Excommunication is not a magical expulsion from salvation but a visible judgment that someone’s profession no longer credibly corresponds to their life. It is simultaneously judicial and medicinal. Examiners may ask how this aligns with doctrines of perseverance and justification by faith alone. The answer is that discipline deals with the visibility of the covenant community, not with the secret decree of election. To bar someone from the Lord’s table is to say that, as far as the church can judge, they should no longer be recognized as walking as a disciple; it is to remove the public seal of their profession, not to reverse God’s justification. Insofar as discipline is grounded in **covenant theology**, it recognizes that the visible church contains both wheat and tares and that the keys are given to preserve the integrity of the covenant signs.

Presbyterian polity thus has deep connections to adjacent loci. Its understanding of **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** guards the uniqueness of his headship against both papal and democratic usurpations. Its commitment to ecclesiastical offices reflects a **doctrine of vocation** and **analogical rule**: elders rule as analogical, not univocal, images of Christ’s shepherding, always under the norm of Scripture. Its graded courts embody a doctrine of catholicity that resists the fragmentation of sectarianism. Its practice of discipline flows from its doctrine of sanctification and assurance, recognizing that God often uses external rebukes and censures as means of grace to reclaim straying believers.

The position to be defended, then, is that Presbyterian polity is not merely one valid option among many, but the form of government that best corresponds to the biblical data, the logic of the gospel, and the confessional Reformed tradition. This does not entail denying that God has worked and still works in churches with other polities. It does entail that churches should aim to conform their structures to what Christ has revealed as his ordinary way of ruling his visible kingdom. When examiners interrogate whether this claim is too strong, one should respond by distinguishing between the esse and the bene esse of the church. Other polities may be consistent with the being of the church where the word and sacraments are present; yet Presbyterian polity pertains to the well-being and stability of the church as an ordered society under Christ. To affirm its divine right in essentials is to honor Christ’s wisdom in governing his body.

In articulating this position under examination, one must show not only familiarity with Calvin’s foundational synthesis, Knox’s national embodiment, Gillespie and Rutherford’s Westminster codification, Hodge’s American refinement, and Witherow’s biblical apologetic, but also an ability to deploy their insights in the face of current pressures. The task is to hold fast to the **presbyterial** center: plurality in office, parity in authority, graded courts in connectional unity, spiritual discipline as a mark of the church, and the constant subordination of all ecclesiastical power to the living voice of Christ in Scripture. Anything less either leaves the church vulnerable to human domination or dissolves her visible order into the chaos of individualized religion. Presbyterian polity, rightly understood and reformed according to the word, is a gift of the ascended King to preserve his gospel, protect his sheep, and display his ordered glory in a confused world.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Presbyterian polity** is the government of the church by a plurality of elders in graded courts, exercising a ministerial power of **discipline** and oversight under the headship of Christ, with distinct but coordinated offices of minister or teaching elder, ruling elder, and deacon.  
- Decisive figures:  
  - Calvin: fourfold office, ministerial authority of elders and consistory, discipline as key mark of the church.  
  - Knox: national, graded courts, Christ’s kingship and anti-episcopal, anti-Erastian structure.  
  - Gillespie: parity of elders, distinctions of power of order and jurisdiction, jure divino presbyterianism.  
  - Rutherford: rejection of episcopacy and Erastianism, articulation of distinct church and state jurisdictions.  
  - Hodge: American defense of divine right in essentials, graded courts, submission and Christian liberty.  
  - Witherow: biblical-exegetical case for New Testament presbyterian patterns over episcopal and congregational models.  
- Debates:  
  - Internal: number and nature of offices, teaching versus ruling elders, binding nature of higher courts, scope and practice of discipline, relation of church and state.  
  - External: episcopal hierarchy and apostolic succession, congregational autonomy and majority rule, Erastian subordination of church discipline to the state.  
  - Contemporary: gender and office, parachurch “courts,” abuse and transparency in discipline, consumerism and mobility versus connectional accountability.  
- Defended position: Presbyterian government, with plural eldership, **parity of presbyters**, connectional courts, and robust but spiritual discipline, is the polity that most faithfully expresses Christ’s mediatorial kingship and should be regarded as jure divino in its essentials, though not in all circumstances of administration.  
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - Why not episcopacy, given early patristic evidence? Because the New Testament pattern of plural elders and identity of presbyter and overseer outweighs later monoepiscopal developments, which lack dominical institution.  
  - Does Presbyterian polity deny the priesthood of all believers? No, it presupposes universal access to Christ while distinguishing representative offices for oversight and discipline.  
  - How can higher courts bind lower courts without compromising Christ’s headship? Their authority is ministerial and revisable by Scripture; in lawful matters their determinations require submission for order, not as new articles of faith.  
  - Is excommunication compatible with justification by faith alone? Yes, since it addresses the credibility of profession in the visible church, not the secret decree of election or the ground of justification.  
  - Why restrict eldership to men today? Because office is a representational structure tied to Christ’s headship and apostolic qualifications, not a negotiable question of dignity or gifting.
