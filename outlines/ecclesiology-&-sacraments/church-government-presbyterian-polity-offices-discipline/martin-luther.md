# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **church government** challenged the medieval hierarchy, advocating a return to **biblical offices** and the **priesthood of all believers**. While he rejected **papal supremacy**, Luther did not develop a fully systematic alternative such as **Presbyterian polity**, instead favoring a flexible structure centered on the **local congregation**, the **ministry of Word and Sacrament**, and the exercise of **church discipline** through the community of believers.

- "All Christians are truly of the spiritual estate, and there is no difference among them, save of office alone." (Address to the Christian Nobility)

## Key Works

- Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (1520)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- On the Councils and the Church (1539)
- The Small Catechism (1529)
- Luther’s Church Postils (sermons and practical guidance)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Priesthood of All Believers**
   - Every Christian shares in the spiritual estate, not just clergy.
   - The distinction between clergy and laity is functional, not ontological.
   - All have direct access to God through Christ, without priestly mediation.
   - Church offices exist for order and service, not for spiritual superiority.
   - "For whoever comes out of the water of baptism can boast that he is already a consecrated priest, bishop, and pope." (Address to the Christian Nobility)

2. **Rejection of Papal Supremacy**
   - The pope does not possess exclusive authority over the church.
   - Church governance should be accountable to Scripture, not papal decree.
   - Councils and congregations have a role in correcting abuses.
   - The church is not defined by institutional hierarchy but by the gospel.
   - "The church needs a Christian government, not a papal tyranny." (On the Councils and the Church)

3. **Congregational Participation in Governance**
   - Local congregations should participate in choosing their ministers.
   - The community is responsible for maintaining doctrine and discipline.
   - Lay involvement is essential for healthy church life.
   - Authority is exercised through the assembly, not imposed from above.
   - "The congregation has the right and power to judge doctrine and to call or dismiss pastors." (On the Councils and the Church)

4. **Offices Rooted in Word and Sacrament**
   - The primary office is that of the **pastor**, who preaches and administers sacraments.
   - Church offices are instituted for the ministry of the gospel, not for domination.
   - Bishops and elders are legitimate if they serve the Word faithfully.
   - Ordination is a recognition by the community, not a sacramental act conferring indelible character.
   - "The ministry of the Word is the highest office in the church." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

5. **Church Discipline as Communal Responsibility**
   - Discipline is necessary to preserve the purity of the church.
   - Excommunication is a last resort, exercised by the congregation.
   - Restoration and repentance are the goals of discipline.
   - Discipline is based on Scripture, not arbitrary authority.
   - "The ban or excommunication should be exercised according to the gospel, by the congregation." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s views on **church government** laid the groundwork for later Protestant models, especially in emphasizing the **priesthood of all believers** and the authority of the local congregation. While he did not establish a detailed **Presbyterian polity**, his rejection of papal hierarchy and insistence on the ministry of Word and Sacrament profoundly shaped Lutheran and broader Reformation ecclesiology. His influence is evident in the development of church offices and the practice of church discipline in many Protestant traditions.
