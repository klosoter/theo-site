# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a comprehensive vision of **Presbyterian polity** rooted in the authority of **elders** and **ministers**, the necessity of **church discipline**, and the importance of **ecclesiastical assemblies**. These confessions emphasize the biblical foundation for **church offices** and the orderly exercise of **spiritual oversight** within the visible church.

- "We believe that this true church must be governed according to the spiritual order which our Lord has taught us in His Word." (Belgic Confession, Article 30)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 30–32
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Days 31 and 38
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Church Order and related Synodical documents
- The Church Orders of Dort (1619)
- J. van Bruggen, The Church in the Twentieth Century: Church Polity in Reformed Perspective

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church Government by Elders and Ministers**
   - The church is governed by a plurality of **elders** and **ministers** as instituted by Christ.
   - Authority is exercised corporately, not individually, reflecting the New Testament pattern.
   - **Deacons** serve alongside elders, focusing on mercy and service.
   - Office-bearers are called and ordained by the congregation under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
   "We believe that ministers of the Word of God, elders, and deacons ought to be chosen to their offices by lawful election of the church." (Belgic Confession, Article 31)

2. **Presbyterian Polity and Assemblies**
   - Local congregations are governed by **consistories** (sessions) of elders.
   - Broader assemblies (classis, synod) provide oversight and unity among churches.
   - Decisions of assemblies are binding, provided they conform to Scripture.
   - The autonomy of local churches is balanced by connectionalism within the broader church.
   "No church shall lord it over another church, no minister over other ministers, no elder or deacon over other elders or deacons." (Church Order of Dort, Article 84)

3. **Necessity and Nature of Church Discipline**
   - **Church discipline** is essential for the purity and unity of the church.
   - Discipline is exercised in a spirit of love and restoration, not vengeance.
   - The keys of the kingdom involve preaching the gospel and Christian discipline.
   - Excommunication is a last resort for unrepentant members.
   "According to the command of Christ, excommunication is to be used for the correction and salvation of the offender, and for deterring others from sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 85)

4. **Biblical Foundation for Church Offices**
   - The offices of **minister**, **elder**, and **deacon** are grounded in Scripture.
   - Each office has distinct responsibilities and qualifications.
   - The call to office is both inward (by the Spirit) and outward (by the church).
   - Office-bearers are accountable to Christ and the church.
   "We believe that the ministers, elders, and deacons must be chosen to their offices by lawful election of the church, with prayer and in good order." (Belgic Confession, Article 31)

5. **Order and Authority in the Church**
   - The church is governed by **spiritual order**, not by human tradition or hierarchy.
   - Church authority is ministerial and declarative, not magisterial.
   - All church power is exercised under the authority of Christ, the only Head of the church.
   - Human ordinances must not bind consciences beyond what Scripture requires.
   "We reject all human inventions and laws introduced into the worship of God, which bind and force the conscience in any way." (Belgic Confession, Article 32)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology**, providing a robust framework for **Presbyterian polity** and the exercise of church discipline. Their articulation of church offices and assemblies has influenced Reformed and Presbyterian churches worldwide, fostering a commitment to biblical order and spiritual oversight. The enduring legacy of these confessions is seen in their ongoing use as doctrinal standards and guides for church government in the global Reformed tradition.
