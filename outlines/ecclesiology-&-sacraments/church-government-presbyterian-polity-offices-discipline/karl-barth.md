# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached **church government** with a strong emphasis on the **sovereignty of Christ** as the true head of the church, critiquing both hierarchical and congregational extremes. While not strictly Presbyterian, Barth affirmed the necessity of **ordered offices**, **ecclesial discipline**, and **representative structures** that reflect the church’s dependence on the Word of God rather than human authority.

- "The church is the congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ, not a human association, and its order must correspond to its nature." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, IV/1–IV/2
- The Theology of the Reformed Confessions (Barth’s Göttingen Lectures)
- Community, State, and Church
- The Knowledge of God and the Service of God According to the Teaching of the Reformation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the sole Head of the Church**
    - Christ alone governs the church; all human authority is derivative.
    - Church offices exist to serve the ministry of the Word, not to exercise autonomous power.
    - The church’s polity must reflect its dependence on Christ’s ongoing lordship.
    - Any form of government is judged by its faithfulness to Christ’s command.
    - "The church is the earthly-historical form of the existence of Jesus Christ Himself." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Necessity of Ordered Offices**
    - Offices are instituted for the ministry of Word and Sacrament.
    - Ministers, elders, and deacons serve distinct but complementary functions.
    - Officeholders are called and authorized by the congregation under the Word.
    - The plurality of offices guards against clericalism and individualism.
    - "The ministry of the community is the ministry of the Word, and it is exercised in the form of these offices." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

3. **Representative and Collegial Governance**
    - Church government should be representative, not autocratic or purely democratic.
    - Presbyterial-synodal structures best express the church’s communal nature.
    - Decision-making is to be collegial, reflecting the unity and diversity of the body.
    - Authority is exercised corporately, not vested in a single individual.
    - "The presbyterial-synodal order is the best safeguard against both tyranny and anarchy in the church." (Community, State, and Church)

4. **Discipline as Service to the Gospel**
    - Church discipline is necessary for the church’s faithfulness to Christ.
    - Discipline is exercised for restoration, not punishment.
    - The goal is the preservation of the church’s witness and holiness.
    - Discipline must be administered under the authority of the Word and in love.
    - "Discipline is the necessary form of the church’s obedience to the Lord who sanctifies it." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

5. **Primacy of the Word in Church Order**
    - All church structures must be continually reformed according to Scripture.
    - The Word of God is the criterion for evaluating church government.
    - Tradition is subordinate to the living voice of Christ in Scripture.
    - The church’s polity is provisional and open to correction by the Word.
    - "The church must always ask whether its order is in conformity with the Word of God." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s theology of **church government** has shaped modern Reformed and ecumenical discussions by insisting on the centrality of Christ’s lordship and the primacy of the Word in all ecclesial structures. His nuanced support for **presbyterial-synodal polity** influenced 20th-century Protestant church orders, especially in Europe. Barth’s emphasis on the provisional and reformable nature of church offices and discipline continues to challenge both traditionalism and pragmatism in church governance.
