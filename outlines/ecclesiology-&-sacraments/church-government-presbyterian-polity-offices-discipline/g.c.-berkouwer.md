# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **church government** with a strong emphasis on the **Presbyterian polity** rooted in the **Reformed confessional tradition**. He viewed the **offices of the church** and **ecclesiastical discipline** as expressions of the church’s spiritual nature and its responsibility to maintain **doctrinal purity** and **communal order** under the authority of Christ as Head of the Church.

- "The church is not a democracy, but a theocracy, and its government must reflect the authority of Christ." (The Church, p. 295)

## Key Works

- The Church (De Kerk) (1957; English trans. 1976)
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Church (volume in the series)
- A Half Century of Theology: Movements and Motives (1977)
- Faith and Sanctification (1952; relevant for ecclesial discipline)
- The Second Vatican Council and the New Catholicism (1965; comparative ecclesiology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity as Biblical Norm**
    - Church government should be exercised through a body of elders, reflecting the New Testament pattern.
    - Authority is distributed, not centralized in a single office or individual.
    - The **session** and **broader assemblies** (presbytery, synod) serve as means of mutual accountability.
    - The structure is intended to safeguard the church’s spiritual character and resist clericalism.
    - "The Reformed tradition has always stressed the collegial and representative character of church government." (The Church, p. 298)

2. **Offices Rooted in Christ’s Kingship**
    - The offices of minister, elder, and deacon are instituted by Christ for the edification of the church.
    - Each office has distinct functions but shares in the ministry of the Word and care for the flock.
    - Office-bearers serve as representatives of Christ’s authority, not their own.
    - The call to office is both a divine and ecclesiastical act, requiring recognition by the congregation.
    - "The offices are not human inventions, but gifts of the ascended Lord to his church." (The Church, p. 301)

3. **Discipline as Spiritual Oversight**
    - Church discipline is a necessary aspect of maintaining the church’s holiness and unity.
    - Discipline is exercised with the aim of restoration, not punishment.
    - The process must be governed by Scripture and carried out with pastoral sensitivity.
    - Discipline upholds the integrity of the church’s confession and witness.
    - "Discipline is not an end in itself, but a means to preserve the church’s faithfulness to Christ." (The Church, p. 312)

4. **Authority Derived from the Word**
    - All ecclesiastical authority is ministerial and declarative, not magisterial.
    - Church courts and assemblies are bound by the authority of Scripture.
    - Decisions must be tested against the teaching of the Word and the confessions.
    - The church’s authority is always exercised under the lordship of Christ.
    - "The church’s authority is valid only insofar as it is obedient to the Word of God." (The Church, p. 307)

5. **Unity and Diversity in the Church**
    - Presbyterian polity allows for unity in doctrine and practice while respecting local diversity.
    - Broader assemblies foster connectionalism and mutual support among congregations.
    - The system guards against both individualism and authoritarianism.
    - True unity is spiritual, grounded in shared confession and mutual submission.
    - "The unity of the church is not uniformity, but a communion in the truth of the gospel." (The Church, p. 320)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s articulation of **Presbyterian polity** has shaped Reformed ecclesiology by emphasizing the biblical and confessional foundations of church government. His nuanced approach to **church offices** and **discipline** has influenced both academic theology and practical church life, especially in the Dutch Reformed tradition. Berkouwer’s work continues to serve as a resource for those seeking a balanced, Christ-centered understanding of church order and authority.
