# Guy Prentiss Waters (1972– )

Guy Prentiss Waters is a leading contemporary Reformed theologian who articulates a robust defense of **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the biblical foundations for **eldership**, **church courts**, and **discipline**. He insists that the **government of the church** is not a matter of mere pragmatism but is rooted in the **New Testament’s teaching** on the offices and structure of the visible church.

- "The government of the church is not a matter of indifference or expediency, but is revealed in Scripture for the good of Christ’s flock." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

## Key Works

- How Jesus Runs the Church (2011)
- The Lord’s Supper as the Sign and Meal of the New Covenant (2020)
- “Presbyterian Church Government” in The Handbook of Presbyterian Church Government (contributor)
- “The Doctrine of the Church” in A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament (2016)
- Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul (2004) [contextualizes ecclesiology]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian polity is biblically mandated**
    - Argues that **Presbyterian government** arises directly from the pattern of **elders** and **courts** in the New Testament.
    - Rejects both **episcopal** and **congregational** models as lacking full biblical warrant.
    - Emphasizes the parity and plurality of elders in local congregations.
    - Sees higher courts (presbyteries, synods) as essential for unity and accountability.
    - "Presbyterian polity is not a human invention but a divine prescription for the church’s order." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

2. **Distinct and perpetual church offices**
    - Affirms the ongoing offices of **elder** (teaching and ruling) and **deacon** as instituted by Christ.
    - Distinguishes between the **ministerial** and **representative** functions of elders.
    - Rejects the continuation of extraordinary offices (apostle, prophet) after the apostolic era.
    - Upholds ordination as a public, ecclesiastical act.
    - "The church’s offices are Christ’s gift to his people for their edification and protection." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

3. **Church discipline as a mark of the true church**
    - Asserts that **discipline** is essential to the church’s purity and witness.
    - Grounds the practice in Christ’s teaching (Matthew 18) and apostolic precedent.
    - Views discipline as both corrective and restorative, aiming at repentance and reconciliation.
    - Insists that discipline is exercised by church courts, not individuals.
    - "Without discipline, the church cannot faithfully bear the name of Christ." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

4. **Connectionalism and church courts**
    - Stresses the necessity of **connectionalism**: local churches are accountable to broader assemblies.
    - Upholds the authority of **sessions**, **presbyteries**, and **general assemblies**.
    - Argues that connectionalism preserves both unity and doctrinal fidelity.
    - Sees church courts as means of mutual edification and correction.
    - "The connectional nature of Presbyterianism is a safeguard for the church’s peace and purity." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

5. **Christ’s kingship over the church**
    - Teaches that **Jesus Christ** is the only head and king of the church.
    - Asserts that all church power is **ministerial** and **declarative**, not legislative.
    - Argues that church government must always be exercised under Christ’s Word.
    - Rejects any form of church rule that usurps Christ’s authority.
    - "Christ alone rules his church, and all human authority is derived and limited by his Word." (How Jesus Runs the Church)

## Legacy and Impact
