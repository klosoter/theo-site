# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. upholds a robust **Presbyterian polity** rooted in the authority of **Scripture**, emphasizing the spiritual and ministerial nature of **church offices** and the necessity of **church discipline** for the church’s purity and mission. He insists that the **eldership** is divinely instituted and that the government of the church is collegial, representative, and accountable to Christ as the only Head of the church.

- "The government of the church is not a matter of human expediency but of divine institution, grounded in the apostolic pattern revealed in Scripture." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "The Church" in The New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" in The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century
- "The Holy Spirit and the Church" in The Holy Spirit: Works and Gifts (ed. John Armstrong)
- "Some Epistemological Reflections on 1 Corinthians 2:6-16" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian polity is biblically mandated**
    - Church government is derived from the **apostolic pattern** in the New Testament.
    - Authority is exercised through a plurality of **elders**, not a single individual.
    - Local congregations are governed by sessions, with broader assemblies (presbyteries, synods) providing oversight.
    - The structure is intended to reflect the unity and catholicity of the church under **Christ**.
    "Presbyterian government is not a matter of mere historical development but is rooted in the apostolic witness." (The Church, NDT)

2. **Offices are spiritual and ministerial, not magisterial**
    - The offices of elder and deacon are instituted by **Christ** for the edification of the church.
    - Elders are responsible for teaching, ruling, and shepherding, but always as servants of the **Word**.
    - No officeholder possesses authority independent of Christ or the Scriptures.
    - The distinction between teaching and ruling elders preserves both order and diversity of gifts.
    "The authority of church office is always ministerial, never magisterial." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Church discipline is essential for purity and witness**
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church, necessary for maintaining doctrinal and moral integrity.
    - It is exercised for the restoration of the offender and the protection of the flock.
    - Discipline is always to be administered in accordance with **Scripture** and in the spirit of gentleness.
    - The ultimate goal is the glory of Christ and the health of his body.
    "Discipline is not an optional extra but integral to the church’s faithfulness." (The Church, NDT)

4. **Christ alone is the Head of the church**
    - All authority in the church derives from **Christ**, mediated through his Word and Spirit.
    - No human office or assembly can usurp Christ’s unique headship.
    - The church’s government must always be accountable to **Scripture**.
    - The unity and diversity of the church are grounded in union with Christ.
    "The church is governed by Christ, not by men, and all its structures must reflect that reality." (The Holy Spirit and the Church)

5. **The unity of the visible and invisible church**
    - The visible church is the institutional expression of the invisible, spiritual body of **Christ**.
    - Church government serves the unity and mission of the whole church, not just local interests.
    - The connectional nature of Presbyterian polity expresses the catholicity of the church.
    - The offices and discipline of the church are means by which Christ builds and preserves his people.
    "The visible church, governed according to Scripture, is the sphere where Christ’s saving reign is manifest." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **Presbyterian polity** has reinforced the biblical and theological foundations for Reformed church government, especially within confessional Presbyterianism. His emphasis on the spiritual nature of church offices and the necessity of discipline has shaped generations of pastors and theologians. Gaffin’s work continues to inform debates on **ecclesiology**, ensuring that church government remains accountable to the authority of Scripture and the lordship of Christ.
