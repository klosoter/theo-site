# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a comprehensive vision of **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the church's visible unity, the parity and plurality of **elders**, and the necessity of **church discipline** for maintaining doctrinal and moral purity. They ground the church's government in **Scripture**, insisting on a system of graded courts and clearly defined **offices** as divinely instituted means for the edification and order of the church.

- "The Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his Church, hath therein appointed a government, in the hand of church-officers, distinct from the civil magistrate." (Westminster Confession of Faith 30.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 25, 30, 31)
- The Form of Presbyterial Church-Government (1645)
- The Directory for Public Worship (1645)
- The Larger Catechism (esp. Q&A 45–62)
- The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652 (ed. Chad Van Dixhoorn)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity is Scriptural**
    - Church government is derived from the **regulative principle**, requiring biblical warrant for its structure.
    - Authority is exercised through **courts** (sessions, presbyteries, synods, general assemblies).
    - The parity of elders is maintained, rejecting hierarchical episcopacy.
    - Christ alone is the head of the church, ruling through ordained officers.
    - "There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ." (WCF 25.6)

2. **Distinct and Perpetual Church Offices**
    - The offices of **elder (teaching and ruling)** and **deacon** are of perpetual divine institution.
    - Ministers of the Word are distinct from ruling elders but share in governance.
    - Deacons serve the church’s temporal and charitable needs.
    - All officers are to be chosen by the congregation, with oversight by the presbytery.
    - "The officers appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the church are pastors, teachers, and other church governors, and deacons." (Form of Presbyterial Church-Government)

3. **Church Discipline is Essential**
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church and necessary for its purity.
    - It includes admonition, suspension, and excommunication for unrepentant sin.
    - Discipline is exercised by church courts, not by individuals.
    - Restoration is the ultimate goal, aiming at repentance and reconciliation.
    - "Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren, for deterring of others from the like offences..." (WCF 30.3)

4. **Connectionalism and Graded Courts**
    - Local congregations are governed by sessions, but are accountable to higher courts.
    - Appeals may be made from lower to higher assemblies for redress of grievances.
    - Unity and order are preserved through mutual accountability among churches.
    - Decisions of higher courts are binding unless contrary to Scripture.
    - "It belongeth to synods and councils, ministerially to determine controversies of faith, and cases of conscience..." (WCF 31.3)

5. **Spiritual Independence from Civil Authority**
    - The church’s government is distinct from and not subordinate to the civil magistrate.
    - Civil authorities may not assume ecclesiastical powers or interfere in church discipline.
    - The church has the right to assemble and govern itself according to Christ’s ordinance.
    - The magistrate may support the church but not dictate its doctrine or polity.
    - "Synods and councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that which is ecclesiastical..." (WCF 31.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** established the theological and practical foundation for **Presbyterian church government** in the English-speaking world and beyond. Their articulation of **offices**, graded courts, and the necessity of discipline shaped the polity of numerous Reformed and Presbyterian denominations. The Standards’ insistence on the church’s spiritual independence from civil authority has influenced subsequent debates on church-state relations. Their legacy endures in the ongoing use of their polity and confessional standards across global Presbyterianism.
