# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **church government** from the perspective of **Reformed ecclesiology**, emphasizing the church as a living fellowship rather than a rigid institution. While he acknowledged the historical development of **Presbyterian polity** and **church offices**, Brunner prioritized the dynamic work of the **Holy Spirit** and the necessity of **discipline** for maintaining the church's spiritual integrity.

- "The Church is not an institution, but a fellowship created by the Word and the Spirit." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

## Key Works

- The Misunderstanding of the Church
- Dogmatics, Vol. III: The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation
- The Divine Imperative
- Truth as Encounter
- The Mediator

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Spiritual Fellowship**
   - The church is fundamentally a **community of believers** gathered by the Word and Spirit.
   - Institutional forms, including **Presbyterian polity**, are secondary to the church’s spiritual reality.
   - The visible structure serves the invisible fellowship, not vice versa.
   - True authority arises from the presence of Christ, not merely from office.
   - "The Church is the fellowship of faith, not an organization with a fixed constitution." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

2. **Critical Reception of Presbyterian Polity**
   - Brunner recognized the historical value of **Presbyterian governance** but did not see it as divinely mandated.
   - He argued that no single form of church government is prescribed in the New Testament.
   - The flexibility of church order allows adaptation to cultural and historical contexts.
   - The essence of the church is not dependent on its external polity.
   - "The New Testament does not prescribe any particular form of church government." (Dogmatics III)

3. **Offices as Functional, Not Hierarchical**
   - Church offices exist to serve the community, not to establish hierarchy.
   - The distinction between clergy and laity is functional, not ontological.
   - Leadership is validated by service and spiritual gifting, not by institutional status.
   - The office of **elder** or **presbyter** is important but not exclusive or absolute.
   - "The office is justified only as it serves the upbuilding of the fellowship." (Dogmatics III)

4. **Necessity and Limits of Church Discipline**
   - **Discipline** is essential for maintaining the church’s witness and purity.
   - It must be exercised in humility and love, reflecting the gospel.
   - The goal of discipline is restoration, not exclusion.
   - Discipline is a communal responsibility, not merely the prerogative of office-bearers.
   - "Discipline is necessary, but it must always be the discipline of love." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

5. **Authority Rooted in Christ and the Word**
   - All church authority is derived from **Christ** as the true head of the church.
   - The **Word of God** is the ultimate standard for church order and discipline.
   - Human structures and decisions must be continually reformed by Scripture.
   - The church is always under the judgment and renewal of the Word.
   - "The Church stands under the authority of Christ and His Word, not under any human constitution." (Dogmatics III)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s ecclesiology challenged rigid institutionalism by emphasizing the **spiritual fellowship** and dynamic nature of the church. His nuanced critique of **Presbyterian polity** influenced later ecumenical discussions and encouraged flexibility in church governance. Brunner’s insistence on the primacy of the Word and Spirit continues to shape Reformed and broader Protestant understandings of church offices and discipline. His work remains a significant resource for those seeking a balance between church order and spiritual vitality.
