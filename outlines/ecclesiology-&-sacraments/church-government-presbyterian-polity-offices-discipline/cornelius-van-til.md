# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **church government** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the necessity of **Presbyterian polity** as a biblically warranted structure that reflects the unity and diversity within the body of Christ. He saw the offices of **elder** and **deacon**, as well as the practice of **church discipline**, as essential to maintaining the purity and order of the church, always subordinated to the authority of **Scripture** and the sovereignty of God.

- "The government of the church must be based upon the principles laid down in Scripture and not upon the traditions of men." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Supreme Authority in Church Government**
    - Church polity must be derived from the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.
    - Human traditions or pragmatic considerations are always subordinate to biblical norms.
    - The **regulative principle** applies not only to worship but also to the structure and discipline of the church.
    - The offices and functions within the church are defined and limited by the Word of God.
    - "The church must ever be reformed according to the Word of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Presbyterian Polity Reflects Biblical Covenantal Structure**
    - The **Presbyterian system** mirrors the covenantal unity and diversity found in Scripture.
    - Authority is exercised through a plurality of elders, reflecting the corporate nature of the church.
    - Local, regional, and broader assemblies express both the unity and diversity of the body.
    - The structure guards against both hierarchical tyranny and individualistic autonomy.
    - "The unity of the church is best preserved in a government that recognizes both the one and the many." (Essays on Christian Education)

3. **Distinct and Complementary Church Offices**
    - The offices of **elder** and **deacon** are instituted by Christ for the edification of the church.
    - Elders are responsible for teaching, ruling, and shepherding the flock.
    - Deacons serve the church’s material and mercy needs, reflecting Christ’s compassion.
    - Each office functions within its biblical mandate, avoiding confusion or overlap.
    - "The offices of the church are not human inventions but divine appointments." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Church Discipline as a Mark of the True Church**
    - **Discipline** is necessary to maintain the purity and witness of the church.
    - It is exercised under the authority of Christ and according to biblical procedures.
    - Discipline aims at restoration, not mere punishment.
    - The church must exercise discipline with humility, recognizing its own dependence on grace.
    - "Without discipline, the church ceases to be a true church of Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis Between Biblical and Non-Biblical Church Government**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between church government grounded in Scripture and that based on human autonomy.
    - Non-biblical forms of polity ultimately reflect a rejection of Christ’s kingship.
    - The church must resist pressures to conform to secular or pragmatic models of governance.
    - Faithfulness in polity is part of the church’s witness to the lordship of Christ over all of life.
    - "The church must not pattern its government after the world, but after the Word." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **Presbyterian polity** and his insistence on the regulative authority of Scripture have shaped generations of Reformed theologians and church leaders. His covenantal approach to church government reinforced the importance of both unity and diversity within the church’s structure. Van Til’s influence is evident in ongoing discussions about church offices and discipline, especially among those committed to a confessional Reformed identity. His legacy endures in the continuing emphasis on the antithesis between biblical and non-biblical models of church government.
