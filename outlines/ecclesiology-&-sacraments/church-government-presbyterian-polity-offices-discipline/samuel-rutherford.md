# Samuel Rutherford (1600–1661)

Samuel Rutherford was a leading advocate of **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the biblical foundation for a graded system of **church courts** and the parity of **elders**. He argued that **church government** should be distinct from civil authority, with **discipline** and **offices** rooted in Scripture and exercised through representative assemblies. Rutherford’s vision shaped the development of **Reformed ecclesiology** in the British Isles and beyond.

- "The government of the church is not monarchical, but presbyterial, and consists in assemblies of elders." ("The Due Right of Presbyteries")

## Key Works

- The Due Right of Presbyteries (1644)
- Lex, Rex (1644)
- The Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication (1646)
- Free Disputation Against Pretended Liberty of Conscience (1649)
- Westminster Assembly Minutes and Debates (as participant)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian polity is biblically mandated**
    - Church government must follow the pattern of **elders** ruling in graded assemblies.
    - The New Testament prescribes a system of **sessions, presbyteries, and synods**.
    - Authority is exercised corporately, not by individuals.
    - Presbyterian polity guards against both **prelacy** and **independency**.
    - "The presbyterial government is founded upon the Word of God and the practice of the apostolic churches." (The Due Right of Presbyteries)

2. **Distinct offices: minister and ruling elder**
    - The church is governed by two types of elders: **teaching elders (ministers)** and **ruling elders**.
    - Ministers are responsible for **Word and sacrament**, while ruling elders share in **government and discipline**.
    - Both offices are of divine institution and necessary for church order.
    - Deacons serve in a separate office focused on mercy and temporal affairs.
    - "There be in the church pastors and teachers, and also ruling elders, by divine right." (The Due Right of Presbyteries)

3. **Church discipline is essential to purity**
    - Discipline is a mark of the **true church** and preserves doctrinal and moral integrity.
    - Excommunication is a spiritual act, not a civil penalty.
    - Discipline must be exercised by church courts, not by individuals or civil magistrates.
    - Restoration, not mere punishment, is the goal of discipline.
    - "The power of the keys is spiritual, and is given to the church for edification, not for destruction." (The Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication)

4. **Church government is distinct from civil government**
    - The church has its own spiritual jurisdiction under Christ as Head.
    - Civil magistrates may support but not control the church’s spiritual affairs.
    - The independence of church courts is necessary to maintain **Christ’s kingship**.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial and declarative, not legislative.
    - "Christ hath given to his church a government distinct from the civil magistrate." (Lex, Rex)

5. **Assemblies are necessary for unity and order**
    - Broader assemblies (presbyteries, synods, general assemblies) provide oversight and resolve disputes.
    - Appeals may be made from lower to higher courts for justice and peace.
    - Assemblies express the unity of the church and prevent schism.
    - Decisions of assemblies are binding when consonant with Scripture.
    - "Assemblies are the means ordained by God for the preservation of unity and truth in the church." (The Due Right of Presbyteries)

## Legacy and Impact

Rutherford’s defense of **Presbyterian polity** shaped the ecclesiology of the Westminster Assembly and the subsequent development of Reformed churches in Scotland and elsewhere. His articulation of the distinct roles of **elders** and the necessity of graded assemblies became foundational for later Presbyterian practice. Rutherford’s insistence on the spiritual independence of the church influenced debates on church-state relations and continues to inform contemporary discussions on **church government** and discipline.
