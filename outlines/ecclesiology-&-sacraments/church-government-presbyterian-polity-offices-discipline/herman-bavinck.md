# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust vision of **Presbyterian polity** grounded in the authority of **Scripture**, the **threefold office** of minister, elder, and deacon, and the necessity of **church discipline** for maintaining doctrinal and moral purity. He emphasized the church as a spiritual organism governed by Christ through ordained offices, balancing the authority of assemblies with the rights of local congregations. Bavinck’s ecclesiology upholds the Reformed tradition’s commitment to **connectionalism** and the spiritual independence of the church from the state.

- "The government of the church is not a democracy, nor an autocracy, but a Christocracy." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:354)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity as Scriptural Model**
    - Church government is derived from the **New Testament** pattern of elders and deacons.
    - Authority is exercised through assemblies (session, presbytery, synod) rather than individuals.
    - Local congregations are governed by a plurality of elders.
    - The unity of the church is expressed through graded courts, not hierarchical episcopacy.
    - "The presbyterian form of government is most in harmony with the spirit and letter of the New Testament." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:355)

2. **Threefold Office: Minister, Elder, Deacon**
    - The offices are distinct yet complementary, reflecting Christ’s own offices as Prophet, Priest, and King.
    - Ministers focus on the ministry of the Word and sacraments.
    - Elders oversee doctrine, discipline, and spiritual care.
    - Deacons are responsible for works of mercy and service.
    - "The threefold office is rooted in the very being of the church as the body of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:367)

3. **Church Discipline as Mark of the True Church**
    - Discipline is essential for preserving the church’s **holiness** and doctrinal purity.
    - It is exercised with pastoral care, aiming at repentance and restoration.
    - Both moral and doctrinal offenses are subject to discipline.
    - Discipline is administered by the consistory (session) under the authority of Christ.
    - "Discipline is the power of the church to maintain itself in purity of doctrine and life." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:376)

4. **Spiritual Independence of the Church**
    - The church’s government is distinct from civil authority.
    - Christ alone is head of the church; no earthly power may usurp this role.
    - The church must resist state interference in spiritual matters.
    - Spiritual authority is exercised through the Word and Spirit, not coercion.
    - "The church is a spiritual organism and institution, independent in its own sphere." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:349)

5. **Connectionalism and the Unity of the Church**
    - Churches are not isolated but united in a broader federation.
    - Assemblies express the unity and catholicity of the church.
    - Decisions of broader assemblies are binding, yet local autonomy is respected.
    - Connectionalism guards against both individualism and authoritarianism.
    - "The unity of the church is realized in the communion of the saints and the fellowship of the churches." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:359)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of **Presbyterian polity** has profoundly shaped Reformed ecclesiology, especially in Dutch and global contexts. His careful balance of church authority, office, and discipline continues to inform debates on church government and the relationship between church and state. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, theologically rich vision of church order that is both catholic and Reformed.
