# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, while best known for his work in **biblical theology**, affirmed the importance of **Presbyterian polity** as the most biblically faithful form of **church government**. He emphasized the scriptural basis for **eldership**, the plurality of church **offices**, and the necessity of **church discipline** as means for maintaining doctrinal purity and spiritual health within the covenant community.

- "The government of the church is not a matter of expediency, but of divine institution." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- “The Scriptural Doctrine of the Church” (Princeton Theological Review, 1905)
- “The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline” (1894)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church government is divinely instituted**
    - The structure and authority of the church are grounded in **biblical revelation**, not human tradition.
    - Christ alone is the head of the church, delegating authority through ordained offices.
    - The New Testament prescribes a system of **elders** and **deacons** for local congregations.
    - The church’s government reflects the **covenantal** nature of God’s people.
    - "The church is not a voluntary association, but a divine institution with Christ as its head." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

2. **Presbyterian polity is biblically mandated**
    - The **plurality of elders** (presbyters) is rooted in apostolic practice.
    - Authority is exercised collectively, not by a single individual.
    - Higher assemblies (sessions, presbyteries, synods) provide accountability and unity.
    - Presbyterian polity guards against both clericalism and congregational autonomy.
    - "The Presbyterian form of government is most in harmony with the apostolic church." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

3. **Distinct church offices are necessary**
    - The New Testament establishes the offices of **elder** (overseer) and **deacon**.
    - Elders are responsible for teaching, ruling, and shepherding the flock.
    - Deacons serve the church’s material and mercy needs.
    - Office-bearers are called and ordained by the church, not self-appointed.
    - "The offices of the church are instituted for the edification and order of the body of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

4. **Church discipline is essential for purity**
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church, preserving **doctrinal and moral integrity**.
    - It is exercised with the goal of restoration, not mere punishment.
    - Discipline is conducted according to scriptural procedures and in the spirit of love.
    - The church has the authority to admit, admonish, suspend, or excommunicate members.
    - "Without discipline, the church cannot maintain its distinctiveness from the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

5. **The church is both visible and invisible**
    - The **visible church** is the organized community of professing believers and their children.
    - The **invisible church** consists of the elect known only to God.
    - Church government pertains to the visible church, but always in light of the invisible reality.
    - The unity and holiness of the church are grounded in Christ, not in external organization alone.
    - "The distinction between the visible and invisible church safeguards both order and spiritual reality." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **Presbyterian polity** has shaped Reformed ecclesiology by grounding church government in redemptive history and biblical theology. His insistence on the divine institution of church offices and discipline continues to influence confessional Presbyterian and Reformed churches. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, scripturally-rooted understanding of church government that balances authority, accountability, and spiritual vitality.
