# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a leading advocate of **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the biblical foundation for a representative system of **church government**. He defended the necessity of **distinct church offices** and the exercise of **church discipline** as essential to the purity and order of the visible church.

- "The government of the Church is a divine institution, and its form is prescribed in the Scriptures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity is Scriptural**
    - The New Testament prescribes a representative form of church government.
    - Authority is vested in a plurality of elders, not in a single individual.
    - Local congregations are governed by sessions, with broader courts (presbyteries, synods, general assembly) providing connectional oversight.
    - Presbyterian polity guards against both clericalism and congregationalism.
    - "The Presbyterian system is founded upon the principle that the Church should be governed by presbyters or elders chosen by the people." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Distinct and Perpetual Church Offices**
    - The offices of **minister**, **elder**, and **deacon** are of perpetual obligation.
    - Ministers (teaching elders) are responsible for preaching and sacraments; ruling elders for governance; deacons for mercy ministry.
    - Office-bearers must meet biblical qualifications and are ordained by the laying on of hands.
    - The parity of elders is maintained, though functions may differ.
    - "There are in the Church permanent officers, whose appointment is not left to the discretion of the people." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Church Discipline is Essential**
    - Discipline is necessary for the purity, peace, and edification of the church.
    - It includes admonition, suspension, and excommunication, always aiming at restoration.
    - Discipline is exercised by church courts, not individuals.
    - The church’s spiritual authority is distinct from civil power.
    - "Discipline is not merely remedial, but also declarative and protective." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Connectionalism and Unity**
    - The unity of the church is expressed through graded courts and mutual accountability.
    - Broader assemblies provide doctrinal and judicial oversight.
    - Connectionalism prevents isolation and schism among congregations.
    - Decisions of higher courts are binding, though subject to Scripture.
    - "The unity of the Church is preserved by the subordination of the lower to the higher courts." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Church Power is Ministerial and Declarative**
    - Church authority is limited to what Christ has commanded in Scripture.
    - Church courts declare, not create, doctrine and law.
    - The church’s power is spiritual, not legislative or coercive.
    - All church actions are subject to the authority of Christ as Head of the Church.
    - "The power of the Church is not magisterial, but ministerial and declarative." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **Presbyterian polity** shaped generations of American Presbyterianism and provided a systematic rationale for representative church government. His articulation of the biblical basis for church offices and discipline remains influential in Reformed and evangelical circles. Hodge’s legacy endures in the continuing emphasis on connectionalism and the spiritual nature of church authority within confessional Presbyterian bodies.
