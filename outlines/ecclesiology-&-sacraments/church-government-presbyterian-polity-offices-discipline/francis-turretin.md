# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust defense of **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the **divine institution of church offices** and the necessity of **ecclesiastical discipline** for the purity and unity of the church. He maintained that **church government** is not a matter of mere human prudence but is grounded in **Scripture**, with a plurality of elders and graded assemblies as essential features.

- "The government of the church is not arbitrary, but has been instituted by Christ and described in the Scriptures." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 3, Topics 18–19)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- De Necessaria Secessione Nostra ab Ecclesia Romana
- Willem van Asselt, ed., Reformation and Scholasticism: An Ecumenical Enterprise (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian polity is of divine right**
    - Church government is established by **divine command**, not human invention.
    - The **New Testament** prescribes a system of rule by elders (presbyters) in local congregations.
    - Christ, as head of the church, instituted a representative and collegial form of government.
    - The parity of elders and the presence of graded assemblies (sessions, presbyteries, synods) are biblically warranted.
    - "Presbyterian government is not a thing indifferent, but is founded on the perpetual will of Christ." (Institutes)

2. **Distinct and perpetual church offices**
    - The church is to be governed by a plurality of **offices**: ministers (pastors), elders, and deacons.
    - Each office has distinct functions: teaching, ruling, and serving.
    - The office of bishop is not superior to that of presbyter; both terms refer to the same office in the New Testament.
    - Extraordinary offices (apostles, prophets) have ceased; ordinary offices remain.
    - "The distinction between bishop and presbyter is not of divine right, but of human arrangement." (Institutes)

3. **Necessity and nature of ecclesiastical discipline**
    - **Church discipline** is essential for maintaining doctrinal purity and moral order.
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church and a means of restoring the erring.
    - The process must be conducted by the church courts, not by individuals.
    - Excommunication is a last resort, always aimed at repentance and restoration.
    - "Discipline is the sinew of ecclesiastical government and cannot be neglected without great peril." (Institutes)

4. **Authority of church courts and assemblies**
    - Authority is exercised collectively through **sessions**, **presbyteries**, and **synods**.
    - No single individual holds supreme power; decisions are made collegially.
    - Appeals and review by higher assemblies safeguard justice and unity.
    - The church's authority is ministerial and declarative, not magisterial or legislative.
    - "The power of the church is not lordly, but ministerial and subordinate to Christ." (Institutes)

5. **Scriptural sufficiency for church government**
    - The **regulative principle** applies to church polity as well as worship.
    - All essential elements of church government are revealed in Scripture.
    - Human traditions are permissible only insofar as they serve scriptural ends and do not contradict biblical norms.
    - The church must always reform its polity according to the Word of God.
    - "Nothing ought to be introduced into the government of the church which does not have the warrant of Scripture." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of **Presbyterian polity** shaped the ecclesiology of the Reformed tradition, especially in Geneva and later in the wider Reformed and Presbyterian world. His careful distinction of church offices and insistence on scriptural warrant influenced confessional standards such as the Westminster Form of Presbyterial Church Government. Turretin’s thought remains a touchstone for discussions of **church government**, discipline, and the relationship between Scripture and ecclesiastical practice.
