# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray advocated a **Presbyterian polity** rooted in the authority of **Scripture**, emphasizing the **offices of elder and deacon** and the necessity of **church discipline** for the purity and unity of the church. He maintained that church government is not a matter of mere expediency but is divinely instituted, with a plurality of elders and graded courts as essential to the church’s well-being.

- "The government of the church is not a matter of indifference or expediency but is determined by the revealed will of Christ, the King and Head of the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Government of the Church" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Form of Government of the Presbyterian Church" (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT; relevant for ecclesiological implications)
- "Principles of Conduct" (especially chapters on the church)
- "Christian Baptism" (for discussion of church membership and discipline)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church government is divinely instituted**
    - The structure and offices of the church are prescribed in **Scripture**.
    - Christ alone is the **Head of the Church** and has appointed its government.
    - Human innovation in polity is to be rejected in favor of biblical patterns.
    - The **Presbyterian model** reflects the New Testament church most faithfully.
    - "The only proper government of the church is that which Christ has instituted." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Plurality of elders and graded courts**
    - Local congregations are governed by a plurality of **elders**.
    - Broader assemblies (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly) provide accountability.
    - This structure guards against both clericalism and congregational autonomy.
    - The system ensures both local and connectional oversight.
    - "The New Testament pattern is that of a plurality of elders in each congregation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Distinct offices: elder and deacon**
    - The office of **elder** includes both ruling and teaching functions.
    - **Deacons** are responsible for the ministry of mercy and temporal affairs.
    - The distinction between offices is rooted in apostolic practice.
    - Both offices are essential for the church’s health and order.
    - "The New Testament clearly distinguishes between the office of elder and that of deacon." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Church discipline is essential**
    - Discipline is a mark of the true church and necessary for its purity.
    - It includes both formative (instructional) and corrective (judicial) aspects.
    - Discipline is exercised by the courts of the church, not individuals.
    - The aim is always restoration and the honor of Christ.
    - "Discipline is indispensable to the maintenance of the purity and integrity of the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Church government is not indifferent or secondary**
    - The form of government is a matter of obedience to Christ’s revealed will.
    - Polity affects the church’s witness, unity, and spiritual health.
    - Indifference to polity undermines the authority of Scripture.
    - The Reformed tradition rightly insists on the regulative principle in church government.
    - "It is a grave error to regard the government of the church as a matter of indifference." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of **Presbyterian polity** has shaped Reformed and Presbyterian churches, especially in North America and the United Kingdom. His insistence on the **biblical foundation** for church offices and discipline continues to inform debates on ecclesiology within confessional Reformed circles. Murray’s careful exegesis and principled approach have made his writings a standard reference for those seeking a scripturally grounded understanding of church government.
