# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed his understanding of **church government** within the context of medieval Catholicism, emphasizing a hierarchical structure rooted in **apostolic succession** and the **sacramental** nature of ecclesiastical offices. He affirmed the necessity of **ecclesiastical discipline** and the distinction of **orders** within the church, but did not advocate for **Presbyterian polity** as later defined in Reformed traditions. Aquinas’s theology of church governance is grounded in his broader doctrines of **grace**, **authority**, and the **visible church**.

- "The spiritual power is committed to certain men who exercise it in the name of the whole Church." (Summa Theologiae, Supplement, Q.37, a.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hierarchical Structure of Church Government**
   - The church is divinely ordered with a hierarchy reflecting the order of grace.
   - **Bishops** possess the fullness of the sacramental order, with priests and deacons serving under them.
   - Authority flows from Christ through the apostles to their successors.
   - The **Pope** holds primacy as the visible head of the universal church.
   - "Just as in the natural body there are various members with different functions, so in the Church there are various orders." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl., Q.37, a.2)

2. **Apostolic Succession and Ordination**
   - Valid ministry requires ordination by those in apostolic succession.
   - The sacrament of **Holy Orders** imparts a spiritual character enabling the exercise of ecclesiastical office.
   - Only those properly ordained may administer certain sacraments and exercise church discipline.
   - The continuity of the church depends on this unbroken succession.
   - "The sacrament of Order is necessary for the Church, for without it there would be no ministers to consecrate the Eucharist or absolve sins." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl., Q.34, a.2)

3. **Distinction and Function of Ecclesiastical Offices**
   - Offices are distinguished by their relation to the **Eucharist** and the care of souls.
   - Bishops ordain, confirm, and govern; priests celebrate the Eucharist and absolve; deacons assist.
   - Each office has specific spiritual and administrative responsibilities.
   - The distinction of offices is necessary for the church’s unity and order.
   - "There must be in the Church various grades and offices, that the whole body may be perfect." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl., Q.37, a.2)

4. **Church Discipline and Excommunication**
   - The church possesses the authority to exercise discipline, including **excommunication**.
   - Discipline aims at the correction and restoration of the sinner and the protection of the community.
   - Ecclesiastical penalties are medicinal, not merely punitive.
   - The ultimate goal is the salvation of souls and the preservation of church purity.
   - "Excommunication is a spiritual medicine intended to bring the sinner to repentance." (Summa Theologiae, Suppl., Q.21, a.1)

5. **Unity and Visibility of the Church**
   - The church is a visible society with a unified structure under Christ and his vicar.
   - Unity is maintained through common faith, sacraments, and hierarchical governance.
   - The visible order reflects the invisible grace at work in the church.
   - Schism and disorder threaten the church’s witness and mission.
   - "The unity of the Church consists in the connection of its members under one head." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, Q.39, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology of **church government** profoundly shaped Roman Catholic ecclesiology, reinforcing the centrality of **hierarchical order** and sacramental offices. His articulation of **apostolic succession** and the necessity of visible, structured authority influenced later debates on church polity, even as Reformation traditions diverged sharply from his model. While Aquinas did not anticipate Presbyterian polity, his systematic approach to church offices and discipline remains foundational for understanding medieval and modern Catholic governance. His thought continues to inform ecumenical discussions on the nature and structure of the **visible church**.
