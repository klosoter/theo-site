# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a vision of **church government** rooted in the **Presbyterian polity**, emphasizing the collective leadership of **elders** and the necessity of **church discipline** for maintaining doctrinal purity and communal holiness. He rejected both hierarchical episcopacy and congregational autonomy, insisting that the **offices** of the church—pastor, teacher, elder, and deacon—were biblically mandated and essential for the church’s spiritual health.

- "No church will long remain in a healthy state unless it has pastors who are true shepherds and watchmen." (Institutes IV.3.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (Book IV)
- The Ecclesiastical Ordinances (1541, Geneva)
- Commentaries on the Pastoral Epistles
- Letters and Correspondence (esp. regarding Geneva’s church order)
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill (secondary, for analysis of polity)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Presbyterian Polity as Biblical Norm**
    - Church government should be exercised by a body of **elders** (presbyters) rather than a single bishop.
    - Authority is distributed among pastors, teachers, elders, and deacons, reflecting New Testament patterns.
    - Local congregations are governed by **consistories** or sessions, with broader assemblies for appeals.
    - This structure guards against tyranny and promotes mutual accountability.
    - "The government of the church ought to be in the hands of a council of elders." (Institutes IV.3.8)

2. **Distinct and Perpetual Church Offices**
    - Calvin identified four perpetual offices: **pastor**, **teacher**, **elder**, and **deacon**.
    - Each office has distinct responsibilities: pastors preach and administer sacraments; teachers instruct; elders govern; deacons care for the poor.
    - Offices are not merely functional but divinely instituted for the church’s edification.
    - The plurality of elders ensures the church’s spiritual and practical needs are met.
    - "There are four orders of office which the ancient church maintained: pastors, teachers, elders, and deacons." (Institutes IV.3.8)

3. **Necessity and Nature of Church Discipline**
    - Discipline is essential for preserving **doctrinal purity** and moral integrity within the church.
    - The process involves admonition, suspension from the Lord’s Table, and, if necessary, excommunication.
    - Discipline is exercised by the consistory, not by civil magistrates or individual leaders.
    - Restoration, not punishment, is the ultimate goal of discipline.
    - "Discipline is like a bridle to restrain and subdue those who resist the doctrine of Christ." (Institutes IV.12.1)

4. **Spiritual Independence from Civil Authority**
    - The church’s spiritual government is distinct from and not subordinate to the civil magistrate.
    - Civil rulers may support the church but must not usurp ecclesiastical authority.
    - Church discipline and governance belong to the ordained officers, not to secular powers.
    - This distinction protects the church’s purity and mission.
    - "No man is fit to rule the church who mingles the spiritual government with the civil." (Institutes IV.11.8)

5. **Unity and Catholicity through Ordered Government**
    - Proper church government fosters unity and prevents schism.
    - Broader assemblies (presbyteries, synods) provide means for resolving disputes and maintaining catholicity.
    - Calvin valued connectionalism, seeing the church as one body with many members.
    - The ordered structure reflects the unity and diversity of Christ’s body.
    - "The unity of the church is preserved by the mutual consent and harmony of its ministers." (Institutes IV.2.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **Presbyterian polity** became foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, shaping their structures of **eldership**, discipline, and connectional assemblies. His insistence on the spiritual independence of the church influenced later debates on church-state relations. The enduring influence of his model is evident in the confessions and practices of Presbyterian and Reformed communions, where his vision of ordered, collegial leadership and robust discipline continues to guide ecclesiastical life.
