# R. Scott Clark (1961– )

R. Scott Clark is a contemporary Reformed theologian who emphasizes the historic **Reformed confessional tradition** in addressing **church and state relations**. He advocates for a clear distinction between the **spiritual mission of the church** and the **civil responsibilities of the state**, drawing on classic **Two Kingdoms theology** to argue against both Erastianism and theonomy.

- "The visible, institutional church has a spiritual mission; it is not called to rule the civil magistrate, nor is the magistrate called to rule the church." (Recovering the Reformed Confession)

## Key Works

- Recovering the Reformed Confession (2008)
- "Christ and Culture Revisited" (various essays and blog posts)
- "The Two Kingdoms and the Reformed Tradition" (in Always Reformed: Essays in Honor of W. Robert Godfrey, 2010)
- Heidelblog articles on church and state, the Two Kingdoms, and confessionalism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - The church and state are distinct institutions ordained by God with separate spheres.
    - The **spiritual kingdom** pertains to the ministry of Word and sacrament, while the **civil kingdom** pertains to temporal justice and order.
    - The church must not wield the sword or civil power.
    - The state must not dictate doctrine or worship.
    - "The Reformed tradition has always distinguished between the visible church as a spiritual institution and the civil magistrate as a temporal institution." (Recovering the Reformed Confession)

2. **Confessional Boundaries for the Church**
    - The church’s authority is limited to what is prescribed in the **Reformed confessions**.
    - The church should not pronounce on matters outside its spiritual calling.
    - Confessionalism protects the church from political co-option.
    - The church’s mission is proclamation, not political activism.
    - "Our confessions do not authorize the church to transform culture or to legislate morality for the state." (Recovering the Reformed Confession)

3. **Critique of Theonomy and Erastianism**
    - Rejects theonomy’s call for civil enforcement of Mosaic law.
    - Opposes Erastianism, where the state controls the church.
    - Argues both errors confuse the distinct roles of church and state.
    - Advocates for a principled separation based on Reformed tradition.
    - "Theonomy and Erastianism both undermine the integrity of the church’s spiritual mission." (Heidelblog)

4. **Liberty of Conscience**
    - The state must not bind consciences in matters of faith.
    - The church must not impose civil laws as spiritual obligations.
    - Religious liberty is a Reformed principle rooted in the gospel.
    - The magistrate’s role is to protect, not to prescribe, religious practice.
    - "The Reformed doctrine of liberty of conscience is essential to a proper understanding of church and state." (Recovering the Reformed Confession)

5. **Christ’s Mediatorial Kingship**
    - Christ rules the church as mediator in a unique, spiritual sense.
    - Christ’s kingship over the nations is providential, not ecclesiastical.
    - The church proclaims Christ’s lordship but does not enforce it by civil means.
    - The distinction safeguards the church’s gospel witness.
    - "Christ’s mediatorial kingship is exercised in the church through Word and sacrament, not through the magistrate." (Always Reformed)

## Legacy and Impact

Clark’s articulation of **Two Kingdoms theology** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on church and state, especially among confessional Presbyterians and Reformed churches. His work has provided a robust defense of the church’s spiritual mission and the importance of confessional boundaries. By critiquing both theonomy and Erastianism, Clark has helped clarify the historic Reformed position and its relevance for modern debates on religious liberty and public theology.
