# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **church and state relations** through the lens of his **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the lordship of Christ over all spheres of life. He maintains that while the **church** and **state** have distinct God-given roles, both are subject to the authority of **Scripture** and are called to serve God's kingdom purposes in their respective domains.

- "God is Lord of all areas of life, and his Word is therefore relevant to all areas, including politics and government." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- "Toward a Theology of the State" (in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1)
- "Christ and Culture" (in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Lordship over All Spheres**
    - Christ’s authority extends to both **church** and **state** without exception.
    - No area of life, including politics, is religiously neutral.
    - Both institutions are accountable to God’s revealed will.
    - The **kingdom of God** encompasses all human institutions.
    - "There is no area of human life that is not subject to the lordship of Christ." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Distinct but Related Roles**
    - The **church** is tasked with spiritual ministry, while the **state** maintains civil order.
    - Each has its own God-ordained responsibilities and limits.
    - The church must not wield the sword, and the state must not administer sacraments.
    - Cooperation is possible, but confusion of roles leads to error.
    - "God has ordained both church and state, but with different functions and limits." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Scripture as the Supreme Norm**
    - Both church and state are subject to the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Civil laws should be evaluated in light of biblical principles.
    - Christians in government must seek to apply biblical ethics.
    - The Bible provides a framework for justice and governance.
    - "Scripture is the ultimate standard for all human authority, including that of the state." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Sphere Sovereignty and Mutual Accountability**
    - Frame affirms a modified **sphere sovereignty**, recognizing legitimate distinctions.
    - Church and state should respect each other’s God-given boundaries.
    - Both are accountable to God and can call each other to faithfulness.
    - Neither sphere is autonomous from God’s law.
    - "Each institution must recognize the sovereignty of God over its own sphere and the legitimacy of the other." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Christian Engagement in Public Life**
    - Christians are called to participate in public affairs as an expression of discipleship.
    - Political involvement should be guided by biblical wisdom and humility.
    - The church should equip believers for faithful citizenship.
    - Engagement must avoid both withdrawal and domination.
    - "Christians should seek to bring every area of life, including politics, under the lordship of Christ." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **church and state relations** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions by emphasizing the comprehensive lordship of Christ and the necessity of biblical authority in public life. His **triperspectival** method offers a nuanced framework for understanding the interplay between spiritual and civil responsibilities. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking to navigate the complexities of Christian engagement in society.
