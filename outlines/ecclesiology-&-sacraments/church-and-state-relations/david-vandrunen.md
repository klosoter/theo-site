# David VanDrunen (1971– )

David VanDrunen is a leading proponent of **Reformed Two Kingdoms theology**, emphasizing a principled distinction between the **church** as a spiritual institution and the **civil government** as a common, temporal authority. He argues that both realms are ordained by God but governed by different norms: the church by the **redemptive order** of Scripture, and the state by the **natural law** accessible to all humanity.

- "God rules the civil kingdom through common grace and natural law, while he rules the redemptive kingdom through special revelation and the means of grace." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

## Key Works

- Living in God’s Two Kingdoms: A Biblical Vision for Christianity and Culture (2010)
- Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms: A Study in the Development of Reformed Social Thought (2010)
- Divine Covenants and Moral Order: A Biblical Theology of Natural Law (2014)
- Politics after Christendom: Political Theology in a Fractured World (2020)
- A Biblical Case for Natural Law (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - The **church** and **state** are distinct institutions with separate God-given mandates.
    - The church is governed by the **Word and sacraments**, while the state is governed by **natural law**.
    - Christians are citizens of both kingdoms but must distinguish their obligations in each.
    - This distinction guards against both **theocracy** and secularism.
    - "The two kingdoms doctrine is not a call for withdrawal from the world but for proper engagement according to God’s design." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

2. **Natural Law as Civil Foundation**
    - The moral order of the civil realm is grounded in **natural law**, accessible to all people.
    - Natural law provides a common standard for justice and public life, apart from special revelation.
    - The state’s legitimacy and authority are rooted in creation, not redemption.
    - Christians can participate in public life on the basis of shared moral knowledge.
    - "Natural law is the means by which God governs the common kingdom and enables human society to flourish." (Divine Covenants and Moral Order)

3. **Redemptive Kingdom Governed by Scripture**
    - The church is a **redemptive community** distinct from the broader society.
    - Its life and mission are shaped by **Scripture**, not by the norms of the civil order.
    - The church’s authority is spiritual, not coercive or political.
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, discipline) define the church’s unique calling.
    - "The church’s task is not to transform the world but to be a faithful witness to Christ’s kingdom." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

4. **Common Grace and Cultural Engagement**
    - God’s **common grace** preserves the civil order and enables cultural life post-Fall.
    - Christians are called to responsible engagement in society, recognizing its provisional nature.
    - Cultural activities are valuable but not redemptive in themselves.
    - The distinction between the kingdoms clarifies Christian freedom and responsibility in the world.
    - "Common grace allows for meaningful cultural activity without confusing it with the work of redemption." (Living in God’s Two Kingdoms)

5. **Critique of Transformationalism**
    - VanDrunen critiques **neo-Calvinist** and **transformationalist** approaches that blur church and state.
    - He warns against identifying Christian mission with political or cultural transformation.
    - The church’s witness is compromised when it seeks temporal power or influence.
    - True transformation is eschatological, not realized through civil institutions.
    - "The church’s hope is not in the transformation of the present age but in the coming of the new creation." (Politics after Christendom)

## Legacy and Impact

VanDrunen’s articulation of the **Two Kingdoms doctrine** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed debates on **church and state relations**, especially in North America. His work has provided a robust theological framework for distinguishing the roles of church and civil government, influencing pastors, theologians, and Christian citizens wrestling with public engagement. While his views have sparked controversy, particularly among advocates of **transformationalism**, VanDrunen’s scholarship has revived interest in the historic Reformed tradition’s approach to natural law and public theology.
