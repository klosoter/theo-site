# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **Church and State relations** from the standpoint of **Reformed covenant theology** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the distinct yet providentially ordered roles of the **church** and **civil government**, insisting that the church’s spiritual mission must remain separate from political authority, while both are under the sovereignty of God.

- "The church is not a political institution, nor is the state a redemptive institution; each has its own divinely appointed sphere." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5: Ecclesiology, The Means of Grace, Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Kingdom of God" (Princeton Theological Review, 1896)
- Selected Shorter Writings

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - The **church** and **state** are distinct institutions ordained by God.
    - The church’s authority is spiritual, not civil or coercive.
    - The state’s role is to maintain justice and order, not to administer grace.
    - Both are accountable to God but operate in different spheres.
    - "The church as an institution is not called to govern the world, but to witness to the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

2. **Primacy of the Spiritual Mission of the Church**
    - The church’s primary task is the proclamation of the **gospel** and administration of the **means of grace**.
    - Political involvement must not compromise the church’s spiritual calling.
    - The church’s authority is exercised through Word and sacrament, not through political power.
    - The visible church is a sign of the coming **kingdom of God**, not its earthly realization.
    - "The church’s calling is to be the bearer of redemption, not the agent of political transformation." (The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church)

3. **Providence and Common Grace in Civil Government**
    - Civil government is a legitimate institution established by God’s providence.
    - God uses the state to restrain evil and promote societal good through **common grace**.
    - The state is not redemptive but serves the order of creation.
    - Christians are called to respect and pray for civil authorities.
    - "The state belongs to the order of creation, not to the order of redemption." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 5)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemptive History**
    - The distinction between church and state is rooted in the unfolding of the **covenants**.
    - The Old Testament theocracy was unique and not normative for post-Christendom.
    - The new covenant church is a pilgrim people, not a political nation.
    - The church’s identity is eschatological, awaiting the consummation of the kingdom.
    - "The church is not a continuation of the Old Testament theocracy, but a new creation in Christ." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The fullness of the **kingdom of God** is future and not to be identified with any earthly polity.
    - The church’s hope is in Christ’s return, not in political triumph.
    - Earthly governments are provisional and will pass away.
    - The church’s witness anticipates the final unity of all things under Christ.
    - "The kingdom of God is not of this world, but it breaks into this world through the church’s witness." (The Kingdom of God, Princeton Theological Review)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **two kingdoms** doctrine and his emphasis on the spiritual nature of the church have profoundly shaped modern Reformed ecclesiology and political theology. His biblical-theological method provided a framework for distinguishing the church’s redemptive mission from the state’s civil responsibilities. Vos’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions about the church’s public role, especially within confessional Reformed circles, where his insights continue to inform debates on the relationship between faith and politics.
