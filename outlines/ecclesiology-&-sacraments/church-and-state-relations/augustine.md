# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **Church and State relations** is rooted in his distinction between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**, emphasizing the ultimate sovereignty of God over all human affairs. He argued that while the **Church** and the **State** have distinct roles, both are under divine providence, and the State’s authority is legitimate insofar as it serves justice and peace. Augustine’s thought laid the groundwork for later Christian understandings of the relationship between **spiritual** and **temporal** power.

- "Two loves have made two cities: the love of self, even to the contempt of God; the love of God, even to the contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between the Two Cities**
    - The **City of God** and the **earthly city** are defined by their ultimate loves and destinies.
    - The Church represents the pilgrim community oriented toward God’s eternal kingdom.
    - The State is part of the earthly city, marked by temporal concerns and self-love.
    - Both cities coexist in history but are fundamentally distinct in purpose and end.
    - "Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves..." (City of God, XIV.28)

2. **Legitimacy of Secular Authority**
    - Civil government is ordained by God to restrain evil and maintain order.
    - The State’s authority is legitimate when it upholds **justice** and peace.
    - Christians are called to obey civil authorities unless commanded to sin.
    - The State is not redemptive but serves a provisional, temporal good.
    - "The earthly city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace..." (City of God, XIX.17)

3. **Church’s Spiritual Supremacy**
    - The Church’s authority is spiritual and oriented toward eternal salvation.
    - The Church guides consciences and judges moral and doctrinal matters.
    - The Church may admonish rulers but does not wield the sword.
    - The Church’s mission transcends political boundaries and allegiances.
    - "The Church is indeed the kingdom of God on earth..." (City of God, XX.9)

4. **Interdependence and Tension**
    - The Church and State interact but must not be conflated.
    - Christians live as citizens of both cities, fulfilling duties to each.
    - The State can aid the Church in maintaining peace and order.
    - Tension arises when State laws conflict with divine law.
    - "We are citizens of two cities, and must serve both so far as duty permits." (Letter 138)

5. **Providence and Eschatology**
    - God’s providence governs both Church and State throughout history.
    - The ultimate destiny of both cities is revealed at the final judgment.
    - Earthly peace is provisional; true peace is found only in God.
    - History is a pilgrimage toward the consummation of the **City of God**.
    - "The peace of the heavenly city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God..." (City of God, XIX.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s vision of **Church and State relations** profoundly shaped Western political theology, influencing medieval, Reformation, and modern debates about the proper roles of spiritual and temporal power. His distinction between the **two cities** provided a framework for understanding the limits of political authority and the transcendent mission of the Church. Later thinkers, from Aquinas to the Reformers, engaged deeply with Augustine’s insights, making his thought foundational for Christian discussions of politics and society.
