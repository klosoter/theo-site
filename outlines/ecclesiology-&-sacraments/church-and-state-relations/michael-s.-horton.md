# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton approaches **Church and State relations** from a distinctly **Reformed two kingdoms** perspective, emphasizing the distinction between the **spiritual authority of the church** and the **civil authority of the state**. He argues that while both are ordained by God, their mandates and means are fundamentally different, with the church tasked with proclaiming the **gospel** and the state responsible for maintaining **civil order**.

- "The church is not called to rule the world, but to serve the world as the embassy of Christ’s kingdom." ("The Gospel Commission")

## Key Works

- "The Gospel Commission: Recovering God’s Strategy for Making Disciples"
- "The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way"
- "Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama"
- "Where in the World Is the Church? A Christian View of Culture and Your Role in It"
- "Christless Christianity: The Alternative Gospel of the American Church"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - Affirms a clear distinction between the **spiritual kingdom** (church) and the **civil kingdom** (state).
    - The church is governed by the Word and sacraments, not by civil power.
    - The state is responsible for justice and order, not for enforcing religious orthodoxy.
    - Both realms are under God’s sovereignty but have distinct purposes and means.
    - "The two kingdoms doctrine is not a division of reality but a distinction of God’s ways of ruling." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Primacy of the Gospel in the Church**
    - The church’s unique mission is the proclamation of the **gospel** and administration of the **means of grace**.
    - Social and political engagement must not eclipse the church’s spiritual calling.
    - The church should resist being co-opted by political agendas.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial, in civil affairs.
    - "When the church confuses its mission with the state’s, it loses its identity and its power." ("The Gospel Commission")

3. **Affirmation of Civil Authority**
    - Recognizes the legitimacy of civil government as ordained by God.
    - The state’s role is to maintain justice, peace, and public order.
    - Christians are called to obey lawful authorities unless commanded to sin.
    - The church should pray for and respect civil leaders, without seeking to control them.
    - "God has established the state for the common good, not for the administration of redemption." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Critique of Theocracy and Constantinianism**
    - Rejects attempts to establish a **theocratic** or **Constantinian** model where church and state are fused.
    - Warns against the dangers of civil religion and politicized Christianity.
    - Advocates for religious liberty and pluralism in the public square.
    - Sees the church as a **pilgrim community**, not a political regime.
    - "The church’s power is persuasive, not coercive; it is exercised through the Word, not the sword." ("Where in the World Is the Church?")

5. **Christian Engagement in Public Life**
    - Encourages Christians to participate in public life as citizens, not as representatives of the institutional church.
    - Christian ethics should inform public conduct, but not be imposed by ecclesiastical decree.
    - The church equips believers for faithful presence in society, not for political domination.
    - The distinction between church and state enables both to flourish in their God-given roles.
    - "Christians are called to be salt and light, but the church is not called to be the government." ("The Gospel Commission")

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed discussions** on church and state, reviving the **two kingdoms** doctrine for modern evangelicalism. His work has provided a robust theological framework for distinguishing the church’s spiritual mission from political activism, influencing pastors, theologians, and lay leaders. Horton’s emphasis on the **primacy of the gospel** and the dangers of politicized Christianity continues to inform debates on religious liberty and the church’s public witness.
