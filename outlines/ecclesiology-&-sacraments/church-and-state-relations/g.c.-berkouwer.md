# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **Church and State relations** from the perspective of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the distinct yet interrelated roles of the **church** and the **civil government** under the sovereignty of God. He rejected both **Constantinianism** and radical separation, advocating for a nuanced understanding in which the church maintains its prophetic voice while recognizing the legitimacy of the state’s authority within its God-given sphere.

- "The church must not identify itself with any political order, but neither can it withdraw from its responsibility to witness to the truth in the public sphere." (The Church, Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction of Church and State**
    - The **church** and **state** are distinct institutions, each ordained by God for specific purposes.
    - The church is responsible for spiritual matters; the state for civil order and justice.
    - Confusion of these spheres leads to theological and practical errors.
    - The church must not become an instrument of political power.
    - "The distinction between church and state is not a separation of spheres but a differentiation of divine mandates." (The Church)

2. **Sovereignty of God Over All Spheres**
    - Both church and state operate under the ultimate sovereignty of God.
    - No sphere is autonomous from God's authority or revelation.
    - The church must remind the state of its accountability to God.
    - This sovereignty prevents both the sacralization and secularization of politics.
    - "God’s sovereignty relativizes all earthly authority, including that of the state." (General Revelation)

3. **Prophetic Witness of the Church**
    - The church has a calling to speak prophetically to the state and society.
    - This witness is grounded in the **Word of God** and the gospel.
    - The church must address issues of justice, peace, and human dignity.
    - Prophetic witness does not mean direct political involvement or partisanship.
    - "The church’s prophetic task is to call the state to justice, not to rule in its place." (The Church)

4. **Rejection of Constantinianism**
    - Berkouwer opposed the fusion of church and state power.
    - He critiqued historical models where the church became subordinate to political interests.
    - The gospel is compromised when the church seeks worldly influence.
    - True Christian witness requires freedom from state control.
    - "The Constantinian temptation is ever present, but the church must resist it for the sake of the gospel." (A Half Century of Theology)

5. **Engagement Without Domination**
    - The church should engage public life without seeking to dominate it.
    - Christian principles inform public ethics, but do not dictate policy.
    - The church’s influence is persuasive, not coercive.
    - Engagement is marked by humility and service, not triumphalism.
    - "The church’s calling is to serve, not to rule, in the public square." (The Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **Church and State relations** has influenced Reformed discussions on public theology, especially in contexts wary of both theocracy and secularism. His insistence on the **sovereignty of God** over all aspects of life, combined with a clear distinction between ecclesiastical and civil authority, has provided a framework for responsible Christian engagement in society. Berkouwer’s work continues to shape debates on the church’s prophetic role and its relationship to political power.
