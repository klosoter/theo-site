# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **Church and State relations** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **covenantal** perspective, emphasizing the distinct yet complementary roles of both institutions under the sovereignty of God. He maintained that while the **Church** and **State** have separate spheres of authority, both are accountable to the **moral law** and ultimately serve the advancement of God's kingdom.

- "The distinction between the church and the state is not one of opposition but of diversity of function under the one sovereign government of God." ("Principles of Conduct")

## Key Works

- "Principles of Conduct: Aspects of Biblical Ethics"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially commentary on Romans 13)
- "Christianity and Culture" (collected essays)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Spheres of Church and State**
    - Church and State are both ordained by God but have different mandates.
    - The Church is responsible for the ministry of the Word and sacraments; the State for civil justice.
    - Neither institution should usurp the authority of the other.
    - Both are subject to the **sovereignty of God** and the **moral law**.
    - "The church as an institution is not to exercise civil authority, nor is the state to administer the ordinances of the church." ("Principles of Conduct")

2. **The Moral Law as Binding on Both Institutions**
    - The **moral law** is universally binding, informing both ecclesiastical and civil ethics.
    - Civil government is obligated to uphold justice as defined by God's law.
    - The Church must call the State to account when it violates moral principles.
    - The law of God provides the ethical foundation for both Church and State.
    - "The law of God is the standard by which both church and state are to be regulated." ("Principles of Conduct")

3. **Religious Liberty and Freedom of Conscience**
    - The State must not coerce religious belief or practice.
    - The Church should be free from State interference in doctrine and worship.
    - True religious liberty is grounded in the lordship of Christ over conscience.
    - Coercion in matters of faith is contrary to the nature of the gospel.
    - "Liberty of conscience is a principle that must be maintained inviolate by both church and state." ("Principles of Conduct")

4. **Civil Authority as a Divine Ordinance**
    - Civil government is instituted by God for the maintenance of order and justice.
    - Christians are called to submit to civil authorities except when commanded to sin.
    - The legitimacy of civil authority is derived from its alignment with God's justice.
    - The State is a servant, not a rival, to God's ultimate authority.
    - "Civil government is ordained of God and is to be respected as such." (Romans commentary)

5. **The Eschatological Perspective on Church and State**
    - The distinction between Church and State is temporary, awaiting the consummation of Christ's kingdom.
    - Both institutions point forward to the final reign of Christ.
    - The Church’s mission is spiritual but has implications for all of life, including the public sphere.
    - The State’s imperfection highlights the need for the coming kingdom.
    - "The present distinction between church and state is provisional and will be transcended in the consummation of redemption." ("Principles of Conduct")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **distinct yet accountable roles** of Church and State has shaped contemporary Reformed thought on public theology and Christian ethics. His insistence on the **moral law** as the standard for both institutions continues to influence debates on religious liberty and civil justice. By grounding his views in biblical exegesis and covenant theology, Murray provided a robust framework for engaging issues at the intersection of faith and public life.
