# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive approach to **church and state relations** rooted in his understanding of **covenant theology** and the **two kingdoms doctrine**. He emphasized the distinction between the **common grace order** of the civil sphere and the **redemptive community** of the church, arguing that the state is governed by the principles of the **Noahic covenant** rather than the redemptive covenants that define the church.

- "The state is a common grace institution, not a redemptive community." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- "Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview"
- "By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism"
- "Structure of Biblical Authority"
- "God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos"
- "Comments on an Old-New Error" (WTJ 41, 1978)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - The **civil realm** and the **ecclesiastical realm** are governed by distinct covenants.
    - The state operates under the **Noahic covenant**, which is universal and non-redemptive.
    - The church is governed by the **redemptive covenants** culminating in Christ.
    - These spheres have separate authorities and purposes in God's plan.
    - "The common grace order is not the kingdom of God in its redemptive sense." ("Kingdom Prologue")

2. **Common Grace and Civil Government**
    - Civil government is a provision of **common grace** for the restraint of evil.
    - The state is not an agent of redemption but maintains order in a fallen world.
    - Moral norms for the state are grounded in the **Noahic covenant**, not in the Mosaic or new covenant.
    - The church should not seek to impose its redemptive mission on the state.
    - "Civil government is not the instrument of the kingdom of God." ("Kingdom Prologue")

3. **Religious Neutrality of the State**
    - The state is not called to enforce **religious orthodoxy** or promote a particular faith.
    - Religious coercion is excluded from the legitimate functions of civil authority.
    - The **Noahic covenant** provides a framework for justice, not for worship.
    - The church's mission is distinct from the state's mandate.
    - "The state is not a redemptive institution and must not assume the prerogatives of the church." ("Comments on an Old-New Error")

4. **Covenantal Foundations for Church and State**
    - The **Noahic covenant** establishes the legitimacy and limits of civil authority.
    - The **Abrahamic and new covenants** define the church as a redemptive community.
    - Confusing these covenants leads to theological and practical errors in church-state relations.
    - The church must maintain its identity as a pilgrim people, not a political entity.
    - "The confusion of the covenants is the root of much mischief in the church's history." ("Kingdom Prologue")

5. **Critique of Theocracy and Christendom**
    - Kline rejects attempts to revive **theocracy** or establish a **Christian state**.
    - The Mosaic theocracy was unique to Israel and fulfilled in Christ.
    - The church's calling is spiritual, not political or national.
    - Efforts to merge church and state compromise the gospel and distort biblical teaching.
    - "The church is not called to reconstruct the Mosaic theocracy, but to bear witness to Christ in the world." ("God, Heaven and Har Magedon")

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of the **two kingdoms doctrine** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on church and state, especially among those wary of theonomic or transformationalist approaches. His emphasis on the **Noahic covenant** as the foundation for civil government has provided a theological rationale for religious liberty and pluralism. Kline’s work continues to influence debates on the proper boundaries between the church’s spiritual mission and the state’s civil responsibilities. His legacy endures in both academic theology and ecclesiastical practice, particularly within confessional Reformed circles.
