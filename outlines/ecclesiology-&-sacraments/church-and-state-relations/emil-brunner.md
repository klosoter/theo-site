# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **Church and State relations** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the distinction yet necessary interaction between the two spheres. He argued that while the **Church** is governed by the **Word of God** and oriented toward the **Kingdom of God**, the **State** is a divinely ordained order responsible for justice and societal order, yet always under the judgment of the Gospel.

- "The Church and the State are two orders which, though distinct, are both under the sovereignty of God." ("The Divine Imperative")

## Key Works

- "The Divine Imperative" (1932)
- "Justice and the Social Order" (1945)
- "The Misunderstanding of the Church" (1952)
- "Christianity and Civilization" (1948)
- "The Mediator" (1934)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church and State as Distinct Orders**
   - The **Church** and **State** have separate origins and purposes within God's providence.
   - The Church is oriented toward **redemption** and the proclamation of the **Gospel**.
   - The State is tasked with maintaining **justice** and **order** in the temporal realm.
   - Both are subject to the **sovereignty of God** but must not be conflated.
   - "The Church is not the State, nor is the State the Church; each has its own God-given task." ("The Divine Imperative")

2. **The State’s Provisional Role**
   - The State is a **provisional order** established after the Fall to restrain evil.
   - It is necessary for the preservation of **social order** and **justice**.
   - The State cannot bring about the **Kingdom of God** or ultimate salvation.
   - Its authority is legitimate but always limited and accountable to God.
   - "The State is a necessary institution, but it is not the final reality for man." ("Justice and the Social Order")

3. **The Church’s Prophetic Witness**
   - The Church must maintain a **critical distance** from the State.
   - It is called to **proclaim the Gospel** and act as the conscience of society.
   - The Church should challenge the State when it acts unjustly or contrary to God’s will.
   - Its loyalty is ultimately to **Christ** and the **Kingdom of God**.
   - "The Church must speak to the State in the name of God, not as its servant but as its prophetic critic." ("The Divine Imperative")

4. **Rejection of State-Church Fusion**
   - Brunner opposed the **Constantinian synthesis** and state-controlled churches.
   - He warned that merging Church and State compromises the integrity of both.
   - The Church loses its prophetic voice when subordinated to political powers.
   - True **freedom of the Church** is essential for authentic Christian witness.
   - "Where the Church becomes the State, it ceases to be the Church." ("The Misunderstanding of the Church")

5. **Ethical Responsibility in Public Life**
   - Christians are called to participate responsibly in the public sphere.
   - Ethical action in society is guided by the **command of God** and love of neighbor.
   - The Church should encourage justice, peace, and human dignity in the State.
   - Brunner emphasized the need for **Christian engagement** without domination.
   - "The Christian is called to serve in the world, not to rule it." ("The Divine Imperative")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s nuanced articulation of **Church and State relations** influenced postwar Protestant thought, especially in Europe. His insistence on the **autonomy of the Church** and the provisional nature of the State provided a framework for resisting both secularism and theocratic tendencies. Brunner’s work continues to shape discussions on the Church’s prophetic role and its ethical responsibilities within pluralistic societies.
