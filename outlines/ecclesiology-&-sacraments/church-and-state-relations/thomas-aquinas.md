# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced vision of **Church and State relations** rooted in his synthesis of **natural law** and **divine law**. He maintained that while the **temporal power** (the State) is legitimate and necessary for human flourishing, it is ultimately subordinate to the **spiritual authority** of the Church, which directs humanity toward its supernatural end.

- "It is not the business of the secular power to determine what pertains to divine worship, but this belongs to the spiritual power." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.60, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially II-II, Q.1–Q.10, Q.60)
- De Regno (On Kingship)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Selected Letters and Disputed Questions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Natural Law as Foundation for Civil Authority**
    - Civil government is grounded in **natural law**, which is accessible to all through reason.
    - The State’s legitimacy derives from its conformity to the moral order established by God.
    - Human laws are just insofar as they reflect the principles of natural law.
    - The State’s role is to promote the **common good** in accordance with reason.
    - "Human law has the nature of law in so far as it is in accordance with right reason; and in this respect it is manifestly derived from the eternal law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.93, a.3)

2. **Subordination of Temporal to Spiritual Power**
    - The **spiritual authority** of the Church is higher than the temporal authority of the State.
    - The Church guides souls to their supernatural end, while the State orders temporal affairs.
    - When conflicts arise, the Church’s judgment prevails in matters concerning salvation.
    - The State should support, not hinder, the Church’s mission.
    - "The spiritual power has to instruct the earthly power to command what is right and just." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.60, a.6)

3. **Distinct but Cooperative Roles**
    - Church and State have distinct spheres: spiritual and temporal.
    - Cooperation is necessary for the full flourishing of human society.
    - The State provides for material well-being; the Church for spiritual well-being.
    - Proper order requires mutual respect and recognition of each domain’s limits.
    - "The two powers must be joined together, so that the spiritual may direct the temporal." (De Regno, Book I, ch.15)

4. **Legitimacy of Secular Authority**
    - Secular rulers possess real authority, not merely delegated by the Church.
    - Political power is part of God’s providential order for human society.
    - The Church does not usurp civil governance but corrects it when it deviates from justice.
    - Obedience to secular rulers is a Christian duty, unless it conflicts with divine law.
    - "Earthly power is from God, but it is subject to the spiritual power as to its end." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.60, a.6)

5. **Limits of Obedience to Civil Law**
    - Civil laws bind in conscience only when they are just and oriented to the common good.
    - Unjust laws, contrary to **natural law** or **divine law**, do not oblige obedience.
    - Christians may resist or disobey laws that command sin.
    - The Church has the right to intervene when civil laws threaten salvation.
    - "Laws may be unjust by being contrary to the divine good; such laws must not be observed." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.96, a.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **Church and State relations** profoundly shaped medieval and post-medieval political theology, providing a framework for distinguishing yet relating the **temporal** and **spiritual** powers. His integration of **natural law** into Christian thought influenced both Catholic social teaching and later Western legal traditions. Aquinas’s careful balance of cooperation and subordination continues to inform debates on religious freedom, the limits of civil authority, and the role of the Church in public life.
