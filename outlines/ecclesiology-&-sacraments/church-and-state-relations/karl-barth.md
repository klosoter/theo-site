# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s approach to **Church and State relations** is rooted in his conviction of the church’s prophetic independence from all worldly powers. He insists that the **sovereignty of God** relativizes all human authorities, including the state, and that the church’s primary allegiance is to the **Word of God** rather than to political or national interests.

- "The community of Jesus Christ is not identical with any state, nation, or people, nor is it subordinate to them." (Church Dogmatics, IV/3)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, especially IV/3 ("The Doctrine of Reconciliation")
- Community, State, and Church: Three Essays
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Against the Stream: Shorter Post-War Writings, 1946–52
- Theological Existence Today!

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereignty Over All Powers**
    - God alone is the ultimate authority, and all earthly powers are subordinate.
    - The church must always judge the state in light of the **Word of God**.
    - No state or political order can claim divine sanction or ultimate loyalty.
    - The church’s prophetic role is to remind the state of its limits.
    - "God alone is Lord. Therefore, the church cannot serve any other master." (Church Dogmatics, IV/3)

2. **The Church’s Prophetic Witness**
    - The church is called to speak truth to power, especially in times of injustice.
    - Its proclamation must not be co-opted by political ideologies.
    - The church critiques both the state’s overreach and its failures to uphold justice.
    - Barth’s opposition to Nazism exemplifies this prophetic stance.
    - "The church must always be ready to say 'No' to the state when the state contradicts the command of God." (Community, State, and Church)

3. **Separation and Mutual Responsibility**
    - Church and state are distinct but not unrelated spheres.
    - The church should not seek to govern the state, nor should the state control the church.
    - Both are accountable to God and have responsibilities toward human flourishing.
    - The church prays for and advises the state but maintains its independence.
    - "The church is not the state, but it is for the state, as it is for all men." (Church Dogmatics, IV/3)

4. **Christocentric Foundation for Ethics**
    - All ethical and political engagement must be grounded in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The church’s political witness flows from its confession of Christ as Lord.
    - Barth rejects all forms of **natural theology** as a basis for church-state relations.
    - The state’s legitimacy is measured by its conformity to Christ’s justice and mercy.
    - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God whom we have to hear and whom we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Barmen Declaration)

5. **Rejection of State Absolutism**
    - Barth opposes any ideology that elevates the state to an absolute status.
    - The church must resist totalitarianism and any attempt to silence its witness.
    - The state is a provisional order, not an ultimate reality.
    - Loyalty to the state is always conditional and secondary to loyalty to God.
    - "Where the state becomes absolute, the church must protest in the name of the living God." (Theological Existence Today!)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s theology of **Church and State** profoundly shaped 20th-century Christian resistance to totalitarian regimes, especially through his role in the **Barmen Declaration**. His insistence on the church’s independence and prophetic responsibility continues to influence ecumenical discussions and Christian engagement with politics. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the church’s public witness and the dangers of political idolatry.
