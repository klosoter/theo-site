# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl’s approach to **church and state relations** is rooted in his emphasis on the **ethical community** of the church and the historical development of **Christianity** as a social force. He distinguished the **kingdom of God** from political structures, arguing that the church’s mission is primarily moral and spiritual, not political. Ritschl rejected the notion of a **theocratic church** and advocated for a clear separation between the **spiritual authority** of the church and the **temporal authority** of the state.

- "The Church is the community which realizes the Kingdom of God in the moral order, and as such it stands in contrast to the State, which is concerned with legal order." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (1870–1874)
- Geschichte des Pietismus (History of Pietism)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)
- Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of the Historical Jesus (secondary: H.R. Mackintosh)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Church as Ethical Community**
   - The church is defined by its function as a community of moral transformation.
   - It embodies the **kingdom of God** in history through ethical action.
   - The church’s authority is spiritual, not coercive or political.
   - Membership is based on shared values, not state citizenship.
   - "The Church is the community of those who, through faith, realize the moral purpose of the kingdom of God." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Separation of Church and State**
   - The church and state have distinct roles: spiritual vs. legal order.
   - The state enforces justice; the church fosters love and moral renewal.
   - Ritschl opposes any fusion of ecclesiastical and political power.
   - The church should not wield civil authority or seek political dominance.
   - "The Church is not to be confused with the State, nor is it to rule over it." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Kingdom of God as Non-Political**
   - The **kingdom of God** is not a political regime but a moral ideal.
   - It is realized in the ethical life of the Christian community.
   - The church’s mission is to promote love, not legislate laws.
   - Political structures are secondary to the church’s spiritual aims.
   - "The Kingdom of God is a moral community, not a political institution." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Historical Development of Church and State**
   - Ritschl analyzes the evolution of church-state relations in history.
   - He critiques medieval and Reformation-era theocracies.
   - The modern era requires a new understanding of their relationship.
   - The church must adapt to changing social and political contexts.
   - "The relation of Church and State has changed with the progress of history." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Rejection of Theocratic Ideals**
   - Ritschl opposes any form of theocracy or state church.
   - He warns against the church seeking worldly power.
   - The church’s authority is persuasive, not coercive.
   - True Christianity flourishes when freed from political entanglements.
   - "The Church must not seek to dominate the State, but to influence it through moral example." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s distinction between the **spiritual mission of the church** and the **legal authority of the state** shaped modern Protestant thought on church-state separation. His emphasis on the church as an ethical community influenced later liberal theology and ecumenical movements. While criticized by some for downplaying the church’s public witness, his work remains foundational for discussions of the **kingdom of God** as a non-political, moral reality. Ritschl’s legacy endures in debates over the church’s role in society and its relationship to political power.
