# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Church and State relations** through the lens of his existential theology, emphasizing the **demythologization** of Christian proclamation and the distinction between **faith** and **history**. He argued that the **Church** is not a political institution but a community called to authentic existence in response to the **kerygma**, and thus its relationship to the **State** must be critically assessed in light of the gospel’s transcendent claims.

- "The Church does not possess a political program; it is not a society for the promotion of any particular form of government, but the community of those who have heard the call of God." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

## Key Works

- "Essays Philosophical and Theological" (especially essays on the Church and society)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology"
- "New Testament and Mythology"
- "Faith and Understanding"
- "Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Political Power**
    - The Church must interpret its role apart from mythic or sacralized views of political authority.
    - Demythologization calls for a critical stance toward all forms of **State** power.
    - The gospel is not bound to any political ideology or regime.
    - Authentic faith resists the identification of the **Kingdom of God** with earthly governments.
    - "The proclamation of the Church is not a political message but a call to decision." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

2. **Existential Decision and Responsibility**
    - The individual’s response to the **kerygma** is primary, not allegiance to the State.
    - Authentic existence involves responsible action within society, but not uncritical obedience.
    - The Church must foster personal responsibility rather than collective political agendas.
    - The existential encounter with Christ relativizes all temporal authorities.
    - "Faith is not a possession but an event—a decision that must be made anew in every situation." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Separation of Church and State Spheres**
    - The Church and State operate in distinct realms: faith and law, respectively.
    - The Church’s mission is proclamation, not governance.
    - The State is necessary for order but cannot mediate salvation.
    - The Church critiques the State when it oversteps its bounds or claims ultimate authority.
    - "The Church is not the State and must not become its servant." (Essays Philosophical and Theological)

4. **Critical Engagement with Society**
    - The Church is called to engage society prophetically, not to dominate it.
    - Christian witness involves critique of injustice and advocacy for authentic human existence.
    - The Church’s authority is rooted in the gospel, not in social or political power.
    - Engagement with the State is always provisional and subject to the demands of faith.
    - "The Christian is in the world, but not of the world, and must always stand in critical distance from it." (Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting)

5. **Transcendence of the Gospel**
    - The message of Christ transcends all political and social systems.
    - The Church’s identity is eschatological, oriented toward the ultimate future of God.
    - No earthly State can embody the fullness of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The Church must resist all attempts to absolutize political structures.
    - "The gospel is not a program for society but the announcement of God’s act in Christ." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Church and State relations** has shaped modern theological discourse by insisting on the radical distinction between the **gospel** and all forms of political power. His emphasis on **demythologization** and existential decision challenged the Church to maintain its prophetic voice and resist co-optation by the State. While some critics argue that his theology risks political quietism, his legacy endures in ongoing debates about the Church’s public role and its responsibility to critique unjust structures. Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of the Church’s identity in a secular world.
