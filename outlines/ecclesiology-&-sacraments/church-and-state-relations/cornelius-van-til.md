# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **church and state relations** through the lens of **Reformed theology** and **presuppositional apologetics**, insisting that all spheres of life, including civil government, are under the authority of **God’s revelation**. He rejected any notion of religious neutrality in the public square, arguing that both church and state are accountable to the **sovereignty of God** and must operate in accordance with **biblical principles**.

- "There is no sphere of neutrality in which the church and the state may operate independently of the Word of God." (Essays on Christian Education)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- Essays on Christian Education
- Christian Apologetics
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **No Neutrality in Public Life**
    - All institutions, including the state, are subject to **God’s authority**.
    - The idea of a religiously neutral state is a myth; all law reflects underlying **worldviews**.
    - Both church and state must recognize the **lordship of Christ** in their respective spheres.
    - The antithesis between **belief and unbelief** extends to political and social structures.
    - "There is no such thing as neutrality; every fact and every law is what it is by virtue of the plan of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Distinct but Accountable Spheres**
    - Church and state have distinct roles but are both accountable to **God’s revelation**.
    - The church’s primary task is spiritual, while the state’s is civil order, but both must honor **biblical norms**.
    - Van Til affirms the **Reformed two kingdoms** doctrine but insists both kingdoms are under Christ.
    - Neither sphere is autonomous; both are to serve God’s redemptive purposes in history.
    - "The state is not the church, nor is the church the state, but both are under God." (Essays on Christian Education)

3. **Antithesis in Society**
    - Society is marked by a fundamental **antithesis** between those who submit to God’s Word and those who do not.
    - This antithesis shapes all cultural and political engagement, including law and governance.
    - Christians must approach civic life with a **distinctively Christian worldview**.
    - The church must equip believers to engage the public square faithfully.
    - "The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian principles is basic to every area of life." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Scripture as the Ultimate Standard**
    - **Scripture** is the final authority for both church and state.
    - Civil laws and policies should be evaluated in light of **biblical revelation**.
    - Human reason and tradition are subordinate to the authority of God’s Word.
    - The church must call the state to account when it violates scriptural norms.
    - "The Bible is the standard by which all human activity, including that of the state, must be judged." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Covenantal Worldview**
    - All of life, including politics, is structured by the **covenant relationship** between God and humanity.
    - The state is a covenantal institution, responsible before God for justice and order.
    - The church bears witness to the **covenant lordship of Christ** over all nations.
    - Christians are called to promote justice and mercy in society as a reflection of God’s covenant.
    - "The covenant idea is basic to the Christian interpretation of every fact, including the state." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **church and state relations** has profoundly shaped Reformed thinking about the public square, especially through his insistence on the impossibility of neutrality and the comprehensive claims of **Christ’s lordship**. His influence is evident in the development of **presuppositional apologetics** and in the work of later theologians who emphasize the integration of faith and public life. Van Til’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the role of **biblical authority** in civil government and the necessity of a distinctively Christian engagement with culture.
