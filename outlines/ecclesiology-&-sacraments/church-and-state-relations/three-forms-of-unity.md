# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a Reformed understanding of the relationship between **church and state**. They affirm the distinct roles of **civil government** and **ecclesiastical authority**, emphasizing the state's duty to protect the church and promote justice, while maintaining the church's spiritual independence. The documents reflect a context of religious conflict, seeking both the **preservation of true doctrine** and the **peaceful coexistence** of church and civil order.

- "Moreover, it is the bounden duty of everyone, of whatever state, quality, or condition he may be, to subject himself to the magistrates, to pay tribute, to show due honor and respect to them, and to obey them in all things which are not repugnant to the Word of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 36)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Article 36
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), Lord’s Days 39 and 48
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- John Bolt, "The Three Forms of Unity and Church-State Relations" (secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Spheres of Church and State**
   - The church and state have separate God-given roles: the church for spiritual matters, the state for civil order.
   - The state must not usurp the church’s authority in doctrine, worship, or discipline.
   - The church is not to wield the sword or enforce civil penalties.
   - Both institutions are accountable to God but operate in different realms.
   - "We detest all confusion of ecclesiastical and civil powers." (Belgic Confession, Art. 36)

2. **Civil Magistrate’s Duty Toward the Church**
   - The magistrate is called to protect the church and ensure the free preaching of the gospel.
   - Civil rulers must restrain idolatry and blasphemy, as understood in the Reformed context.
   - The state should promote justice and punish evil, maintaining public order.
   - The magistrate is to act as a servant of God for the good of all, including the church.
   - "Their office is not only to have regard unto and watch for the welfare of the civil state, but also to protect the sacred ministry." (Belgic Confession, Art. 36)

3. **Obedience to Civil Authorities**
   - Christians are to honor, respect, and obey civil authorities as ordained by God.
   - Obedience is required in all things not contrary to God’s Word.
   - Resistance is permitted only when civil commands conflict with divine law.
   - The Heidelberg Catechism connects the fifth commandment to civil obedience.
   - "We must obey God rather than men." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 104)

4. **Religious Toleration and Limits**
   - The confessions were written in a context of religious persecution, yet call for justice and order.
   - They recognize the need for the state to maintain public peace among differing religious groups.
   - The state should not coerce conscience or force conversion.
   - There are limits to toleration: public blasphemy and gross immorality are subject to civil restraint.
   - "The government’s task is to remove and prevent all idolatry and false worship." (Belgic Confession, Art. 36, original version; later revisions nuanced this)

5. **Church’s Spiritual Independence**
   - The church governs its own affairs in doctrine, worship, and discipline.
   - Civil authorities may not interfere in the internal spiritual matters of the church.
   - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial or coercive.
   - The church’s weapons are spiritual: Word, sacraments, and discipline.
   - "The kingdom of Christ is a spiritual kingdom." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 123)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to **church and state relations**, influencing confessional churches in Europe, North America, and beyond. Their careful distinction between civil and ecclesiastical spheres provided a theological foundation for religious liberty and the autonomy of the church. While reflecting their historical context, these confessions continue to inform contemporary debates on the role of government in religious life and the limits of state power over the church. Their legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to both **civil obedience** and the **spiritual independence** of the church.
