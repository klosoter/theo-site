### ESSAY
Church and state relations are fundamentally a question of how the one **kingdom of God** under the exalted Christ is to be expressed through differentiated earthly institutions. The conceptual heart of the matter is jurisdiction under the **mediatorial kingship of Christ**. If Christ is Lord of all, how do we affirm both universal lordship and differentiated spheres such as the visible church and the civil polity, without collapsing them into a theocratic monism or separating them into practical dualism where public life is de facto secular? Any defense at Westminster must work out this problem in terms of **two kingdoms** that are not two lords, and **distinct vocations** that are not independent sovereignties.

Augustine is the first decisive figure. In The City of God he does not offer a modern church–state blueprint, but he profoundly reframes the issue. Rome’s sack forced him to ask what it means for Christians to be citizens of an earthly polity while belonging to a higher **civitas**. His distinction between the **City of God** and the earthly city is not simply institutional but teleological: two communities ordered by two different loves, the love of God to the contempt of self, and the love of self to the contempt of God. Yet Augustine insists that these cities are intermixed historically, sharing the same institutions, laws, and outward forms. Christians can and must participate in civil life as an expression of neighbor love. Political authority, grounded in divine providence and ordered by **natural law**, has a limited but real good: the maintenance of temporal peace and order in service of pilgrimage toward the heavenly city. 

This Augustinian schema generates internal debates examiners will probe. Does Augustine justify a full “Christendom” in which the civil magistrate enforces orthodoxy, as later medievals claimed? Or is he more modest, limiting the state to external peace? The best reading is that Augustine opens conceptual space for Christian rulers to use their authority for the support of the true religion, but always as temporal means toward a spiritual end the church alone administers through Word and sacrament. The sword can restrain heresy externally but cannot create faith. This already anticipates a key anchor: **coercion is external, faith is internal**, and therefore the magistrate’s power is real yet indirect with respect to salvation. An examiner may press: if the earthly city is ordered by disordered love, why trust any civil institution? Augustine’s answer is that God’s common grace and natural law restrain and redirect even disordered loves toward relative goods, and Christians can make principled use of these goods without identifying any polity with the City of God.

Thomas Aquinas stands as the second decisive figure, giving the classic medieval synthesis of **temporal and spiritual power**. For Thomas, grace perfects nature, not by abolishing but by elevating it. The civil realm, ordered by natural law, aims at the temporal common good: peace, justice, and virtuous life. The church, ordered by supernatural revelation, aims at the eternal good, the vision of God. Because the eternal is higher, the spiritual power of the keys is in principle superior to temporal power. The pope’s plenitudo potestatis developed in the high papacy drew on this logic to justify indirect papal jurisdiction over kings whenever temporal matters bore upon salvation.

Aquinas thus provides an internally differentiated but hierarchically ordered account of jurisdictions under one Christendom. The strength of this position is its clear integrated vision: every aspect of human life is teleologically ordered, and there is no religiously neutral political space. Natural law gives the civil ruler real competence, but because human life is ultimately ordered to supernatural beatitude, the church is the higher society. Reformed examiners, however, will press two problems. First, does this compromise **Christ’s immediate headship** over both church and state by subordinating kings to the pope? Second, does the church’s indirect power swallow the integrity of the temporal? A Reformed answer affirms with Thomas a real natural law and a positive teleology of politics, but rejects the specific institutional claim that the episcopal hierarchy, and especially the papacy, mediates Christ’s rule over temporal affairs. Christ rules the civil realm immediately by providence and law, not mediately by a clerical chain of command. This is a crucial external debate: Protestant rejection of Roman claims while retaining Augustinian and Thomistic **integralism** at the level of principle, namely that Christ’s rule encompasses all of life.

John Calvin is the central Reformed figure and must be handled with precision. Calvin shares Augustine’s duality of pilgrimage and Aquinas’s insistence that civil authority is a good ordinance of God, but he forges a distinctive **twofold government** or **two kingdoms** teaching. In the Institutes Calvin distinguishes the spiritual government of Christ in the conscience through the gospel from the political or civil government through law and magistrate. These are not two realms that divide the world into sacred and secular, but two modes of Christ’s rule. The spiritual kingdom is exercised through the ministry of the Word, sacraments, and discipline; the political kingdom through the sword, legislation, and administration of justice.

Calvin insists on both distinction and mutual service. Distinction: the church may not wield the sword, and the state may not administer Word and sacrament. Mutual service: the magistrate has a duty to protect the church, promote true religion, and uphold the external conditions for godliness. Here lies a pivotal internal Reformed debate. Some later interpreters have read Calvin as proto-liberal, limiting the magistrate to generic order. This misreads his context and explicit teaching. Calvin explicitly counts among the magistrate’s responsibilities the defense of sound doctrine and the suppression of open blasphemy and idolatry in a Christian commonwealth. Yet he carefully resists the Erastian collapse where the magistrate controls doctrine or discipline. In Geneva, ecclesiastical discipline was entrusted to the consistory, not the magistrate, though civil punishment could follow ecclesiastical censures.

An examiner will test the coherence of Calvin’s position: if the magistrate must promote true religion, what happens under conditions of pluralism or a hostile regime? The answer, drawing on Calvin’s own exile experience, is to distinguish between what the magistrate ought to do and what the church can expect in a fallen world. Under a rightly ordered Christian polity, the magistrate has duties toward the first table of the law as well as the second. Under defective polities, the church still recognizes civil authority as from God and obeys in all things lawful, while reserving the duty of **civil disobedience** when commanded to sin, and the right to seek lesser magistrates or lawful means of resistance when fundamental justice and religion are at stake. Calvin’s doctrine of lesser magistrates anticipates later constitutional checks and provides a bridge to early modern constitutional thought.

Johannes Althusius represents a crucial but often neglected development of Reformed political theology into a federal and constitutional framework. Writing in the early seventeenth century, he synthesizes classical Reformed theology, natural law, and emerging federal political structures. For Althusius, political life is essentially **symbiotic**: a layered commonwealth built from associations, from family and guild up to city and province, culminating in the realm. Authority is grounded in covenant and consent under God’s natural and revealed law. The magistrate’s calling is to preserve and promote the common life ordered to God’s glory, which includes the protection and public recognition of true religion.

Althusius sharpens three points important for church–state relations. First, he articulates the autonomy of ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the broader commonwealth. The church is not a department of the state but a distinct association with its own internal law derived from Scripture. Second, he embeds this in a broader constitutionalism: no single human office is absolute because authority is distributed through overlapping covenants. This guards against both caesaropapism, where the ruler dominates the church, and clerical domination of the state. Third, his use of **natural law** and covenant allows for principled resistance to tyranny. The people, through their lesser magistrates, can hold rulers accountable when they violate both justice and the support of true religion.

This early modern Reformed trajectory stands against multiple external rivals. Against Erastianism, as in some Anglican and Lutheran establishments, it denies that the prince is head of the church or that ecclesial discipline is a branch of state administration. Against radical Anabaptist separatism, it insists that Christians have positive duties to participate in coercive political order as a vocation from God. Against Enlightenment liberalism, which will later argue for a religiously neutral state under a supposedly autonomous public reason, it maintains that civil law inevitably reflects moral judgments and that these are answerable to God’s natural law and, in Christian polities, also to revealed truth.

Abraham Kuyper, standing at the threshold of modern pluralistic democracies, is the fifth decisive figure. He inherits Calvin and Althusius but reframes their insights for a world of non-establishment and widening religious diversity. Kuyper’s key contribution is his doctrine of **sphere sovereignty**. Human life is structured by multiple, irreducible spheres of God-given authority: church, state, family, school, business, art, science. Each has its own internal normativity under Christ’s kingship. The state’s sphere is unique but limited: to uphold public justice among these spheres, not to absorb or direct them toward a single comprehensive vision imposed from above.

Kuyper’s great strength is that he defends the **comprehensive lordship of Christ** over all of life and the inescapably religious character of every sphere, while repudiating both statist absorption and ecclesiastic domination. The church does not run the schools or the economy; the state does not run the church or the family. Instead, each sphere stands immediately under God and must order itself according to God’s ordinances. This yields a principled defense of religious liberty and institutional pluralism: the state must protect the free exercise of religious communities to organize their common life, so long as they do not violate public justice.

However, Kuyper also introduces internal Reformed tensions. Some Kuyperians interpret sphere sovereignty as functionally privatizing religion, reducing the public task of the state to procedural fairness among competing confessions. Others, pressing Kuyper’s insistence on an antithesis between belief and unbelief, advocate explicitly confessional politics that verge on a new integralism. A coherent Kuyperian-Reformed position will maintain three things: first, Christ’s lordship is universal and political life cannot be morally or religiously neutral; second, the state’s competence is limited to **temporal justice** and cannot directly aim at spiritual ends or enforce orthodoxy as such; third, the state must nonetheless give public recognition to the moral order, including the basic demands of the first table in its structural laws, even where it cannot and must not coerce belief.

These figures and trajectories converge on a defensible position for today: a Reformed, Augustinian, natural-law account of **two kingdoms** and **distinct-yet-ordered jurisdictions**. The spiritual kingdom, administered by the visible church through Word, sacrament, and discipline, aims at the eternal good and operates only with spiritual means. The civil kingdom, administered by magistrates through law and coercion, aims at the temporal common good of justice and peace and operates only with external means. Both are under the one Christ, but he rules each according to its own proper mode. The overlap between them is significant: believers are citizens of both, their vocations straddle both, and the moral law is one. Yet confusion of jurisdictions is forbidden: the church may not wield the sword, and the state may not administer spiritual censures or define doctrine.

Internally, Reformed debates center on how robustly to understand the magistrate’s duty toward the first table, and how to deploy **natural law** in a secularizing culture. Some emphasize a minimal, “rights-of-conscience” framework focusing almost exclusively on the second table. Others defend a richer vision in which states, where providentially possible, recognize Christianity as true and give it institutional protection and symbolic privilege, without coercing confession or usurping church governance. The position defended here aligns with the latter: the magistrate is morally bound to acknowledge the true God and to favor the true religion in ways consistent with the **spiritual independence** of the church and the limits of civil coercion. This does not entail criminalizing non-Christian worship per se in our circumstances, where prudence and justice toward neighbors require wide toleration. But it does reject a principled commitment to religious neutrality as a myth.

Externally, the Enlightenment liberal ideal of a state grounded solely in autonomous public reason and radical **secular neutrality** stands as the major modern challenge. The Reformed response, drawing on Augustine and Kuyper, is that there is no view from nowhere. Every regime embodies some substantive moral anthropology and ultimate ordering of goods. To claim that the state must refrain from any reference to God or transcendent moral order is not neutrality but the elevation of a particular secular creed to public dominance. The alternative is not theocratic imposition but an honest acknowledgment that laws answer to a higher standard than majority preference and that citizens may bring their comprehensive convictions, including Christian faith, into public deliberation. The state should protect the civil peace of differing confessions, but it cannot pretend that the universe is not under God.

Contemporary issues bring these debates to a head. Religious liberty is not merely the state’s concession of private worship but the recognition, on natural-law grounds, that coercion cannot produce genuine faith and that the conscience has a direct relation to God. A two-kingdoms, sphere-sovereignty framework yields a strong defense of **freedom of the church**: the state has no jurisdiction to dictate doctrine, liturgy, or internal discipline, even when public opinion deems traditional doctrine harmful. At the same time, Christians are obligated to obey the state in all matters within its competence unless it commands what God forbids or forbids what God commands. This provides principled grounds for civil disobedience in cases such as compelled participation in idolatry or denial of basic moral truths.

Examiners will likely press the problem of “Christian nationalism.” The defended position neither baptizes the nation as a new Israel nor identifies the church with any ethnic or national identity. Instead, it affirms that nations are legitimate orders of creation, answerable to God, whose rulers have duties under the moral law including public recognition of God and justice ordered to his creational norms. This is a form of **Christian political theology** that rejects both nationalist idolatry and liberal agnosticism. It allows for constitutional arrangements in which there is no formal ecclesiastical establishment, yet where Christian truth and morality have a recognized formative role in the culture and law, within the bounds of religious liberty.

Finally, doctrinal coherence across loci is essential. The doctrine of **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** means that the exalted Christ as God-man is given all authority in heaven and on earth; at the same time, classical theism insists on **divine simplicity** and the distinction between God’s absolute and mediatorial rule. This guards against collapsing providence into ecclesiastical or political programs. Eschatology reminds us that no political order will be the kingdom of God; all states are penultimate, and the church’s primary mission is not cultural dominion but faithful witness. The doctrine of Scripture constrains church–state thinking by revealing the church’s charter and the moral law, while **analogical knowledge** reminds us that our application of these norms to changing political orders will require prudent judgment, not mechanical proof-texting.

In oral defense, the candidate must be able to say: church and state are two distinct but related modes of Christ’s one rule. The church, as spiritual embassy of the heavenly city, administers means of grace and discipline unto salvation, free from civil control. The state, as servant of God in the temporal order, bears the sword to uphold justice and outward peace in accord with natural law and, where providence permits, in supportive relation to true religion. Both are under obligation to Christ, neither is ultimate, and neither may usurp the other’s jurisdiction. Our current pluralistic democracies should be engaged not by retreating into privatized piety nor by sacralizing the nation, but by bearing public witness to Christ’s lordship, working for just laws in common with others on the basis of shared moral knowledge, and preserving the church’s spiritual independence as the primary sign of the world to come.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Church–state relations concern the ordered coordination of **distinct jurisdictions** of church and civil polity under the one **mediatorial kingship of Christ**, with the church exercising spiritual authority through Word and sacrament and the state exercising temporal authority through law and coercion for justice and peace.  
- Decisive figures:  
  - Augustine: two cities distinguished by loves but intermingled; civil authority is good, limited, and ordered by **natural law** in service of the pilgrim church.  
  - Aquinas: hierarchical coordination of temporal and spiritual powers; civil common good under natural law, church ordered to supernatural end, with asserted **papal superiority**.  
  - Calvin: **two kingdoms** or twofold government; spiritual and civil modes of Christ’s rule, distinct yet mutually serving, with magistrate protecting true religion but not controlling the church.  
  - Althusius: Reformed constitutionalism; federal, symbiotic commonwealth, distributed authority, real autonomy of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and duty of rulers toward true religion.  
  - Kuyper: **sphere sovereignty**; multiple God-given spheres, state limited to public justice, robust affirmation of Christ’s lordship over all and defense of religious and institutional liberty.  
- Debates:  
  - Internal: extent of magistrate’s first-table duties; versions of Reformed **two kingdoms** vs more integral neo-Calvinist models; relation of natural law to Scripture in public ethics.  
  - External: Roman papalism and integralism; Erastian and caesaropapist subordination of church; Anabaptist separatism; Enlightenment **secular neutrality** and privatization of religion.  
  - Contemporary: religious liberty and freedom of the church; pluralism and public reason; civil disobedience; “Christian nationalism” and the legitimacy of confessional states.  
- Defended position: A Reformed, Augustinian, natural-law account in which church and state are distinct but ordered jurisdictions under Christ; the magistrate is bound to uphold justice and, where providentially possible, support true religion without usurping ecclesial powers, while the church maintains spiritual independence, proclaims the lordship of Christ over all, and engages political life without identifying the kingdom of God with any regime.  
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - How do two kingdoms not create a sacred–secular split? They distinguish modes of Christ’s one rule, not two lords or value systems; the moral law and Christ’s authority are common to both.  
  - Does your view justify establishment? In principle, yes in a modest, non-Erastian form that honors the church’s autonomy and conscience, but prudence may counsel non-establishment under current conditions.  
  - Is the state religiously neutral? No; all law embodies moral judgments answerable to God, though the state must protect liberty of conscience and not coerce faith.  
  - When is civil disobedience warranted? When the state commands what God forbids or forbids what God commands, especially regarding worship, proclamation of the gospel, and basic moral duties.  
  - What is the church’s political task? To preach and embody the whole counsel of God, form consciences, and send members into public vocations, not to wield the sword or run the state.
