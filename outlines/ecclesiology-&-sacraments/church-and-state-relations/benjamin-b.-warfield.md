# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the question of **Church and State relations** from a classic **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the distinction between the **spiritual mission of the church** and the **civil authority** of the state. He argued that while both institutions are ordained by God, their spheres must remain distinct, with the church focusing on the proclamation of the **gospel** and the state maintaining **order and justice** in society.

- "The church is not a civil institution, and the state is not a spiritual institution; each has its own sphere, and neither may trespass upon the other." ("The Foundations of Social Order")

## Key Works

- "The Foundations of Social Order"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- "The Right of the State to Educate" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Constitution of the Church" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Church: Its Nature, Authority, and Mission" (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Spheres of Church and State**
    - The church and state are both divinely instituted but serve different purposes.
    - The church is tasked with spiritual oversight, while the state governs civil affairs.
    - Confusion of these roles leads to corruption in both institutions.
    - Warfield draws on **Westminster Confession** principles to support this separation.
    - "The church is not the state, nor is the state the church; each must keep to its own God-given sphere." ("The Westminster Assembly and Its Work")

2. **Spiritual Mission of the Church**
    - The church’s primary role is the proclamation of the **gospel** and administration of the **sacraments**.
    - Social and political engagement must be subordinate to spiritual priorities.
    - The church should not wield civil power or enforce religious conformity.
    - Warfield warns against the church becoming an instrument of political agendas.
    - "The church’s power is spiritual, not civil; it persuades, not coerces." ("The Constitution of the Church")

3. **Authority of the Civil Magistrate**
    - The state is ordained by God to maintain **order, justice, and peace**.
    - Civil magistrates are accountable to God but not to the church for their civil duties.
    - The state should protect religious liberty and not interfere in ecclesiastical matters.
    - Warfield affirms the legitimacy of civil government within its proper bounds.
    - "The magistrate is God’s minister for good, but not for the propagation of the faith." ("The Right of the State to Educate")

4. **Religious Liberty**
    - Warfield defends the right of conscience and freedom of worship.
    - The state must not establish or privilege any particular church.
    - Coercion in matters of faith is contrary to the gospel and Reformed tradition.
    - Religious liberty is a safeguard for both church and state integrity.
    - "Liberty of conscience is the inalienable right of every man, and the state must respect it." ("The Foundations of Social Order")

5. **Theological Basis in Reformed Confessions**
    - Warfield grounds his views in the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and Reformed tradition.
    - He interprets the confessions as teaching institutional separation, not hostility.
    - The confessions affirm both the legitimacy of civil government and the autonomy of the church.
    - Warfield sees the Reformed tradition as a bulwark against both Erastianism and clericalism.
    - "The Westminster divines were careful to distinguish the powers of church and state, each under God." ("The Westminster Assembly and Its Work")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **distinct spheres** of church and state has shaped American Presbyterian and broader Reformed approaches to public theology. His insistence on the **spiritual mission of the church** and the protection of **religious liberty** continues to influence debates on the church’s role in society. Warfield’s legacy endures in discussions of church-state relations, especially among those who seek to maintain fidelity to Reformed confessional standards while engaging the modern world.
