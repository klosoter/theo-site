# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a nuanced theology of **church and state relations**, emphasizing the divinely ordained distinction between the **spiritual government** of the church and the **civil government** of the state. He maintained that both institutions are accountable to God, with the church entrusted with spiritual matters and the state responsible for civil order, each possessing its own legitimate authority.

- "There is a twofold government in man, and twofold jurisdiction: one spiritual, by which the conscience is instructed in piety and in reverencing God; the other, political, by which man is educated for the duties of humanity and citizenship." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 4.20.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book IV, chapters 11–20)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2
- Ecclesiastical Ordinances (1541)
- Selected Letters (especially correspondence with political leaders)
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Kingdoms Distinction**
    - Calvin distinguished between the **spiritual government** of the church and the **civil government** of the state.
    - Each kingdom has its own sphere of authority, ordained by God for distinct purposes.
    - The church governs through the **Word and sacraments**, while the state governs through law and coercion.
    - Neither sphere should usurp the role of the other, though both are accountable to God.
    "There is a twofold government in man... one spiritual... the other, political." (Institutes, 4.20.1)

2. **Role of the Civil Magistrate**
    - The magistrate is a **minister of God** for the public good, tasked with upholding justice and peace.
    - Civil rulers are to protect the church and promote true religion, but not to administer spiritual matters.
    - Magistrates must act within the bounds of **God’s law** and are subject to divine judgment.
    - The state may enforce external discipline but cannot bind consciences.
    "The magistrate does not take away from the church her own jurisdiction." (Institutes, 4.11.8)

3. **Church Autonomy in Spiritual Matters**
    - The church possesses **spiritual authority** over doctrine, worship, and discipline.
    - Ecclesiastical power is exercised through **elders** and **church courts**, not civil authorities.
    - Excommunication and church discipline are reserved for the church, not the state.
    - The church must resist state interference in matters of faith and conscience.
    "No man is to be judged by civil authority for doctrine, but by the church." (Institutes, 4.11.7)

4. **Mutual Support and Distinct Roles**
    - Church and state should **cooperate** for the common good, each supporting the other’s proper function.
    - The state may assist the church in external matters such as property and protection.
    - The church prays for and counsels civil authorities, urging them toward justice and godliness.
    - Both institutions are accountable to God and serve His glory in their respective domains.
    "The church does not claim for herself what is proper to the magistrate, nor does the magistrate invade what is given to the church." (Institutes, 4.11.8)

5. **Resistance to Tyranny**
    - Calvin allowed for **resistance** to ungodly rulers under certain conditions, especially through lesser magistrates.
    - Obedience to civil authority is required unless it conflicts with obedience to God.
    - The people may appeal to lower magistrates if the supreme ruler becomes tyrannical.
    - The ultimate allegiance of believers is to **God’s kingdom** above all earthly powers.
    "We are subject to the men who rule over us, but subject only in the Lord." (Institutes, 4.20.32)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **church and state relations** profoundly shaped the development of **Reformed political theology** and influenced later Protestant views on religious liberty and civil government. His two kingdoms framework provided a basis for distinguishing spiritual and temporal authority, impacting the governance of Geneva and later Presbyterian polity. Calvin’s thought laid groundwork for modern discussions of the separation of church and state, while also inspiring debates about the proper limits of civil and ecclesiastical power.
