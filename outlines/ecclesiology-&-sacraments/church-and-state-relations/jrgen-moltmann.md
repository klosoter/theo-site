# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **church and state relations** through the lens of **eschatology**, emphasizing the church's role as a sign of the coming **Kingdom of God** and a witness to **public justice**. He critiques both state absolutism and ecclesial withdrawal, advocating for a **public theology** in which the church actively participates in societal transformation while maintaining its prophetic distinctiveness.

- "The church must not become the religious department of the state, nor should it withdraw into the private sphere, but must be a critical and creative force in public life." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

## Key Works

- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- God for a Secular Society (1999)
- Ethics of Hope (2012)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of the Church**
   - The church exists as a sign and anticipation of the **Kingdom of God**.
   - Its mission is shaped by hope in the coming transformation of all things.
   - The church critiques both secular and religious attempts to absolutize present realities.
   - Eschatology empowers the church to resist unjust structures in society.
   - "The church is the community of hope for the world, not for itself alone." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Prophetic Witness in Society**
   - The church is called to speak truth to power, challenging injustice.
   - It must maintain independence from state control to preserve its prophetic voice.
   - Prophetic witness involves both critique and constructive engagement.
   - The church’s public role is grounded in the gospel’s call for **justice** and peace.
   - "The church must be the conscience of society, not its chaplain." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Public Theology and Political Responsibility**
   - The church is responsible for engaging in public discourse on ethical and political issues.
   - **Faith** is not a private affair but has implications for social and political life.
   - The church should advocate for **human rights**, peace, and the dignity of all people.
   - Christian hope motivates active participation in shaping a more just society.
   - "Christian faith is public faith, and the church is a public institution." (God for a Secular Society)

4. **Critique of Christendom and State Absolutism**
   - Moltmann rejects the fusion of church and state characteristic of **Christendom**.
   - He warns against the church legitimizing state power or ideology.
   - The state must not co-opt the church for its own purposes.
   - True partnership requires mutual critique and respect for distinct roles.
   - "The church must not be the handmaid of the state, nor the state the master of the church." (Experiences in Theology)

5. **Solidarity with the Marginalized**
   - The church’s public witness is measured by its solidarity with the oppressed.
   - Advocacy for **justice** and liberation is central to its mission.
   - The church must align itself with movements for social transformation.
   - Solidarity is rooted in the crucified and risen Christ’s identification with the suffering.
   - "Where the church stands with the poor and the oppressed, it stands with Christ." (Ethics of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary **public theology** and discussions of the church’s role in society. His eschatological vision challenges both ecclesial withdrawal and uncritical accommodation to state power, inspiring churches to engage in prophetic advocacy for justice. Moltmann’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogues, liberation theology, and Christian approaches to political engagement, emphasizing the church’s responsibility to embody hope and transformation in the world.
