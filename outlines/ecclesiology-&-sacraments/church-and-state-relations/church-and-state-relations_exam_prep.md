### ESSAY
Church and state relations concern the differentiated yet coordinated ordering of two divine ordinances, each under the universal kingship of Christ, each ordered to a distinct proximate end, each governed by distinct means. The church is a spiritual polity constituted by Word and sacrament, ministerially governed by presbyters and deacons, ordered to the supernatural end of communion with God. The state is a civil polity constituted by law and coercion, governed by magistrates, ordered to the temporal common good of justice, peace, and outward righteousness. The core conceptual axis is jurisdiction under God. The question is not whether Christ reigns but how his rule is mediated. The Reformed tradition insists on **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** over the church in a proper and redemptive sense, and on his providential rule over the civil order in a common and preservative sense. This differentiation answers two perennial temptations: that the state assume cura animarum, and that the church wield the sword. The proper coordination of these two powers requires an account of ends, laws, and forms of authority. Ends distinguish the civil peace and the beatific communion. Law distinguishes coercive positive law from ministerial discipline grounded in the gospel. Authority distinguishes jurisdictional competence, limiting each power to its assigned office. Underlying these is the claim that civil rulers are accountable to **natural law** known by **analogical knowledge** in creation and heightened by conscience, while the church is normed by special revelation.

Augustine is the first decisive figure because he reframed the Western imagination about politics by relocating it within an eschatological and moral topography. In City of God he distinguishes two cities by two loves, the City of God whose end is the enjoyment of God and the earthly city whose end is a precarious peace ordered by love of self. This is not the distinction of two institutions, but two orders of love and ultimate ends that overlap in history. Augustine’s conceptual breakthrough never collapses the earthly peace into the heavenly, yet he refuses to despise that peace. He articulates an account of civil authority as a postlapsarian remedy and as a genuine good under providence, addressing the Roman charge that Christianity undermined the empire. The lexicon that matters here is his layered account of peace: domestic, civic, and eternal. The earthly peace is a relative harmony ordered to the penultimate good of justice. The church, as a pilgrim people, uses this peace to worship and witness. The result is a politics of penultimacy. Augustine therefore can justify civil coercion to maintain external order and even at points to correct the recalcitrant, as in his later defense of using coercion against Donatists. His arguments appeal to love rightly ordered, to the moral responsibility to restrain harm, and to the fact that some afflictions are medicinal. This legacy is ambivalent for later debates. On one hand, Augustine arms the tradition against sacral empire by specifying the city’s horizon, and he offers the grammar of cooperation without confusion of ends. On the other hand, his acceptance of limited coercion in religion will be pressed by later integralists. When examiners ask whether Augustine justifies religious coercion, the answer is that he permits it under severe prudential constraints and in a context where the civil order assumes the unity of the commonwealth and the church. But the controlling insight is that the church’s end is not the state’s end, and that history is marked by a mixed body and therefore necessitates toleration for the sake of relative peace.

Thomas Aquinas is decisive because he provides the most precise articulation of law, ends, and the hierarchy of powers in Christendom. In the Summa Theologiae he explains **natural law** as the participation of rational creatures in the eternal law. Civil law determines the general precepts to specific circumstances for the **common good**. Aquinas holds that the final end of man is the vision of God, which transcends the capacity of temporal authority. The temporal power can order citizens to the civil virtues, to justice and peace, but only the spiritual power dispenses grace and orders to beatitude. This teleological hierarchy grounds the medieval claim that the temporal power is implicitly subordinate to the spiritual in matters touching salvation, a view represented in the doctrine of potestas indirecta. The church does not wield the sword directly, yet it can judge when the temporal order frustrates the ultimate end and can demand correction. Aquinas’s posture is not Erastian, because he does not subordinate the church to the prince, nor is it caesaro-papist, because each power is genuine in its own order. Rather, there is an integrated order of nature and grace. Aquinas’s theory allows a form of **establishment** insofar as rulers protect and promote the true religion for the sake of the civil common good, on the ground that even temporal felicity is incomplete without right worship. This account is coherent within his metaphysic of participation and his ecclesiology. The modern critic presses, however, whether such an arrangement can be just in plural societies and whether it respects **religious liberty** as a moral duty not to coerce faith. Aquinas himself allows for prudential toleration of false religions when suppressing them would cause greater evils. The contemporary Reformed position defended here learns from Aquinas the grammar of law, teleology, and the civil **common good**, and his insistence that authority is ordered to ends beyond the will of rulers. It does not adopt potestas indirecta or confessional **establishment**, not because grace is privatized, but because under the **Noahic covenant** Christ rules the civil realm in a common mode, and because coercion in matters of worship contradicts the evangelical form of faith.

John Calvin is the decisive Reformation figure because he consolidates the classic Protestant distinction of powers without surrendering positive civil responsibility. In Institutes book four he distinguishes between the spiritual government of the church and the civil government of the commonwealth. The spiritual governance is exercised by ministers who wield the keys, bind and loose, and discipline unto repentance. The civil government secures external peace and punishes evildoers. Both are ordained by God and under Christ. Calvin refuses clerical supremacy and also refuses civil supremacy over the church. In Geneva he labored to establish ecclesiastical discipline through the consistory and insisted it not be subsumed by the council. He did think the magistrate bears responsibility for both tables of the law, guarding piety as well as justice, but the means of that guardianship are differentiated. The magistrate protects the church’s ministry, suppresses public blasphemy, and upholds the Lord’s Day, but he does not preach, administer sacraments, or control ordination. He also articulates the doctrine of the lesser magistrate to resist tyranny. Calvin’s significance for Westminster examiners is twofold. First, the twofold government under Christ is foundational for **two kingdoms** teaching in Protestantism. Second, it spawns internal debate about the extent of civil care for the first table. The original Westminster Confession charged the magistrate to maintain piety and to suppress blasphemies. The American revision in the nineteenth century deleted this language and recognized the equality of all religious denominations under the civil law. The Reformed tradition thus wrestled with how to deploy Calvin’s principles in a plural republic. The position defended here argues that Calvin’s core principle of differentiated jurisdiction is nonnegotiable, whereas his establishmentarian prudence is not. The magisterial insight that the church cannot be placed under the civil sword stands; the prudential question of how civil authorities should address public religious wrongs is answered today by affirming free exercise and non-establishment, not because truth is indifferent, but because coercion corrupts worship and endangers both church and state.

John Locke is decisive not because his metaphysic is accepted, but because he codifies the liberal settlement concerning **religious liberty** and civil competence that shapes modern polities. In A Letter Concerning Toleration Locke argues that the end of civil society is the protection of civil interests, life, liberty, and property, not the salvation of souls. Faith cannot be compelled by the sword. The church is a voluntary society, and the state should not adjudicate doctrine. Locke’s framework restricts the competence of the magistrate to civil peace. There are limits in Locke, including his refusal of toleration to atheists and Catholics in his context, but the structural claim is decisive. For Westminster examiners wary of liberal foundationalism, the question is whether the Reformed tradition can affirm civil non-coercion in matters of worship without adopting secular neutrality. The answer defended here is yes. One can adopt the Lockean restriction of coercive jurisdiction while rejecting his anthropology and epistemology. The ground is not social contract but **natural law** under **common grace** and the **Noahic covenant**, which ordain the civil sword to preserve justice and life for all image bearers. Thus, the Reformed basis for **religious liberty** is theological, not pragmatic, and it resists the reduction of moral discourse to private faith. This appropriation takes what Locke got right about limits on coercion while refusing the privatization of ultimate convictions in public reasoning.

Abraham Kuyper is decisive because he reframes Reformed political theology for modern plural democracies with his doctrines of **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace**. In the Stone Lectures and his political practice in the Netherlands he argued that God ordained distinct spheres of human life, each with its own law and internal normativity under God. Church, family, school, business, art, science, and the state have their own sovereignty under the kingship of Christ. The state’s sovereignty is unique because it bears coercion and is ordered to public justice among spheres. The church’s sovereignty is spiritual and ministerial. **Sphere sovereignty** resists both the state’s absorption of all life and the church’s control of civil affairs. Paired with **common grace**, Kuyper grounds cooperation among confessions for the civil good while honoring religious and institutional pluralism. In practice, this yielded pillarization, where parallel institutions flourished under public law, including confessional schools financed by the state on equal footing. Kuyper does not advocate secular neutrality; he insists on confessional candor and on a public square where worldviews contest without state monopoly. The value for contemporary Reformed thinking is that it provides a thicker grammar than bare non-establishment. It tells us why the state should not micromanage ecclesial life and why ecclesial authorities should not wield the sword; and it gives a positive account of the state’s task to secure justice among institutions by **subsidiarity** and restraint. When modern governments and corporations accumulate quasi-sovereign power in education, health, and communication, Kuyper’s doctrine highlights the need to protect mediating institutions from both state and market domination. When examiners push on whether **sphere sovereignty** contradicts **two kingdoms**, the answer is that they are complementary: two kingdoms names the redemptive distinction between common and special rule of Christ, while sphere sovereignty specifies the creational differentiation within the common realm. Together they check both integralisms and privatizations.

With these five figures we can assemble the conceptual core and state the position. The position is a differentiated, non-establishmentarian, principled pluralist model grounded in **natural law**, the **Noahic covenant**, and **Christ’s mediatorial kingship**. Differentiation means that church and state are distinct institutions with distinct competence, means, and ends. Non-establishment means the state neither privileges nor funds a confessional church as such, nor coerces doctrine or worship. Principled pluralism means the state protects free exercise for a diversity of religious communities consistent with public justice, and permits those communities to bring their convictions to bear in public reasoning. The theological ground is threefold. First, **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** is proper to the church, which is his body, gathered by Word and sacrament, governed by elders, disciplined without the sword. Second, civil government is ordained under the **Noahic covenant** as a common institution for humanity to restrain violence, secure justice, and preserve the conditions for cultural life until the end. Third, **natural law** obligates rulers to the civil **common good** and is accessible to all by **analogical knowledge** of created order, though conscience is impaired by sin and requires civil and ecclesial formation. This framework honors Augustine’s penultimacy, Aquinas’s teleology and law, Calvin’s twofold government, Locke’s limits on coercion, and Kuyper’s differentiation of spheres. It rejects Erastianism, which subordinates the church to the state; rejects Roman integralism, which subordinates the state to the church’s jurisdiction in temporal matters; rejects Hobbesian absolutism, which swallows both into sovereign will; and rejects secularist privatization, which pretends religion is merely private and excludes it from public reason.

Internal Reformed debates sharpen this position. Establishmentarian strands in early modern Reformed thought, including the original Westminster Confession’s charge to suppress blasphemies, assumed a confessional commonwealth and a unity of church and people that does not obtain in modern plural societies. The American Presbyterian revision of the confession removed establishmentarian language and affirmed the independence and freedom of the church in relation to the state. Theonomy disputes whether the civil law of Israel supplies the direct norm for modern states. The position defended here denies that Mosaic judicials as such bind modern magistrates, while insisting that **natural law** and **general equity** norm civil judgment. Radical two kingdoms currents fear any appeal to natural law or public theology as compromising the spiritual mission of the church. The response is that the church as institute refrains from binding consciences on prudential policy, but she must teach the **natural law** that God wrote on the heart and admonish magistrates when they suppress justice. Kuyperian currents at times blur the special and common rule of Christ or inflate cultural mandate into a theocratic impulse. The response is to keep **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** anchored in the church’s ministry while affirming **common grace** and **sphere sovereignty** for civil life.

External debates sharpen it further. Roman Catholic integralism proposes that civil authority must be directed to the true religion and that the church exercises an indirect power over the state in temporal matters that affect salvation. The response is that this confuses ends and forms of mediation in the new covenant. The state cannot pursue the supernatural end by coercion without corrupting worship. Augustine’s two cities caution against any project of sacral empire. Aquinas’s own prudential toleration gently undermines maximalism. Erastian frameworks, from Henry Erastus to Hobbes, subject the church’s ministry to civil will to preserve unity and prevent disorder. The response is Calvin’s principle of differentiated powers under Christ. The church cannot give up her keys and discipline without ceasing to be a church. Enlightenment liberalism, especially in its Rawlsian register, demands that citizens justify political positions in terms allegedly accessible to all, policing religious reasons out of the public square. The response is that **natural law** supplies a shared moral grammar, but citizens may speak from their deepest convictions, and coercive exclusion of religious reasoning is itself a substantive metaphysical imposition. The state should protect free exercise and free speech, adjudicating civil peace, not curating metaphysical neutrality.

Contemporary stress tests demand application. First, religious liberty and nondiscrimination conflicts require a principle: the state must protect both equal dignity and institutional integrity. Under **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, mediating institutions like churches, schools, and charities should be granted maximal autonomy to govern their internal life according to their doctrines, especially in selection of ministers and the regulation of sacraments, with reasonable accommodations in commerce where possible. The magistrate has a duty of even-handed justice but lacks competence to redefine doctrinal identity. Second, pandemic restrictions exposed the competence boundaries. The civil magistrate bears responsibility to protect life under the **Noahic covenant**. Temporary, neutral, and necessary restrictions on assembly for public health may be legitimate, but the state cannot declare worship nonessential, nor may it persistently burden religious assembly more than comparable activity. The church must practice prudence and love of neighbor, yet retains the freedom to gather when civil action becomes discriminatory. Third, platform governance and technological control by private corporations raise questions about new quasi-sovereigns. Kuyper’s **sphere sovereignty** suggests that communications platforms should be recognized as institutions with public significance and thus subject to law that protects free expression and pluralism while preventing direct state capture. The general rule is not state takeover, but legal frameworks that prevent the concentration of power that suffocates mediating institutions. Fourth, the rise of Christian nationalism and postliberal integralism provokes pressure to return to confessional establishment. The Reformed answer should be that Christian moral witness in public is good and necessary, that legal orders inevitably reflect moral visions, but that the state cannot confess on behalf of citizens nor coerce faith without harming the church and violating **religious liberty**. The magistrate can be a **nursing father** in a limited sense, protecting the free exercise of religion, securing the sanctity of life and family, and honoring the weekly rest day in general labor law for humane reasons, while not privileging one denomination. Finally, global persecution of Christians demands clarity: the state’s task is not to compel religion but to protect it. A principled pluralist regime can argue for this internationally without importing imperial theologies.

This model coheres across loci. In Christology and soteriology, **Christ’s mediatorial kingship** is exercised through the Word and Spirit in the church, not through civil coercion. In **federal theology**, the **Noahic covenant** grounds a common civil order across peoples, while the new covenant creates a pilgrim church. In ecclesiology, the spiritual jurisdiction of the keys is irreducible and independent, while in anthropology and hamartiology the reality of sin requires civil coercion to restrain evil. In eschatology, the already and not yet forbids premature sacralization of politics and also forbids despair. The doctrine of **natural law** supplies common moral knowledge, though damaged by sin, and guards against both theonomy and moral skepticism.

A final set of examiner challenges can be answered briefly. Is the state metaphysically neutral in this model. No. The state is a moral agent under God and must acknowledge accountability to him, but its jurisdiction is limited to the civil **common good**. Does this model reduce the first table to private piety. No. It affirms that true worship is the highest good but denies that coercion produces it. It allows for public acknowledgment of God and for humane laws consonant with the moral law, without penal establishments. Does **two kingdoms** entail quietism. No. The church proclaims the whole counsel of God, including the moral law, and Christians act in public as citizens. The restraint is on the institute of the church binding consciences on prudential policy. Does **sphere sovereignty** license cultural capture. No. It differentiates institutional competencies, thereby protecting the church from politicization and the state from sacralization. Is **religious liberty** simply liberal ideology. No. It is grounded in creation and the gospel, the duty to worship God freely, and the incompetence of the civil sword to effect faith. How does this model engage Rawlsian public reason. It offers **natural law** arguments while refusing to censor theological speech.

The effect of integrating Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Locke, and Kuyper is not eclecticism but a chastened confidence. Augustine and Aquinas supply the grammar of ends and law. Calvin secures ecclesial integrity and civil limits under Christ. Locke marks the civil limits of coercion in a way that can be theologically owned. Kuyper provides a structural account for modern pluralism. The defended position steers between the Scylla of integralism and the Charybdis of secularism. It treats the magistrate as a limited **nursing father**, honors **religious liberty**, forbids **establishment**, and deploys **natural law** and **common grace** as the shared grammar of civic life. It gives the church the freedom to be the church, and it gives the state the nobility of doing justice without pretending to save.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Church and state relations are the differentiated ordering of spiritual and civil jurisdictions under Christ, with the church, under **Christ’s mediatorial kingship**, ordered to salvation by Word and sacrament, and the state, under the **Noahic covenant**, ordered to the civil **common good** by **natural law** and coercive justice.
- Decisive figures and stance:
  - Augustine: two cities by two loves, earthly peace as penultimate good, limited coercion for order, church as pilgrim using civil peace.
  - Aquinas: teleological hierarchy of ends, **natural law**, potestas indirecta, prudential toleration within a qualified **establishment**.
  - Calvin: **two kingdoms** or two governments under Christ, ecclesial discipline independent of magistrate, civil care for both tables with differentiated means.
  - Locke: limits of civil coercion, church as voluntary society, **religious liberty** grounded in the ends of civil society.
  - Kuyper: **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace**, principled pluralism, protection of mediating institutions by **subsidiarity**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: establishment versus disestablishment in Reformed history, theonomy versus **natural law**, Kuyperian differentiation versus radical two kingdoms.
  - External: Catholic integralism and Erastian subordination, Hobbesian absolutism, secular liberal neutrality and Rawlsian public reason.
  - Contemporary: SOGI conflicts and institutional integrity, pandemic restrictions on worship, platform governance, Christian nationalism and postliberal integralism.
- Defended position: a differentiated, non-establishmentarian, principled pluralist model where the magistrate as limited **nursing father** protects free exercise and public justice under **natural law** and **common grace**, while the church retains spiritual authority and public witness without the sword.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does this model deny first-table concern. No, it denies coercion of worship while upholding public acknowledgment of God and moral law.
  - How do two kingdoms and sphere sovereignty relate. They are complementary, one redemptive and one creational.
  - Is religious liberty a liberal concession. No, it is grounded theologically in creation and the gospel’s form.
  - What restrains moral relativism in public. **Natural law** and the **Noahic covenant** provide shared norms for civil justice.
  - How is the church protected from the state. By jurisdictional limits, free exercise, and the independence of Word, sacrament, and discipline.
