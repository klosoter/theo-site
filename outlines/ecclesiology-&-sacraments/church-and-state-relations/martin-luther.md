# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s understanding of **church and state relations** is grounded in his doctrine of the **Two Kingdoms**, which distinguishes between the spiritual authority of the church and the temporal authority of the state. He maintained that while both realms are ordained by God, they serve distinct purposes: the church governs through the **Word and Sacraments**, while the state wields the **sword** to maintain civil order and justice.

- "God has ordained two governments: the spiritual, by which the Holy Spirit produces Christians and righteous people under Christ, and the secular, which restrains the un-Christian and wicked so that they are obliged to keep the peace outwardly." ("Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed")

## Key Works

- "Temporal Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed" (1523)
- "On Secular Authority" (1523)
- "Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation" (1520)
- "The Freedom of a Christian" (1520)
- Martin Brecht, *Martin Luther: Shaping and Defining the Reformation* (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms**
   - God rules the world through two distinct realms: the **spiritual kingdom** (church) and the **temporal kingdom** (state).
   - The church is governed by the **gospel**, not by coercive power.
   - The state is responsible for maintaining external peace and justice through law and force.
   - The two kingdoms must not be confused or merged, though both are under God's sovereignty.
   - "Christ’s government does not extend over outward, temporal matters, but only over the conscience." ("Temporal Authority")

2. **Limits of Secular Authority**
   - Secular rulers have no jurisdiction over matters of **faith** or the **conscience**.
   - The state must not compel belief or interfere with the preaching of the Word.
   - Christians are to obey secular authorities in civil matters unless commanded to sin.
   - The state’s power is limited to external, temporal affairs.
   - "For over the soul God can and will let no one rule but Himself." ("Temporal Authority")

3. **Role of the Christian in Society**
   - Christians are citizens of both the spiritual and temporal kingdoms.
   - They are called to obey civil authorities as a matter of **vocation** and service to neighbor.
   - Resistance to unjust rulers is permitted only in cases of clear conflict with God’s commands.
   - Christian freedom does not abolish civil obligations.
   - "A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all." ("The Freedom of a Christian")

4. **Church’s Spiritual Authority**
   - The church’s authority is exercised through the **Word**, **preaching**, and **sacraments**.
   - The church must not wield the sword or exercise civil power.
   - Spiritual leaders are to shepherd consciences, not govern external affairs.
   - The purity of the church depends on its separation from coercive, worldly power.
   - "The church has no power except to forgive sins and to preach the gospel." ("Temporal Authority")

5. **Divine Ordination of Civil Government**
   - Civil government is established by God for the preservation of order and justice.
   - Rulers are God’s servants, accountable to Him for their stewardship.
   - Christians should pray for and support just rulers.
   - The legitimacy of government does not depend on the personal faith of rulers.
   - "All authority comes from God, and the sword is God’s, not the ruler’s, who is but its bearer." ("Temporal Authority")

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of the **Two Kingdoms** profoundly shaped Protestant thought on the relationship between church and state, providing a theological basis for the distinction between spiritual and civil authority. His views influenced later developments in religious liberty and the limitation of state power over conscience. While his ideas were sometimes adapted or contested by later Reformers, Luther’s framework remains foundational for understanding the Protestant approach to church and state relations.
