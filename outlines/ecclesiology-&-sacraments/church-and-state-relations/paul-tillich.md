# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Church and State relations** through his broader framework of **theonomy**, **autonomy**, and **heteronomy**, emphasizing the dialectical relationship between **religious symbols** and **political structures**. He argued that the **Church** should act as the "bearer of the Spiritual Community," critiquing both the subordination of the Church to the State and the Church's direct control over political affairs.

- "The church must not become the servant of the state, nor must it attempt to dominate the state; it must remain the prophetic critic of all social realities." ("The Protestant Era")

## Key Works

- "The Protestant Era" (1948)
- "Love, Power, and Justice" (1954)
- "Systematic Theology," Volumes 1–3 (1951–1963)
- "Political Expectation" (1971)
- "The Socialist Decision" (1933)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theonomy as the Ideal Relation**
    - Advocates a **theonomous** society where divine principles inform both Church and State without conflation.
    - Rejects both **heteronomy** (external law imposed) and **autonomy** (self-law) as insufficient for genuine justice.
    - Sees theonomy as a dynamic, not static, relationship that preserves the prophetic voice of the Church.
    - Theonomy enables the Church to critique the State without seeking political domination.
    - "Theonomy is the form in which the divine law is actualized in the self-law of the spirit." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

2. **Prophetic Critique of Political Structures**
    - The Church must maintain a critical distance from all political powers.
    - Its role is to provide **prophetic judgment** rooted in ultimate concern, not partisan interests.
    - The Church exposes the idolatry of elevating the State to ultimate significance.
    - This critique is ongoing, not a one-time intervention.
    - "The church is the guardian of the ultimate concern and must judge every political reality in its light." ("The Protestant Era")

3. **Symbolic Mediation of Ultimate Concerns**
    - Both Church and State operate with **symbols** that mediate meaning and order.
    - The Church’s symbols point to the **Kingdom of God**, transcending temporal political arrangements.
    - The State’s symbols can become idolatrous if absolutized.
    - The Church must continually reinterpret its symbols to address changing political realities.
    - "Every religious symbol is subject to the judgment of the ultimate, and so are the symbols of the state." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 1")

4. **Autonomy and the Limits of Secular Authority**
    - Recognizes the legitimacy of **autonomous** political structures in a secular age.
    - Warns against the Church seeking direct political power or the State enforcing religious conformity.
    - Autonomy is valuable but must be open to critique from the standpoint of ultimate meaning.
    - The secular State is not neutral but shaped by underlying spiritual forces.
    - "Autonomy is not the enemy of faith, but its necessary correlate in the secular sphere." ("The Protestant Era")

5. **Eschatological Tension and Historical Realism**
    - The Church lives in tension between the **already** and the **not yet** of the Kingdom.
    - It must avoid utopianism in its political engagement.
    - The Church’s witness is both eschatological and historically engaged.
    - Political structures are provisional and subject to transformation.
    - "The church is the anticipation of the new reality, but it is never its fulfillment." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **Church and State relations** has influenced both theological and political discourse, especially in contexts wrestling with secularization and the prophetic role of religion in society. His emphasis on **theonomy** and the Church’s critical distance from political power has shaped ecumenical and mainline Protestant thinking. Tillich’s dialectical method continues to inform debates on the proper boundaries and mutual responsibilities of religious and political communities. His legacy endures in discussions about the Church’s prophetic voice amid modern pluralism.
