# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen advocated for a principled distinction between **church and state**, emphasizing the necessity of religious liberty and the dangers of state interference in **doctrinal matters**. He argued that the **church** must remain free to proclaim the **gospel** without coercion or control by civil authorities, while the state should protect the rights of all citizens, including religious minorities.

- "A free church in a free state: that is the great ideal." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Christian View of Man (1937)
- "The Necessity of the Christian School" (1933)
- Selected correspondence and articles on religious liberty

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Separation of Church and State**
    - The church and state have distinct God-ordained spheres of authority.
    - The state must not dictate the church’s doctrine or worship.
    - The church should not wield civil power or enforce faith by law.
    - Religious liberty is essential for genuine faith and church vitality.
    - "The church must be free to carry out its divine mission without interference from the state." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Primacy of the Gospel**
    - The church’s central task is the proclamation of the gospel, not political activism.
    - Civil government cannot save or sanctify; only the gospel can.
    - The church must resist the temptation to become an agent of social or political reform.
    - The purity of the gospel is threatened when the church aligns too closely with state agendas.
    - "The responsibility of the church is to preach the gospel, not to direct the policies of the state." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Defense of Religious Liberty**
    - Every individual must have the freedom to worship according to conscience.
    - State-imposed religion undermines true faith and leads to hypocrisy.
    - The church should advocate for the rights of religious minorities.
    - Religious liberty is a safeguard against both tyranny and heresy.
    - "Religious liberty is not merely a privilege but a right grounded in the dignity of man as created in the image of God." (What Is Faith?)

4. **Opposition to State Control of Education**
    - State-controlled education often promotes secularism hostile to Christianity.
    - Christian education is vital for preserving doctrinal integrity.
    - Parents, not the state, have the primary responsibility for their children’s religious instruction.
    - The church must support and defend Christian schools as an extension of its mission.
    - "The most important thing, therefore, is that the Christian school should be really Christian." ("The Necessity of the Christian School")

5. **Critique of Civil Religion**
    - Civil religion dilutes the distinctiveness of Christian doctrine.
    - The church must not compromise its confession to gain state approval.
    - True Christianity cannot be reduced to generic moralism or patriotism.
    - The gospel transcends national and political boundaries.
    - "Christianity is not a mere adjunct to patriotism or good citizenship; it is a supernatural message from God." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **separation of church and state** has shaped Reformed and evangelical approaches to religious liberty in America. His warnings against state interference in church affairs and education continue to influence Christian advocacy for **religious freedom**. Machen’s thought remains a touchstone for those seeking to maintain the church’s independence and fidelity to the gospel amid political and cultural pressures.
