# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **Church and State relations** through the lens of his **transcendental theology** and commitment to the **dignity of human conscience**. He emphasized the autonomy of the **secular order** while maintaining the Church’s responsibility to witness to the **Gospel** in public life, advocating for a dialogical rather than oppositional relationship between Church and State.

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s nuanced approach to **Church and State relations** influenced post-Vatican II Catholic thought, especially in affirming **religious liberty** and the autonomy of secular institutions. His theology helped shape the Church’s engagement with modern pluralistic societies, emphasizing dialogue and prophetic witness over political control. Rahner’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions on the Church’s public role, especially regarding the dignity of conscience and the importance of the Church as a sacramental presence in the world.
