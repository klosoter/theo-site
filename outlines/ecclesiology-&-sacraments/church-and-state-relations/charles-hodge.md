# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a **Reformed doctrine of Church and State** that emphasized the distinct yet complementary roles of each institution under the sovereignty of God. He maintained that the **Church** is a spiritual body governed by Christ, while the **State** is a civil institution ordained by God for justice and order, with both spheres responsible to uphold **God’s moral law** but not to encroach upon each other's proper domain.

- "The province of the Church is the truth; the province of the State is the protection of the rights of persons and property." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on the Church and civil government)
- Discussions in Church Polity
- Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
- Commentary on the Confession of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Spheres of Church and State**
   - The **Church** and **State** are separate institutions, each with its own divinely appointed authority.
   - The Church’s authority is spiritual, concerning doctrine, worship, and discipline.
   - The State’s authority is civil, concerning justice, order, and the protection of rights.
   - Neither should usurp the functions of the other, though both are under God’s law.
   - "The Church has no right to make laws to bind the conscience in matters of civil concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Moral Law as Binding on Both Spheres**
   - Both Church and State are accountable to **God’s moral law** as revealed in Scripture.
   - The State is not religiously neutral but must recognize the moral order established by God.
   - Civil laws should not contradict the teachings of Scripture.
   - The Church must call the State to account when it violates God’s law.
   - "The State is bound to recognize the law of God as the supreme rule." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Religious Liberty and Freedom of Conscience**
   - The State must protect the **religious liberty** of all citizens.
   - Coercion in matters of faith is contrary to the gospel and the nature of the Church.
   - The Church should not wield civil power or enforce its doctrines by force.
   - Freedom of conscience is a fundamental right under God.
   - "Liberty of conscience is the right of every man, and the Church has no authority to invade it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Church’s Spiritual Independence**
   - The Church is governed by Christ alone as its head.
   - Civil magistrates have no authority to dictate doctrine, worship, or church government.
   - The Church must resist state interference in spiritual matters.
   - Spiritual discipline and sacraments are the exclusive domain of the Church.
   - "The Church is a spiritual body, and its jurisdiction is exclusively spiritual." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Cooperation for the Common Good**
   - Church and State may cooperate in promoting justice, morality, and social order.
   - The Church should pray for and counsel civil authorities.
   - The State should protect the Church’s freedom and support public morality.
   - Both institutions serve the **common good** under God’s providence.
   - "The Church and State, though distinct, are not antagonistic, but may cooperate for the welfare of society." (Discussions in Church Polity)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **Reformed two kingdoms doctrine** shaped American Presbyterianism’s approach to Church and State relations, emphasizing both religious liberty and the moral accountability of civil government. His influence persists in debates over the public role of Christianity and the limits of ecclesiastical and civil authority. Hodge’s careful distinction between spiritual and civil spheres remains a touchstone for Reformed thought on religious freedom and the responsibilities of the State under God’s law.
