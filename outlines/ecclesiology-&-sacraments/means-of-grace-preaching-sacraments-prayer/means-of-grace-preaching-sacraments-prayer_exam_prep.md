### TITLE
The Word–Spirit Economy: How Christ Communicates Grace in Preaching, Sacraments, and Prayer

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how the ascended Christ, by the Holy Spirit, uses instituted ordinances as **ordinary means** to communicate saving benefits without compromising his unique mediation or the priority of grace.
- Decisive figures: Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Owen, Karl Barth.
- Traditions engaged: Patristic sacramental realism, medieval scholastic sacramental causality, Lutheran and Reformed Reformation trajectories, Puritan and Westminster **federal theology**, modern dialectical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: priority of preaching versus sacraments, nature and timing of sacramental efficacy, baptismal benefits and apostasy, frequency of the Supper, whether prayer is a true means of grace.
  - External: Roman Catholic ex opere operato and priestly causality, Lutheran sacramental presence and baptismal regeneration, Zwinglian memorialism and Anabaptist anti-sacramentalism, Quaker inner light.
  - Contemporary: digital church and virtual communion, multi-site video preaching, charismatic immediacy versus **ordinary means**, therapeutic spirituality and formationism.
- Position: I defend the classic Reformed claim that the **means of grace** are the Word preached, the sacraments as visible words, and prayer, which Christ uses as instituted instruments within the **covenant of grace** to communicate the benefits of **union with Christ**, with preaching as chief, sacraments as signs and seals effectual to the elect by the **Word–Spirit** nexus, and prayer as a real, commanded instrument rather than mere response.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **means of grace** asks how the ascended Christ communicates salvation to sinners now. It is not a marginal pastoral technique, but an ecclesial articulation of the Christological and pneumatological economy under the rule of **divine simplicity** and the singular mediation of Christ. If God is one and simple, he does not need media to supplement his power, yet he freely wills to bind us to his promised ways. The question is how to affirm the primacy of divine agency while confessing that the Lord employs instituted ordinances as real instruments. The Reformed answer is that God alone is the principal cause of saving grace, yet he has ordained the **ordinary means** of preaching, sacraments, and prayer as the public form of Christ’s self-giving by the Spirit in the **covenant of grace**. These means are not rival mediations, but Christ’s own ministry extended through his body. They neither work by natural power nor by bare human performance, but by Christ’s promise accompanied by the Spirit to the elect, received by faith. To defend this requires theological grammar about **instrumental causality**, a doctrine of the church as the place where Christ speaks and gives himself, a **Word–Spirit** account of efficacy, and careful engagement with rival sacramental ontologies.

Augustine is decisive because he framed signs and res in a way that disciplined later debates. Facing Donatist rigorism, he argued that the church’s sacramental acts do not derive their validity from the minister’s holiness, since the sacrament is Christ’s gift to his body; yet he refused magical accounts of efficacy. Sacraments are holy signs that both signify and convey the res they signify, yet their saving fruit is tied to incorporation into Christ by the Spirit. His sermons and letter to Januarius show the pastoral point: sacraments are the gospel in visible form, and their effect is bound to the promise they enact and the faith by which the Spirit unites us to Christ. On preaching, Augustine insisted that Scripture’s God speaks now through the human preacher whom the Spirit uses as an instrument, and he repeatedly taught that prayer is a divinely commanded pathway of grace in which God gives what he commands. His synthesis secured two anchors that later Reformed theology deepened: sacraments as visible words and ecclesial objectivity without Donatist conditionalism, and Word and sacrament under the Spirit as God’s chosen vehicles of Christ’s presence and power. Examiners will ask whether Augustine taught ex opere operato; the answer is that he prepared its later medieval formulation by stressing sacramental objectivity, but he never detached efficacy from the Spirit’s gift of love and the bond of unity with Christ. That Augustine’s polemical situation pressed him to defend the church’s sacramental acts against Donatist invalidation does not entail a mechanistic account.

Thomas Aquinas codified medieval sacramental causality with precision that remains the standard external point of comparison. He taught that sacraments are instruments of Christ’s humanity, instruments God uses to cause grace by a divinely conferred power, ex opere operato. The instrumentality is not autonomous. Aquinas’s distinction between principal and instrumental causes is salutary: God alone gives grace as principal cause, while sacraments instrumentally confer grace by virtue of Christ’s institution, not by human fervor. This protected objective ecclesial life and distinguished sacrament from human preparation, yet it implicated a robust ontological account of sacramental efficacy and located causality in the rite as such, when not obstructed. The sevenfold sacramental system flows from this account. For our topic, two implications matter. First, preaching is not numerically a sacrament, though the Word is indispensable; the sacrament’s form, matter, and intention confer grace as an instrumental cause. Second, prayer is not a means of grace in the same sense as sacraments, but rather a meritorious cooperation eliciting further grace in the ordered habitus of charity. The Reformed response received the distinction between principal and instrumental causes, yet rejected the ex opere operato placement of instrumentality in the rite as such and the multiplication of sacraments beyond gospel dominical institution. If examiners press whether the Reformed have any place for ex opere operato, the correct answer is that they retain the objectivity of divine promise bound to the ordinance and so deny that sacramental efficacy depends on the sincerity of the minister or recipient, but they locate efficacy in the **Word–Spirit** nexus rather than in sacramental matter considered as an infused instrument.

Martin Luther re-centered the church around the external Word as God’s act. Against both scholastic moralism and Schwärmer enthusiasm, he declared that the gospel is a preached Word that delivers what it promises. The means of grace are the viva vox Dei: the preached gospel, baptism as a baptism into Christ that regenerates, and the Lord’s Supper in which Christ gives his true body and blood in, with, and under the bread and wine. If Augustine taught visible words, Luther sharpened it to say that words do what they say because God speaks and gives himself. His Small Catechism shows that the question is always what these mean and what benefit they give, and his answer is: forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation. Prayer appears as a means in Luther’s piety because God commands and promises to hear it, but within the Lutheran dogmatic systems prayer is more response than conduit of justifying grace. Luther’s decisive contribution is a polemic against any replacement of external Word by inner light and an insistence on sacramental realism. The Reformed learned from him that the gospel must be preached as God’s speech, and that sacraments are gospel acts that give Christ, not our acts of memorial piety. Yet Lutheran sacramental presence and baptismal regeneration differ from the Reformed account of sacramental **spiritual presence** and baptismal efficacy tied to election and faith’s bond to Christ. The internal Protestant debate will repeatedly return to this divergence.

John Calvin, more than any other, supplies the Protestant architecture of the **means of grace** that the Westminster Standards codify. His context in Geneva forced him to translate doctrine into a liturgical and pastoral regimen. Calvin’s method is to bind everything to **union with Christ** and the **Word–Spirit** nexus. In the Institutes and the Geneva Catechism he argued that Christ communicates the twofold grace of justification and sanctification by the Spirit through means that are truly instrumental because Christ uses them. Preaching is chief, not because sacraments are optional, but because faith comes by hearing, and preaching is the Spirit’s chosen vehicle for creating and sustaining faith. Preaching is not mere explanation; it is God’s living voice, yet only when Christ speaks through the minister and the church receives it by faith wrought by the Spirit. Calvin thus excludes clericalism and magic while protecting the holiness of ordained ministry as the stewardship of the **keys of the kingdom**.

On sacraments, Calvin resists both ex opere operato and memorialism by articulating **sacramental union**. The sign and the thing signified are distinct yet joined by divine promise, so that in sacramental action Christ truly gives what he signifies. The efficacy is not tied to the moment of administration as if grace were in the elements, nor does it wait upon human piety; it flows from Christ by the Spirit to the elect, sometimes without temporal coincidence, but never apart from the appointed means themselves. In the Supper we truly feed on Christ by the Spirit who lifts us to the risen Christ; Christ is really present, not locally, but spiritually, and this presence yields participation in his life and benefits. Calvin applies the same pattern to baptism. It is incorporation into Christ and his church, a sign and seal of remission and regeneration, genuinely conferring these benefits to the elect as and when the Spirit unites them. He grounds infant baptism in **federal theology** before federalism: God’s covenant embraces believers and their children, and the sign should be applied to the proper recipients of the covenant, while its saving grace is God’s to apportion as he wills. Prayer for Calvin is the chief exercise of faith, the ordained way we receive from God all his benefits; because God commands and promises to answer, prayer is an appointed instrument by which Christ communicates grace. He has no hesitation speaking of prayer as a means of grace because it functions within the covenant economy as God’s pipeline of promised help rather than a human technique.

If examiners press whether Calvin’s view reduces sacraments to subjective signs that only the elect benefit from, the answer is that objectivity is found in Christ’s promise attached to visible ordinances and in the ecclesial administration of them, not in a quasi-physical power. The reprobate truly receive the sign and are bound by the covenant, and there is a non-saving participation that aggravates judgment. The elect, however, receive the res sacramenti by the Spirit’s sovereign application, sometimes before, during, or after the sign’s application. This protects both the gospel’s objectivity and the sovereignty of grace in the **ordo salutis** without collapsing into mechanism or memorialism.

John Owen develops the Westminster mind of the **ordinary means** with a pneumatological rigor that guards against both sacramentalism and revivalism. In Communion with God and his treatises on the Holy Spirit, Owen argues that the Spirit is the efficient cause of all gracious operations, yet he has appointed means as moral instruments which he owns and uses. The ordinances are not dispensable channels we may discard for private raptures; they are Christ’s commanded paths in which he walks toward us. Preaching is the Spirit’s great instrument to break open the conscience, convict of sin, reveal Christ, and conform believers to him. Owen’s polemic against empty formality is not a rejection of ordinances but an insistence that efficacy is not tied to the work worked. On sacraments he follows Calvin and the Westminster Standards in affirming signs and seals effectual to the elect by the Spirit. On prayer, Owen is unambiguous: the Spirit is the Spirit of supplication, and prayer functions as a God-given means for the increase of grace, mortification of sin, and fellowship with the triune God. His pastoral warning is timely: to seek extraordinary experiences apart from instituted ordinances is to grieve the Spirit who appointed them.

Karl Barth, though outside the Reformed confessional mainstream on this locus, represents a modern attempt to purify the **means of grace** by collapsing them into the event of God’s speaking. For Barth, the Word is primarily Jesus Christ; Scripture and preaching become witnesses through which God freely chooses to address us. Sacraments are powerful but secondary signs of that divine event. Barth’s dialectic simultaneously wards off clericalism and magic and risks dissolving the ordinances into contingently useful occasions of grace that lack covenantal institution as stable structures of the church’s life. His critique reminds us that Christ is Lord of the means and cannot be confined by them, yet his reduction of sacramental objectivity creates instability in the church’s confidence to expect God’s promised presence in gathered worship. The Reformed doctrine must answer Barth by affirming that the risen Christ is free in using the means yet faithful to his own institution, so that churches may expect him in his appointed ways.

The main internal debates among the Reformed concern the relative priority of the means, the nature and timing of sacramental efficacy, and the place of prayer. First, priority. The Reformed call preaching the chief ordinary means because of the Word’s primacy in creating faith and ordering the sacraments. This does not demote sacraments to optional extras. Sacraments are the Word made visible, the gospel enacted. The internal correction is to push back against practical Zwinglianism that treats the table as a quarterly add-on. The better view follows Calvin and the Scottish and Dutch practice of frequent communion and robust catechesis. If asked whether the Supper should be weekly, the best answer is that frequency is a matter of prudence bound by the ends of edification; the Word’s primacy does not militate against weekly communion if done with full preaching and self-examination according to the Standards.

Second, efficacy and timing. The Westminster doctrine affirms that sacraments are effectual means of grace to the elect. Does this commit us to baptismal regeneration? No. It affirms that baptism signifies and seals the benefits of the covenant of grace and confers them to the elect in God’s time, not necessarily at the moment of administration. The apostasy of the baptized is explained by the difference between external covenant relation and internal saving union. The sign is truly given; the thing signified is given in union with Christ by the Spirit to those whom the Father has given the Son. This protects assurance from sacramentalism and from radical subjectivism. On the Supper, the internal debate concerns presence. The confession rules out carnal presence and crude memorialism, affirming **spiritual presence** accessed by faith, which itself is God’s gift within the ordinance.

Third, prayer. Some Reformed have treated prayer only as response rather than as a conduit of grace. Calvin and the Standards cut against this by explicitly including prayer among the **means of grace**. Prayer is not a human engine that powers grace but a divinely commanded instrument in which God gives what he promises. If examiners ask how prayer can be a means when it rises from us, the answer is that the means are all God’s acts through and with creaturely instruments. The Spirit is the one who prays in us with groanings too deep for words, and Christ as mediator perfects our prayers. Prayer belongs in the same **Word–Spirit** economy as preaching and sacraments.

External debates must be confronted candidly. Roman Catholic ex opere operato claims that sacraments confer grace by the rite itself when the recipient does not pose an obstacle. The Reformed deny that sacraments work by their own power considered as ritual causes, yet we affirm divine objectivity: they are means that God uses under the promise of Christ, not dependent on the minister’s holiness or the recipient’s fervor as such. The fundamental disagreement is about where **instrumental causality** is located. We place it in the Spirit’s use of the **Word–Spirit**-bound ordinance according to election, not in sacramental form and matter as such. Lutheran sacramental presence and baptismal regeneration represent another external pressure. The Reformed will not affirm that all baptized receive regeneration strictly on administration, nor that Christ’s body is locally present in or under the elements; nevertheless, we reject mere symbolism and insist that the Supper is a real participation in Christ by the Spirit, and that baptism truly unites us to the visible church and seals saving grace to the elect. Anabaptist memorialism and Quaker inner light invert the economy, cutting the church loose from God’s appointed external ordinances in favor of direct immediacies. Against this we say with Luther that the devil is a spiritualist; the Lord tied us to audible and visible gospel.

Contemporary debates test the doctrine’s resilience. Digital church culture has tempted evangelicals to treat livestreamed sermons as interchangeable with embodied assembly and to attempt virtual communion. The Reformed view must insist that the **means of grace** are ecclesial acts requiring the gathered **visible church** under ordained ministry, because they are not mere content delivery but covenantal encounters. Preaching is an ecclesial act of Christ addressing his body through a called minister in an assembly; the Supper is one bread and cup in one body, which presupposes bodily gathering and shared elements; baptism is a public incorporation into a visible people. Livestreamed teaching may be edifying, but it is not the same means. Multi-site video preaching adds a wrinkle. If examiners ask whether projected preaching counts, the best answer is that while God may bless truth wherever heard, the Reformed doctrine associates preaching with the personal presence and pastoral oversight of a minister over a particular flock. The further one separates proclamation from pastoral presence and sacramental governance, the more one departs from the grammar of the **means of grace**.

Charismatic immediacy raises another pressure. Claims that the Spirit’s power is most manifest in extraordinary signs risk displacing the **ordinary means**. The Reformed should affirm the Spirit’s freedom and occasional extraordinary works while insisting that the Spirit has pledged himself to the ordinary ministry of Word, sacrament, and prayer. To seek power apart from the means is to despise the Spirit’s own ordinances. Therapeutic spiritual formation programs often bypass the church’s public means for techniques of self-cultivation. Here the doctrine insists that transformation is located first not in private regimens but in Christ’s public gifts to his church.

One theological landmine is the relation of the means to Christ’s once-for-all mediation. Do the means add mediators? No. They are extensions of the one mediator’s own ministry. Because of **divine simplicity**, God is not composed of power plus instruments; rather, he freely wills to communicate his grace through created signs and words in a way that is fitting to creatures. Another landmine is the relation of the means to election. Do the elect receive grace apart from the means? God is free to do as he wills, yet he ordinarily binds his saving work to the appointed means, and the church must never encourage presumption that despises the ordinances. A third landmine is assurance. If sacraments are effectual only to the elect, can anyone know they receive grace at the Supper? The Reformed answer is practical: assurance rests on Christ’s promise and the Spirit’s witness. The Supper not only signifies grace but seals it; each communicant is invited to receive Christ by faith and, in so doing, truly receives him. Knowledge of election is not a precondition for coming; the Supper itself is one of God’s appointed instruments for strengthening assurance.

The coherence of this doctrine across loci must be underscored. In soteriology, the **means of grace** describe the instrumental link between redemption accomplished and applied, locating the Spirit’s application in the church’s ministry. In ecclesiology, they define the church as a creature of the Word and sacrament under Christ’s offices. In Christology, they express the continuation of Christ’s prophetic, priestly, and kingly work through ordained structures. In covenant theology, they enact and confirm the **covenant of grace**, specifying who belongs and how grace is communicated to households. In theology proper, they preserve divine agency as principal cause and make room for true **analogical knowledge** as God speaks and gives himself through creaturely signs. The doctrine restrains both rationalism, which abstracts grace from concrete practices, and enthusiasm, which despises them.

The defended position is therefore clear. Christ has instituted preaching, sacraments, and prayer as the **ordinary means** by which he communicates the benefits of **union with Christ** to his people. Preaching is chief because it creates and sustains faith and orders the sacraments, but sacraments are not optional; they are the gospel enacted as signs and seals, truly effectual to the elect by the **Word–Spirit** nexus. Prayer is not merely responsive but an appointed instrument in which God gives what he promises. This doctrine rejects Roman ex opere operato by relocating **instrumental causality** from sacramental matter to the Spirit’s use of the ordinance according to Christ’s promise. It rejects Lutheran local presence and universal baptismal regeneration while affirming real **spiritual presence** and true baptismal incorporation. It rejects memorialism and Quaker interiority by insisting that God’s saving presence is ordinarily bound to external Word and sacrament. It resists contemporary substitutions of technique or technology for ecclesial acts, insisting that the **visible church** gathered under the **keys of the kingdom** is the locus of Christ’s public self-giving.

To close, some brief examiner-style clarifications are in order as embedded answers. Does this doctrine make God dependent on means? No, it confesses that the God who is not dependent freely binds himself to promised paths for our assurance and obedience. If sacraments are effectual only to the elect, why warn the unworthy? Because sacramental participation involves a covenantal relation that is either unto blessing or judgment; the warning is itself a means by which God brings sinners to repentance. Can a believer expect God’s grace when hearing preaching from a flawed minister? Yes. Christ’s efficacy is not tethered to the minister’s moral state, though the church must discipline unfaithful ministers. Does prayer change God? No. Prayer is the ordained path by which the unchanging God brings about providential and redemptive effects, conforming our wills to his and giving what he has promised. Should the Supper be weekly? The best pastoral answer is that frequency should be as often as conducive to sober, joyful, and robust communion with Christ, with the Word’s primacy preserved. May communion be celebrated online? No. The Supper is a corporate act of the gathered body, a single loaf and cup in a visible assembly under Christ’s officers. When technology aids proclamation beyond the assembly, it can edify, but it does not replace the church’s public worship where the **means of grace** are administered.

The Reformed doctrine of the **means of grace** is not a sacral mechanism nor a pietist retreat. It is a confession of the living Christ who, by the Spirit, continues his prophetic, priestly, and kingly office through preaching, sacraments, and prayer, the avenues he has ordained to unite sinners to himself and to build them up in the **covenant of grace**. To defend it is to defend the concrete economy of salvation as Christ himself has given it to his church.

### RECAP NOTES
