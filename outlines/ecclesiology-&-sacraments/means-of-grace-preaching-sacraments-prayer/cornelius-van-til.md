# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **means of grace**—especially **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**—through the lens of **Reformed covenant theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized that these means are not merely human activities but divinely ordained instruments by which the **Holy Spirit** applies the benefits of **redemption** to the elect within the context of the **covenant community**.

- "The means of grace are the divinely appointed channels through which the Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to His people." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian Apologetics
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Theology of James Daane (for Van Til’s critique of sacramental theology)
- Essays in Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Means of Grace as Covenant Instruments**
    - The means of grace are inseparable from the **covenant relationship** between God and His people.
    - They function as the ordinary channels through which the **Holy Spirit** works faith and sanctification.
    - The efficacy of the means is grounded in God’s sovereign initiative, not human merit.
    - The church, as the covenant community, is the proper context for their administration.
    - "The means of grace are not magical rites but covenantal ordinances, grounded in God’s promises." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Primacy of the Word Preached**
    - **Preaching** is the central means by which God addresses His people and calls them to faith.
    - The preached Word is authoritative because it is the self-attesting revelation of the triune God.
    - The Spirit’s inward work is necessary for the outward Word to be effectual.
    - Preaching must be self-consciously presuppositional, confronting all hearers with the antithesis between belief and unbelief.
    - "The Word of God, preached in the power of the Spirit, is the chief means by which God builds His church." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**
    - The **sacraments** (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) are visible signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
    - They confirm and strengthen faith, but do not operate ex opere operato.
    - Their meaning is inseparable from the Word and must be interpreted by Scripture.
    - The sacraments are means by which the covenant community is marked off from the world.
    - "The sacraments, as means of grace, are intelligible only within the context of the covenant Word." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Prayer as Dependent Response**
    - **Prayer** is the covenantal response of dependence upon God, grounded in Christ’s mediation.
    - It is both a means of grace and an expression of the believer’s participation in the covenant.
    - True prayer presupposes regeneration and faith wrought by the Spirit.
    - Prayer is effectual because it is offered in accordance with God’s revealed will.
    - "Prayer is the means by which the covenant child communes with the Father through the Son by the Spirit." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Antithesis and the Means of Grace**
    - The means of grace presuppose the **antithesis** between the regenerate and unregenerate.
    - Only those united to Christ by faith receive the intended spiritual benefit.
    - The means of grace expose the futility of autonomous human effort in salvation.
    - Their proper use requires submission to the authority of Scripture.
    - "The means of grace are effectual only for those who, by grace, stand on the foundation of the Christian worldview." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **means of grace** reinforced their centrality in Reformed ecclesiology and worship, emphasizing their covenantal and Spirit-dependent character. His insistence on the primacy of the **Word preached** and the necessity of the **antithesis** shaped generations of Reformed pastors and theologians. Van Til’s presuppositional approach continues to influence discussions on the relationship between the means of grace, faith, and the church’s apologetic witness. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a robustly confessional and covenantal understanding of the church’s ministry.
