# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **means of grace**—preaching, sacraments, and prayer—through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He emphasized the proclamation of the **kerygma** as the true locus of encounter with God, downplaying the objective efficacy of sacraments and focusing instead on the individual's existential response to the Word.

- "The real meaning of the sacraments is to be found in the proclamation of the Word, which calls men to decision." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Faith and Understanding
- Existence and Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The **proclamation** of the gospel is the central means by which God addresses humanity.
    - The kerygma calls for an existential decision, not mere intellectual assent.
    - Preaching is effective when it confronts the hearer with the demand for authentic existence.
    - The historical Jesus is less important than the existential encounter with the proclaimed Christ.
    - "Faith is awakened by the word of preaching, not by historical knowledge." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization of Sacraments**
    - Sacraments are symbolic actions that point to the existential reality of faith.
    - Their value lies in their ability to express and awaken authentic decision, not in any objective efficacy.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are meaningful insofar as they are interpreted existentially.
    - The church’s ritual acts must be freed from mythological understandings of supernatural causality.
    - "The sacraments have meaning only as expressions of faith and as calls to decision." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Prayer**
    - Prayer is not a means to manipulate God or secure supernatural intervention.
    - It is an expression of openness to God’s address and a response to the existential call of the Word.
    - Authentic prayer arises from the individual's confrontation with the divine demand.
    - The significance of prayer is found in personal transformation, not in external results.
    - "Prayer is the attitude of the man who is open to God’s word and ready for decision." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Rejection of Objective Efficacy**
    - Means of grace do not possess inherent power apart from the existential response of the individual.
    - There is no magical or automatic transmission of grace through rituals or words.
    - The focus is on the subjective appropriation of the gospel message.
    - Grace is encountered in the moment of existential decision, not in external acts.
    - "There is no magical efficacy in the sacraments; their meaning is realized only in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Faith as Existential Decision**
    - Faith is not assent to doctrine or participation in ritual, but a personal, existential act.
    - The means of grace serve to confront individuals with the call to authentic existence.
    - The church’s proclamation and practices are valid only as they provoke genuine decision.
    - The existential encounter with the Word is the heart of Christian experience.
    - "Faith is decision, not possession; it is an event, not a state." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **means of grace** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting focus from objective sacramental efficacy to existential encounter with the Word. His method of **demythologization** influenced generations of scholars to reinterpret traditional practices in light of existential philosophy. While controversial for his rejection of supernaturalism, Bultmann’s emphasis on authentic faith and decision continues to provoke theological reflection on the nature of preaching, sacraments, and prayer.
