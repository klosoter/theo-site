# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. underscores the centrality of the **means of grace**—especially **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**—as the Spirit-ordained channels through which believers receive the benefits of **union with Christ**. He insists that these means are inseparable from the ministry of the **Holy Spirit**, who applies the redemptive work of Christ to the church through these appointed ordinances.

- "The means of grace are the Spirit’s instruments for communicating Christ and his benefits to believers." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit"
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment"
- "Word and Spirit: Selected Writings in Biblical and Systematic Theology"
- Contributions to "The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century" (especially on means of grace and union with Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Preaching as the Primary Means of Grace**
    - Preaching is the principal means by which the **Holy Spirit** applies redemption.
    - The preached **Word** is effectual because of the Spirit’s sovereign work, not human eloquence.
    - Preaching is central to the church’s life and mission, as it proclaims Christ and his benefits.
    - The efficacy of preaching is inseparable from the reality of **union with Christ**.
    "The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from it." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Sacraments as Spirit-Ordained Signs and Seals**
    - **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are visible words, confirming and strengthening faith.
    - The sacraments are not mere symbols but effectual means when received by faith.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ in the sacraments, especially highlighting participation in his death and resurrection.
    - The sacraments are ecclesial acts, administered within the context of the church’s ministry.
    "The sacraments are means by which the Spirit communicates Christ to his people." ("Word and Spirit")

3. **Prayer as a Means of Ongoing Communion**
    - Prayer is a divinely appointed means for believers to receive grace and maintain fellowship with God.
    - The Spirit enables and sustains true prayer, interceding for believers in their weakness.
    - Prayer is both individual and corporate, rooted in the believer’s access to the Father through Christ.
    - Prayer is essential for appropriating the benefits of redemption and spiritual growth.
    "Prayer is the Spirit-wrought response to the Word and sacraments." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

4. **Means of Grace and Union with Christ**
    - All means of grace are grounded in and flow from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - The Spirit’s application of redemption is always personal and corporate, mediated through these means.
    - The means of grace are not mechanical but relational, fostering communion with the risen Lord.
    - Participation in the means of grace is essential for perseverance and sanctification.
    "Union with Christ is the context in which the means of grace operate." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Necessity of the Spirit’s Work**
    - The means of grace are effectual only through the sovereign operation of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - There is no automatic efficacy; faith and the Spirit’s presence are necessary for benefit.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that the means of grace are not empty rituals but living encounters with Christ.
    - The church’s reliance on the means of grace is ultimately a reliance on the Spirit’s ongoing ministry.
    "Apart from the Spirit, the means of grace are powerless." ("Word and Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of the **means of grace** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in emphasizing the inseparability of **Word and Spirit**. His work has reinforced the centrality of **union with Christ** as the framework for understanding how believers receive and grow in grace. Through his teaching and writing, Gaffin has influenced generations of pastors and theologians to uphold the ordinary means as vital for the church’s life and mission. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a Spirit-dependent, Christ-centered ministry of Word, sacraments, and prayer.
