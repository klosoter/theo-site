# Peter Leithart (1959–)

Peter Leithart approaches the **means of grace**—especially **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**—with a robustly sacramental and ecclesial vision. He emphasizes the **real efficacy** of the means of grace, insisting that God truly acts through these ordinary channels to shape and sustain the **covenant community**. Leithart’s theology is marked by a strong commitment to the **visible church** and the **transformative power** of liturgical practices.

- "The sacraments are not mere signs, but effective means by which God communicates His grace to His people." ("The Baptized Body")

## Key Works

- "The Baptized Body" (2007)
- "The Priesthood of the Plebs" (2003)
- "Blessed Are the Hungry: Meditations on the Lord’s Supper" (2000)
- "The Kingdom and the Power: Rediscovering the Centrality of the Church" (1993)
- "Delivered from the Elements of the World" (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Means of Grace as Efficacious Signs**
    - The means of grace are not merely symbolic but are instruments through which God actually imparts grace.
    - Preaching, sacraments, and prayer are central to the life and growth of the church.
    - The sacraments effect what they signify within the covenant community.
    - God’s promises are attached to these means, making them vital for spiritual nourishment.
    - "God uses water, bread, and wine to do what He promises to do." ("The Baptized Body")

2. **Sacraments and the Covenant Community**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are constitutive of Christian identity and belonging.
    - Participation in the sacraments marks entrance and ongoing membership in the visible church.
    - The sacraments are communal acts, not merely individual experiences.
    - The church is shaped and sustained by regular sacramental practice.
    - "The church is a baptized body, a community formed and maintained by sacramental grace." ("The Baptized Body")

3. **Preaching as Performative Word**
    - Preaching is not just information transfer but a performative act that accomplishes God’s purposes.
    - The Word preached is living and active, effecting transformation in hearers.
    - The Spirit works through preaching to convict, convert, and sanctify.
    - Preaching is central to the church’s mission and worship.
    - "The Word proclaimed is an event in which God addresses and re-creates His people." ("The Kingdom and the Power")

4. **Prayer as Participation in Christ’s Mediation**
    - Prayer is grounded in union with Christ and participation in His ongoing intercession.
    - The church’s prayers are effective because they are offered in Christ and by the Spirit.
    - Prayer is both individual and corporate, shaping the identity of the people of God.
    - The liturgy of prayer forms the church’s desires and mission.
    - "Prayer is the church’s sharing in the priestly ministry of Jesus." ("The Priesthood of the Plebs")

5. **Liturgical Renewal and the Church’s Mission**
    - The means of grace are central to the church’s renewal and witness in the world.
    - Liturgical practices are formative for Christian discipleship and public life.
    - The church’s worship is a foretaste of the kingdom and a sign to the world.
    - Renewal of the means of grace is essential for the church’s faithfulness and fruitfulness.
    - "The renewal of the church begins at the font, the table, and the pulpit." ("Blessed Are the Hungry")

## Legacy and Impact

Leithart’s theology of the **means of grace** has contributed to renewed interest in the **sacramental life** of the church within Reformed and evangelical circles. His emphasis on the efficacy and communal nature of preaching, sacraments, and prayer has challenged reductionistic or merely symbolic understandings. Leithart’s work has influenced discussions on **ecclesiology**, liturgical renewal, and the practical outworking of theology in the life of the church. His writings continue to provoke debate and inspire deeper reflection on the church’s worship and mission.
