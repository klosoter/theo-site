Divine Efficacy Through Instituted Means: Word, Sacrament, and Prayer in Reformed Theology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How the triune God communicates saving grace to the elect through **outward, ordinary means** without compromising **sovereign grace**, **divine freedom**, or **Christ’s sufficiency**.  
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, John Owen, Herman Bavinck, Louis Berkhof.  
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian and medieval Western sacramental theology, Reformation and post-Reformation **Reformed orthodoxy**, in distinction from Roman Catholic and Anabaptist trajectories.  
- Debates: Internal Reformed debates over **sacramental efficacy**, assurance, and preparation; external debates with Roman Catholic **ex opere operato** and Anabaptist memorialism; contemporary debates over digital mediation, therapeutic preaching, and individualistic spirituality.  
- Defended position: The triune God ordinarily bestows and confirms salvation through the **public preaching of the Word**, the **right administration and reception of the sacraments**, and **Spirit-wrought prayer**, all as instituted means that are truly efficacious yet never automatic and never separable from **union with Christ** and **sovereign election**.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **means of grace** answers a focused question: how does the triune God actually bring sinners into saving communion with Christ and sustain them there in history, in concrete practices, among particular congregations. Reformed theology insists that God is not only the ultimate cause of salvation in an abstract decree but also the immediate giver of grace through appointed instruments. The Westminster Shorter Catechism gives the classic formulation: the outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption are his ordinances, especially the Word, sacraments, and prayer, all made effectual to the elect for salvation. This statement gathers and systematizes a long development from Augustine through medieval sacramental thought, sharply reframed in the Reformation, and refined by Reformed scholastics and modern dogmaticians like Herman Bavinck and Louis Berkhof.

At the conceptual center is the relation between **divine sovereignty** and **instrumental causality**. If God alone regenerates and preserves, how can Word, sacraments, and prayer be more than pedagogical symbols. Conversely, if these practices are truly **means of grace**, what guards against sacramentalism, clerical control, or mechanistic views of grace. Examiners will press whether the Reformed position collapses either into a quasi magic of the rites or into an almost Zwinglian subjectivism in which the means merely occasion faith already produced elsewhere. A defensible answer requires tracing the decisive figures who formed the Reformed synthesis and locating the internal tensions.

Augustine is foundational because he first clearly binds ecclesial signs to **sovereign grace** and **predestination**, yet attributes a genuine sacramental efficacy to them. In works like On Baptism against the Donatists and On the Spirit and the Letter, Augustine distinguishes between the sign and the res, and insists that baptism truly confers something objective, indeed the sacramentum is valid even when administered by unworthy ministers. Yet only the elect receive the full saving benefit, which he identifies with the gift of perseverance and inner renewal. Here we already see the pattern that Reformed orthodoxy later formalizes: the outward rite communicates Christ according to divine promise, but the **efficacy** of that communication is sovereignly governed by God’s decree. Augustine thus resists Donatist reduction of efficacy to ministerial holiness, but he also refuses the idea that the sacrament’s power operates independently of God’s free giving of the Spirit. For the means to be means of grace, they must be more than bare signs, but they cannot be self-contained causes of grace.

Thomas Aquinas develops this Augustinian inheritance with scholastic rigor, especially in the Summa Theologiae. He articulates the classic view that sacraments are **instruments** of Christ’s humanity, used by the Holy Spirit to convey grace. Aquinas famously affirms that sacraments confer grace ex opere operato, by the work worked, meaning that their efficacy does not depend on the subjective state of the minister or recipient in the same way that ex opere operantis would. Yet for Thomas this is not magical automaticity: the sacrament is an instrumental cause whose power remains grounded in Christ’s passion and applied by the Spirit, and faith is necessary to receive the fruit. Nevertheless, his account embeds grace deeply in the sacramental system as an ordered, hierarchical channel of infused habits. Externalized ecclesial mediation becomes structurally central to the Christian life. This is the trajectory that Reformed theology will explicitly reject, especially in its ex opere operato formulation, while retaining the idea of instrumental causality and sacramental objectivity.

With John Calvin the doctrine of the **means of grace** is reconfigured around **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s free sovereignty. Calvin is not content simply to deny ex opere operato; he wants to preserve a robust account of **sacramental efficacy** and of preaching as God’s own address. In the Institutes, especially book 4, Calvin insists that the sacraments are instruments by which God actually offers and, to believers, truly gives Christ. The bread of the Supper is not bare memorial but a divinely chosen means through which the Spirit lifts believers into real participation in Christ’s body and blood. Similarly, preaching is not a mere human exhortation but the living voice of God when the Word is faithfully expounded. Calvin’s controversial contribution is to radicalize the dependence of means on the Spirit while heightening their objectivity: the Supper is not efficacious because of human devotion, yet it is not a channel of grace apart from faith; rather, the Spirit makes the external sign a true means of internal communion only in the context of living faith that he himself engenders.

Calvin also firmly integrates the means of grace with **election** and **covenant**. Examiners may ask whether this collapses into a two-track soteriology where the elect alone really receive grace, rendering the means a facade for the non-elect. Calvin’s answer, which must be owned and sharpened, is that the same Word that saves hardens, the same sacrament that seals salvation also aggravates judgment when received unbelievingly. The means of grace never fail in efficacy, but the efficacy is double: grace unto life or grace unto judgment. This underscores that divine promises attached to the means are not empty; God truly deals with people through these ordinances, though always according to his decree.

John Owen represents a high point of post-Reformation **Reformed orthodoxy** on the means of grace, and his thought helps answer another examiner concern: does a strong doctrine of the Spirit’s freedom render the instituted means contingent or even unnecessary. In works like Communion with God and his treatises on the work of the Holy Spirit, Owen is adamant that the Spirit is the immediate efficient cause of all spiritual life and growth. Yet precisely as such, the Spirit has freely bound himself to work ordinarily through the means Christ appointed. For Owen, public preaching is the principal outward means by which the Spirit begets and strengthens faith. He offers a dense account of the **habitus of faith** being excited and nourished through the preached Word, distinguishing between the Word’s moral suasion and the Spirit’s internal illumination, but refusing to separate them in actual ministry. Likewise, Owen views the sacraments as covenantal confirmations in which the Spirit seals what is promised in the Word.

Owen’s internal polemic is against both formalism and enthusiasm. Against formalism, he insists that to expect any spiritual good from Word or sacrament apart from the Spirit is idolatrous dependence on the outward elements. Against enthusiasm, he rejects the idea that the Spirit ordinarily bypasses the means in private revelations or immediate impulses. This anti enthusiastic polemic becomes vital in Reformed responses to certain radical pietist and later charismatic claims that prioritize extraordinary experiences over the instituted means and marginalize the church’s public ordinances. For Owen, **means of grace** are not optional aids but the very field upon which the Spirit has pledged to work. To despise them is to resist the Spirit’s own order.

Moving closer to modern articulations, Herman Bavinck and Louis Berkhof both codify a classic Reformed stance in a late modern context tempted toward subjectivism. Bavinck in his Reformed Dogmatics treats the means of grace within a broader organic vision of the Christian life. He emphasizes that God’s saving work unfolds in history through creaturely means, consistent with the **covenant of grace** as an historical administration. For Bavinck, Word and sacrament are not arbitrary appendages to an interior salvation; they are integral to the way God has chosen to relate to us as embodied, social creatures. He recovers the patristic and Reformed insight that the church is a visible, public entity constituted around these means. Yet he guards against Roman Catholic sacramentalism by anchoring their efficacy in God’s sovereign good pleasure and **divine simplicity**: God is never divided between his being and acts, so his action in the means is nothing other than the triune God himself communicating Christ by the Spirit according to promise.

Louis Berkhof, in his Systematic Theology, distills this into precise, catechetical form that closely tracks the Westminster Standards. He defines means of grace as objective channels instituted by God for the purpose of imparting the grace of the covenant. He stresses that they are necessary not absolutely, as if God could not work otherwise, but morally and normally, because God has covenanted to use them. Berkhof also gives systematic clarity to the distinction between Word, sacraments, and prayer. The Word, especially as preached, is the primary means by which the Spirit works faith. Sacraments are subordinate means, sealing and confirming what the Word proclaims. Prayer is both the fruit of grace and a means by which God further communicates grace, especially in the context of public worship. Berkhof thus safeguards the primacy of the Word while preserving the real, covenantal efficacy of the sacraments and the integral role of prayer.

These figures frame the internal Reformed debates where examiners will probe. One axis concerns the relative primacy of Word versus sacrament. While all agree that faith comes by hearing, some strands of Reformed thought have functionally reduced sacraments to near irrelevance, treating them as optional symbols. Against this, Calvin, the Westminster divines, Bavinck, and Berkhof insist that the sacraments are true **means of grace**, not bare memorials, and that neglect of them is spiritually harmful. Another internal debate surrounds the sacraments and assurance. Are baptism and the Lord’s Supper objective grounds for assurance, or does strong emphasis on election and the decrees undercut their comfort by introducing constant anxiety about whether one is truly elect. Here the more robustly ecclesial voices like Calvin and Bavinck argue that God intends the sacraments to serve as concrete, external anchors for the believer’s assurance when received in faith. The sacraments do not reveal the decree, but they exhibit Christ offered to me personally, and thus, in connection with the Spirit’s work, they strengthen assurance by directing away from introspection toward Christ.

A further internal tension lies in the place of **preparatory disciplines** within the means of grace. Puritan and later Reformed piety often commended self examination, fasting, and other practices before the Supper. Examiners may press whether this creates a two tiered spirituality and burdens consciences. The best Reformed response is to subordinate all such practices to the instituted means. Preparatory exercises may dispose the heart to receive the Word and sacraments more profitably, but they are not themselves instituted means of grace in the same sense. They must never become prerequisites that block believers from the table or drive them from public worship.

Externally, the chief dialogue partner is Roman Catholic theology with its strong doctrine of sacramental causality and **ex opere operato**. Rome affirms seven sacraments as necessary for the fullness of salvation and locates the church’s mediatorial role centrally in the sacramental system. From a Reformed standpoint, the problem is not the affirmation of sacramental efficacy as such but its structural function. When the sacraments are construed as principal channels of infused habits that cooperate with human freedom, the sufficiency of Christ’s once-for-all mediation and the gratuity of grace are endangered. The Reformed alternative, as seen in Calvin, Owen, and Bavinck, is to treat the means as instruments of Christ’s finished work, never supplements. The sacraments do not add to the cross; they are the Spirit’s chosen form of applying and sealing what is already fully accomplished. Examiners may ask whether the Reformed rejection of ex opere operato undermines objective assurance. The answer is that assurance is grounded in the divine promise attached to the means, which is objectively present, and in the Spirit’s witness, which is subjectively given. The sacraments are objective because God has bound his promise to them, but their saving fruit is received only through the faith which the Spirit works by the same Word they seal.

On the opposite side, Reformed theology must also distinguish itself from Zwinglian or Anabaptist memorialism and from contemporary evangelical reductions of the means of grace to teaching tools. If Word, sacrament, and prayer are only human acts of remembrance or expression, their status as instituted channels of divine action collapses. Calvin’s and Owen’s insistence that preaching is the living voice of God and that the Supper is a true participation in Christ exposes how much modern preaching has slid into moral exhortation, therapeutic storytelling, or self help. To defend a Reformed doctrine of the means of grace today requires a polemic against any reduction of preaching to information transfer. The Spirit binds himself to the Word, but only the Word faithfully expounded in its redemptive historical Christocentric fullness. Likewise, the sacraments must be administered according to Christ’s institution, within the context of a real church, by lawful ministers, if they are to function as means of grace.

Contemporary debates sharply test the Reformed doctrine of the means. Digital mediation raises the question whether livestreamed sermons and virtual communion can be considered true participation in the means of grace. A robust Reformed answer, drawing on Bavinck’s emphasis on the embodied, social character of the church and means, must say that although the Spirit may in extraordinary cases use recorded preaching to awaken faith, the instituted form of the means of grace presupposes bodily gathering around Word and table. The Lord’s Supper especially requires physical sharing of one bread and one cup as a visible sign of the one body. To normalize disembodied practices is to erode the very nature of the means as public, ecclesial ordinances.

Another contemporary pressure arises from therapeutic spirituality and hyper individualism. Prayer in many contexts is recast as generic mindfulness or self soothing, preaching as psychological counseling, sacraments as community rituals of belonging. The Reformed doctrine insists instead that these means are first God’s acts toward us, not our performances for God or ourselves. Prayer is a **means of grace** precisely because the Spirit of adoption causes us to cry Abba, Father, and the Father answers, giving more of the Spirit, conforming us to Christ. It is not primarily catharsis, but covenantal communion. Likewise, preaching is proclamation of God’s mighty acts, sacraments are God’s visible words, not instruments of communal self expression. Defending this requires linking the doctrine of the means tightly to **covenant theology**: God has bound himself to meet his people in these ordinances, promising to be their God in public, ordered worship.

With this framework in place, the position to defend before examiners can be stated: the triune God, having decreed to save his elect in Christ, has freely ordained specific **outward, ordinary means** by which he ordinarily communicates, applies, and confirms redemption, namely public preaching of the Word, administration and reception of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and prayer, especially corporate prayer. These means are truly efficacious as **instrumental causes** subordinate to Christ and the Spirit, yet they never operate automatically or apart from faith. Election does not render the means superfluous, but rather determines that the Spirit will infallibly make them effectual in due time for the elect. Rejecting Roman Catholic ex opere operato, this position still affirms a genuine objectivity: when the Word is preached and sacraments administered according to Christ’s institution, God is really present and really offers Christ; the failure of the non elect to receive savingly is not due to deficiency in the means but to their own unbelief and God’s secret will.

Anticipating objections, if asked whether this makes God dependent on means, one must invoke **divine freedom**. God is not bound absolutely but by covenantal promise; he can save extraordinarily without means, yet he has revealed that we are not to expect or seek salvation apart from them. If challenged that such a view leads to formalism, the answer lies in the Augustinian and Reformed distinction between sign and thing signified, and in the centrality of the Spirit’s sovereign work. The means do not save as bare rituals; they save as living instruments wielded by the Spirit. If asked whether the inward work of the Spirit alone suffices, the reply must be that separating Spirit from Word and sacrament is a form of enthusiasm. The same Spirit who regenerates inwardly has also inspired the Word and instituted the sacraments; therefore, despising or marginalizing them is opposition to the Spirit’s own economy.

Finally, this doctrine must be located within adjacent loci. In relation to **Scripture**, the means of grace presuppose the sufficiency and clarity of the biblical Word. Preaching is authoritative only as exposition and application of Scripture. In relation to **Christology**, the means function as extension of Christ’s prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices: he still speaks, feeds, and governs his people through these ordinances. In relation to **ecclesiology**, the means of grace are constitutive of the visible church as the place where the kingdom is publicly manifested. Any ecclesiology that marginalizes public preaching, sacraments, and gathered prayer is ecclesiologically defective. In relation to **soteriology**, the means of grace are the historical, covenantal mode in which the ordo salutis is applied: effectual calling through the Word, justification and adoption sealed in baptism and the Supper, sanctification nourished through ongoing participation in all three means.

Thus the Reformed doctrine of the means of grace is not a peripheral liturgical addendum, but the concrete outworking of **sola gratia** and **sola Scriptura** in the lived life of the church. To defend it well is to show how the sovereign God of all grace has freely chosen to bind his saving presence to ordinary, public, embodied ordinances, so that faith may have sure anchors outside itself and the church may know where and how her Lord has promised to meet her until he comes.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Means of grace** are the outward, ordinary ordinances of Word, sacraments, and prayer, instituted by Christ as true instruments by which the Spirit communicates, applies, and confirms saving grace to the elect.  
- Decisive figures: Augustine ties sacramental efficacy to predestination and the sign thing distinction; Aquinas articulates sacramental instrumental causality and ex opere operato; Calvin centers means in **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s free use of Word and sacrament; Owen insists on the Spirit’s immediacy and ordinary use of means against formalism and enthusiasm; Bavinck grounds means in covenantal, ecclesial, embodied life; Berkhof codifies the classic Reformed synthesis following Westminster.  
- Debates: Internally, tensions over sacramental objectivity, assurance, preparatory disciplines, and the primacy of Word versus sacrament; externally, contrast with Roman Catholic sacramental system and ex opere operato, and with Zwinglian memorialism and Anabaptist subjectivism; contemporarily, disputes about digital worship, therapeutic spirituality, and individualistic bypassing of churchly means.  
- Defended position: God sovereignly and freely saves, ordinarily through instituted **outward means** that are genuinely efficacious by the Spirit, never automatic, never separated from faith and union with Christ, and never bypassing the visible church.  
- Likely examiner questions and answers:  
  - Does rejecting ex opere operato leave you with bare memorials. → No, because the Spirit makes the instituted means true instruments of Christ’s saving presence, though only faith receives the saving benefit.  
  - Why are sacraments needed if the Word is primary. → Sacraments are visible words that seal and confirm the same promise preached, strengthening faith and assurance by God’s design.  
  - Can God save apart from the means of grace. → Yes extraordinarily, but he has promised ordinarily to work through these means, which we are not free to neglect.  
  - How do you avoid enthusiasm while honoring the Spirit’s sovereignty. → By affirming that the Spirit is the immediate cause of grace and has covenanted to operate through the instituted means, not independently of them.  
  - Are livestreamed or virtual sacraments true means of grace. → The Spirit may use extraordinary media for the Word, but the normative form of Word and sacrament requires bodily gathering; virtual communion does not meet Christ’s instituted pattern.
