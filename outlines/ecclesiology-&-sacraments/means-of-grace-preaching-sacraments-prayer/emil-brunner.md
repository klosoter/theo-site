# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the **personal encounter with God** as central to the **means of grace**, viewing **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer** as divinely appointed avenues for genuine relationship rather than mere institutional mechanisms. He critiqued both **sacramentalism** and **rationalism**, insisting that these means are effective only as they serve the living Word and foster existential response to Christ.

- "The means of grace are the forms in which the living Christ Himself meets us and communicates Himself to us." (The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- Revelation and Reason
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Means of Grace as Encounter**
   - The means of grace are not automatic channels but occasions for **personal encounter** with God.
   - Their efficacy depends on the **living presence of Christ** and the response of faith.
   - Rejects any notion of **mechanical efficacy** or magical operation in sacraments.
   - Stresses the existential dimension: grace is always relational and dialogical.
   - "The means of grace are not magical rites but forms in which God addresses us and awaits our answer." (The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation)

2. **Primacy of the Word in Preaching**
   - **Preaching** is the primary means by which God’s Word confronts and calls the hearer.
   - The preached Word is effective only as it becomes a **living encounter** with Christ.
   - Human words are used by the Spirit to mediate the divine Word, but never guarantee grace apart from faith.
   - The church’s authority rests in its faithfulness to the Word, not in institutional continuity.
   - "The Word of God is not a possession of the Church, but an event that happens in preaching." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Sacraments as Testimony, Not Magic**
   - **Baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper** are visible testimonies to the reality of God’s promise.
   - Sacraments are effective only in the context of faith and the Word.
   - Rejects both Roman Catholic transubstantiation and purely symbolic views.
   - Sacraments serve to confirm and strengthen faith, not to impart grace automatically.
   - "The sacrament is the Word of God in visible form, and its power lies in the Word, not in the element." (The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation)

4. **Prayer as Personal Response**
   - **Prayer** is the believer’s response to God’s initiative in grace.
   - It is not a means to manipulate God but a participation in the divine-human relationship.
   - True prayer arises from faith awakened by the Word and is sustained by the Spirit.
   - Prayer is both individual and communal, expressing dependence and trust.
   - "Prayer is the answer of faith to the Word of God, not a technique for obtaining blessings." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Means of Grace and the Church**
   - The **church** is the community gathered by the Word and sacraments, not an end in itself.
   - The means of grace serve to build up the church as the body of Christ.
   - Institutional forms are secondary to the reality of faith and encounter.
   - The church’s mission is to witness to Christ through Word, sacrament, and prayer.
   - "The Church exists where the Word is truly preached and the sacraments rightly administered in faith." (The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **means of grace** challenged both Protestant formalism and Catholic sacramentalism, emphasizing the necessity of **personal encounter** and faith. His existential approach influenced later discussions on the nature of **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer** within neo-orthodox and ecumenical circles. Brunner’s insistence on the primacy of the living Word continues to shape debates about the church’s ministry and the dynamic character of grace.
