# David F. Wells (1939– )

David F. Wells approaches the **means of grace**—especially **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**—as essential conduits through which the church encounters the living God in a secular age. He emphasizes the centrality of **biblical proclamation** and the necessity of grounding all worship and spiritual practice in the transcendent reality of God’s truth, warning against the dilution of these means by cultural accommodation.

- "The church’s power lies not in its programs, but in its faithful proclamation of God’s Word and its dependence upon Him in prayer." (God in the Wasteland)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Preaching as a Means of Grace**
    - Preaching is the chief means by which God communicates His **truth** to His people.
    - Faithful exposition of Scripture is essential for spiritual vitality and church renewal.
    - The authority of preaching rests on the **objective revelation** of God.
    - Preaching must resist cultural trends that undermine biblical authority.
    - "The pulpit is the place where God’s voice must be heard above the din of the world." (God in the Wasteland)

2. **Sacraments as Signs and Seals of God’s Grace**
    - The sacraments are instituted by Christ and serve as visible words of the gospel.
    - They function as means by which believers are nourished and assured of God’s promises.
    - The sacraments must be administered according to the Word and not reduced to mere ritual.
    - Their significance is rooted in the objective work of Christ, not subjective experience.
    - "Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are not empty symbols, but God’s appointed means to strengthen faith." (Above All Earthly Pow’rs)

3. **Prayer as Dependent Communion with God**
    - Prayer is a vital means by which the church expresses its dependence on God.
    - True prayer is shaped by the **character of God** and the priorities of His kingdom.
    - Prayer must be rooted in biblical truth, not therapeutic self-expression.
    - The decline of prayer reflects a loss of the sense of God’s transcendence.
    - "Prayer is the church’s declaration that it lives by God’s power, not its own." (Losing Our Virtue)

4. **Means of Grace as Countercultural Witness**
    - The means of grace confront the secularization and pragmatism of contemporary culture.
    - They remind the church of its distinct identity and calling in the world.
    - Faithfulness in these practices resists the temptation to measure success by worldly standards.
    - The church’s vitality depends on its rootedness in God’s appointed means, not cultural relevance.
    - "The church must recover its confidence in the means of grace if it is to stand against the spirit of the age." (The Courage to Be Protestant)

5. **Integration of Doctrine and Practice**
    - The means of grace are inseparable from sound **theology** and confessional integrity.
    - Neglect of doctrine leads to the erosion of meaningful worship and spiritual life.
    - Theological depth must inform the church’s practice of preaching, sacraments, and prayer.
    - The means of grace are the context in which doctrine is embodied and experienced.
    - "Without theological substance, the means of grace become hollow forms, devoid of power." (No Place for Truth)

## Legacy and Impact

David F. Wells has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical thought by calling the church back to the **centrality of the means of grace** in a secular and therapeutic age. His critique of cultural accommodation and insistence on the primacy of **biblical proclamation** have influenced pastors, theologians, and church leaders worldwide. Wells’s work continues to challenge the church to recover its theological depth and dependence on God’s appointed means for spiritual vitality and faithful witness.
