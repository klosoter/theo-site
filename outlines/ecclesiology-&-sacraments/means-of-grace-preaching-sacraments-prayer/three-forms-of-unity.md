# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of the **means of grace**, emphasizing **preaching**, the **sacraments** (Baptism and the Lord’s Supper), and **prayer** as the primary ways God communicates and confirms His grace to believers. These confessional standards stress that the **Word and sacraments** are not mere symbols but effectual instruments ordained by God to strengthen faith and unite believers to Christ.

- "For the sake of Christ’s merits, God will much less deny us what we ask in faith than will our parents refuse us earthly things." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 129)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Lord’s Days 25–31
- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 33–35
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV, V

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Preaching as the Primary Means of Grace**
    - Preaching is the chief means by which the **Holy Spirit** works faith in the hearts of the elect.
    - The public proclamation of the **Word** is necessary for salvation and spiritual growth.
    - The preached Word is effectual, not by human eloquence, but by God’s sovereign appointment.
    - Faith comes specifically through hearing the gospel message.
    - "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the Word of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 65)

2. **Sacraments as Visible Signs and Seals**
    - The sacraments are **holy, visible signs and seals** instituted by God to confirm His promises.
    - They signify and seal the reality of the gospel to believers, strengthening faith.
    - Only two sacraments are recognized: **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on the work of the **Holy Spirit** and faith, not the mere outward act.
    - "They are visible signs and seals of something internal and invisible, by means of which God works in us through the power of the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Article 33)

3. **Baptism as Initiation into the Covenant**
    - Baptism is a sign and seal of **regeneration** and entrance into the covenant community.
    - It points to the washing away of sins by the blood and Spirit of Christ.
    - Baptism is to be administered to believers and their children, emphasizing covenant continuity.
    - The sacrament obligates recipients to a life of faith and repentance.
    - "To us and our children belongs this promise." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

4. **The Lord’s Supper as Spiritual Nourishment**
    - The Lord’s Supper is a means by which believers are spiritually fed with Christ’s true body and blood.
    - Participation is by faith, through the operation of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - The Supper is a memorial, communion, and assurance of Christ’s benefits.
    - It fosters unity among believers as members of one body.
    - "As certainly as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me, so certainly was His body offered for me." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 75)

5. **Prayer as a Necessary Means of Receiving Grace**
    - Prayer is essential for believers to receive God’s grace and maintain communion with Him.
    - It is both a duty and a privilege, grounded in Christ’s mediation.
    - True prayer must arise from the heart, in accord with God’s will, and in faith.
    - The Spirit helps believers in their weakness to pray rightly.
    - "God will give His grace and Holy Spirit only to those who with heartfelt longing continually ask Him for these gifts and thank Him for them." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 116)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have shaped the **Reformed understanding of the means of grace** for centuries, providing a confessional framework that prioritizes the centrality of preaching, sacraments, and prayer in the life of the church. Their careful articulation of these means has influenced Reformed liturgy, catechesis, and pastoral practice globally. By emphasizing the Spirit’s work through ordinary means, these confessions have safeguarded the church against both sacramentalism and spiritual subjectivism, ensuring a balanced, Christ-centered approach to grace.
