# Hughes Oliphant Old (1933–2016)

Hughes Oliphant Old was a leading Reformed liturgical scholar whose work emphasized the centrality of the **means of grace**—especially **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**—in the life of the church. He argued that these means are divinely instituted channels through which the **Holy Spirit** communicates the benefits of **Christ’s redemption** to believers, grounding his views in both the **Reformed confessions** and the historic practice of the church.

- "The means of grace are those instruments which God has appointed to communicate Christ and all his benefits to his people." (The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century)

## Key Works

- The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church (7 vols.)
- Worship: Reformed According to Scripture
- Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church
- The Patristic Roots of Reformed Worship
- Leading in Prayer: A Workbook for Ministers

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Preaching as the Primary Means of Grace**
    - Preaching is the chief means by which God addresses his people.
    - The exposition of **Scripture** is central to Reformed worship and spiritual formation.
    - Faith is created and sustained through the hearing of the Word.
    - The Spirit works through preaching to unite believers to Christ.
    - "The reading and preaching of the Word is the heart of Christian worship." (The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures, Vol. 1)

2. **Sacraments as Visible Words**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are divinely instituted signs and seals of the covenant.
    - Sacraments confirm and nourish faith by visibly presenting the promises of the gospel.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on the work of the Holy Spirit, not the minister.
    - Proper administration requires the Word to be joined to the element.
    - "The sacraments are the visible Word, instituted by Christ to confirm the promises of the gospel." (Worship: Reformed According to Scripture)

3. **Prayer as a Means of Grace**
    - Prayer is an essential act of dependence upon God and participation in Christ’s priesthood.
    - The public prayers of the church shape the faith and piety of the congregation.
    - Prayer is both a response to the Word and a means by which the Spirit applies redemption.
    - The historic prayers of the church inform and enrich contemporary worship.
    - "Prayer is the means by which the church appropriates the grace of God in Christ." (Leading in Prayer)

4. **Means of Grace as Corporate and Communal**
    - The means of grace are primarily exercised in the gathered assembly of the church.
    - Worship is not a private act but a corporate participation in Christ’s body.
    - The church’s unity and identity are formed through shared participation in Word and sacrament.
    - The means of grace foster the communion of saints across time and space.
    - "The means of grace are given to the church as a community, not simply to individuals." (Worship: Reformed According to Scripture)

5. **Continuity with the Historic Church**
    - Reformed worship stands in continuity with the practices of the early and medieval church.
    - The means of grace are rooted in the apostolic and patristic tradition.
    - Liturgical forms and practices should be reformed, not discarded, according to Scripture.
    - The church’s worship is shaped by both biblical mandates and historical wisdom.
    - "The Reformed tradition has always sought to reform the worship of the church, not to invent it anew." (The Patristic Roots of Reformed Worship)

## Legacy and Impact

Old’s scholarship revitalized appreciation for the **means of grace** in Reformed theology and worship, especially by recovering the centrality of preaching and the sacraments. His historical studies bridged the gap between Reformed confessional theology and the liturgical practices of the broader Christian tradition. Through his writings and teaching, Old influenced pastors, liturgists, and theologians to pursue worship that is both biblically faithful and historically rooted. His legacy endures in the renewed focus on the formative power of Word, sacrament, and prayer in the life of the church.
