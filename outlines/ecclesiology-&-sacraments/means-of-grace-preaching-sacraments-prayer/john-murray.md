# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust doctrine of the **means of grace**, emphasizing their divine institution and efficacy in the life of the church. He viewed **preaching**, the **sacraments**, and **prayer** as ordained channels through which God communicates **saving grace** and nurtures the faith of believers, always grounding their efficacy in the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The means of grace are those divinely appointed ordinances through which the Holy Spirit works to convey to believers the benefits of redemption." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Christian Baptism" (1952)
- "The Covenant of Grace" (1953)
- "The Nature of the Sacrament" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- "Worship" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "Principles of Conduct" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Means of Grace Are Divinely Instituted**
    - The means of grace are not human inventions but ordained by God for the church.
    - Their authority and efficacy rest in their divine appointment, not in the merit of the participants.
    - The church is obligated to employ these means faithfully as commanded in Scripture.
    - The means of grace are essential for the ordinary administration of salvation.
    - "The ordinances of worship are means of grace because they are divinely appointed channels for the communication of blessing." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Preaching as the Primary Means**
    - Preaching is the chief means by which God calls and sanctifies His people.
    - The Word preached is effectual only through the operation of the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of Christ.
    - The preached Word is central to the life and mission of the church.
    - "The preaching of the Word of God is the most important means of grace." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**
    - The sacraments (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) are visible signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
    - They confirm and strengthen faith but do not confer grace automatically.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on the work of the Holy Spirit and the faith of the recipient.
    - Sacraments are to be administered according to Christ’s institution.
    - "The sacraments are means of grace, not by any power in themselves, but by the blessing of Christ and the working of his Spirit in them that by faith receive them." (Christian Baptism)

4. **Prayer as a Means of Communion**
    - Prayer is a divinely appointed means for believers to commune with God.
    - It is both a duty and a privilege, grounded in the mediation of Christ.
    - Prayer is essential for spiritual growth and perseverance.
    - The Spirit intercedes for believers, making prayer effectual.
    - "Prayer is the divinely appointed means whereby we seek and obtain the blessings of God." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Efficacy Rooted in the Holy Spirit**
    - The means of grace are effectual only as the Holy Spirit applies them to the hearts of believers.
    - There is no mechanical or automatic efficacy in the outward observance.
    - The Spirit’s sovereign work ensures that the means accomplish God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The church must rely on the Spirit in all use of the means of grace.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who makes the means of grace effectual to salvation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful articulation of the **means of grace** has profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian theology, especially in the English-speaking world. His insistence on the divine institution and spiritual efficacy of preaching, sacraments, and prayer continues to inform pastoral practice and theological education. Murray’s legacy endures in his balanced emphasis on both the objective means and the subjective work of the Holy Spirit, reinforcing the centrality of Word and sacrament in the life of the church.
