# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema emphasized the inseparable relationship between **faith** and **repentance** as central to the process of **conversion** and the application of **salvation**. He argued that both are gifts of **God’s grace**, necessary responses to the **gospel**, and are always found together in genuine Christian experience. Hoekema’s Reformed perspective stressed that true **saving faith** is never without repentance, and that repentance is always accompanied by faith.

- "Faith and repentance are not two separate steps to be taken one after the other; they are two aspects of the same turning—turning away from sin in repentance and turning to Christ in faith." (Saved by Grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Two Sides of Conversion**
    - Faith and repentance are inseparable and constitute the essence of conversion.
    - Repentance involves a turning from sin, while faith is a turning to Christ.
    - Both are responses to the call of the gospel and are wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    - Neither can exist in isolation; genuine faith always includes repentance.
    - "Repentance and faith are like two sides of the same coin; you cannot have one without the other." (Saved by Grace)

2. **Both Are Gifts of God’s Grace**
    - Faith and repentance originate not from human effort but from God’s sovereign initiative.
    - The Holy Spirit enables the sinner to repent and believe.
    - This underscores the monergistic nature of salvation in Reformed theology.
    - Human responsibility is maintained, but the ability comes from God alone.
    - "Both faith and repentance are gifts of God, given to the sinner as part of the application of salvation." (Saved by Grace)

3. **Repentance Involves the Whole Person**
    - Repentance is not merely sorrow for sin but includes intellectual, emotional, and volitional elements.
    - It involves a change of mind, heart, and will regarding sin and God.
    - True repentance leads to a new direction in life and ongoing sanctification.
    - It is a continual aspect of the Christian life, not a one-time event.
    - "Repentance is a radical change of the whole person, involving mind, heart, and will." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Faith as Trust and Commitment**
    - Saving faith is more than intellectual assent; it is personal trust in Christ.
    - Faith includes knowledge, assent, and trust (notitia, assensus, fiducia).
    - It results in union with Christ and participation in his benefits.
    - Faith is active and results in obedience and good works.
    - "Saving faith is not just believing certain facts; it is trusting in Christ alone for salvation." (Saved by Grace)

5. **Ongoing Necessity of Faith and Repentance**
    - The Christian life is marked by continual faith and ongoing repentance.
    - Believers must daily turn from sin and trust in Christ.
    - This dynamic is essential for growth in **sanctification** and assurance.
    - The pattern of faith and repentance shapes the entire Christian experience.
    - "The life of the believer is a life of continual faith and continual repentance." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of the unity of **faith and repentance** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology and pastoral practice. His clear, accessible teaching on the necessity and nature of conversion remains influential in evangelical and Reformed circles. By emphasizing both the divine initiative and the human response, Hoekema provided a balanced and biblically grounded account of salvation that continues to inform preaching, counseling, and discipleship. His work remains a standard reference for understanding the Reformed doctrine of conversion.
