# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the existential and relational character of **faith and repentance**, seeing them as personal responses to the divine initiative in **revelation**. For Brunner, **faith** is not mere assent to doctrine but a living trust in God’s self-disclosure in Christ, while **repentance** is the turning of the whole person toward God in response to His call. Both are inseparable aspects of the human encounter with the **Word of God** and are central to the restoration of fellowship between God and humanity.

- "Faith is the acceptance of the divine offer, repentance the turning away from self to God." ("The Christian Doctrine of Faith," in Dogmatics: Volume III)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Personal Encounter**
   - Faith is fundamentally a response to God’s personal address in **revelation**.
   - It involves existential trust rather than intellectual assent to propositions.
   - Faith is awakened by the **Word of God** and is relational, not abstract.
   - The act of faith is inseparable from the presence of Christ as Mediator.
   - "Faith is not the acceptance of a doctrine, but trust in the living God." (Dogmatics III)

2. **Repentance as Turning to God**
   - Repentance is the radical reorientation of the self from autonomy to dependence on God.
   - It is inseparable from faith; both are responses to the divine initiative.
   - Repentance involves confession of sin and acknowledgment of human estrangement.
   - True repentance is enabled by the encounter with God’s grace in Christ.
   - "Repentance is the turning away from self-sufficiency to the sufficiency of God." (Dogmatics III)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Divine-Human Encounter**
   - Both faith and repentance arise from the encounter between God’s call and human response.
   - The initiative always lies with God; human response is enabled by grace.
   - Faith and repentance are not human achievements but gifts received in relationship.
   - The encounter is mediated through the **Word and Spirit**.
   - "The initiative is always with God; man’s part is response, not achievement." (Dogmatics III)

4. **Rejection of Legalism and Subjectivism**
   - Brunner rejects both legalistic and purely subjective understandings of faith and repentance.
   - Faith is not mere obedience to law, nor is it a psychological state.
   - Repentance is not self-improvement but surrender to God’s transforming grace.
   - The focus is on the restoration of relationship, not moral attainment.
   - "Faith and repentance are not works, but the opening of the heart to God’s work." (The Mediator)

5. **Christocentric Focus**
   - Faith and repentance are centered on the person and work of Jesus Christ.
   - Christ is the Mediator who makes genuine faith and repentance possible.
   - The cross is the decisive revelation that calls forth faith and repentance.
   - The believer’s life is continually shaped by the ongoing encounter with Christ.
   - "In Christ, faith and repentance find their true object and fulfillment." (Dogmatics III)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s existential and relational approach to **faith and repentance** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, especially within the **dialectical theology** movement. His emphasis on the personal encounter with God challenged both rationalistic and moralistic distortions of the gospel. Brunner’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of faith, the meaning of repentance, and the centrality of Christ as Mediator in the human-divine relationship. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between revelation, faith, and human response.
