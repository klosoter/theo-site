# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson emphasizes the inseparability and necessity of both **faith** and **repentance** in the application of **salvation**, viewing them as twin responses to the **gospel** wrought by the **Holy Spirit**. He insists that true **conversion** involves a turning from sin to Christ, rooted in union with Him, and that both faith and repentance are ongoing realities in the Christian life.

- "Faith and repentance are not two separate stages in conversion, but two aspects of the one movement by which we turn from ourselves to Christ." ("The Christian Life")

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Inseparable Graces**
    - Both are gifts of **God’s grace** and cannot be separated in true conversion.
    - Faith involves a turning to Christ, while repentance is a turning from sin.
    - They are simultaneous responses to the gospel call.
    - Neither is meritorious; both rest on Christ’s finished work.
    - "Repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin; you cannot have one without the other." (The Christian Life)

2. **Union with Christ as the Source**
    - Faith and repentance flow from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - This union is established by the Spirit and is the foundation for all spiritual blessings.
    - Repentance is not merely a human act but the fruit of being joined to Christ.
    - Faith receives Christ and all His benefits, including ongoing repentance.
    - "All that we have in salvation is found in Christ and comes to us through union with Him." (The Whole Christ)

3. **Ongoing Nature of Repentance and Faith**
    - Both are not only initial acts but ongoing realities in the Christian life.
    - Daily repentance and faith characterize sanctification.
    - The believer continually turns from sin and trusts in Christ anew.
    - Assurance grows as faith and repentance deepen over time.
    - "Repentance is not a one-time event, but a lifelong attitude." (Devoted to God)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables both faith and repentance in the heart.
    - Regeneration precedes and empowers the response of faith and repentance.
    - The Spirit convicts of sin and reveals the sufficiency of Christ.
    - Spiritual transformation is impossible apart from the Spirit’s work.
    - "It is the Spirit who opens our eyes to see both our sin and Christ’s sufficiency." (The Christian Life)

5. **Assurance Rooted in Christ, Not in Faith or Repentance Themselves**
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the **objective work of Christ**, not the quality of one’s faith or repentance.
    - Legalism and antinomianism both distort the relationship between faith, repentance, and assurance.
    - The believer looks away from self to Christ for confidence before God.
    - Proper understanding of faith and repentance safeguards gospel assurance.
    - "Our assurance rests not in our repentance or faith, but in Christ to whom we repent and in whom we believe." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s teaching on **faith and repentance** has shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of **conversion** and the Christian life, especially through his accessible yet theologically rich writings. His emphasis on the believer’s **union with Christ** and the ongoing nature of repentance and faith has influenced pastors, theologians, and laypeople alike. Ferguson’s work continues to be a vital resource for those seeking clarity on the relationship between gospel assurance, sanctification, and the call to continual repentance and faith.
