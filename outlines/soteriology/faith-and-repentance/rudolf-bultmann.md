# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **faith and repentance** through the lens of **existential interpretation** and **demythologization**. For Bultmann, faith is not intellectual assent to doctrinal propositions but an existential response to the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—calling individuals to authentic existence and radical self-understanding. Repentance is inseparable from faith, representing a decisive turning from inauthentic existence to openness before God.

- "Faith is the abandonment of oneself to God, the readiness to let oneself be judged and made new by God." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth, 1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Existence and Faith" (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Existential Decision**
    - Faith is a personal, existential response to the **kerygma**, not mere belief in facts.
    - It involves a radical openness to God’s call in the present moment.
    - Faith is characterized by trust and surrender rather than intellectual certainty.
    - Authentic faith leads to a new mode of existence, free from self-reliance.
    - "Faith is not a possession but a decision, an act in which man surrenders himself to God." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Repentance as Turning from Inauthentic Existence**
    - Repentance is a decisive break from self-centeredness and autonomy.
    - It is inseparable from faith, as both involve a reorientation of the self toward God.
    - Repentance is not primarily moral improvement but existential transformation.
    - The call to repentance is the call to authentic existence in response to the **kerygma**.
    - "Repentance means to become free from oneself, to be open to God’s future." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

3. **Demythologization of Biblical Language**
    - Biblical calls to faith and repentance are embedded in mythological language.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind these terms.
    - Faith and repentance are not tied to supernatural events but to existential realities.
    - The true significance of these concepts is found in their call to authentic existence.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential decision to which the kerygma summons us." ("New Testament and Mythology")

4. **Faith and Repentance as Response to the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ (kerygma) confronts individuals with a demand for decision.
    - Faith and repentance are the proper responses to this proclamation.
    - The kerygma is not historical information but an existential summons.
    - Only in responding to the kerygma do faith and repentance become real.
    - "The kerygma confronts man with the necessity of decision, of faith and repentance." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Rejection of Objective Proofs for Faith**
    - Faith is not grounded in historical evidence or rational proofs.
    - The quest for certainty undermines the existential nature of faith.
    - Repentance and faith arise from personal encounter, not objective demonstration.
    - The truth of faith is existentially verified in the act of believing.
    - "Faith cannot be based on objective certainty; it is always a venture, a risk." ("Faith and Understanding")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **faith and repentance** profoundly shaped twentieth-century **New Testament theology** and the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential character of faith challenged traditional doctrines and inspired both strong criticism and creative engagement. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of faith, the interpretation of Scripture, and the relationship between theology and modern thought.
