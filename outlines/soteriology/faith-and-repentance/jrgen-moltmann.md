# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **faith and repentance** through the lens of **eschatological hope** and **participation in the crucified and risen Christ**. For Moltmann, faith is not merely assent but a dynamic, forward-looking trust in God's promised future, while repentance is a turning toward the new reality inaugurated by the **Kingdom of God**. Both are communal and transformative, rooted in the experience of the **cross and resurrection**.

- "Faith, wherever it develops into hope, causes not rest but unrest, not patience but impatience." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Spirit of Life (1991)
- The Coming of God (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Eschatological Hope**
    - Faith is fundamentally oriented toward the **future fulfillment** of God's promises.
    - It involves active participation in the **coming Kingdom**, not passive waiting.
    - Faith is inseparable from hope, energizing believers for transformation.
    - The resurrection grounds faith in God's ultimate victory over suffering and death.
    - "Faith takes its stand on the coming freedom and the coming justice of God." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Repentance as Turning Toward New Creation**
    - Repentance is not only sorrow for sin but a reorientation toward God's future.
    - It involves embracing the **new reality** inaugurated by Christ's resurrection.
    - Repentance is communal, calling the church to embody signs of the coming Kingdom.
    - It is a response to God's invitation to participate in renewal and liberation.
    - "Repentance means learning to live in the presence of the risen Christ and in the power of the coming Spirit." (The Spirit of Life)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Participation in Christ**
    - Both faith and repentance are forms of **participation in the crucified and risen Lord**.
    - They entail solidarity with the suffering and hope for the oppressed.
    - The believer is called to share in Christ's mission of reconciliation and renewal.
    - This participation is empowered by the **Spirit**, who brings new life.
    - "Christian faith lives from the raising of the crucified Christ and strains after the coming of the Kingdom." (The Crucified God)

4. **Communal and Political Dimensions**
    - Faith and repentance are not merely private but have **public and political implications**.
    - The church is called to be a sign of hope and an agent of transformation in the world.
    - Repentance involves confronting structures of injustice and seeking liberation.
    - Faith motivates action for justice, peace, and reconciliation.
    - "Hope’s statements of promise anticipate the future of righteousness and justice for all." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Pneumatological Empowerment**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables faith and repentance as ongoing realities.
    - The Spirit draws believers into the life of the **triune God** and the coming Kingdom.
    - Faith and repentance are sustained by the Spirit’s presence and power.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that faith and repentance are never static but always open to renewal.
    - "The Spirit is the power of the new life, the power of faith, and the power of repentance." (The Spirit of Life)

## Legacy and Impact

His integration of **political theology** and pneumatology has encouraged the church to see faith and repentance as transformative for both individuals and societies. Moltmann’s vision continues to inspire movements for justice, reconciliation, and renewal within global Christianity.
