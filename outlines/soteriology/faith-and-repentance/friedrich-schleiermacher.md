# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined **faith** as a form of **God-consciousness** rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence, rather than assent to doctrinal propositions. For Schleiermacher, **repentance** is not a juridical act but an existential turning, arising from the individual's awareness of alienation from God and the subsequent longing for reconciliation. Both faith and repentance are thus grounded in the inner life and experience of the believer, rather than in external authority or forensic categories.

- "Faith is simply the consciousness of being absolutely dependent, or, which is the same thing, of being in relation with God." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as God-Consciousness**
    - Faith is fundamentally a **feeling of absolute dependence** on God, not intellectual assent.
    - This consciousness is immediate and precedes doctrinal formulation.
    - Faith is the core of religious life, uniting the individual with the divine.
    - Doctrines are secondary expressions of this primary experience.
    - "Faith is neither a knowing nor a doing, but a being—a being in a particular state." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Repentance as Existential Turning**
    - Repentance is an inward transformation, not merely sorrow for sin.
    - It arises from the recognition of one's distance from God.
    - True repentance leads to a renewed God-consciousness.
    - It is a continual process, not a one-time event.
    - "Repentance is the return from self-sufficiency to the feeling of dependence upon God." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Religious experience is the foundation of all theology.
    - Faith and repentance are understood through the lens of lived experience.
    - The church community mediates and shapes these experiences.
    - Doctrine serves to interpret, not create, religious experience.
    - "Dogmatics is the science which systematizes the doctrine prevailing in the Christian Church at any time as the expression of its religious consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Christ as the Exemplar of Faith**
    - Christ embodies perfect God-consciousness and is the model for faith.
    - Repentance is possible through participation in Christ's consciousness.
    - The work of Christ is transformative, not merely forensic.
    - Faith and repentance are realized in union with Christ.
    - "In Him the God-consciousness was essentially original." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
    - Schleiermacher rejects legalistic or juridical understandings of faith and repentance.
    - Salvation is not a matter of imputed righteousness but of restored relationship.
    - Repentance is not penance but a reorientation of the self toward God.
    - Faith is not a meritorious act but a receptive state.
    - "The idea of guilt and punishment is subordinate to the idea of alienation from God." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **faith** and **repentance** as experiential and relational rather than forensic profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology. His emphasis on **religious experience** influenced later liberal theologians and set the stage for existential and phenomenological approaches to theology. While criticized by confessional traditions for downplaying doctrinal content, his work remains foundational for understanding the development of modern theology and the shift toward subjectivity in religious life.
