# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **faith and repentance** as inseparable aspects of the believer’s response to the **gospel**, emphasizing their grounding in **divine grace** rather than human merit. He stressed that both are gifts of God, integrally related to **justification** and the ongoing process of **sanctification**, and warned against any form of introspective legalism that would sever faith from repentance or make them prerequisites for grace.

- "Faith and repentance are not two separate acts, but two aspects of the one turning to God in Christ." (Faith and Justification)

## Key Works

- Faith and Justification
- Faith and Sanctification
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Perseverance
- Studies in Dogmatics: Sin
- The Work of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and repentance are inseparable**
    - Both are united in the believer’s turning to God and cannot be separated without distorting the gospel.
    - Repentance is not a preliminary work before faith, but is bound up with trusting in Christ.
    - The call to faith always includes the call to repentance, and vice versa.
    - This unity preserves the **Reformed** emphasis on salvation by grace alone.
    - "Repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin, both arising from the encounter with the gospel." (Faith and Justification)

2. **Both are gifts of divine grace**
    - Neither faith nor repentance originates in human initiative or ability.
    - The Holy Spirit works both in the heart, enabling a genuine response to the gospel.
    - Any notion of faith or repentance as human achievements undermines the sufficiency of grace.
    - This commitment safeguards the **sola gratia** principle of the Reformation.
    - "The possibility of faith and repentance lies in the grace of God, not in the potentialities of man." (Faith and Justification)

3. **Faith is trust in Christ, not mere assent**
    - Faith involves personal reliance on Christ, not just agreement with doctrine.
    - It is a living, dynamic relationship, not a static possession.
    - True faith is always accompanied by repentance, as it turns from sin to Christ.
    - This view resists both rationalism and emotionalism in understanding faith.
    - "Faith is not a matter of intellectual assent, but of trustful surrender to Christ." (Faith and Justification)

4. **Repentance is a continual orientation**
    - Repentance is not a one-time act but an ongoing turning from sin throughout the Christian life.
    - It is characterized by sorrow for sin and a renewed commitment to obedience.
    - This continual repentance is inseparable from the process of **sanctification**.
    - The believer’s life is marked by a rhythm of repentance and faith, sustained by grace.
    - "Repentance is not completed in a moment, but is the continual posture of the believer before God." (Faith and Sanctification)

5. **Avoidance of introspective legalism**
    - Berkouwer warned against making faith or repentance a new form of legalistic requirement.
    - He emphasized assurance in Christ rather than self-examination for evidences of faith or repentance.
    - The focus remains on Christ’s sufficiency, not the quality of one’s own response.
    - This guards against despair and fosters assurance rooted in the gospel.
    - "The certainty of salvation does not rest on the intensity of faith or repentance, but on the faithfulness of God." (Faith and Justification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **faith and repentance** has shaped modern Reformed theology by clarifying their unity and grounding both in divine grace. His work countered both legalistic and antinomian tendencies, emphasizing the centrality of Christ and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. Berkouwer’s influence persists in discussions of **justification**, **sanctification**, and the pastoral care of believers struggling with assurance. His careful avoidance of introspective legalism continues to guide theologians and pastors in articulating the gospel’s call to faith and repentance.
