# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **faith and repentance** through the lens of **existential theology**, emphasizing faith as the state of being ultimately concerned and repentance as a profound act of self-acceptance in light of **estrangement from the Ground of Being**. He rejected traditional forensic or voluntaristic models, instead framing both faith and repentance as responses to the human condition of **alienation** and the call to **accept acceptance** by God.

- "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of man’s ultimate concern." ("Dynamics of Faith")

## Key Works

- "Dynamics of Faith" (1957)
- "The Courage to Be" (1952)
- "Systematic Theology," Volumes 1–3 (1951–1963)
- "The Shaking of the Foundations" (1948)
- "The Protestant Era" (1948)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Ultimate Concern**
    - Faith is not mere intellectual assent but the total orientation of the person toward what is ultimately meaningful.
    - It transcends the distinction between subject and object, involving the whole being.
    - Faith is existential, rooted in the depth of the human spirit and its relation to the **Ground of Being**.
    - Doubt is an essential element of faith, not its opposite.
    - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned." ("Dynamics of Faith")

2. **Repentance as Acceptance of Acceptance**
    - Repentance is not primarily remorse or moral resolve but the existential acceptance of being accepted by God despite estrangement.
    - It involves a transformation of self-understanding in the presence of the **divine grace**.
    - Repentance is the acknowledgment of one’s separation from the Ground of Being and the movement toward reunion.
    - It is inseparable from the experience of forgiveness.
    - "The courage to accept oneself is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable." ("The Courage to Be")

3. **Estrangement and Reconciliation**
    - Human beings are fundamentally estranged from their true being and from God.
    - Faith and repentance are responses to this existential estrangement.
    - Reconciliation is not a legal transaction but a healing of the rift between existence and essence.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted as the New Being who overcomes estrangement.
    - "Sin is separation. Grace is reunion." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

4. **Symbolic and Existential Language**
    - The language of faith and repentance is symbolic, pointing beyond itself to ultimate reality.
    - Doctrines and confessions are expressions of existential truth, not literal propositions.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, making faith a living encounter.
    - Repentance is expressed through symbolic acts that mediate existential transformation.
    - "Religious symbols are double-edged: they open and they close." ("Dynamics of Faith")

5. **Critique of Legalistic and Voluntaristic Models**
    - Tillich rejects the view of faith as a voluntary decision or repentance as mere moral effort.
    - Both are existential responses to the depth of human predicament, not acts of will or intellect alone.
    - Legalistic models distort the nature of **grace** and the human condition.
    - Authentic faith and repentance arise from the encounter with the **Ground of Being**, not external compulsion.
    - "Faith is not an act of any of man’s rational functions, but it is an act in which all functions of the human spirit are centered." ("Dynamics of Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **faith and repentance** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His emphasis on **ultimate concern** and the symbolic nature of religious language has shaped contemporary understandings of faith beyond traditional doctrinal boundaries. While some criticize his approach for lacking doctrinal specificity, his work remains a touchstone for those exploring the existential dimensions of Christian belief and the nature of **grace** in the modern world.
