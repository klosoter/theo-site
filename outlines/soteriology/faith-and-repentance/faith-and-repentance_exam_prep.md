### ESSAY
The theological nerve of the doctrine of faith and repentance is conversion’s twofold movement: a turning to Christ and a turning from sin. The examiner’s first question, however, concerns structure, not mood: does repentance condition pardon or does faith alone justify? Unless this relation is fixed with precision, preaching will either dilute the free promise or neutralize the command to turn. I defend this: faith, as **fiducia** receiving Christ and his righteousness, is the sole **instrumental cause** of justification because it unites to the person to whom all saving benefits are attached in the **covenant of grace**. Repentance, as evangelical turning from sin to God with grief and hatred for sin, is necessary and inseparable from faith, given in the same **effectual calling**, yet belongs formally to **sanctification** and evidences true faith. This position secures **sola fide** without antinomian escape hatches and honors the gospel’s imperative without smuggling merit through the back door.

Augustine stands at the fountainhead of the conversion grammar. In his anti-Pelagian works he fixes the asymmetry of grace and human willing by insisting that God gives what he commands. That sentence governs the whole question. When Augustine speaks of repentance, he speaks of a grace God grants, not a prior moral achievement that elicits grace. This conviction rests on his theology of sin as bondage of the will, his account of **regeneration** as re-creation of loves, and his sense that Scripture’s calls to repent are instruments by which God accomplishes what he requires. While medieval penitential practices grew under different pressures, the Augustinian core is that repentance is God’s work in us, an interior conversion that cannot be reduced to external satisfaction. Whenever examiners suggest that Augustine birthed a penitential system, the reply must distinguish his doctrine of grace from later sacramental codifications. Augustine’s concern is the primacy of God in moving the sinner to turn, an insight that the Reformation would press with ferocious clarity.

Luther rethreaded the conceptual center when he wrote that the whole life of believers is repentance. In making thesis one of the Ninety-Five Theses a programmatic claim about poenitentia, he dethrones the idea that penance is a periodic sacramental act and recovers repentance as evangelical posture under the preaching of the law and promise. Luther’s method moves through **law and gospel**: the law convicts, slays, and drives to Christ; the gospel promises Christ’s alien righteousness and is received by **faith alone**. For Luther, repentance has two moments. First, contrition produced by the law, which is real sorrow but not a meritorious condition. Second, faith in the promise, which is the decisive turn to Christ and the reception of forgiveness. The gravitational shift here is that repentance is not a satisfactio but a dying and rising coram Deo, and the rising is faith, not performance. The debate shaped by Luther concerns whether repentance in any sense contributes causally to justification. He answers no: the causality lies entirely in Christ’s righteousness imputed, instrumentally received. Evangelical repentance is inseparable from true faith because the faith that receives Christ cannot simultaneously clutch idols, but repentance is not a co-instrument that helps faith justify. Examiners will ask whether this bifurcation yields antinomianism. Luther’s answer is that faith is a living, busy thing and produces works. His insistence that the baptized live under the daily return to the promise secures ongoing repentance as a fruit of faith. The pastoral point is crucial: one does not weigh sorrow to see if pardon will follow. One flees to the promise and, in the very act, the Spirit begins **mortification** and renewal.

Calvin deepens the structure by placing conversion within **union with Christ** and the duplex gratia, justification and **sanctification** as twin graces inseparably bestowed. In Institutes book three he expounds repentance before faith in the order of instruction, lest sinners presume on free pardon apart from change of life, yet he states plainly that faith precedes repentance in the secret order because one cannot repent truly until he has tasted God’s mercy. This exegetical finesse avoids a merely temporal sequencing and instead clarifies conceptual dependence. Repentance for Calvin is not a preliminary moral ladder but a life of turning that flows from being ingrafted into Christ by the Spirit through the gospel. He argues that Christ justifies no one he does not also sanctify, which guards against the charge that **sola fide** severs obedience. Calvin’s definition of faith as a firm and certain knowledge of God’s benevolence toward us, founded upon the promise of Christ, kindled in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, underscores the **fiducia** that joins the sinner to Christ and so receives pardon. Repentance, defined as true conversion of life proceeding from fear of God and grounded in love of righteousness, follows as a necessary concomitant. In the debates Calvin faced, on one side Rome’s objection that faith alone produces libertinism, and on the other antinomian tendencies, his answer ties both graces to union. Examiners sometimes press whether this makes repentance a condition of receiving pardon. Calvin’s reply is unwavering: repentance is inseparable from salvation, but pardon is received by faith alone. The necessity of repentance is not that it pays for sins nor that it precipitates pardon as a condition in the same category as faith, but that the Christ who justifies is the Christ who sanctifies. The duplex gratia is a personal union logic, not a two-track system.

Robert Bellarmine, the master controversialist of post-Tridentine theology, codifies the alternative architecture. In his De iustificatione he defends **fides caritate formata**, the notion that faith justifies only insofar as it is formed by charity. Penance becomes the ordinary sacrament for post-baptismal sins, comprising contrition, confession, and satisfaction. Contrition, though grace-enabled, is construed as dispositive of grace, and satisfaction is ordered to temporal punishments. Bellarmine’s framework treats repentance not only as necessary but as an integral part of the instrumental complex by which the soul is transformed and thereby justified. The underlying metaphysic is that of inherent righteousness as the formal cause of justification, so sanctification is not the inseparable companion of justification but its content. On this scheme, repentance is not simply fruit but a constituent in the process by which one becomes truly righteous. When examiners ask whether this is merely a semantic difference, the answer is no because the location of instrumentality determines the pastoral direction of conscience. If faith is instrument because it opens empty hands to Christ, then the terrified conscience is directed outward. If repentance supplies charity that forms faith, then the conscience necessarily looks inward to measure contrition and weigh satisfactions. The Reformed protest is not that repentance is unnecessary but that to make it co-instrumental is to confound **imputation** with infusion and to collapse the duplex gratia. The irony is Augustinian: grace may be affirmed, yet the form of justification makes repentance the hinge upon which acceptance turns.

Francis Turretin brings Reformed scholastic precision to the neuralgic points. In Institutes of Elenctic Theology he distinguishes the parts of faith as notitia, assensus, and **fiducia**, insisting that fiducia is the principal act by which Christ is embraced and rests upon him alone for righteousness. Faith therefore is the sole **instrumental cause** of justification, not because it is a nobler work, but because by divine ordination it is the empty hand that receives Christ. Repentance unto life he defines as the turning of man to God from sin, with sincere sorrow and hatred of sin and purpose of new obedience. He vigorously asserts its necessity for salvation and that no adult can be saved without it. But he sets careful relations. First, considering the relative order, he argues that in the forum of justification faith is prior and alone, because repentance as a work cannot be introduced there without overthrowing grace. Second, considering the forum of sanctification and the life of the regenerate, repentance necessarily flows from faith and accompanies it inseparably. Third, both graces are gifts of the same **effectual calling**, so there is no temporal gap required, while logical distinctions remain. Turretin addresses internal polemics: against antinomians, he argues that the gospel contains precepts as well as promises, and that the **covenant of grace** has conditions not of merit but of order and method. Against neonomians, he rejects the suggestion that repentance functions as an evangelical work satisfying a milder law. He contends that this is a different covenant altogether and creates a form of **neonomianism** incompatible with **sola fide**.

This doctrinal structure gives us a stable platform to address internal Reformed debates. One axis concerns the order of faith and repentance. Some catechetical expositions, like Calvin’s arrangement, present repentance first pastorally to cut false assurance, while others, following Ursinus and Turretin, locate repentance as consequent upon faith when justification is the point at issue. The right answer is to specify the forum. In the forum of union, faith instrumentally unites to Christ, and repentance follows as the first motion of **evangelical obedience**. In the forum of sanctification, repentance threads the whole life. Another axis concerns the nature of saving faith. Does faith include repentance as its negative aspect, or are they conceptually distinct graces? The prudent answer grants a material inseparability and acknowledges a formal distinction. Faith’s essence is receptive trust in Christ. Repentance’s essence is aversive turning from sin to God. They are two aspects of conversion, but they are not the same act under different descriptions. Treating them as identical blurs the unique role of faith as instrument and invites confusion about works in justification.

The antinomian and neonomian poles illustrate what happens when the hinge is mishandled. Antinomianism, ancient and modern, severs repentance from the gospel in the name of grace, detaching **sanctification** from **justification** and collapsing the duplex gratia. The examiner’s challenge here is whether our doctrine leaves space for carnal Christians impervious to repentance. The response is that true faith, because it unites to the sanctifying Christ, produces repentance. The apostolic warnings about those who do not inherit the kingdom apply. At the other pole, neonomianism, classically in Richard Baxter’s formulation, risks construing repentance and sincere obedience as the new law’s evangelical righteousness, turning the gospel into a milder covenant of works. The Reformed scholastics reject this as an assault on **imputation** and as a pastoral disaster. The Marrow Controversy shows the delicate balance: free offer without legal conditions, and yet repentance preached in full as the certain fruit and duty of those effectually called.

Roman Catholic theology after Trent, represented here by Bellarmine, is the chief external opponent, but Arminian and Wesleyan lines introduce another. Arminius and later Wesleyans posit universal prevenient grace that restores a measure of libertarian ability such that repentance can precede regeneration as a genuine human contribution. On that scheme, the call to repent is addressed to an undifferentiated human capacity made possible by universal grace. The Reformed reply, in Augustine’s voice, is that the inability described by Scripture requires **monergism** in **regeneration**; God grants repentance, as Paul says. The call is universal and sincere, but the success of the call is God’s particular work. This is not quietism. It is confidence that the Spirit works through the preached command. The examiner may object that such monergism makes the imperative meaningless. The reply invokes divine concursus: the external word is the ordained instrument by which the Spirit works inwardly. Command and gift are not opposed; the command is the vehicle of the gift.

Contemporary debates test the durability of this architecture. The Free Grace versus Lordship Salvation dispute in evangelicalism often recapitulates old errors with new slogans. Free Grace proposals that repentance is optional or that discipleship is a second-stage add-on contradict the biblical presentation of conversion and the confessional teaching that repentance unto life is of such necessity to all sinners that none may expect pardon without it. Yet Lordship formulations that write obedience into the definition of faith risk turning **fiducia** into a constellate of dispositions and practices rather than a simple resting on Christ. The way through is Turretin’s clarity: saving faith is receptive trust, never alone but always accompanied by repentance as its immediate, necessary fruit. Another contemporary dispute reframes faith as allegiance and repentance as social transformation. While allegiance language can capture the royal object of faith, it must not displace **fiducia** or obscure **instrumental cause**. If faith justifies because it is allegiance, then one risks substituting a quality of loyalty for the instrument that receives Christ. Repentance has corporate dimensions, but it cannot be collapsed into activism without losing its evangelical center.

The New Perspective on Paul proposes that justification is about ecclesial boundary markers and that pistis may name Jesus’ own faithfulness rather than the believer’s trust. This reframing affects our topic by sidelining the individual’s turning and recasting faith and repentance as participation in a covenant community. The Reformed counterargument is not an individualism but a Christological one: Christ’s faithfulness is the ground of our justification, but the New Testament still speaks of the sinner’s **fiducia** and **repentance unto life** as the means by which union with the faithful Christ is enjoyed. The Pauline imperative to believe and repent stands.

Pastoral questions reveal whether the doctrine can walk. Does preaching repentance alongside **sola fide** muddy the free offer? No, if we preach both as imperatives grounded in promise. Repentance does not add a bar to clear; it names what the Spirit works when the promise lays hold of the heart. What of the thief on the cross? His plea declares both realities: he condemns his own sin and casts himself on Jesus’ innocent kingly mercy. Repentance and faith are present, but only faith receives the justifying word, today you will be with me in paradise. Does requiring repentance compromise assurance? No, because assurance rests first on Christ’s finished work apprehended by **fiducia**; repentance then functions as a secondary corroboration in the reflex act of faith. Here the Reformed distinction between direct and reflex acts safeguards afflicted consciences. The presence of repentance, even in weakness, assures that the Spirit is at work. Its absence warns.

The role of the law must be plain. The law exposes, names, and condemns sin, driving to Christ. In the regenerate it norms **evangelical obedience** and schoolmasters daily repentance. This avoids the mistake of locating repentance in pure emotion or in therapeutic self-acceptance. Metanoia is not a mere change of mind but a Spirit-wrought inversion of loves. Contemporary therapeutic moods often misread repentance as self-shaming, and the reaction immunizes the church against contrition. The biblical and confessional pattern grounds repentance in the mercy announced in the gospel, so grief for sin is not self-hatred but allegiance to the God who pardons.

We must also integrate the ecclesial dimension. Repentance is not private catharsis but has ecclesial and sacramental shapes under the **means of grace**. Baptism signifies and seals definitive turning from sin to God by union with Christ in death and resurrection; the Lord’s Supper shepherds ongoing repentance as we discern the body and examine ourselves in the light of the promise. The church’s discipline functions as a ministerial aid to repentance, not as a satisfaction for sin but as pedagogy in the school of Christ. This ecclesial shape distinguishes evangelical repentance from mere behavioral change.

Finally, we should draw lines to adjacent loci. In the **ordo salutis**, **effectual calling** by the Spirit through the Word gives both faith and repentance, inseparably, as the initial act of conversion. **Justification** is by **imputation**, Christ’s righteousness counted to the believer, received by faith alone. **Sanctification** begins immediately as repentance and new obedience bloom from union with Christ. **Assurance** arises primarily from the grounds of justification and secondarily from the fruits of repentance. **Perseverance** includes a life of repenting, not a plateau of sinlessness. Eschatologically, final salvation includes the evidence of repentance, yet the verdict remains grounded in Christ’s righteousness.

This position resists the external Roman Catholic alternative by protecting the unique instrumentality of faith and by situating repentance within sanctification rather than within the formal cause of justification. It resists Arminian synergism by maintaining that God grants repentance and faith within monergistic regeneration. It resists contemporary Free Grace reductionism by insisting on the necessity of repentance unto life, and it resists Lordship confusion by refusing to redefine faith as obedience. It accents the duplex gratia of Calvin and the instrumentality of Turretin, illuminated by Luther’s law-gospel dynamic and stabilized by Augustinian monergism. It also shapes proclamation. The preacher does not calculate the sorrow scale but heralds Christ crucified and risen, calling all to repent and believe. The Spirit, who alone grants both graces, will effect what he commands. If an examiner objects that this all but collapses repentance into a synonym for sanctification and robs conversion of its twofoldness, the reply is that conversion as the initial Spirit-wrought act includes both graces inseparably, but their formal relations to justification and sanctification remain distinct. The same Sun that melts ice also gladdens the fields. Faith receives Christ and his righteousness; repentance immediately begins the melting of sin’s reign. The gospel does not ask us to tidy up before coming, nor does it leave us as it finds us.

We end where we began, with the double motion. The sinner is called to turn to Christ and to turn from sin. The form of the turn is shaped by union. Christ himself is both our righteousness and our sanctification. Faith unites to him and so receives the first; repentance is born from that union and grows as the second. The honored axiom stands: faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone. This is not a theological slogan. It is a pathway for the conscience to walk: empty hands stretched out to receive Christ, and then a life of putting to death what is earthly and walking in newness, a **repentance unto life** sustained by the same promise that justified us at first.
