# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates **faith** as an intellectual assent to divine truth, elevated by **grace**, and **repentance** (penance) as a necessary turning from sin, involving contrition, confession, and satisfaction. For Aquinas, both faith and repentance are infused virtues essential for **justification** and **salvation**, operating within the framework of **sacramental theology** and the **ordo salutis**.

- "Faith is the habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the intellect assent to what is non-apparent." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 4, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially II-II, qq. 1–16 (on faith) and III, qq. 84–90 (on penance)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book III (on faith and conversion)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV (on penance)
- De Veritate, q. 14 (on faith)
- Brian Davies, The Thought of Thomas Aquinas (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Supernatural Virtue**
    - Faith is an infused habit, not merely natural belief.
    - It is oriented toward **divine revelation** and transcends human reason.
    - Faith is necessary for **salvation** and is the foundation of the Christian life.
    - It involves both the intellect (assent) and the will (consent).
    - "Faith denotes a habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the intellect assent to what is non-apparent." (ST II-II, q. 4, a. 1)

2. **Repentance as Sacramental Penance**
    - Repentance is not only an inward act but also a sacramental action.
    - It consists of contrition, confession, and satisfaction.
    - True repentance is motivated by **love of God** rather than fear of punishment.
    - Penance restores the sinner to **grace** after mortal sin.
    - "Penance is a sacrament, in so far as it is a certain action, whereby the penitent is absolved by the priest." (ST III, q. 84, a. 1)

3. **Faith Precedes and Informs Repentance**
    - Faith is logically prior to repentance; one must believe to truly repent.
    - Repentance presupposes knowledge of sin and trust in divine mercy.
    - The act of penance is made efficacious by faith in **Christ’s atonement**.
    - Without faith, repentance is incomplete and lacks salvific effect.
    - "No one can repent rightly unless he believes." (ST III, q. 85, a. 2)

4. **Justification Involves Both Faith and Repentance**
    - Justification is a process involving the infusion of grace.
    - Faith and repentance cooperate with grace in the movement from sin to righteousness.
    - Both are necessary dispositions for receiving the effects of the sacraments.
    - The will’s turning from sin (repentance) and toward God (faith) are inseparable.
    - "The justification of the ungodly includes a movement of the free-will towards God through faith, and a movement of the free-will against sin, which is repentance." (ST I-II, q. 113, a. 4)

5. **Assurance and the Role of Grace**
    - Certitude of faith is grounded in **God’s authority**, not subjective feeling.
    - Repentance is always enabled by prevenient and cooperating grace.
    - Assurance of forgiveness comes through the sacrament of penance, not private conviction.
    - Human cooperation is real but always subordinate to divine initiative.
    - "It is by grace that man is moved to believe and to repent." (ST I-II, q. 109, a. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **faith** and **repentance** shaped the Roman Catholic understanding of the **ordo salutis** and the sacramental system, especially the theology of penance. His distinction between the intellectual and volitional aspects of faith influenced later scholastic and Reformed debates. Aquinas’s integration of **grace**, human cooperation, and sacramental efficacy continues to inform ecumenical dialogues and remains foundational for Catholic doctrine on justification and conversion.
