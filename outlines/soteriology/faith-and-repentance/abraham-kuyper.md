# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **faith and repentance** as inseparable elements of the **ordo salutis**, emphasizing their roots in **regeneration** and the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Kuyper, true faith is a supernatural gift, not a human achievement, and repentance is the Spirit-wrought turning from sin that accompanies the embrace of Christ. Both are grounded in the **covenantal relationship** between God and His people.

- "Faith is not a work of man, but a work of God in man." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as a Divine Gift**
    - Faith arises from **regeneration**, not human initiative.
    - The Holy Spirit implants faith in the heart, enabling trust in Christ.
    - Faith is not mere assent but a living, vital union with Christ.
    - Human will is passive in the initial act of faith.
    - "Faith is wrought in us by the Holy Spirit, and is not the product of our own will." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

2. **Repentance as Spirit-Wrought Conversion**
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith in the process of salvation.
    - It involves a radical turning from sin, enabled by grace.
    - True repentance is not self-generated but the fruit of the Spirit’s work.
    - Repentance is ongoing, marking the entire Christian life.
    - "Repentance is the fruit of the Spirit’s operation, not the cause of regeneration." (E Voto Dordraceno)

3. **Covenantal Context of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are exercised within the context of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The covenant community is the sphere where the Spirit ordinarily works.
    - Baptism and the means of grace nurture faith and repentance.
    - The promises of God undergird the believer’s response.
    - "The covenant is the womb in which faith and repentance are conceived and nourished." (E Voto Dordraceno)

4. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions**
    - Faith has an objective ground in Christ’s finished work.
    - The subjective experience of faith is the Spirit’s application of redemption.
    - Repentance involves both sorrow for sin and a new obedience.
    - Assurance flows from the objectivity of Christ’s work, not the strength of one’s faith.
    - "Faith rests not in itself, but in the objective reality of Christ’s atonement." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

5. **Antithesis and the New Life**
    - Faith and repentance mark the believer’s entrance into the **antithesis** between church and world.
    - The regenerate live in conscious opposition to sin and unbelief.
    - The new life is characterized by continual repentance and growing faith.
    - The Spirit sustains the believer in this ongoing spiritual conflict.
    - "The antithesis is maintained by faith and repentance, which set the believer apart from the world." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust articulation of **faith and repentance** as Spirit-wrought responses within the covenant community has deeply influenced Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology. His emphasis on the **sovereignty of God** and the necessity of regeneration shaped later Neo-Calvinist thought and practice. Kuyper’s integration of doctrinal precision with pastoral application continues to inform discussions on conversion and the Christian life, especially in traditions that stress the primacy of divine grace in salvation.
