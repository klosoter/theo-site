# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **faith and repentance** as essential components of **justification** and **salvation** within the **covenant of grace**. Faith is defined as the sole instrument by which sinners receive and rest upon **Christ alone for salvation**, while repentance is inseparably joined to faith as a turning from sin unto God, marked by sincere grief and new obedience. Both are presented as **gifts of God**, necessary for entrance into the benefits of the gospel.

- "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification; yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love." (Westminster Confession of Faith 11.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 11, 14, and 15)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 70–73, 153–155)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 85–87)
- The Westminster Assembly’s Annotations on the Confession and Catechisms
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as the Sole Instrument of Justification**
    - Faith alone unites the believer to Christ and appropriates His righteousness.
    - Faith is not a meritorious work but an empty hand receiving Christ.
    - Justification is by faith alone, yet faith is never alone but accompanied by other graces.
    - Faith is always directed to Christ as He is offered in the gospel.
    - "Faith...is the alone instrument of justification." (WCF 11.2)

2. **Repentance as an Evangelical Grace**
    - Repentance is a saving grace, wrought by the Spirit and the Word.
    - It involves a true sense of sin, apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ, and turning from sin to God.
    - Repentance is necessary for all who would be saved, but not a ground of pardon.
    - It leads to new obedience and a hatred of sin.
    - "Repentance unto life is an evangelical grace..." (WCF 15.1)

3. **Faith and Repentance are Inseparable**
    - True faith is always accompanied by repentance, and vice versa.
    - Both are required for entrance into the covenant of grace.
    - Repentance flows from faith in Christ and is sustained by it.
    - The believer cannot have one without the other in the experience of salvation.
    - "Whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin...doth, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God..." (WCF 15.2)

4. **Both Faith and Repentance are Gifts of God**
    - Neither faith nor repentance arise from human ability or will.
    - Both are sovereignly granted by the Holy Spirit through the means of grace.
    - The elect are enabled to believe and repent by God’s effectual calling.
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) are the ordinary channels for these gifts.
    - "The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe..." (WCF 14.1)

5. **Necessity of Ongoing Repentance and Faith**
    - Repentance is not only initial but continues throughout the Christian life.
    - Believers must renew their faith and repentance daily as they battle remaining sin.
    - There is no sin so small but it deserves damnation, nor any so great that it can bring condemnation to the truly repentant.
    - Assurance of salvation is strengthened by ongoing faith and repentance.
    - "There is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation; yet there is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly repent." (WCF 15.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, establishing the classic Protestant understanding of **faith and repentance** as twin graces essential to salvation. Their careful distinction between faith as the instrument of justification and repentance as an inseparable, yet non-meritorious, grace has influenced confessional documents and catechetical instruction across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The Standards’ teaching continues to serve as a doctrinal benchmark for churches and seminaries worldwide, ensuring clarity and fidelity in the proclamation of the gospel.
