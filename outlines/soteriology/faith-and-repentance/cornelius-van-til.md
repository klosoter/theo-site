# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **faith and repentance** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing their inseparability as gifts of **sovereign grace**. He insisted that both are responses to the self-attesting revelation of the **triune God**, grounded in a presuppositional epistemology that rejects all forms of **autonomous reasoning** in coming to Christ.

- "Faith and repentance are not the products of autonomous man but are the gifts of God, wrought by the Holy Spirit through the Word." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Inseparable Graces**
    - Both are wrought by the **Holy Spirit** and cannot be separated in the experience of salvation.
    - They are responses to the objective revelation of God in Christ.
    - Repentance involves a turning from **autonomy** to submission to God's authority.
    - Faith is trust in the self-attesting Christ of Scripture, not a leap into the unknown.
    - "Faith and repentance are two sides of the same coin, both necessary responses to the gospel." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Presuppositional Nature of Faith**
    - Faith is not a neutral or autonomous act but presupposes the truth of **God’s revelation**.
    - The unbeliever suppresses the truth in unrighteousness, making repentance a radical change of presuppositions.
    - Faith involves a whole-person commitment to the triune God, not mere intellectual assent.
    - Saving faith is distinguished from mere historical or temporary faith by its source in regeneration.
    - "Faith is not a probability judgment but a presuppositional commitment to the God who speaks." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Repentance as Epistemological Reorientation**
    - Repentance is not merely moral but involves a fundamental change in one’s view of knowledge and authority.
    - It is a turning from self-sufficiency to dependence on God’s revelation.
    - True repentance rejects all forms of **autonomous reasoning**.
    - It is inseparable from faith, as both are responses to the same divine initiative.
    - "Repentance is the abandonment of all attempts at autonomy in thought and life." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Monergistic Work of the Spirit**
    - Both faith and repentance are gifts, not products of human effort.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work sovereignly and effectually.
    - Human will is renewed and enabled to respond only by divine initiative.
    - Assurance of faith is grounded in the Spirit’s testimony, not subjective experience.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who enables men to repent and believe, not their own native powers." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal Context of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance occur within the context of God’s **covenant relationship** with His people.
    - The covenant frames the promises and demands of the gospel.
    - Both are necessary for entrance into and continuation in the covenant community.
    - The church proclaims the call to faith and repentance as the means by which God gathers His elect.
    - "The covenant God calls men to faith and repentance as the means of entering into fellowship with Himself." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **faith and repentance** as inseparable, Spirit-wrought graces within a presuppositional framework has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and soteriology. His emphasis on the antithesis between **autonomy** and submission to divine revelation continues to influence discussions on conversion and the nature of saving faith. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of covenantal apologetics and the defense of the necessity of regeneration for true repentance and faith.
