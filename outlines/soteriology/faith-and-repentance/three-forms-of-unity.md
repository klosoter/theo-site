# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of **faith and repentance** as essential elements of the ordo salutis. They emphasize that **saving faith** is a gift of God, inseparable from **true repentance**, and both are necessary responses to the gospel, wrought by the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the elect. These confessions stress the inseparability of **justification by faith alone** and the **renewal of life** that issues in repentance.

- "True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in His Word, but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the gospel in my heart." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 20–23, 60, 88–90
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 22–24
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV, Articles 11–14
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, *An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism* (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Knowledge and Confidence**
    - Faith involves both **intellectual assent** to the truth of the gospel and **personal trust** in Christ.
    - It is not mere historical faith, but a living, Spirit-wrought conviction.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which sinners receive **justification** and all Christ’s benefits.
    - Assurance is an integral part of true faith, grounded in the promises of God.
    - "Faith is a sure knowledge and a firm confidence." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

2. **Repentance as Conversion**
    - Repentance is described as the **mortification of the old nature** and the **vivification of the new**.
    - It is inseparable from faith, marking the beginning of the Christian life.
    - True repentance involves heartfelt sorrow for sin and a sincere desire to live according to God’s will.
    - Repentance is ongoing, not a single act, but a continual turning from sin.
    - "It is the dying of the old nature and the coming to life of the new." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 88)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Gifts of Grace**
    - Both faith and repentance are **sovereign gifts** of the Holy Spirit, not products of human effort.
    - The Canons of Dort stress the **monergistic** work of God in regeneration and conversion.
    - Human will is renewed and enabled by grace to respond in faith and repentance.
    - This excludes all boasting and grounds assurance in God’s faithfulness.
    - "Faith is a gift of God, not because it is offered by God to man’s free will, but because it is actually conferred, instilled, and infused into him." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 14)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is received by faith alone, apart from works, as taught in the Belgic Confession.
    - Good works and repentance are fruits and evidences of true faith, not grounds for acceptance.
    - The believer’s assurance rests on Christ’s righteousness imputed, not on the quality of faith or repentance.
    - Faith is always accompanied by repentance, but only faith justifies.
    - "We do not mean that faith itself justifies us... but only as it is an instrument with which we embrace Christ." (Belgic Confession, Article 22)

5. **Necessity of New Obedience**
    - The confessions insist that **sanctification** follows justification as the necessary fruit of faith and repentance.
    - Repentance issues in a life of gratitude and new obedience to God’s law.
    - The Christian’s ongoing struggle against sin is evidence of the Spirit’s work.
    - Good works are necessary as the evidence of true faith, though they do not merit salvation.
    - "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Belgic Confession, Article 24)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the Reformed tradition’s understanding of **faith and repentance** as inseparable, Spirit-wrought responses to the gospel. Their teaching has provided a confessional standard for Reformed churches worldwide, emphasizing the necessity of both **justification by faith alone** and the ongoing renewal of life. These documents continue to inform catechesis, preaching, and pastoral care, ensuring that the doctrines of faith and repentance remain central to Reformed identity and practice.
