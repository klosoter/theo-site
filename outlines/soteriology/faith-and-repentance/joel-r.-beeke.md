# Joel R. Beeke (1952– )

Joel R. Beeke, a leading figure in **Reformed experiential theology**, emphasizes that **faith and repentance** are inseparable graces wrought by the **Holy Spirit** in the heart of the believer. He stresses that true **saving faith** is always accompanied by heartfelt **repentance**, both of which are essential components of **conversion** and the ongoing life of **sanctification**.

- "Faith and repentance are twin graces that always accompany each other in the soul’s turning to God." ("Reformed Preaching")

## Key Works

- Reformed Systematic Theology, Vol. 2: Man and Christ (with Paul Smalley)
- The Quest for Full Assurance: The Legacy of Calvin and His Successors
- Puritan Reformed Spirituality
- Living for God’s Glory: An Introduction to Calvinism
- Reformed Preaching: Proclaiming God’s Word from the Heart of the Preacher to the Heart of His People

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and repentance as inseparable graces**
    - Faith and repentance are always found together in genuine conversion.
    - Both are gifts of **sovereign grace** produced by the Holy Spirit.
    - Repentance is not a precondition for faith, but its inseparable companion.
    - The absence of either indicates a spurious profession.
    - "Wherever there is true faith, there is true repentance; and wherever there is true repentance, there is true faith." (Reformed Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Experiential nature of faith**
    - Faith is more than intellectual assent; it involves trust and personal reliance on Christ.
    - True faith engages the whole person: mind, heart, and will.
    - Assurance grows out of experiential communion with Christ.
    - Faith is evidenced by a transformed life and ongoing repentance.
    - "Faith is not merely a notional assent to the truth, but a hearty trust in Christ as He is freely offered in the gospel." (The Quest for Full Assurance)

3. **Repentance as evangelical, not merely legal**
    - Repentance is motivated by the gospel, not just fear of punishment.
    - It involves sorrow for sin as an offense against a gracious God.
    - Evangelical repentance leads to a turning from sin and a turning to Christ.
    - It is ongoing throughout the Christian life, not a one-time act.
    - "Evangelical repentance flows from faith in Christ and is sustained by the Spirit’s work in the believer’s heart." (Puritan Reformed Spirituality)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in faith and repentance**
    - The Spirit regenerates the heart, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Both graces are impossible apart from the Spirit’s sovereign work.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - Assurance and growth in faith and repentance are fruits of the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - "Without the Spirit’s regenerating work, neither faith nor repentance can exist in the soul." (Reformed Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Pastoral application and assurance**
    - Pastors must call hearers to both faith and repentance.
    - Assurance is nurtured by examining the presence of these graces.
    - The Puritan tradition provides rich resources for guiding souls in self-examination.
    - True assurance is grounded in Christ, evidenced by faith and repentance, and confirmed by the Spirit.
    - "Assurance grows as believers see the fruits of faith and repentance in their lives, by the Spirit’s testimony." (The Quest for Full Assurance)
