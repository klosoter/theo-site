# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck understood **faith and repentance** as inseparable graces within the ordo salutis, both rooted in union with Christ and wrought by the Holy Spirit. He emphasized that **faith** is a receptive instrument, uniting the believer to Christ, while **repentance** is the necessary turning from sin that accompanies genuine trust in the gospel. For Bavinck, both are gifts of **regenerating grace** and are essential to the believer’s participation in salvation.

- "Faith and repentance are not two separate acts, but two sides of the same act of conversion." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as the Instrumental Cause of Justification**
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, serving as the means by which justification is received.
    - It is not a meritorious work but a receptive, God-given trust in Christ’s finished work.
    - Faith looks away from self and rests solely on the promises of the gospel.
    - The object of faith is always Christ as revealed in Scripture.
    - "Faith is not a work but a relinquishing of all work, a resting in Christ alone." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

2. **Repentance as a Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Repentance arises from the new life imparted by the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
    - It involves a genuine sorrow for sin and a turning to God in obedience.
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith, both being aspects of conversion.
    - True repentance is ongoing, characterizing the entire Christian life.
    - "Repentance is the reverse side of faith; both are wrought by the Spirit in the heart of the believer." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Divine Gifts**
    - Both faith and repentance are graciously given by God, not produced by human effort.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work by enabling faith and repentance.
    - Human inability necessitates the sovereign initiative of God in salvation.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on God’s promise, not on the strength of faith or repentance.
    - "Faith and repentance are gifts of grace, fruits of the Spirit’s regenerating work." ("Saved by Grace")

4. **The Necessity of Both for Salvation**
    - Faith and repentance are both necessary responses to the gospel call.
    - Neither can exist in isolation; true faith always produces repentance, and true repentance flows from faith.
    - The call to conversion in Scripture always includes both elements.
    - The absence of either indicates a deficient response to the gospel.
    - "Wherever faith is, there is also repentance; and wherever repentance is, there is also faith." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

5. **Ongoing Character of Repentance in the Christian Life**
    - Repentance is not a one-time act but a continual turning from sin.
    - The believer’s life is marked by ongoing renewal and mortification of sin.
    - Daily repentance is evidence of the Spirit’s sanctifying work.
    - The Christian’s assurance grows as faith and repentance deepen over time.
    - "Repentance is a lifelong process, inseparable from the life of faith." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of **faith and repentance** has shaped Reformed soteriology by emphasizing their inseparability and grounding both in the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit. His nuanced treatment safeguards the doctrines of grace while calling believers to a life of continual conversion. Bavinck’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of the ordo salutis, pastoral theology, and the relationship between justification and sanctification. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a balanced, biblically grounded understanding of conversion.
