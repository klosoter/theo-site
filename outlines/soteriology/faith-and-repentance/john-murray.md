# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robustly Reformed understanding of **faith and repentance** as inseparable aspects of **conversion** and the application of **redemption**. He emphasized that both are sovereign gifts of **God’s grace**, integrally united in the experience of **union with Christ**, and essential to the doctrine of **justification** and **sanctification**.

- "Faith and repentance are inseparable and simultaneous, though repentance is not to be equated with faith nor faith with repentance." ("Redemption: Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Inseparable Graces**
    - Faith and repentance are distinct yet always conjoined in the application of salvation.
    - Both are wrought by the Holy Spirit in the heart of the believer.
    - Repentance is never meritorious, but always accompanies saving faith.
    - The exercise of faith necessarily involves a turning from sin (repentance).
    - "There is no faith in Christ unto salvation apart from a radical change of heart, mind, and life." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Faith as Trust in Christ Alone**
    - Faith is not mere assent but personal trust in the person and work of Christ.
    - It rests exclusively on Christ’s righteousness for justification.
    - Faith is receptive, not contributory, to salvation.
    - Assurance is of the essence of faith, though not always of its exercise.
    - "Faith is essentially receiving and resting upon Christ alone for salvation." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Repentance as Turning from Sin to God**
    - Repentance involves a genuine sorrow for sin and a resolve to forsake it.
    - It is a turning from sin unto God, not merely a change of mind.
    - True repentance is inseparable from faith and is a continual aspect of the Christian life.
    - Repentance is the fruit of regeneration, not its cause.
    - "Repentance is a change of mind and heart, a turning from sin unto God." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Monergistic Origin of Faith and Repentance**
    - Both faith and repentance are gifts of God, not products of human effort.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables the acts of faith and repentance.
    - The Holy Spirit effectually calls and imparts new life, resulting in conversion.
    - Human responsibility is upheld, but divine sovereignty is primary.
    - "It is by the sovereign and efficacious operation of the Holy Spirit that faith and repentance are wrought in us." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Faith and Repentance in the Ordo Salutis**
    - Faith and repentance are part of the application of redemption, following effectual calling and regeneration.
    - They are the means by which the benefits of Christ’s work are received.
    - Both are necessary for justification and entrance into the Christian life.
    - Their ongoing exercise is essential for sanctification and growth in grace.
    - "The faith that is unto salvation is a penitent faith and the repentance that is unto life is a believing repentance." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **faith and repentance** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, especially in the context of the **ordo salutis** and the inseparability of conversion graces. His careful exegesis and theological precision continue to influence contemporary discussions on the nature of saving faith and evangelical repentance. By emphasizing the monergistic work of the Holy Spirit and the necessity of both faith and repentance, Murray provided a framework that safeguards both the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man in salvation.
