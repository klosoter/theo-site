# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame understands **faith and repentance** as inseparable, Spirit-enabled responses to the **gospel**, rooted in the sovereign **grace of God** and the comprehensive **lordship of Christ**. He places both within the **ordo salutis**, emphasizing their mutual dependence and the necessity of the whole person’s involvement, consistent with his **triperspectival** approach.

- "Faith and repentance are two sides of the same coin; you cannot have one without the other." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Inseparable**
    - Faith and repentance are distinct but always occur together in true **conversion**.
    - Both are responses to the **gospel call** and are enabled by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Repentance is not merely sorrow for sin but a turning to Christ in faith.
    - Saving faith necessarily includes a repentant disposition toward sin.
    "Faith and repentance are not two separate steps, but two aspects of one response to God’s grace." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Triperspectival Understanding**
    - Faith and repentance involve the whole person: intellect (normative), will (situational), and emotions (existential).
    - This approach avoids reductionism and integrates doctrinal, ethical, and experiential dimensions.
    - Faith includes knowledge, assent, and trust; repentance involves conviction, contrition, and change.
    - Both are seen as dynamic, ongoing realities in the Christian life.
    "We must see faith and repentance from multiple perspectives to grasp their full biblical meaning." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Grounded in the Lordship of Christ**
    - Faith and repentance are responses to Christ’s comprehensive **lordship**.
    - Repentance is a turning from all idols to the living Lord.
    - Faith is personal trust in Christ as Savior, Lord, and God.
    - Both are acts of allegiance to the risen Christ.
    "To trust Christ is to submit to him as Lord, and to repent is to turn from all that opposes his rule." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Monergistic Work of Grace**
    - Both faith and repentance are gifts of **God’s grace**, not products of human effort.
    - The **Holy Spirit** effectually calls and enables the sinner’s response.
    - Human responsibility is upheld, but divine sovereignty is ultimate.
    - Assurance rests on God’s promise, not the strength of one’s faith or repentance.
    "Faith and repentance are not works we perform, but gifts God gives to his people." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

5. **Ongoing Necessity in the Christian Life**
    - Faith and repentance are not only initial acts but continual attitudes.
    - The believer’s life is marked by ongoing trust in Christ and turning from sin.
    - **Sanctification** involves deepening both faith and repentance.
    - Assurance and growth are fostered by continual reliance on Christ.
    "The Christian life is a life of continual faith and continual repentance." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **faith and repentance** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his **triperspectivalism** and focus on the lordship of Christ. His integrated approach has influenced pastors, theologians, and students seeking a holistic understanding of conversion and sanctification. Frame’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between faith, repentance, and the Christian life.
