# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl redefined **faith** and **repentance** within the framework of his ethical and communal understanding of **Christianity**. For Ritschl, faith is not assent to doctrinal propositions but a practical trust in God as revealed in the **community of believers**, while repentance is a moral turning shaped by the values of the **Kingdom of God** rather than forensic guilt. Both are oriented toward the transformation of life and society rather than individual justification before God.

- "Faith is the conviction that through the community of believers, the purpose of God is realized in the world." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Its History
- Theology and Metaphysics
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Ritschl and Luther: A Fresh Perspective (secondary, ed. Brian A. Gerrish)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Practical Trust**
    - Faith is defined by a personal, practical trust in God, not assent to metaphysical propositions.
    - The object of faith is God as revealed in the historical person of Jesus and the Christian community.
    - Faith is oriented toward the realization of the **Kingdom of God** in ethical life.
    - Faith is inseparable from the believer’s participation in the community.
    - "Faith is not the acceptance of dogma, but the assurance of God’s grace in the fellowship of the Kingdom." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Repentance as Moral Transformation**
    - Repentance is a turning from self-centeredness to the values of the Christian community.
    - It is not primarily about legal guilt but about moral renewal.
    - Repentance is inseparable from the ethical demands of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The process is communal, not merely individual.
    - "Repentance is the moral reorientation of the will toward the good of the community." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
    - Ritschl rejects the traditional forensic or legal understanding of justification and repentance.
    - He views faith and repentance as relational and ethical, not juridical.
    - The focus is on reconciliation within the community, not legal acquittal before God.
    - The categories of guilt and punishment are subordinated to those of moral development.
    - "The legal conception of justification must yield to the ethical reality of reconciliation." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Centrality of the Kingdom of God**
    - Faith and repentance are oriented toward the establishment of the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The Kingdom is understood as a moral community, not a future eschatological event.
    - Both faith and repentance serve the realization of God’s purpose in history.
    - The ethical life of the community is the primary context for these doctrines.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the sphere in which faith and repentance find their true meaning." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Historical and Communal Mediation**
    - Faith and repentance are mediated through the historical community of believers.
    - The church is the locus where God’s purpose is realized and experienced.
    - Individual experience is always interpreted within the communal context.
    - The historical Jesus and his community are the foundation for understanding these doctrines.
    - "The historical community is the medium through which faith and repentance are actualized." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s redefinition of **faith** and **repentance** shifted the focus of Protestant theology from individual justification to ethical transformation within the community. His emphasis on the **Kingdom of God** as a present, moral reality influenced later liberal theology and the Social Gospel movement. While criticized by confessional theologians for downplaying doctrinal and forensic categories, Ritschl’s work remains pivotal in discussions of the ethical and communal dimensions of Christian life.
