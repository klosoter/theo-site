# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure of **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a robust doctrine of **faith and repentance** as essential components of **justification** and **conversion**. He emphasized that **saving faith** is a trust in Christ alone for salvation, inseparable from genuine **repentance**, which involves a turning from sin to God. For Hodge, both are gifts of **grace**, wrought by the **Holy Spirit** in the heart of the believer.

- "Repentance and faith are twin graces; they always go together, and the one cannot exist without the other." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Trust in Christ Alone**
    - Faith is not mere intellectual assent but a personal trust in the person and work of Christ.
    - It involves the whole soul—mind, will, and affections—resting upon Christ for salvation.
    - Faith is the sole instrument of **justification**, excluding all human merit.
    - Saving faith is always directed toward Christ as revealed in the gospel.
    - "Faith, in the evangelical sense, is receiving and resting upon Christ alone for salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Repentance as Turning from Sin to God**
    - Repentance is a change of mind, heart, and will regarding sin and God.
    - It involves sorrow for sin, hatred of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it.
    - True repentance is inseparable from faith and is evidence of regeneration.
    - Repentance is not a meritorious work but a necessary response to the gospel.
    - "Repentance is turning from sin unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Gifts of Grace**
    - Both faith and repentance are wrought in the soul by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - They are not produced by human effort or natural ability.
    - The grace of God precedes and enables the sinner’s response in faith and repentance.
    - Regeneration is the root from which both faith and repentance spring.
    - "It is the office of the Holy Spirit to produce repentance and faith in the hearts of men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **The Necessity of Both for Salvation**
    - Neither faith nor repentance can be absent in genuine conversion.
    - Faith without repentance is spurious; repentance without faith is incomplete.
    - Both are required for entrance into the state of **justification** and **union with Christ**.
    - The gospel call always includes a summons to both faith and repentance.
    - "Where there is no repentance, there is no faith; and where there is no faith, there is no repentance." (The Way of Life)

5. **The Ongoing Nature of Repentance in the Christian Life**
    - Repentance is not only initial but continues throughout the believer’s life.
    - The Christian is called to daily turn from sin and renew faith in Christ.
    - Ongoing repentance is evidence of sanctification and spiritual growth.
    - Assurance of salvation is strengthened by continual faith and repentance.
    - "Repentance is not a single act, but a permanent disposition of the soul." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **faith and repentance** shaped generations of Reformed and evangelical theology, especially through his influence at Princeton Seminary. His insistence on the inseparability of faith and repentance as gifts of grace remains a hallmark of confessional **Reformed soteriology**. Hodge’s careful distinctions and biblical exegesis continue to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of conversion and the ordo salutis. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a Christ-centered, grace-driven understanding of salvation.
