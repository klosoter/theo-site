# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen taught that **faith and repentance** are inseparable graces in the application of **salvation**, both grounded in the sovereign work of **God’s grace**. He emphasized that **saving faith** is not mere intellectual assent but a personal trust in **Christ’s finished work**, while **repentance** is a genuine turning from sin to God. Both are essential for **justification** and the Christian life.

- "Faith means not doing something, but receiving something; it means not performing, but accepting." (What Is Faith?)

## Key Works

- What Is Faith?
- Christianity and Liberalism
- The Christian View of Man
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World
- God Transcendent

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Personal Trust in Christ**
    - Faith is more than intellectual agreement; it is a wholehearted trust in the person and work of Christ.
    - **Saving faith** involves knowledge, assent, and trust, with trust being central.
    - Faith looks away from self and rests entirely on **Christ’s righteousness**.
    - Machen rejects any view that reduces faith to mere assent to doctrine.
    "Faith, in the Christian sense, is trust reposed in a person." (What Is Faith?)

2. **Repentance as a Turning from Sin to God**
    - Repentance is a genuine change of mind and heart regarding sin.
    - It involves sorrow for sin and a resolve to forsake it.
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith; both are wrought by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Machen insists repentance is not a meritorious work but a response to **grace**.
    "Repentance is not a work which we perform in order to earn salvation, but it is a turning away from sin in response to God’s grace." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Gifts of God**
    - Both faith and repentance originate from **God’s sovereign initiative**.
    - Human effort cannot produce true faith or repentance apart from divine grace.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the sinner to believe and repent.
    - Machen opposes any synergistic understanding of **conversion**.
    "It is God who enables us to believe; it is God who gives repentance unto life." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - **Justification** is received through faith alone, not by works or repentance as a ground.
    - Repentance accompanies faith but is not the basis of justification.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, whose **righteousness is imputed**.
    - Machen defends the Reformation doctrine of **sola fide** against modernist distortions.
    "The ground of our acceptance with God is not our repentance, but Christ’s finished work received by faith." (Christianity and Liberalism)

5. **Necessity of Both Faith and Repentance in Salvation**
    - Both faith and repentance are necessary responses to the **gospel call**.
    - They are distinct yet inseparable graces in the experience of **conversion**.
    - The absence of either indicates an incomplete response to the gospel.
    - Machen warns against separating or conflating the two in Christian teaching.
    "Where there is true faith, there is also true repentance; and where there is true repentance, there is also true faith." (What Is Faith?)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust articulation of **faith and repentance** helped preserve Reformed orthodoxy amid early twentieth-century theological liberalism. His insistence on the necessity of both graces shaped evangelical understandings of **conversion** and the doctrine of justification. Machen’s writings continue to influence Reformed and Presbyterian thought, especially in defending the integrity of the gospel against reductionistic or moralistic distortions. His legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the primacy of **God’s grace** in salvation.
