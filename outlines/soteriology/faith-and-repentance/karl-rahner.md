# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **faith and repentance** through the lens of his **transcendental theology**, emphasizing the universal human openness to **God’s self-communication**. For Rahner, **faith** is a supernatural existential, a graced response to God’s offer of Himself, while **repentance** is the ongoing conversion of the whole person in light of this encounter. Both are rooted in the mystery of **grace** and the dynamic relationship between human freedom and divine initiative.

- "Faith is the free and grace-enabled acceptance of God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Hearer of the Word

- Spirit in the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Supernatural Existential**
    - Faith is not merely assent to propositions but a fundamental, graced orientation toward God.
    - Every person is endowed with a capacity for God, which is actualized in faith.
    - Faith involves both knowledge and trust, rooted in God’s self-revelation.
    - The act of faith is always enabled by **grace**, not human effort alone.
    - "Faith is the basic act of the whole person, made possible by God’s prevenient grace." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Repentance as Ongoing Conversion**
    - Repentance is not a one-time act but a lifelong process of turning toward God.
    - It involves the transformation of the entire person, not just sorrow for individual sins.
    - True repentance is inseparable from faith, as both are responses to God’s self-gift.
    - Conversion is both personal and communal, affecting one’s relationship with God and others.
    - "Conversion is the radical reorientation of one’s life toward the mystery of God." (Theological Investigations)

3. **Grace as God’s Self-Communication**
    - Grace is understood as God’s self-gift, not a created substance or external aid.
    - Human openness to grace is universal, forming the basis for both faith and repentance.
    - Grace precedes, accompanies, and enables every human response to God.
    - The experience of grace is mediated through history, community, and sacrament.
    - "Grace is nothing other than God himself, communicating himself to man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Freedom and Responsibility in Faith and Repentance**
    - Human freedom is respected and elevated by grace, not overridden.
    - Faith and repentance require a free, personal response to God’s initiative.
    - The possibility of rejecting grace (sin) underscores the seriousness of human responsibility.
    - Authentic faith and repentance are never coerced but always invited.
    - "God’s grace does not destroy freedom but brings it to fulfillment." (Theological Investigations)

5. **The Anonymous Christian and Universal Offer of Salvation**
    - Rahner’s concept of the "anonymous Christian" suggests that faith and repentance can occur outside explicit Christian boundaries.
    - God’s self-communication is universally offered, making salvation possible for all.
    - Implicit faith and repentance are real, even if not formally articulated.
    - This view emphasizes the inclusivity of God’s salvific will and the mystery of grace at work in all people.
    - "A non-Christian can, in his basic orientation and fundamental decision, accept God’s self-communication, even if he does not recognize it explicitly in Christian terms." (Theological Investigations)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **faith and repentance** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic thought, especially in its emphasis on the universality of grace and the existential dimension of conversion. His integration of **transcendental philosophy** with traditional doctrines opened new avenues for dialogue with contemporary culture and other religions. Rahner’s influence endures in discussions of **grace**, **salvation**, and the ongoing nature of conversion within the Church and beyond.
