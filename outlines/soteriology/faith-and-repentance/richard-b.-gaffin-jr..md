# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. teaches that **faith and repentance** are inseparable, Spirit-wrought responses that together mark the believer’s entrance into and ongoing participation in **union with Christ**. He maintains that faith alone is the instrument of **justification**, while repentance is its necessary fruit, both grounded in the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit** and central to the application of redemption.

- "Faith and repentance are inseparable, Spirit-worked responses to the gospel, together constituting the initial and ongoing turning to God in Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (in "The Glory of the Atonement")
- "Redemption and Resurrection" (Westminster Theological Journal articles)
- "Calvin and the Sabbath" (for historical context on repentance and faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as the Sole Instrument of Justification**
    - Faith alone unites the believer to Christ and appropriates His righteousness.
    - Justification is grounded in Christ’s work, not in the quality or presence of repentance.
    - Repentance is always present where faith is genuine, but does not itself justify.
    - Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit, not a human achievement.
    "Faith is the exclusive instrument by which Christ and his benefits are received." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Repentance as the Necessary Fruit of Faith**
    - Repentance is inseparable from saving faith but logically follows it.
    - True faith always issues in a turning from sin and toward God.
    - Repentance is not a meritorious work but evidence of Spirit-wrought renewal.
    - The ongoing life of repentance marks the believer’s sanctification.
    "Repentance is the necessary and inseparable fruit of faith, not its ground or co-instrument." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Union with Christ as the Redemptive Context**
    - Faith and repentance are both aspects of the believer’s union with Christ.
    - All benefits of salvation, including justification and sanctification, flow from this union.
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s work by uniting believers to Him through faith.
    - Repentance is the believer’s response within this vital union.
    "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality, with faith and repentance as its experiential outworking." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

4. **The Eschatological Structure of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are shaped by the already/not yet of redemptive history.
    - The resurrection of Christ grounds the believer’s new life and ongoing repentance.
    - The Spirit’s work is both inaugurating (conversion) and continuing (sanctification).
    - Assurance is rooted in Christ’s finished work, not in the perfection of faith or repentance.
    "The resurrection of Christ is the eschatological event that shapes the believer’s faith and repentance." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

5. **The Spirit’s Sovereign Role in Faith and Repentance**
    - Both faith and repentance are sovereignly wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    - Human response is real but enabled and sustained by divine initiative.
    - The Spirit unites the believer to Christ, effecting both trust and transformation.
    - The Christian life is marked by dependence on the Spirit for ongoing faith and repentance.
    "The Spirit is the agent of union with Christ, effecting both faith and repentance in the believer." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **union with Christ** as the context for faith and repentance has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology. His insistence on the inseparability of faith and repentance, while maintaining the unique instrumental role of faith in justification, has clarified debates on the ordo salutis. Gaffin’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a robust, biblically grounded understanding of the application of redemption.
