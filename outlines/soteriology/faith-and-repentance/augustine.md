# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **faith and repentance** is foundational for Western Christianity, emphasizing the necessity of **divine grace** for both. He teaches that **faith** is a gift from God, preceding and enabling **repentance**, which involves a turning of the will from sin to God. Both are inseparable aspects of **conversion** and are rooted in the transformative work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "No one can believe unless God calls him, and no one can turn to God unless God himself converts him." (Enchiridion 32)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- On the Predestination of the Saints
- Sermons (various, especially on the Psalms and Gospel of John)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith is a gift of grace**
    - Faith originates not from human will but from God’s sovereign initiative.
    - The human heart is incapable of true faith apart from **regenerating grace**.
    - Faith is the beginning of salvation and the root of all other virtues.
    - God grants faith to the elect according to his eternal purpose.
    - "For what do we have that we did not receive?" (On the Spirit and the Letter)

2. **Repentance is inseparable from faith**
    - Repentance is not merely sorrow for sin but a turning to God enabled by faith.
    - True repentance flows from a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith and repentance together constitute the initial movement of conversion.
    - Both are ongoing realities in the Christian life, not one-time acts.
    - "He who believes and turns to God in repentance is healed by the Physician." (Sermon 352)

3. **Necessity of divine initiative**
    - Human beings are bound by **original sin** and cannot turn to God unaided.
    - God’s prevenient grace awakens both faith and repentance in the soul.
    - The will is freed only by the Spirit’s work, not by autonomous choice.
    - Salvation is entirely dependent on God’s mercy and initiative.
    - "It is God who makes us both to will and to do." (On Grace and Free Will)

4. **Faith seeks understanding**
    - Faith is not irrational but seeks deeper understanding of God’s truth.
    - The famous dictum "I believe in order to understand" shapes Augustine’s approach.
    - Repentance involves a reorientation of the mind as well as the will.
    - Growth in faith leads to greater knowledge and love of God.
    - "Understand in order to believe, believe in order to understand." (Sermon 43)

5. **Ongoing need for repentance in the Christian life**
    - Christians must continually repent as they grow in holiness.
    - Even the regenerate struggle with sin and require daily renewal.
    - The life of faith is marked by humility and dependence on grace.
    - Repentance is both initial and lifelong, tied to sanctification.
    - "The whole life of a Christian is a holy longing: what you desire, as yet you do not see; but let your desire be exercised, and your heart be enlarged, that it may be filled." (Tractates on the Gospel of John)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s teaching on **faith and repentance** profoundly shaped both medieval and Reformation theology, especially in articulating the priority of **grace** over human effort. His insistence on the necessity of divine initiative influenced later doctrines of **justification** and **conversion**. Augustine’s integration of faith and repentance as inseparable aspects of the Christian life remains a cornerstone for both Catholic and Protestant traditions. His thought continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of salvation and the transformative power of grace.
