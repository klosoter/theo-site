### ESSAY
Faith and repentance belong to the heart of the ordo salutis, and oral examiners will probe whether you can hold them together without confusion or separation. The central claim to defend is that in Reformed theology **faith and repentance** are distinct yet inseparable graces, both gifts of **regeneration** and means of entering and continuing in **union with Christ**, but that **faith alone** is the sole instrument of justification while repentance is its necessary, non‑meritorious correlate, belonging to conversion and the entire Christian life. To sustain this claim under pressure, you must define the terms precisely, situate them historically, and show how they function across the loci of God, Christ, salvation, and the Christian life.

At the conceptual level, saving **faith** can be defined, in classic Reformed terms, as a Spirit‑wrought act of the whole person, involving **knowledge**, **assent**, and **trust**, by which the sinner receives and rests upon Christ alone for salvation as he is offered in the gospel. Its object is Christ in his person and mediatorial work, not generic religious truth. It is receptive, not contributory. It is the sole **instrumental cause** of justification, the empty hand that receives Christ’s righteousness. **Repentance** unto life is also a Spirit‑wrought act of the whole person, consisting in a true sense of sin, apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, grief and hatred for sin, and a turning from it to God with full purpose of and endeavor after new obedience. Its object is sin before God and the reconciling mercy of God in Christ. It is a turning, not a meritorious satisfaction. Together they form the **conversion** of the sinner, the twofold motion of turning to Christ and turning from sin. The key is to maintain that they are conceptually distinct, ordered in a logical way, but always united in the concrete act of conversion and in the ongoing believer’s life.

The Augustinian heritage provides the deep structure for later Reformed thinking. Augustine of Hippo, though he did not formulate a scholastic ordo salutis, fixed a trajectory on three points: the primacy of **grace**, the bondage of the will, and a dynamic view of faith and repentance within conversion. In his debates with Pelagius, Augustine insisted that the sinner cannot, by free will, initiate faith or repentance. Both believing and mourning over sin are effects of **prevenient grace** that liberates and sweetly inclines the will. In works like his Anti‑Pelagian writings and Confessions, Augustine portrays faith as trusting acceptance of God’s promise and repentance as the brokenness and return of the prodigal heart under the Spirit’s convicting work. Importantly, Augustine tends to speak of faith as a beginning that must be formed by love, and of repentance as a lifelong posture, but he does not sharply distinguish justification and sanctification. This will later expose a fault line: is faith counted as justifying only when “formed” by love and repentance, or is faith, considered as bare instrument receiving Christ, the sole condition of justification?

Roman Catholic development, canonized at Trent, takes certain Augustinian motifs in a direction that Reformed theology must reject. The Council of Trent describes justifying faith as accepting revelation and trusting in God’s promises, but insists that justification consists in the infusion of righteousness and inward renewal, such that faith must be **formed by charity** to justify. Repentance is treated under the sacrament of penance as including contrition, confession, absolution, and satisfaction. Here repentance has a quasi‑meritorious function, contributing to the satisfaction for temporal punishment. Under oral examination, you must be able to contrast this with the Reformed view: repentance in Reformed confessions is necessary but never meritorious and never part of the ground or instrument of justification. It is a fruit and concomitant of justifying faith, not a component of the justifying act itself.

Martin Luther reconfigures the discussion by re‑centering both faith and repentance on the external word of the gospel and the forensic character of justification. His first of the Ninety‑Five Theses declares that the entire life of the believer is to be repentance. Yet Luther’s mature theology, especially in his Galatians lectures, distinguishes sharply between law and gospel, repentance and faith. The law, through the Spirit, brings about contrition and terror; the gospel announces free forgiveness in Christ, eliciting faith. Luther famously says that repentance is not satisfaction but a change of the whole person that results from the word. But the decisive move is his insistence that **faith alone** justifies because it clings solely to Christ’s promise, while repentance, understood as sorrow over sin and dawning hatred of it, prepares for and accompanies that faith rather than forming part of its justifying role. When examiners press whether repentance is a condition for justification in Luther, you must answer that for him repentance is logically prior as the law’s work but not an additional condition alongside faith. The sinner is justified the moment he believes the gospel, yet that very faith is born from the furnace of evangelical repentance created by the preacher’s condemnation of sin.

John Calvin develops a more structurally integrated account of **faith and repentance** within a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** and the duplex gratia, the double grace of justification and sanctification. For Calvin, union with Christ is the fountain from which the entire order of salvation flows. Faith is the bond of union, the instrument by which we are grafted into Christ and receive his benefits. Justification and sanctification are inseparable yet distinct aspects of that union: justification is the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, sanctification is the Spirit’s work of renewal. Here is where repentance finds its proper place. In the Institutes, Calvin calls repentance a “consequence of faith” and “inseparably linked” to it. The gospel promise does not address those secure in sin but those whom the law has humbled, and the same Spirit who works faith works repentance. Yet he is adamant that repentance is not a part of the ground of justification, nor a co‑instrument. When Rome claimed that making repentance necessary for salvation implies it is a part of justification, Calvin responds that though repentance is never absent where faith is present, justification rests wholly in Christ’s righteousness received by faith alone.

Calvin is particularly helpful for navigating examiner challenges regarding order. Does repentance precede faith, or faith repentance? Calvin locates both in the dynamic work of the Spirit through law and gospel. Under the law, the Spirit produces a legal repentance, a dread and sorrow that can be without faith. But true evangelical repentance unto life presupposes some apprehension of divine mercy in Christ. Thus there is a kind of “preparatory” repentance under the law, but repentance as a saving grace is bound up with faith itself. Conceptually, faith has priority with respect to justification, since only faith receives Christ. Experientially, the sinner under conviction experiences law‑wrought sorrow and turning, then gospel‑wrought repose in Christ, from which arises a deeper, grateful repentance. Calvin’s insistence on the logical priority of faith in the order of grace safeguards **sola fide**, while his insistence on the inseparability of faith and repentance safeguards against **antinomianism**.

John Owen, representing mature **Reformed orthodoxy**, refines this within a more technical account of the ordo salutis and the covenant of grace. In works like his treatise on the Holy Spirit and his sermons on mortification, Owen emphasizes that both faith and repentance are effects of **effectual calling** and **regeneration**, wrought by the Spirit through the word. Owen clearly distinguishes the forensic act of justification from the inherent work of sanctification. Faith alone is the instrumental cause of justification, but the faith that justifies is never alone; it is always accompanied by all saving graces, especially repentance and love. This is the classical Reformed formulation: not by faith that is alone, but by faith alone. Owen is also attentive to the pastoral and psychological manifestations of repentance. He describes repentance as involving conviction, self‑abhorrence, confession, and a renewed purpose of obedience, all under the apprehension of God’s pardoning mercy in Christ. It is not a temporary entry ticket but a constant frame of soul in the believer’s life. In relation to the covenant, Owen understands repentance as one of the means by which believers respond to God’s covenant faithfulness, yet always as an evangelical, not a legal, duty.

Under internal debate, Owen becomes crucial in answering neonomian and antinomian tendencies within the Reformed world. The neonomian error, attached to certain strands of later Puritanism and moderated Anglicanism, reconceived the gospel as a new law with milder terms, in which faith and repentance are evangelical works that God accepts instead of perfect obedience. Owen opposes this: neither faith nor repentance are works that fulfill a legal condition; faith is purely receptive and repentance is a fruit of union, not a new obedience that God counts as righteousness. Antinomianism, on the other side, downplays the necessity of repentance as an integral part of conversion and the Christian life, sometimes treating it as an optional, later deepening. Owen responds that while repentance is not a condition of justification in the sense of contributing to its ground, it is a condition of salvation in the wider sense that no one is saved who is not repenting, since the Spirit never unites a person to Christ without also turning him from sin.

Louis Berkhof, representing twentieth‑century systematic Reformed theology, distills these trajectories in a way that examiners at Westminster will expect you to articulate. In his Systematic Theology, Berkhof defines **repentance unto life** as both an intellectual and emotional change regarding sin, and a volitional turning to God, grounded in an evangelical grasp of God’s mercy in Christ. He places faith and repentance together under conversion, treating them as two sides of the same coin: faith is the turning to Christ, repentance the turning from sin. Yet when he comes to justification, Berkhof is explicit that faith alone is the instrument; repentance is not the ground nor co‑instrument, though it is inseparable as a concomitant grace. He also follows classic Reformed orthodoxy in rooting both faith and repentance in **regeneration**. Regeneration is the Spirit’s sovereign, instantaneous act changing the heart; conversion is the conscious, active response of the regenerated person in faith and repentance. This allows him to say that both faith and repentance are gifts of God, yet genuinely acts of the believer’s renewed will.

Internal Reformed debates tend to revolve around four pressure points: the nature of saving faith, the order of regeneration, faith, and repentance, the place of repentance in justification, and the relationship between initial and ongoing repentance. Regarding the nature of faith, some lean toward **fiducial** trust as the essence, others stress the necessary presence of knowledge and assent. Under questioning, you must maintain that saving faith is not bare assent, but that assent to the truth of the gospel is inseparable from personal trust in Christ, and both are fruits of regeneration. Regarding order, it is best to affirm that in the strictest sense **regeneration** logically precedes faith and repentance as their principle, but that in the conscious experience of the believer, faith and repentance are simultaneous aspects of conversion. The Spirit, through law and gospel, turns the heart; in that turning, the sinner both believes and repents.

On the place of repentance in justification, you must be vigorous. Any suggestion that repentance is a condition of justification in the sense of contributing to its ground, or that the measure of sorrow over sin affects God’s verdict, is to be rejected as contradicting **imputed righteousness** and **sola fide**. Yet to say that repentance is not a condition of justification is not to say it is optional. Rather, it is a necessary fruit and concomitant of the faith that is the sole instrument. If an examiner presses you with the worry that this makes repentance unnecessary, respond that necessity can be of different kinds: repentance is necessary as a sine qua non of salvation because God never justifies the impenitent, but it is not necessary as a formal or material cause of justification. Regarding initial and ongoing repentance, maintain that the New Testament and the Reformed confessions speak both of a decisive turning at conversion and of a lifelong practice. The first marks the transition from death to life; the second is the steady mortification and vivification that characterize sanctification.

Externally, Reformed theology must be distinguished not only from Roman Catholicism but also from Arminian synergism, revivalist decisionism, and modern therapeutic religion. Arminianism tends to weaken the monergistic root of faith and repentance, speaking of prevenient grace that restores libertarian free will so that the sinner’s choice to believe and repent is not decisively determined by God. The Reformed response, drawing on Augustine, is that the new birth and conversion are sovereign and effectual acts of God; the grace that works faith and repentance is not merely enabling but efficacious. This preserves the doxological focus of salvation and the certainty that God can take the initiative with the hardest heart. Revivalist decisionism, particularly in some evangelical traditions, reshapes faith and repentance as discrete decisions the sinner can make at will, often reducing faith to walking an aisle and repentance to a moment of emotional resolve. This erodes the doctrines of **total depravity** and **effectual calling**, and leads to pastoral confusion when such “decisions” lack spiritual fruit. The Reformed alternative insists that true faith and repentance are enduring dispositions produced by the Spirit, not mere transient acts.

Contemporary debates such as “lordship salvation” versus “free grace” replay older antinomian and neonomian themes. The “free grace” position often treats repentance as a post‑conversion, optional deepening, while reducing saving faith to bare assent to the proposition that Jesus saves me. The “lordship” side insists that genuine saving faith includes a disposition to submit to Christ’s lordship and turn from sin. A Reformed answer refuses both the reduction of faith to assent and any inclusion of obedience as part of the instrumental cause of justification. Saving faith, as Reformed theology defines it, includes fiducial trust that is inherently oriented to Christ as Lord, and thus cannot coexist with a settled refusal to repent. But obedience and repentance, though inseparable, are never part of the ground of acceptance before God. The rhetoric of “making Jesus Lord” is flawed, yet the theological intuition that Christ cannot be divided is sound: the Christ who justifies is the Christ who sanctifies.

Modern therapeutic conceptions of sin as mere brokenness or maladjustment erode the category of repentance. If sin is primarily harm to self rather than offense against the holy God, then repentance becomes self‑care, not a Godward turning. Here the doctrines of **holiness**, **law**, and **wrath** must be reasserted. Repentance is more than processing guilt; it is a judgment on oneself before God, aligned with God’s own verdict against sin, under the cross of Christ. Faith without repentance in this context degenerates into positive thinking about God’s unconditional acceptance. But biblical faith, as the Westminster Confession states, receives and rests upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life. This means the faith that saves cannot be indifferent to sin, for it lays hold of a Christ who died and rose to destroy sin’s dominion.

To integrate all these strands, it is helpful to frame faith and repentance explicitly within **union with Christ** and **covenant theology**. In the covenant of grace, God promises salvation in Christ to all who believe. This promise is unconditional in its origin and foundation in Christ, yet it is administered through means and conditions on the human side. Faith is the sole condition instrumentally for justification, because only faith looks away from self to Christ. Repentance, while not a co‑condition of justification, is a covenant obligation and blessing that necessarily accompanies faith and is included among the benefits of union. By faith we are united to Christ, justified, adopted, and begin to be sanctified. In the very act of that union, the Spirit turns us from idols to God. Thus faith and repentance are twin exercises of the same renewed heart in response to the **covenant Lord**.

When examiners push you with the dilemma whether someone can be justified while still loving his sin, the proper response is to distinguish the legal and the renovative aspects of salvation without separating them. Legally, the ungodly person is justified solely by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness and the instrumentality of faith that receives Christ. At that precise moment, what makes him just is entirely outside him. Yet that justifying union with Christ is never without the indwelling Spirit, who at once begins to transform affections. There is no temporal gap in which a justified person remains wholly impenitent and unconcerned about sin, although subjectively a person may not be able to parse the order of the Spirit’s work. Any supposed faith that leaves the will unbent and the heart unchanged toward sin is not the biblical **faith** of which Reformed theology speaks.

The doctrine of **faith and repentance** thus touches adjacent loci everywhere. It presupposes **anthropology**, since total depravity explains why grace must precede and produce both. It depends on **Christology**, since the content of faith is the person and work of the Mediator and the ground of repentance is the mercy of God in that Mediator. It leans on **pneumatology**, because faith and repentance are acts of the Spirit in and with us, not autonomous choices. It shapes **ecclesiology**, since the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments are ordained means by which the Spirit works both graces. It shapes **sanctification**, since ongoing repentance is the negative pole of mortification and faith is the positive pole of vivification. And it speaks to **assurance**, because assurance grows as the Spirit bears witness not only through the objective promises believed, but also through the fruits of repentance in our lives.

In defending the Reformed position, you should summarize it in terms that keep the doctrinal anchors visible. Faith and repentance are both necessary, both gifts of **sovereign grace**, and both acts of the whole person. Faith alone is the instrumental cause of justification, clinging to Christ’s **imputed righteousness**. Repentance is the necessary correlate and fruit of that faith, grounded in the same apprehension of mercy that faith has, turning from sin to God. They are distinct in definition and role but inseparable in reality. Any view that makes repentance meritorious or co‑instrumental undermines the freeness of grace; any view that makes repentance optional or subsequent in such a way that a person can be savingly united to Christ while clinging without struggle to sin undermines the power and holiness of the Spirit. A robust, Augustinian, Calvinian, and confessional account avoids both errors by locating both graces in **union with Christ**, brought about by the Spirit through the law and the gospel.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Saving **faith** is the Spirit‑wrought act of knowledge, assent, and trust by which the sinner receives and rests on Christ alone; **repentance unto life** is the Spirit‑wrought turning from sin to God in grief and hatred of sin, grounded in the apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: monergistic grace producing both faith and repentance, but less sharply distinguishing justification and sanctification.
  - Luther: law‑gospel dynamic, faith alone justifies, repentance as lifelong but not meritorious.
  - Calvin: **union with Christ** and duplex gratia; faith as bond of union; repentance inseparable from faith yet not part of justification.
  - Owen: mature Reformed ordo salutis; faith alone as instrument of justification; repentance as necessary fruit against neonomian and antinomian errors.
  - Berkhof: conversion as faith plus repentance; both gifts of **regeneration**; faith alone instrumental in justification.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature of saving faith; precise ordering of regeneration, faith, repentance; whether repentance is a condition of justification or only of salvation broadly; initial versus ongoing repentance.
  - External: Roman Catholic formed faith and penance; Arminian synergism; neonomian “new law” and antinomianism; revivalist decisionism.
  - Contemporary: “lordship salvation” vs “free grace”; therapeutic minimization of sin; faith reduced to assent or feeling.
- Defended position: Faith and repentance are distinct but inseparable, both wrought by the Spirit in regeneration and conversion; **faith alone** is the sole instrument of justification, while repentance is its necessary, non‑meritorious correlate in conversion and throughout sanctification.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Is repentance a condition of justification?  
    Answer: Necessary as a concomitant fruit of faith and of salvation broadly, but not as a ground or co‑instrument of justification; justification is by **faith alone**.
  - Can there be true faith without repentance?  
    Answer: No; the Spirit never works justifying faith without simultaneously turning the heart from sin, even if the believer’s experience is not neatly ordered.
  - Does repentance precede or follow faith?  
    Answer: Both arise from **regeneration**; preparatory law‑wrought sorrow may come first, but evangelical repentance unto life is inseparable from and logically follows faith in Christ’s mercy.
  - How does this differ from Roman Catholic penance?  
    Answer: Repentance is not a sacrament or satisfaction but a grace; it contributes nothing to the ground of pardon, which rests solely on Christ’s righteousness imputed and received by faith.
  - Does emphasizing repentance compromise assurance?  
    Answer: No; assurance is grounded primarily in Christ’s promise received by faith, yet is strengthened by the Spirit’s witness in the fruits of ongoing repentance and obedience.
