# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield understood **faith and repentance** as inseparable graces wrought by the **Holy Spirit** in the heart of the believer, essential to the application of **salvation**. He emphasized that **faith** is fundamentally trust in the finished work of **Christ**, while **repentance** is a Spirit-enabled turning from sin, both being gifts of **regenerating grace**. Warfield’s approach is deeply rooted in the **Reformed ordo salutis**, highlighting the monergistic work of God in conversion.

- "Faith is not the ground of salvation, but the instrument by which we receive Christ and all His benefits." ("The Plan of Salvation")

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "Faith and Life"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation"
- "The Indispensableness of Systematic Theology to the Preacher"
- Selected Shorter Writings (especially essays on faith and conversion)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Trust in Christ Alone**
   - Faith is not mere intellectual assent but a personal trust in the person and work of Christ.
   - It is the means by which the believer is united to Christ and receives justification.
   - Faith is always directed outward, away from self, to the sufficiency of Christ.
   - Warfield insists that faith is the sole instrument of receiving salvation, excluding all human merit.
   - "It is not faith that saves, but Christ; it is not, strictly speaking, even faith in Christ that saves, but Christ by means of faith." ("The Plan of Salvation")

2. **Repentance as a Fruit of Regeneration**
   - Repentance is inseparable from faith and arises from the new birth.
   - It involves a genuine turning from sin toward God, enabled by the Holy Spirit.
   - Repentance is not a prerequisite for grace but a result of God’s regenerating work.
   - Warfield rejects any notion of repentance as a meritorious work contributing to justification.
   - "Repentance and faith are twin gifts of grace, wrought in us by the Spirit." ("Faith and Life")

3. **Monergistic Work of the Holy Spirit**
   - Both faith and repentance are gifts, not products of human effort or decision.
   - The Holy Spirit effectually calls and regenerates, producing faith and repentance in the elect.
   - Warfield upholds the Reformed doctrine of **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace**.
   - Human will is passive in regeneration, becoming active only after being made alive by the Spirit.
   - "The faith by which we are saved is itself the gift of God, wrought in us by His Spirit." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation")

4. **Union with Christ as the Context for Faith and Repentance**
   - Faith and repentance are the means by which believers are united to Christ.
   - Union with Christ is the fountain from which all saving benefits flow.
   - Warfield situates both faith and repentance within the broader framework of the ordo salutis.
   - The believer’s new life is grounded in this vital union, not in the acts of faith or repentance themselves.
   - "All the blessings of salvation flow from our union with Christ, received by faith." ("Faith and Life")

5. **Assurance Grounded in Christ’s Work, Not Subjective Experience**
   - Assurance of salvation rests on the objective work of Christ, not on the strength of one’s faith or repentance.
   - Warfield warns against introspection that shifts focus from Christ to self.
   - True assurance grows as believers look to Christ’s sufficiency and promises.
   - The subjective experience of faith and repentance is real, but never the ground of hope.
   - "Our assurance is rooted not in what we do, but in what Christ has done for us." ("Faith and Life")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust articulation of **faith and repentance** as gifts of sovereign grace has shaped Reformed soteriology and pastoral practice. His insistence on the monergistic work of the **Holy Spirit** and the centrality of **union with Christ** continues to influence evangelical and Reformed theology. Warfield’s careful distinction between the instrumentality of faith and the ground of salvation in Christ remains a touchstone for discussions on conversion and assurance. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the doctrines of grace and the Reformed understanding of the Christian life.
