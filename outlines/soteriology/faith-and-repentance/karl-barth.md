# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth understood **faith** and **repentance** as inseparable responses to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. For Barth, both are grounded in the **objective reality of Christ’s work** and are enabled by the **Holy Spirit**, emphasizing that human response is always secondary to divine initiative. He rejected any notion of faith or repentance as autonomous human achievements, insisting instead on their character as gifts received in the encounter with the living Word.

- "Faith is the act in which man knows and acknowledges and confesses that God is right and that he is wrong." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics II/2: The Doctrine of God
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Response to Divine Revelation**
    - Faith is not a human possibility but a response to God’s self-disclosure in Christ.
    - It is grounded in the **objective reality** of Christ’s person and work.
    - Faith is the recognition of God’s truth and the acceptance of His verdict.
    - The act of faith is enabled and sustained by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - "Faith is obedience to the revelation, to the Word of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Repentance as Turning to God in Christ**
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith and is a turning away from self to God.
    - It is initiated by the encounter with the living Christ.
    - Repentance involves acknowledgment of sin in light of God’s grace.
    - True repentance is possible only within the sphere of Christ’s reconciliation.
    - "Repentance is the radical change by which man turns from himself to God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Christological Grounding of Faith and Repentance**
    - Both faith and repentance are rooted in the **vicarious humanity of Christ**.
    - Jesus Christ is the true believer and penitent on behalf of humanity.
    - Human faith and repentance participate in Christ’s perfect response to the Father.
    - The believer’s response is always derivative of Christ’s own obedience.
    - "In Him our faith and repentance are anticipated and fulfilled." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Rejection of Autonomous Human Agency**
    - Barth denies any capacity for faith or repentance apart from God’s initiative.
    - Human will is incapable of turning to God without divine grace.
    - Faith and repentance are gifts, not achievements or conditions for salvation.
    - The human subject is always addressed and claimed by God’s Word.
    - "Man cannot believe or repent of himself; he can only do so as God acts upon him." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

5. **Faith and Repentance within the Covenant Community**
    - The church is the sphere where faith and repentance are called forth and nurtured.
    - Proclamation of the Word summons the community to continual faith and repentance.
    - The sacraments serve as signs and means of God’s ongoing call to response.
    - The communal aspect underscores the corporate dimension of reconciliation.
    - "The Church is the place where faith and repentance are awakened and sustained." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s understanding of **faith and repentance** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Protestant theology by re-centering these doctrines on the **sovereign initiative of God** and the **Christological foundation** of salvation. His rejection of human autonomy in salvation challenged both liberal and pietistic traditions, emphasizing the primacy of grace. Barth’s influence endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between divine action and human response, especially within Reformed and ecumenical contexts.
