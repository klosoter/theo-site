# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **faith and repentance** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing their inseparability as responses to the **gospel call**. He viewed both as **gracious gifts** wrought by the **Holy Spirit** in the context of **union with Christ**, and insisted that genuine faith necessarily produces repentance, while repentance is always joined to faith.

- "Faith and repentance are twin aspects of the same turning to God, inseparable in the experience of salvation." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Soteriology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (article)
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Instrumental Union with Christ**
    - Faith is the means by which the believer is united to Christ and receives all benefits of redemption.
    - It is not a meritorious work but an empty hand receiving Christ’s righteousness.
    - Faith is rooted in the objective work of Christ and applied subjectively by the Spirit.
    - The focus is on Christ as the object of faith, not on faith’s quality or strength.
    - "Faith is the bond that unites the believer to Christ, making him a participant in all that Christ has accomplished." (Reformed Dogmatics)

2. **Repentance as Turning from Sin to God**
    - Repentance involves a genuine sorrow for sin and a decisive turning away from it.
    - It is inseparable from faith, both arising from regeneration.
    - Repentance is not merely external but involves the whole person—mind, will, and affections.
    - True repentance is ongoing throughout the Christian life, not a one-time act.
    - "Repentance is the negative side of conversion, the turning from sin that accompanies the turning to Christ in faith." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Gifts of Grace**
    - Both faith and repentance are wrought by the Holy Spirit, not products of human effort.
    - They are granted in the context of effectual calling and regeneration.
    - The initiative in salvation belongs entirely to God’s sovereign grace.
    - Assurance rests on God’s promise, not on the subjective experience of faith or repentance.
    - "The grace that calls is the grace that enables, producing both faith and repentance in the heart of the elect." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **The Priority of Faith in Justification**
    - Faith alone is the instrument of justification, not repentance or any other work.
    - Repentance, while necessary, is not the ground or instrument of justification.
    - Justification is by faith apart from works, preserving the distinction between law and gospel.
    - Repentance evidences true faith but does not contribute to the believer’s righteousness before God.
    - "It is faith, not repentance, that is reckoned for righteousness; repentance is the fruit, not the ground, of justification." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **The Eschatological Context of Conversion**
    - Faith and repentance are responses to the inbreaking of the kingdom of God in Christ.
    - Conversion is not merely individual but participates in the larger redemptive-historical movement.
    - The new life of faith and repentance anticipates the consummation of salvation.
    - The Spirit’s work in faith and repentance is a foretaste of the eschatological renewal.
    - "The call to faith and repentance is the call to enter the new age inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **faith and repentance** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, emphasizing their unity and grounding in the work of Christ and the Spirit. His insistence on the **gracious, monergistic nature** of conversion has influenced generations of theologians and pastors, especially within confessional Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Vos’s biblical-theological method continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of saving faith, repentance, and their place in the ordo salutis.
