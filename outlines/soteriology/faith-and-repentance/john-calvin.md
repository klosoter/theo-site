# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin viewed **faith and repentance** as inseparable graces granted by the Holy Spirit, foundational to union with Christ and the application of redemption. He emphasized that **faith** is a firm and certain knowledge of God's mercy in Christ, while **repentance** is a continual turning from sin, both flowing from regeneration and leading to a transformed life. For Calvin, these are not human achievements but gifts of **sovereign grace**, integrally connected within the ordo salutis.

- "Repentance and forgiveness of sins, that is, newness of life and free reconciliation, are conjoined by an everlasting and indissoluble bond." (Institutes 3.3.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Knowledge, Assent, and Trust**
    - Faith involves knowledge of God’s promises in Christ, not mere opinion.
    - It includes assent to the truth of the gospel, grounded in Scripture.
    - True faith is personal trust in Christ for salvation.
    - Faith is produced by the Holy Spirit, not human effort.
    - "Faith is a firm and sure knowledge of the divine favor toward us, founded on the truth of a free promise in Christ, and revealed to our minds, and sealed on our hearts, by the Holy Spirit." (Institutes 3.2.7)

2. **Repentance as Lifelong Conversion**
    - Repentance is not a single act but a continual process throughout the Christian life.
    - It involves both mortification (dying to sin) and vivification (living to righteousness).
    - Repentance flows from faith and is inseparable from it.
    - True repentance is marked by sorrow for sin and a desire for renewal.
    - "Repentance is the true turning of our life to God, a turning that arises from a pure and earnest fear of him." (Institutes 3.3.5)

3. **Union with Christ as the Source**
    - Faith and repentance are benefits of union with Christ, not prerequisites for it.
    - All saving graces flow from being united to Christ by the Spirit.
    - Union with Christ secures both justification and sanctification.
    - This union is the foundation for the believer’s new life.
    - "As long as Christ remains outside of us, and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us." (Institutes 3.1.1)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone, Accompanied by Repentance**
    - Justification is by faith alone, apart from works, but true faith is never alone.
    - Repentance always accompanies faith as evidence of genuine conversion.
    - Good works and repentance are fruits, not grounds, of justification.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on Christ, not on the perfection of repentance.
    - "We dream neither of a faith devoid of good works nor of a justification that stands without them." (Institutes 3.16.1)

5. **The Role of the Word and Sacraments**
    - Faith is created and nourished by the preaching of the Word.
    - Repentance is deepened through continual exposure to Scripture.
    - The sacraments confirm faith and call believers to ongoing repentance.
    - The means of grace are essential for sustaining faith and repentance.
    - "Faith needs the Word as much as fruit needs the living root of a tree." (Institutes 3.2.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of **faith and repentance** shaped Reformed soteriology, emphasizing their inseparability and grounding in union with Christ. His teaching influenced confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession and continues to inform Reformed preaching and pastoral practice. By rooting both faith and repentance in the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit, Calvin provided a framework that resists both legalism and antinomianism, ensuring that the Christian life is marked by both assurance and ongoing transformation.
