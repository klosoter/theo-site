# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress views **faith and repentance** as inseparable, Spirit-wrought responses to the **gospel** within the context of **covenant relationship** and **union with Christ**. He emphasizes that both are gifts of grace, rooted in the believer’s participation in the redemptive work of Christ and enabled by the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Faith and repentance are two sides of the same coin, both necessary responses to the gospel call." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith and Repentance as Inseparable Responses**
    - Faith and repentance are always united in authentic **conversion**.
    - Both are responses to the **gospel** initiated by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Repentance involves a turning from sin, while faith is a turning to **Christ**.
    - Neither is meritorious; both are gifts of **grace**.
    "Faith and repentance are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of turning to God." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

2. **Covenantal Context of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are covenantal responses to God’s promises.
    - They are rooted in the believer’s participation in the **new covenant**.
    - The covenant structure shapes the call to trust and turn from sin.
    - Both are necessary for entering and remaining in **covenant fellowship**.
    "The covenant relationship frames the call to faith and repentance." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Union with Christ as the Ground**
    - Faith unites the believer to **Christ**, making repentance possible.
    - Repentance is the fruit of being joined to Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Both flow from the believer’s incorporation into **Christ**.
    - **Union with Christ** ensures the efficacy and ongoing nature of repentance and faith.
    "Union with Christ is the foundation for both faith and repentance." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables both faith and repentance in the heart of the believer.
    - Regeneration precedes and empowers the response of faith and repentance.
    - The Spirit continually sustains these graces throughout the Christian life.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s work, not human effort.
    "The Holy Spirit is the author of faith and repentance in the believer." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - Faith and repentance are interpreted within the unfolding story of **redemption**.
    - Old Testament patterns prefigure the New Testament reality of these graces.
    - The call to faith and repentance is consistent across both Testaments.
    - Christ’s fulfillment of the law grounds the believer’s response.
    "The redemptive-historical context clarifies the meaning of faith and repentance." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s articulation of **faith and repentance** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by integrating **biblical-theological** and systematic perspectives. His emphasis on the inseparability of faith and repentance, grounded in **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**, has shaped pastoral approaches to conversion and sanctification. Poythress’s covenantal and redemptive-historical framework continues to inform discussions on the nature of saving faith and true repentance within evangelical circles.
