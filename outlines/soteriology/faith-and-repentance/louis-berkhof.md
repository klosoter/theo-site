# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, a leading figure in 20th-century Reformed theology, articulates **faith** and **repentance** as inseparable aspects of **conversion** within the ordo salutis. He emphasizes that **saving faith** is a gift of God, involving knowledge, assent, and trust, while **repentance** is a Spirit-wrought turning from sin toward God. For Berkhof, both are necessary responses to the gospel and are integrally connected in the application of **salvation**.

- "Faith and repentance are not to be regarded as separate and independent acts, but as two aspects of the same turning of the sinner to God." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially chapters on Faith and Repentance)
- Manual of Christian Doctrine
- Summary of Christian Doctrine
- The Assurance of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Knowledge, Assent, and Trust**
    - Faith consists of three elements: notitia (knowledge), assensus (assent), and fiducia (trust).
    - True faith involves understanding the content of the gospel.
    - Assent is the conviction that the gospel is true.
    - Trust is a personal reliance on Christ for salvation.
    - "Saving faith always includes a personal trust in Christ as Savior and Lord." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Repentance as a Turning from Sin**
    - Repentance is a change of mind that results in a change of life.
    - It includes sorrow for sin, hatred of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it.
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith, both being wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    - It is not merely remorse but a turning to God in obedience.
    - "Repentance is that change wrought in the conscious life of the sinner, by which he turns away from sin." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Gifts of Grace**
    - Both faith and repentance are not works of man but gifts from God.
    - The Holy Spirit enables the sinner to respond to the gospel.
    - Human inability necessitates divine initiative in conversion.
    - This underscores the monergistic nature of salvation.
    - "Both faith and repentance are wrought in the heart by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

4. **The Necessity of Both for Salvation**
    - Faith and repentance are required responses to the gospel call.
    - Neither can be present in true form without the other.
    - Repentance without faith is despair; faith without repentance is presumption.
    - Both are necessary for justification and entrance into the Christian life.
    - "There is no saving faith without true repentance, and no true repentance without saving faith." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Ongoing Role in the Christian Life**
    - Faith and repentance are not only initial acts but ongoing attitudes.
    - The believer continues to exercise faith and repentance throughout life.
    - This ongoing dynamic is essential for sanctification.
    - Assurance of salvation is strengthened through continual faith and repentance.
    - "The Christian life is a life of continued faith and repentance." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s clear articulation of **faith** and **repentance** has shaped generations of Reformed pastors and theologians, especially through his widely used Systematic Theology. His emphasis on their inseparability and their grounding in the work of the Holy Spirit remains a standard in Reformed soteriology. Berkhof’s formulations continue to provide a concise and accessible framework for understanding the nature of conversion in the context of the **ordo salutis**.
