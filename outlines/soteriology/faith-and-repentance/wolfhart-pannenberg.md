# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **faith and repentance** within the context of **revelation**, **eschatology**, and the **self-disclosure of God in history**. He emphasized that **faith** is fundamentally trust in the reality of God’s acts, especially as revealed in the resurrection of Christ, while **repentance** is a response to the divine initiative that reorients the self toward God’s future. For Pannenberg, both faith and repentance are inseparable from the unfolding of God’s truth in history and the anticipation of the final consummation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Response to Revelation**
   - Faith is grounded in the historical self-revelation of God, especially in Christ.
   - It is not subjective conviction but openness to God’s reality as disclosed in history.
   - Faith involves rational assent to the truth of God’s acts.
   - The resurrection is the central event that calls forth faith.
   - "Faith is not a leap into the dark but a response to the light that has dawned in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Repentance as Eschatological Reorientation**
   - Repentance is a turning from self-centeredness to God’s coming kingdom.
   - It is motivated by the anticipation of God’s future and final judgment.
   - Repentance is inseparable from faith as a response to God’s initiative.
   - It involves a transformation of the whole person in light of God’s revelation.
   - "Repentance means to allow oneself to be determined by the future of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Faith and Repentance as Corporate and Historical**
   - Both faith and repentance have communal as well as individual dimensions.
   - The church embodies the response of faith and repentance in history.
   - Historical events, especially the resurrection, shape the community’s faith.
   - Repentance is ongoing as the church anticipates the eschaton.
   - "The faith of the church is the anticipation of the future of humanity in the history of Jesus." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Faith and Reason in Mutual Relationship**
   - Faith is not irrational but seeks understanding and is open to critique.
   - Reason and faith are mutually corrective in the pursuit of truth.
   - Faith involves trust in God’s promises, but also intellectual engagement.
   - Repentance includes the reformation of thought as well as action.
   - "Faith must be able to give an account of itself before the tribunal of reason." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Universal Scope of Faith and Repentance**
   - God’s revelation in Christ is intended for all humanity.
   - Faith and repentance are not limited to a religious elite but are universal invitations.
   - The eschatological horizon means all people are called to respond.
   - The universality of Christ’s resurrection grounds the call to faith and repentance.
   - "The resurrection of Jesus is the prolepsis of the destiny of all men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s integration of **faith and repentance** with **historical revelation** and **eschatology** has significantly shaped modern theology’s understanding of these doctrines. His insistence on the rational and public character of faith challenged both existentialist and fideist tendencies. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogue and the relationship between theology and history, making his approach to faith and repentance a vital reference point in contemporary systematic theology.
