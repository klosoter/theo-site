# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton articulates **faith and repentance** as inseparable graces within the ordo salutis, emphasizing their grounding in the objective work of **Christ** and the sovereign initiative of **God’s grace**. He stresses that **justification** is received by faith alone, while repentance is the Spirit-wrought turning from sin that necessarily accompanies true faith, both being gifts rather than human achievements.

- "Faith and repentance are not our contributions to salvation but the means by which we receive Christ and all his benefits." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples
- Putting Amazing Back into Grace
- Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ
- Christless Christianity

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Instrumental, Not Meritorious**
    - Faith is the means by which believers receive **justification** and union with Christ.
    - It is not a work or virtue that merits salvation.
    - Faith looks away from itself to the finished work of Christ.
    - The object of faith is always Christ and his promises, not faith itself.
    - "Faith is not a substitute for works; it is the empty hand that receives Christ and his righteousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Repentance as Spirit-Wrought Response**
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith but distinct in its orientation toward turning from sin.
    - It is a gift of the Holy Spirit, not a precondition for grace.
    - True repentance involves both sorrow for sin and a new obedience.
    - Repentance is ongoing in the Christian life, not a one-time act.
    - "Repentance is not a human work that earns forgiveness, but the Spirit’s gracious turning of our hearts from idols to the living God." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Union with Christ as the Source of Both**
    - Both faith and repentance flow from union with Christ, not from autonomous human decision.
    - Union with Christ is the fountainhead of all saving benefits.
    - Faith and repentance are simultaneous fruits of being united to Christ by the Spirit.
    - This union is covenantal, rooted in God's initiative and promise.
    - "All of the benefits of salvation, including faith and repentance, are found in union with Christ." (Covenant and Salvation)

4. **Monergistic Regeneration Precedes Faith and Repentance**
    - Regeneration is the Spirit’s sovereign act, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Human will is passive until enlivened by God’s grace.
    - Faith and repentance are responses to, not causes of, new birth.
    - This upholds the Reformation emphasis on sola gratia.
    - "We do not believe in order to be born again; we are born again in order to believe." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Covenantal Context of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are framed within the context of God’s covenant promises.
    - The covenant of grace provides the structure for understanding their role in salvation.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s covenant faithfulness, not the quality of one’s faith or repentance.
    - The church is the community where faith and repentance are nurtured through Word and sacrament.
    - "The covenant of grace assures us that faith and repentance are responses to God’s initiative, not conditions we fulfill to earn his favor." (Pilgrim Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by clarifying the relationship between faith, repentance, and the doctrines of grace. His work has reinforced the centrality of **union with Christ** and the monergistic nature of salvation in evangelical discourse. Horton’s covenantal framework and emphasis on the objectivity of Christ’s work have influenced both academic theology and church practice, especially in debates over assurance and the nature of saving faith. His teaching continues to equip pastors and laypeople to distinguish the gospel from moralism and to rest in the sufficiency of Christ.
