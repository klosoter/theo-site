# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood **faith and repentance** as inseparable aspects of the believer’s response to the **gospel**, both rooted in the work of **God’s grace**. For Luther, **faith** is a living trust in Christ’s promises, while **repentance** (or **penitence**) is a continual turning from sin, not a meritorious work but the fruit of faith. Both are central to his doctrine of **justification by faith alone**, emphasizing the believer’s utter dependence on Christ.

- "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, 'Repent,' he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance." (Ninety-Five Theses)

## Key Works

- Ninety-Five Theses (1517)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Faith is the sole means by which sinners are justified before God.
    - Good works and repentance are fruits, not grounds, of justification.
    - Faith involves personal trust in Christ’s righteousness, not mere assent.
    - Repentance is necessary but does not merit forgiveness.
    - "Faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law." (Romans Commentary)

2. **Repentance as Lifelong**
    - Repentance is not a one-time act but a continual turning from sin.
    - The Christian life is characterized by ongoing contrition and renewal.
    - True repentance arises from the recognition of sin and God’s mercy.
    - The entire life of the believer is to be marked by repentance.
    - "The entire life of believers should be repentance." (Ninety-Five Theses)

3. **Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
    - The Law reveals sin and drives one to repentance.
    - The Gospel offers forgiveness and new life through faith in Christ.
    - Repentance is prompted by the Law but fulfilled in the Gospel.
    - Assurance comes from the Gospel, not from the depth of one’s repentance.
    - "The Law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The Gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **Faith as Gift and Assurance**
    - Faith is a gift of God, not a human achievement.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on Christ’s promise, not on subjective experience.
    - Faith clings to the external Word and sacraments.
    - Repentance and faith are both wrought by the Holy Spirit.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace." (Preface to Romans)

5. **Penitence and the Rejection of Works-Righteousness**
    - Medieval penitential system is rejected as contrary to the Gospel.
    - True penitence is sorrow for sin and trust in Christ’s forgiveness.
    - Indulgences and external acts cannot secure forgiveness.
    - Repentance is inward and spiritual, not merely outward or ritualistic.
    - "Those who believe that they can be certain of their salvation because they have indulgence letters will be eternally damned." (Ninety-Five Theses)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **faith and repentance** reshaped the understanding of the Christian life in the Reformation, grounding assurance in Christ rather than human effort. His emphasis on **justification by faith alone** and the lifelong nature of repentance became foundational for Protestant theology. Luther’s distinction between **Law and Gospel** continues to influence Reformed and Lutheran traditions, shaping pastoral care and preaching. His legacy endures in the centrality of faith and repentance in evangelical proclamation.
