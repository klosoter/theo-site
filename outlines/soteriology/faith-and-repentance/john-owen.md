# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen, a leading Puritan theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of **faith and repentance** as inseparable graces within the ordo salutis. He emphasized that **saving faith** is a Spirit-wrought trust in Christ alone, while **repentance** is a necessary turning from sin, both rooted in union with Christ and enabled by the **new covenant**. Owen insisted that these are not meritorious works but gifts of **sovereign grace** that flow from regeneration.

- "Faith and repentance are the first and immediate duties that God requireth of sinners, that they may be justified and saved." ("The Doctrine of Justification by Faith")

- "The Mortification of Sin"
- "A Display of Arminianism"
- "The Holy Spirit: His Gifts and Power"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Spirit-wrought Union with Christ**
    - Faith is the principal means by which believers are united to Christ and receive all benefits of redemption.
    - It is not mere assent but a living, active trust in the person and work of Christ.
    - The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause of saving faith, applying the work of Christ to the elect.
    - Faith looks away from self and rests solely on Christ’s righteousness for justification.
    - "Saving faith is not a bare assent unto the truth of the promises, but a receiving of Christ in them." ("The Doctrine of Justification by Faith")

2. **Repentance as a Gospel Grace**
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith and is always present where true faith exists.
    - It involves a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a turning from it, and a renewed obedience to God.
    - Repentance is not a condition for justification but a fruit of regeneration and faith.
    - The Spirit convicts of sin and enables genuine repentance in the believer’s life.
    - "Repentance is a grace of the gospel, a fruit of the new covenant, wrought in us by the Spirit." ("The Nature and Causes of Apostasy")

3. **Distinction and Inseparability of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are distinct graces but always conjoined in the experience of salvation.
    - Neither is meritorious; both are gifts granted by God’s sovereign initiative.
    - Repentance does not precede faith chronologically but is simultaneous with it in conversion.
    - Both are necessary responses to the gospel call, reflecting the work of the Spirit.
    - "There is no faith where there is no repentance, nor repentance where there is no faith." ("The Doctrine of Justification by Faith")

4. **Faith and Repentance in the Context of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Both graces are promised and provided in the new covenant, secured by Christ’s mediation.
    - The covenant of grace ensures the efficacy and certainty of faith and repentance for the elect.
    - Owen rejects any notion that these are conditions that earn favor; they are evidences of covenant membership.
    - The Spirit’s work in the heart is the distinguishing mark of the new covenant people.
    - "All the promises of the covenant are made unto faith and repentance, as the means of our participation in them." ("The Doctrine of Justification by Faith")

5. **Pastoral Application: Mortification and Assurance**
    - Faith and repentance are ongoing realities in the believer’s sanctification, not one-time acts.
    - The mortification of sin is both the fruit and evidence of genuine faith and repentance.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in Christ’s work, but confirmed through the exercise of faith and repentance.
    - Owen exhorts believers to continual self-examination and reliance on the Spirit for growth in grace.
    - "Be killing sin or it will be killing you; this is the work of faith and repentance in the life of the believer." ("The Mortification of Sin")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s theology of **faith and repentance** has profoundly shaped Reformed and Puritan understandings of conversion and the Christian life. His insistence on the inseparability of these graces, rooted in the **covenant of grace** and wrought by the Spirit, remains influential in discussions of soteriology and sanctification. Owen’s pastoral emphasis on ongoing repentance and faith continues to inform evangelical spirituality and practical theology. His careful distinctions and robust biblical exegesis have secured his place as a foundational voice in the Reformed tradition.
