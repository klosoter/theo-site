# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **faith and repentance** as integral components of **justification** and **conversion**. He distinguished **saving faith** as both knowledge and trust, inseparably joined with **evangelical repentance** as a fruit of regeneration, yet carefully maintained their distinct roles in the application of **salvation**.

- "Repentance is indeed necessary to salvation, not as a cause, but as a means and condition without which God neither will nor can save us." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology," 15.3.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), esp. Vol. 2, Topics 14–15
- The Doctrine of Faith (various sections within the Institutes)
- The Doctrine of Repentance (Institutes, Topic 15)
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (secondary, for context)
- John Beardslee, "Reformed Dogmatics: Selections from the Writings of Francis Turretin" (secondary, selections on faith and repentance)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Faith as Knowledge, Assent, and Trust**
    - Faith consists of notitia (knowledge), assensus (assent), and fiducia (trust).
    - True faith involves personal reliance on Christ, not mere intellectual agreement.
    - Faith is the sole instrument of **justification**.
    - The object of faith is the whole Christ as offered in the gospel.
    - "Faith is not only a knowledge of the truth revealed in the word, but also a firm and certain assent, and a trust by which we rest in Christ for salvation." (Institutes, 14.2.8)

2. **Repentance as a Fruit, Not a Ground, of Justification**
    - Repentance is necessary for salvation but not the basis of justification.
    - It is a result of regeneration and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Repentance is inseparable from faith but logically follows it.
    - It involves both sorrow for sin and a turning to God.
    - "Repentance is not the cause of remission, but the condition without which it is not given." (Institutes, 15.3.5)

3. **Distinction and Inseparability of Faith and Repentance**
    - Faith and repentance are distinct graces but always found together in the regenerate.
    - Faith looks to Christ for pardon; repentance turns from sin to God.
    - Neither can exist in isolation in the experience of salvation.
    - Their distinction safeguards the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.
    - "Although they are distinct, faith and repentance are never separated in the justified." (Institutes, 15.3.6)

4. **Necessity of Evangelical Repentance**
    - Repentance is required by the gospel command and promise.
    - It is not a meritorious work but a necessary response to grace.
    - Evangelical repentance includes both contrition and conversion.
    - It is ongoing throughout the Christian life, not a one-time act.
    - "Repentance is commanded by God as necessary to all who would be saved." (Institutes, 15.1.1)

5. **Faith as the Instrumental Cause of Justification**
    - Faith alone unites the sinner to Christ and appropriates his righteousness.
    - Repentance, while necessary, is not the instrument of justification.
    - This preserves the **sola fide** principle of the Reformation.
    - Good works and repentance are evidences, not grounds, of acceptance with God.
    - "Faith alone is the instrument by which we receive and apply to ourselves the righteousness of Christ." (Institutes, 16.8.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise distinctions regarding **faith and repentance** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy and provided a bulwark against both antinomianism and legalism. His careful articulation of **justification by faith alone** while affirming the necessity of repentance influenced confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession. Turretin’s legacy endures in Reformed seminaries and systematic theologies, where his scholastic clarity continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of conversion and salvation.
