# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **sacraments** as symbolic acts that participate in the **depth of being** and mediate the **New Being** revealed in Christ. For Tillich, the sacraments are not magical but are **means of grace** in that they make the **divine presence** existentially real to the community, functioning as visible words that actualize the experience of **justification** and **reconciliation**.

- "The sacrament is a visible word which mediates the Spiritual Presence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Symbols Participating in Ultimate Reality**
    - Sacraments are not mere signs but **symbols** that participate in the reality they signify.
    - They mediate the **presence of the New Being** in Christ to the community.
    - The symbolic function connects finite elements with the infinite ground of being.
    - The efficacy of sacraments depends on their existential appropriation by faith.
    - "A sacrament is a symbol in which the Spiritual Presence is manifest." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

2. **Means of Grace as Actualization, Not Transmission**
    - Sacraments do not transmit grace mechanically or magically.
    - They actualize the **divine-human encounter** in the context of the community.
    - The means of grace are effective as they awaken and deepen faith.
    - The event of grace is existential, not ontological, in its mediation.
    - "Grace is not a substance which is transmitted; it is a relationship which is actualized." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

3. **Sacraments Rooted in the Community of the New Being**
    - The sacraments presuppose and express the reality of the **ecclesial community**.
    - They are communal acts that embody the **reconciliation** achieved in Christ.
    - The church as the bearer of the New Being is the context for sacramental action.
    - Participation in sacraments is participation in the life of the community.
    - "The church is the bearer of the Spiritual Presence, and the sacraments are its visible manifestation." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

4. **Word and Sacrament as United Means of Grace**
    - The **Word** and **sacraments** are inseparable in mediating the presence of Christ.
    - Both function as "visible" and "audible" words, actualizing the same reality.
    - Sacraments without the Word lose their existential meaning.
    - The unity of Word and sacrament is essential for the mediation of grace.
    - "The sacrament is a visible word, and the word is an audible sacrament." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

5. **Existential Reception and Openness to Grace**
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on existential openness and faith.
    - Sacraments call for personal decision and acceptance of the **New Being**.
    - The subjective response is integral to the sacramental event.
    - Grace is received where there is openness to the **Spiritual Presence**.
    - "The sacramental act is fulfilled only where there is an existential response." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s theology of the **sacraments as means of grace** has profoundly influenced 20th-century Protestant thought, especially in its existential and symbolic reinterpretation of traditional doctrines. His emphasis on the **symbolic participation** and the unity of Word and sacrament challenged both purely memorialist and magical views. Tillich’s approach continues to shape discussions on the nature of **divine presence** and the role of the church in mediating grace, particularly within ecumenical and philosophical theology.
