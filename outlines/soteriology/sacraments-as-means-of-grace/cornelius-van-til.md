# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **sacraments as means of grace** within the framework of **Reformed covenant theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized that the sacraments, as instituted by Christ, function within the context of the **covenant community** and are inseparable from the **Word of God**, serving as visible signs and seals of the promises of the gospel.

- "The sacraments are not magical rites but are efficacious only as they are joined to the Word and received by faith." (The Defense of the Faith)

- The Theology of James Daane (for interaction with sacramental theology)
- Essays in Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs and Seals**
   - Sacraments visibly signify and seal the promises of the **covenant of grace**.
   - They are not autonomous but derive meaning from the **Word of God**.
   - Their efficacy is tied to the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - Participation presupposes membership in the **covenant community**.
   - "The sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant, not mere symbols." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Word and Sacrament Inseparability**
   - The sacraments never operate apart from the **preached Word**.
   - The Word interprets the meaning of the sacraments.
   - Sacraments confirm and strengthen faith already created by the Word.
   - The unity of Word and sacrament guards against **sacramentalism** and **rationalism**.
   - "The Word gives the sacraments their proper context and meaning." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Means of Grace, Not Automatic Efficacy**
   - Sacraments are true **means of grace** but not ex opere operato.
   - Their efficacy depends on the **sovereign work of God** and the faith of the recipient.
   - They are not magical but are used by God to communicate grace.
   - Faith is the necessary instrument for receiving the benefits signified.
   - "The sacraments are efficacious only as the Spirit applies them to the heart." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenantal Context of Sacraments**
   - Sacraments are administered within the visible **church** as the covenant community.
   - They mark out the people of God and their relationship to Him.
   - The administration of sacraments is a corporate, not merely individual, act.
   - The covenantal structure shapes both the form and function of the sacraments.
   - "The church as covenant community is the proper context for the sacraments." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Antithesis and Sacramental Participation**
   - Only those within the **covenant of grace** rightly partake of the sacraments.
   - The antithesis between belief and unbelief extends to sacramental participation.
   - The sacraments reinforce the distinction between the church and the world.
   - Unbelieving participation does not confer grace but brings judgment.
   - "There is no neutrality in the sacraments; they are a blessing or a curse." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **sacraments as means of grace** reinforced the centrality of the **covenant** and the inseparability of **Word and sacrament** in Reformed theology. His presuppositional framework influenced generations of theologians to view sacramental efficacy through the lens of God’s sovereign initiative and the necessity of faith. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the sacraments as covenantal, ecclesial, and Christ-centered means by which God communicates grace to His people.
