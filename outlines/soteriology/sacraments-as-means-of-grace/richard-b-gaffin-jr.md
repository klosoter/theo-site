# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **sacraments** as central **means of grace** within the context of **union with Christ** and the application of **redemption** by the Holy Spirit. He emphasizes the sacraments’ role in the **ordo salutis**, insisting that their efficacy is inseparable from the work of the Spirit and the faith of the recipient, while maintaining their objective character as instituted by Christ.

- "The sacraments are not merely signs but effective means by which the benefits of Christ’s redemptive work are applied to believers by the Holy Spirit." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Holy Spirit" in The New Dictionary of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
   - The sacraments derive their efficacy from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
   - This union is established by the Holy Spirit and is the basis for all benefits of redemption.
   - Sacramental grace is not automatic but is realized in the context of this union.
   - The sacraments signify and seal the reality of union with Christ to believers.
   - "All the benefits signified and sealed in the sacraments flow from union with the resurrected Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Instrumentality of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit is the primary agent applying Christ’s benefits through the sacraments.
   - The Spirit’s work ensures that the sacraments are not empty rituals but true means of grace.
   - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on the Spirit’s sovereign activity.
   - The Spirit unites the sign and the thing signified in the experience of the believer.
   - "The Holy Spirit is indispensable to the sacramental efficacy, making the means of grace effectual." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Efficacy**
   - Faith is the means by which individuals receive the grace offered in the sacraments.
   - Without faith, the sacraments do not confer saving benefits, though they remain objectively valid.
   - The sacraments confirm and strengthen faith, but do not create it ex opere operato.
   - The relationship between faith and sacrament is dynamic and covenantal.
   - "The sacraments are effectual means of grace only for those who receive them in faith." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Objective and Covenantal Character**
   - The sacraments are objective signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**.
   - Their validity does not rest on the subjective state of the minister or recipient.
   - They mark out the visible church and serve as boundary markers of the covenant community.
   - The sacraments are public ordinances instituted by Christ for his church.
   - "The sacraments are covenantal acts, objectively binding and marking the people of God." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Integration with the Ordo Salutis**
   - The sacraments are organically connected to the application of redemption.
   - They function within the broader framework of the **ordo salutis**, not as isolated rites.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper correspond to distinct aspects of salvation: initiation and ongoing nourishment.
   - The sacraments visibly express and confirm the benefits of Christ’s work as applied to believers.
   - "The sacraments are means by which the benefits of the ordo salutis are communicated to the people of God." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of the **sacraments as means of grace** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its emphasis on **union with Christ** and the role of the Holy Spirit. His work has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to sacramental theology, reinforcing the importance of faith and the objective, covenantal nature of the sacraments. Gaffin’s integration of biblical theology and systematic categories continues to inform the understanding and practice of the sacraments in Reformed churches.
