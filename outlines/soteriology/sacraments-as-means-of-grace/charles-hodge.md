# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in nineteenth-century **Reformed theology**, emphasized the **sacraments** as divinely instituted **means of grace** within the church. He maintained that the sacraments, particularly **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**, are not merely symbolic but serve as effective signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**, conveying spiritual benefits to believers through the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The sacraments are means of grace, not by any power of their own, but by the blessing of Christ and the working of his Spirit in those who by faith receive them." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on sacraments)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the sacraments)
- Articles in the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Divine Ordinances**
    - The sacraments are instituted by Christ as perpetual ordinances for the church.
    - They serve as visible signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Their efficacy depends on Christ’s institution, not on the worthiness of the minister.
    - They are to be administered according to Christ’s command and example.
    - "A sacrament is an ordinance instituted by Christ, in which, by sensible signs, Christ and the benefits of the new covenant are represented, sealed, and applied to believers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Means of Grace, Not Mere Symbols**
    - Sacraments are true means of grace, not empty ceremonies.
    - They convey grace to believers through the operation of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Their efficacy is not automatic but is connected to faith in the recipient.
    - The sacraments strengthen and confirm faith, rather than create it ex nihilo.
    - "The sacraments are not the exclusive channels of grace, but they are appointed means for its communication." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as the Only Sacraments**
    - Only Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are recognized as sacraments in the New Testament.
    - Both are commanded by Christ and have clear scriptural warrant.
    - Baptism signifies and seals **union with Christ** and entrance into the visible church.
    - The Lord’s Supper signifies and seals **communion with Christ** and spiritual nourishment.
    - "There are but two sacraments under the gospel, baptism and the Lord’s Supper." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Efficacy Dependent on the Holy Spirit and Faith**
    - The sacraments do not work ex opere operato (by the mere act performed).
    - Their efficacy is tied to the presence and work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Faith is the necessary instrument for receiving the benefits of the sacraments.
    - Unbelievers may receive the outward sign but not the inward grace.
    - "The efficacy of the sacraments depends upon the attending blessing of Christ and the working of his Spirit in those who by faith receive them." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Sacraments and the Covenant of Grace**
    - Sacraments are signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**.
    - They confirm God’s promises to his people and their obligations to him.
    - The sacraments unite believers to Christ and to one another within the covenant community.
    - They serve as public professions of faith and means of assurance.
    - "The sacraments are the seals of the covenant of grace, confirming the faith of believers in the promises of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **sacraments as means of grace** shaped generations of Presbyterian and Reformed theology, especially in North America. His careful distinction between the sign and the thing signified, and his insistence on the necessity of faith and the Holy Spirit’s work, provided a bulwark against both sacramentalism and bare memorialism. Hodge’s influence endures in confessional Reformed churches, where his balanced approach to the sacraments continues to inform both doctrine and practice.
