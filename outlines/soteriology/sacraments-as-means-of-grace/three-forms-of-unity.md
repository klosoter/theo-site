# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of the **sacraments** as **means of grace**, emphasizing their divine institution and efficacy in confirming faith. They maintain that **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are not mere symbols but effectual signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**, truly communicating Christ and his benefits to believers by the **Holy Spirit**. This view underscores the necessity of faith for receiving the grace offered in the sacraments.

- "For by these means He more fully declares and seals to us the promise of the gospel… namely, that He grants us forgiveness of sins and everlasting life by grace, because of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 66)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 65–82
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 33–35
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV and V

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Divine Ordinances**
   - Sacraments are instituted by Christ as visible signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**.
   - They are not human inventions but divinely commanded means for the church.
   - Their authority and efficacy rest on God’s promise, not on the worthiness of the minister.
   - Both sacraments point to the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ.
   - "We believe that our gracious God, mindful of our insensitivity and weakness, has ordained sacraments to seal His promises to us." (Belgic Confession, Art. 33)

2. **Means of Grace, Not Mere Symbols**
   - Sacraments truly confer what they signify when received by faith.
   - They are instruments through which the **Holy Spirit** works to strengthen faith.
   - The grace signified is not tied to the outward sign but is genuinely offered.
   - The sacraments are effectual only for believers, not by mere participation.
   - "The sacraments are visible holy signs and seals appointed by God… to more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 66)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Efficacy**
   - The sacraments benefit only those who receive them in faith.
   - Unbelievers do not receive the grace signified, though they may receive the outward sign.
   - Faith is the instrument by which the benefits of Christ are received through the sacraments.
   - The sacraments confirm and nourish the faith already present in the believer.
   - "For both the word and the sacraments are intended for this very purpose: to direct our faith to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as the only ground of our salvation." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 67)

4. **Two Sacraments: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper**
   - Only **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are recognized as sacraments of the New Covenant.
   - Baptism signifies and seals the washing away of sins and incorporation into Christ.
   - The Lord’s Supper signifies and seals participation in Christ’s body and blood.
   - Both sacraments are to be administered according to Christ’s institution.
   - "There are two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the New Testament, namely, Holy Baptism and the Holy Supper." (Belgic Confession, Art. 33)

5. **Union with Christ by the Spirit**
   - The sacraments serve to strengthen the believer’s **union with Christ**.
   - The Holy Spirit uses the sacraments to apply Christ and his benefits to believers.
   - Participation in the sacraments is a means of spiritual nourishment and growth.
   - The sacraments foster communion with Christ and with the body of believers.
   - "As certainly as we see with our eyes the bread of the Lord broken for us and the cup given to us, so certainly does He nourish and refresh my soul to everlasting life with His crucified body and shed blood." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 75)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed sacramental theology**, providing a clear and balanced articulation of the sacraments as true means of grace. Their teaching safeguards both the objective efficacy of the sacraments and the necessity of faith for their benefit. These confessions continue to serve as doctrinal standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring a consistent and biblically grounded understanding of the **covenant of grace** and its administration through the sacraments. Their influence endures in both liturgical practice and theological education.
