# Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531)

Huldrych Zwingli’s doctrine of the **sacraments** is marked by a strong emphasis on their symbolic and commemorative character rather than as **means of grace** in themselves. He rejected the notion that **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** convey grace ex opere operato, instead viewing them as public testimonies of faith and reminders of the promises of **Christ**. Zwingli’s approach set him apart from both Roman Catholic and Lutheran sacramental theology.

- "The sacraments are signs of holy things, not the things themselves." ("On the Lord’s Supper," 1526)

## Key Works

- "On the Lord’s Supper" (1526)
- "Commentary on True and False Religion" (1525)
- "Sixty-Seven Articles" (1523)
- "Exposition of the Christian Faith" (1531)
- Ulrich Zwingli: Selected Works, ed. Samuel M. Jackson

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**
   - Sacraments are outward **signs** that point to spiritual realities but do not themselves confer grace.
   - They serve as **public testimonies** of faith and allegiance to Christ.
   - The efficacy of the sacrament depends on the **faith** of the recipient.
   - The sacraments are **seals** of God’s promises, not the means by which grace is imparted.
   - "Nothing is effected by the sacraments except that which is wrought in the heart by faith." ("On the Lord’s Supper")

2. **Rejection of Sacramental Efficacy ex opere operato**
   - Zwingli denied that sacraments work automatically or by their own power.
   - He argued that **grace** is received directly from God, not through the elements.
   - The physical elements are not vehicles of **spiritual power**.
   - Participation in the sacraments is a response to grace, not a means of obtaining it.
   - "The water of baptism cannot wash away sin." ("Commentary on True and False Religion")

3. **Memorialism in the Lord’s Supper**
   - The Lord’s Supper is primarily a **memorial** of Christ’s death and resurrection.
   - The bread and wine are symbols, not the actual body and blood of Christ.
   - The focus is on **remembrance** and proclamation of the gospel.
   - Spiritual benefit comes through faith, not through the elements themselves.
   - "Do this in remembrance of me." ("On the Lord’s Supper")

4. **Faith as the Only Means of Receiving Grace**
   - Faith alone unites the believer to Christ and receives the benefits of redemption.
   - The sacraments are secondary to the **Word of God** in conveying truth.
   - Without faith, participation in the sacraments is meaningless.
   - The inward work of the **Holy Spirit** is essential for any spiritual benefit.
   - "It is not the eating, but the believing, that brings life." ("On the Lord’s Supper")

5. **Sacraments as Community Markers**
   - Sacraments serve to distinguish the **church** from the world.
   - They are signs of **covenant membership** and communal identity.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are administered within the context of the gathered body.
   - They reinforce the unity and witness of the Christian community.
   - "By baptism we are received into the church of God." ("Sixty-Seven Articles")

## Legacy and Impact

Zwingli’s theology of the **sacraments** profoundly influenced the Reformed tradition, especially in its emphasis on the symbolic and memorial aspects of the ordinances. His rejection of sacramental efficacy ex opere operato distinguished the Swiss Reformation from both Lutheran and Catholic positions. Zwingli’s views laid the groundwork for later Reformed debates on the nature of the sacraments and contributed to ongoing discussions about the relationship between **faith**, the **Word**, and the visible signs of the church. His legacy endures in Reformed and Anabaptist sacramental theology.
