# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **sacraments** from the standpoint of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He rejected the traditional view of sacraments as objective **means of grace**, instead emphasizing their significance as symbolic acts that call the believer to authentic **faith** and decision in response to the **kerygma**.

- "The sacraments are not magical means by which grace is imparted, but symbolic actions which call for faith." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting" (1956)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Sacraments**
    - Sacraments are stripped of supernatural or magical interpretations.
    - Their meaning is found in existential encounter, not in metaphysical change.
    - The language of **means of grace** is reinterpreted as existential proclamation.
    - The focus is on the individual's response to the **kerygma**.
    - "The real meaning of the sacrament is the demand for decision which it presents." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Existential Interpretation**
    - Sacraments are understood through the lens of existential philosophy.
    - They symbolize the call to authentic existence before God.
    - The act of participating in a sacrament is a moment of self-understanding and decision.
    - The emphasis is on inward transformation, not outward ritual.
    - "The sacraments are meaningful only as they are understood existentially." ("Faith and Understanding")

3. **Rejection of Objective Efficacy**
    - Bultmann denies that sacraments confer grace automatically or ex opere operato.
    - The efficacy of sacraments depends entirely on the faith of the participant.
    - There is no ontological change effected by the sacrament itself.
    - The church's ritual actions have no intrinsic supernatural power.
    - "There is no magical efficacy in the sacraments; their significance is in the proclamation." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of the gospel is primary, and sacraments serve to point to this message.
    - Sacraments are secondary to the existential encounter with the **Word of God**.
    - The **kerygma** is the true means by which grace is mediated.
    - Rituals are valuable only insofar as they direct attention to the gospel.
    - "The Word, not the sacrament, is the true bearer of grace." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

5. **Symbolic and Remembrance Function**
    - Sacraments function as symbols that recall the saving event of Christ.
    - They serve as reminders of the believer's need for continual decision and faith.
    - The Lord's Supper and Baptism are acts of remembrance, not mystical transformation.
    - Their value lies in their ability to provoke existential reflection.
    - "Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are acts of remembrance, not channels of supernatural power." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **sacraments** as existential symbols rather than objective means of grace profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in the context of **demythologization**. His work challenged traditional sacramental theology and shifted the focus to the individual's response to the **kerygma**. While his views have been critiqued for undermining the historic understanding of the sacraments, they remain a significant reference point in discussions about the relationship between ritual, faith, and proclamation. Bultmann’s legacy endures in debates over the nature of **grace** and the function of church practices in contemporary theology.
