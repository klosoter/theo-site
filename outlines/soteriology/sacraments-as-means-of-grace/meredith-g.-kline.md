# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **sacraments** as integral elements within the structure of **covenant theology**, emphasizing their function as **means of grace** that confirm and communicate the blessings of the covenant. He viewed the sacraments as **divine oath-signs** that not only symbolize but also effectuate the believer’s participation in the **covenant of grace**, always in connection with the **Word** and the **Spirit**. Kline’s distinctive focus on the legal and ceremonial dimensions of the sacraments highlights their role in ratifying the relationship between God and his people.

- "The sacraments are covenantal signs and seals, divinely instituted to confirm the promises and obligations of the covenant relationship." ("By Oath Consigned")

## Key Works

- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- Images of the Spirit
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Covenant Oath-Signs**
    - Sacraments function as **oath-signs** that bind both God and the recipient within the covenant relationship.
    - They serve as visible, legal ratifications of the promises and obligations of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The form and administration of sacraments are patterned after ancient Near Eastern treaty rituals.
    - The sacraments are not merely symbolic but are effectual within the covenant context.
    - "Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the covenant’s oath signs, marking the boundaries of the community of faith." (By Oath Consigned)

2. **Means of Grace through Word and Spirit**
    - The sacraments are **means of grace** only as they are joined to the proclamation of the **Word**.
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who makes the sacraments effectual for the elect.
    - Sacraments do not operate ex opere operato but require faith for their efficacy.
    - The grace signified is truly conveyed, not merely represented, to believers.
    - "The efficacy of the sacramental signs is inseparable from the operation of the Spirit and the Word." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - Sacraments are rooted in the typological patterns of **redemptive history**.
    - Old Testament rites (e.g., circumcision, Passover) prefigure New Testament sacraments (baptism, Lord’s Supper).
    - The continuity and discontinuity between old and new covenant signs are crucial for understanding their function.
    - Sacraments point forward to eschatological fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The new covenant sacraments are the antitypical realization of the redemptive signs of the old covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Sacraments and Covenant Community Boundaries**
    - The administration of sacraments marks the visible boundaries of the **covenant community**.
    - Baptism serves as the rite of initiation, while the Lord’s Supper is the rite of ongoing participation.
    - The sacraments distinguish the church from the world and reinforce communal identity.
    - Proper administration is essential for maintaining the purity and integrity of the church.
    - "The sacraments are the divinely appointed boundary markers of the covenant people." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Judgment and Blessing in the Sacraments**
    - Sacraments mediate both blessing and curse, depending on the recipient’s covenant faithfulness.
    - Participation without faith or repentance brings covenantal judgment rather than grace.
    - The dual aspect of sacraments reflects the legal structure of biblical covenants.
    - This underscores the seriousness of sacramental participation and church discipline.
    - "The sacraments, as covenant sanctions, are instruments of both blessing and curse." (By Oath Consigned)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and legal-ceremonial interpretation of the **sacraments** has profoundly influenced Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **biblical theology** and sacramental practice. His emphasis on the oath-sign character of the sacraments has shaped contemporary discussions on baptism, church membership, and the Lord’s Supper. Kline’s work continues to be a touchstone for those seeking to understand the sacraments within the broader framework of **redemptive history** and covenant administration.
