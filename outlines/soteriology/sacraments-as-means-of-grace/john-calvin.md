# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin viewed the **sacraments** as true **means of grace**, instituted by God to confirm and nourish faith in believers. He emphasized their function as visible words, inseparably joined to the **Word of God** and empowered by the **Holy Spirit**, while rejecting any notion of automatic efficacy or magical transformation.

- "The sacraments are testimonies of grace and seals of the promise, by which God, as it were, seals the promises of his good will to us, to sustain the weakness of our faith." (Institutes IV.14.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book IV
- Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels
- Short Treatise on the Holy Supper of Our Lord
- Catechism of the Church of Geneva
- Selected Letters (esp. correspondence on sacramental controversies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sacraments as Visible Words**
    - Sacraments are outward signs instituted by God to signify and seal **spiritual realities**.
    - They are always joined to the **preaching of the Word** for their proper effect.
    - The visible element corresponds to an invisible grace, which is received by faith.
    - The sacraments confirm and strengthen the faith of believers, not create it ex nihilo.
    - "They are testimonies of grace and, as it were, seals of the promise." (Institutes IV.14.7)

2. **Efficacy Dependent on the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit unites the sign and the thing signified, making the sacrament effective.
    - Without the Spirit’s work, sacraments are empty signs and do not confer grace.
    - The Spirit applies Christ and his benefits to the believer through the sacraments.
    - The efficacy is not inherent in the elements but in God’s sovereign action.
    - "The sacraments profit nothing without the power of the Holy Spirit." (Institutes IV.14.9)

3. **Faith as the Instrument of Reception**
    - Only those who receive the sacraments with faith benefit from their grace.
    - Unbelievers may receive the outward sign but not the inward grace.
    - Faith grasps the promise attached to the sacrament and appropriates its benefit.
    - The sacraments are designed to nourish and confirm faith already present.
    - "Whatever is offered in the sacraments is received by faith." (Institutes IV.14.15)

4. **Real Spiritual Presence in the Lord’s Supper**
    - Christ is truly, though spiritually, present in the Supper, not physically or locally.
    - Believers are lifted by the Spirit to partake of Christ’s body and blood in heaven.
    - The Supper is a means of communion with the risen Christ and participation in his benefits.
    - Calvin rejects both transubstantiation and mere memorialism.
    - "The mode of presence is such that the Spirit truly unites things separated by space." (Institutes IV.17.10)

5. **Two Sacraments Instituted by Christ**
    - Only **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are recognized as sacraments of the New Covenant.
    - Both are means of grace, but each has a distinct signification and function.
    - Baptism is the sign of initiation and union with Christ; the Supper is for ongoing nourishment.
    - The sacraments are to be administered according to Christ’s institution and not multiplied.
    - "Christ has instituted only two sacraments as necessary for the church." (Institutes IV.19.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **sacraments as means of grace** shaped Reformed theology and distinguished it from both Roman Catholic and Zwinglian positions. His emphasis on the **Word-Spirit nexus** and the necessity of faith in sacramental efficacy became foundational for later Reformed confessions. Calvin’s careful balance of spiritual presence and symbolic function continues to influence discussions on sacramental theology within the broader Protestant tradition.
