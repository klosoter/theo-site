# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **adoption** as an integral aspect of **union with Christ** and the broader doctrine of **salvation**. He emphasizes that adoption is a legal and relational benefit granted to believers, situating it within the context of the **ordo salutis** and highlighting its implications for the believer’s identity as a child of God.

- "Adoption is a legal act of God, in which he makes us members of his family, with all the privileges that entails." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Forensic and Relational Act**
    - Adoption is both a legal declaration and a personal relationship established by God.
    - It is distinct from, but inseparable from, **justification** and **regeneration**.
    - The believer is granted the status and privileges of **sonship**.
    - Adoption is rooted in the work of **Christ** and applied by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - "Adoption is not only a change of status, but also a change of relationship, as God becomes our Father." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Adoption within the Ordo Salutis**
    - Adoption is one of the benefits received in union with Christ.
    - It follows justification and is closely linked to **sanctification**.
    - Frame sees the **ordo salutis** as a logical, not strictly temporal, sequence.
    - Adoption assures believers of their inheritance and security in Christ.
    - "Adoption is a benefit of salvation that comes to us as we are united to Christ by faith." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Privileges and Responsibilities of Adoption**
    - Believers receive the privileges of access to God, inheritance, and discipline.
    - Adoption entails the responsibility to live as children of God, reflecting His character.
    - The Spirit enables believers to cry, "Abba, Father," confirming their status.
    - Adoption brings believers into the **family of God**, the church.
    - "As adopted children, we are called to imitate our Father and to love our brothers and sisters." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

4. **Trinitarian Foundation of Adoption**
    - Adoption is initiated by the **Father**, accomplished by the **Son**, and applied by the **Spirit**.
    - The Trinity works harmoniously to bring believers into the divine family.
    - The Spirit testifies to our adoption and assures us of God’s fatherly love.
    - The Son’s mediatorial work is the basis for our adoption.
    - "The whole Trinity is involved in our adoption: the Father plans, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Adoption and Assurance**
    - Adoption provides the foundation for the believer’s assurance of salvation.
    - The Spirit’s witness in the heart confirms the reality of adoption.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s promise and the believer’s new identity.
    - Adoption assures believers of their eternal inheritance and security.
    - "Our assurance rests in the fact that God has made us his children, and he will never abandon his own." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of **adoption** has contributed to a renewed appreciation for its place within the **Reformed doctrine of salvation**. His emphasis on the relational and Trinitarian dimensions of adoption has influenced contemporary systematic theology, especially in discussions of Christian identity and assurance. Frame’s accessible yet robust articulation of adoption continues to shape pastoral practice and theological education within Reformed circles.
