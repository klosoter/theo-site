# Robert A. Peterson (1954– )

Robert A. Peterson is a contemporary Reformed theologian who has given significant attention to the doctrine of **adoption** within the broader framework of **soteriology**. He emphasizes adoption as a distinct and vital aspect of **union with Christ**, highlighting the believer’s new status as a **child of God** and the privileges that flow from this relationship. Peterson’s work seeks to recover adoption’s biblical and theological importance, often noting its relative neglect compared to other **salvation benefits**.

- "Adoption is the climactic blessing of the gospel, for it brings us into the family of God." 

## Key Works

- Adopted by God: From Wayward Sinners to Cherished Children (2001)
- Salvation Accomplished by the Son: The Work of Christ (2011)
- “Adoption: What It Means to Be a Child of God” in The Glory of the Atonement (2004, ed. Hill & Letham)
- “Adoption” entry in New Dictionary of Theology (2nd ed., 2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Benefit of Salvation**
   - Adoption is not synonymous with **justification** or **regeneration**, but a separate act of God’s grace.
   - It confers a new legal status: believers become sons and daughters of God.
   - Adoption is grounded in union with Christ and the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - It brings both privileges (inheritance, intimacy) and responsibilities (holiness, obedience).
   - "Adoption is a distinct and climactic blessing that follows justification and regeneration." (Adopted by God)

2. **Biblical Foundation of Adoption**
   - Peterson grounds adoption in key texts such as Romans 8, Galatians 4, and Ephesians 1.
   - He emphasizes the Trinitarian shape: the Father adopts, the Son secures, the Spirit assures.
   - Old Testament background (Israel as God’s son) is fulfilled and expanded in Christ.
   - Adoption is both a present reality and an eschatological hope.
   - "The New Testament’s teaching on adoption is rooted in the Old Testament and reaches its fulfillment in Christ." (Adopted by God)

3. **Adoption and Union with Christ**
   - Adoption is inseparable from the believer’s union with Christ.
   - All the blessings of adoption flow from being “in Christ.”
   - Christ’s own sonship is the model and ground for believers’ adoption.
   - The Spirit of adoption unites believers to Christ and assures them of their status.
   - "Union with Christ is the fountain from which adoption flows." (Salvation Accomplished by the Son)

4. **Adoption and the Work of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies adoption to the believer.
   - The Spirit assures believers of their sonship and enables them to cry “Abba, Father.”
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the evidence and means of adoption.
   - Adoption leads to transformation by the Spirit, producing family likeness.
   - "The Spirit of adoption is the one who assures us that we are God’s children." (Adopted by God)

5. **Adoption’s Ethical and Ecclesial Implications**
   - Adoption creates a new family identity among believers, shaping church life.
   - It calls Christians to love, unity, and mutual care as brothers and sisters.
   - The privileges of adoption entail responsibilities to reflect the Father’s character.
   - Adoption motivates mission, as God seeks more children for His family.
   - "Adoption shapes the church as the family of God and calls us to live as such." (Adopted by God)

## Legacy and Impact

Peterson’s work has contributed to a renewed appreciation of **adoption** as a central and climactic aspect of **Reformed soteriology**. His biblical and systematic treatment has influenced pastors, scholars, and students to recover adoption’s significance for Christian identity and church life. By emphasizing both the privileges and responsibilities of being God’s children, Peterson has helped shape contemporary evangelical understanding of the believer’s relationship to God and to one another.
