# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield situated **adoption** firmly within the ordo salutis, emphasizing its distinctiveness from **justification** and **regeneration** while underscoring its gracious character as a legal act of God. He viewed adoption as the conferral of the status of **sonship** upon believers, rooted in union with Christ and the believer’s participation in the privileges of the **children of God**. Warfield’s treatment of adoption highlights its forensic and relational dimensions within the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology**.

- "Adoption gives us the rights of children, regeneration the nature of children." ("Adoption," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "Adoption" in *Biblical and Theological Studies* (Princeton Theological Seminary, 1912)
- *The Plan of Salvation* (1915)
- *Faith and Life* (1916)
- *The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield*, esp. Vol. 2: *Biblical Doctrines*
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation" (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Forensic Act**
    - Adoption is not identical with justification or regeneration but is a separate legal act in the order of salvation.
    - It confers a new status—**sonship**—upon the believer, distinct from the forgiveness of sins.
    - Warfield insists that adoption is grounded in the believer’s union with Christ, the eternal Son.
    - The privileges of adoption are rooted in the believer’s standing before God as Father.
    - "Adoption is the bestowal of a status, not the infusion of a new nature." ("Adoption," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Adoption and Union with Christ**
    - All the blessings of adoption flow from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Christ’s own sonship is the ground and pattern for the believer’s adoption.
    - Warfield emphasizes the corporate dimension: believers are adopted into the family of God.
    - Adoption is inseparable from the work of the Spirit, who applies Christ’s benefits.
    - "It is only in Christ that we are made sons of God." (*Biblical Doctrines*)

3. **Privileges and Rights of the Children of God**
    - Adoption grants believers access to God as Father and participation in the family of God.
    - The privileges include inheritance, discipline, and the Spirit’s witness.
    - Warfield highlights the assurance and boldness that flow from adoption.
    - The rights of adoption are secured by Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "The adopted are given the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, Father." ("Adoption," in Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Adoption and the Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who assures believers of their status as God’s children.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is both objective (legal) and subjective (experiential).
    - Warfield connects the Spirit’s work in adoption to sanctification and perseverance.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is a mark of adoption and a guarantee of future inheritance.
    - "The Spirit of adoption is the Spirit of Christ, sent into our hearts." (*Faith and Life*)

5. **Adoption’s Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Warfield teaches that adoption has both a present reality and a future consummation.
    - The full realization of adoption awaits the resurrection and glorification of the body.
    - Present adoption is a foretaste of the believer’s final inheritance.
    - The hope of adoption encourages perseverance and holiness.
    - "We wait for adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." (*Biblical Doctrines*)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **adoption** clarified its distinct place within the Reformed ordo salutis and influenced subsequent systematic treatments of the doctrine. His emphasis on the forensic and relational aspects of adoption has shaped evangelical and Reformed understandings, ensuring that adoption is not subsumed under justification or regeneration. Warfield’s legacy endures in the ongoing recognition of adoption as a central, gracious benefit of union with Christ.
