# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **adoption** not as a discrete locus within systematic theology, but as an existential reality grounded in the individual's participation in the **New Being** revealed in **Jesus as the Christ**. For Tillich, the experience of being accepted by God—what classical theology calls adoption—is reframed as the **acceptance of the unacceptable** through **justification** and **reconciliation**, emphasizing the transformative encounter with the **Ground of Being**.

- "You are accepted. You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you..." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as Existential Acceptance**
    - Adoption is interpreted as the existential acceptance of the individual by the **Ground of Being**.
    - It is not a legal or forensic change of status, but a transformation of the self’s relationship to God.
    - This acceptance is experienced in the depth of anxiety and estrangement.
    - The language of adoption is subsumed under the broader category of **justification** and **reconciliation**.
    - "The acceptance of the unacceptable is the message of grace." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

2. **Christ as the Bearer of the New Being**
    - Jesus as the Christ is the manifestation of the **New Being** in whom estrangement is overcome.
    - Through participation in Christ, individuals experience the reality that classical theology describes as adoption.
    - The New Being brings about a new existential state, not merely a change in legal standing.
    - The community of the New Being (the Church) mediates this acceptance.
    - "In him the separation is overcome, and we are accepted." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
    - Tillich moves away from the forensic or juridical language of adoption found in traditional **Reformed** theology.
    - He emphasizes existential and ontological transformation over legal imputation.
    - The focus is on the healing of estrangement, not the declaration of a new legal status.
    - Adoption is thus a metaphor for the existential reality of being accepted.
    - "The Protestant principle is not a doctrine of justification by faith alone, but the experience of being accepted in spite of being unacceptable." (The Protestant Era)

4. **Adoption within the Doctrine of Grace**
    - The experience of adoption is a concrete manifestation of **grace**.
    - Grace is the power that accepts and transforms the estranged.
    - Adoption is not a separate act, but the existential realization of grace’s power.
    - The assurance of acceptance is rooted in the depth of God’s being, not in external decree.
    - "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness... sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying: 'You are accepted.'" (The Shaking of the Foundations)

5. **Community and the New Reality**
    - The **Church** as the community of the New Being is the locus where adoption is existentially realized.
    - The community mediates the message of acceptance and reconciliation.
    - Participation in the Church is participation in the new reality of acceptance.
    - The communal aspect of adoption underscores the social dimension of reconciliation.
    - "The Church is the community in which the New Being is manifest and in which the message of acceptance is proclaimed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **adoption** shifted the focus from legal status to the transformative experience of acceptance and reconciliation. His approach influenced later **systematic theology** by integrating existentialist categories and emphasizing the depth dimension of grace. While Tillich’s framework departs from classical Reformed formulations, his emphasis on the **Ground of Being** and the existential reality of acceptance continues to shape discussions on the meaning of adoption in contemporary theology.
