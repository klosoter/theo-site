# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. situates **adoption** within the broader framework of **union with Christ**, emphasizing its inseparability from other aspects of **ordo salutis** such as **justification** and **sanctification**. He stresses that adoption is a distinct yet integrated benefit of Christ’s redemptive work, realized through the believer’s participation in Christ by the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Adoption is not an isolated benefit but is integrally related to the whole of salvation in union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit"
- "Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (in various essays)
- Contributions to "Justified in Christ: God’s Plan for Us in Justification" (ed. K. Scott Oliphint)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption Flows from Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is a benefit received only in vital union with the resurrected Christ.
    - It is not a separate or subsequent blessing but is simultaneous with justification and sanctification.
    - The believer’s status as a child of God is grounded in Christ’s own sonship.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates this filial relationship, making adoption experiential.
    - "All the benefits of salvation, including adoption, are found in union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Adoption’s Forensic and Transformative Dimensions**
    - Adoption involves a legal change of status before God, paralleling justification.
    - It also entails a transformative relationship, as believers are conformed to the image of the Son.
    - The Spirit’s work is both declarative (status) and renovative (character).
    - Adoption is not merely a metaphor but a real participation in Christ’s sonship.
    - "Adoption is both a matter of status and of being conformed to the image of Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Pneumatological Realization of Adoption**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies adoption to the believer’s experience.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling assures believers of their sonship and enables them to cry, ‘Abba, Father.’
    - Adoption is thus existentially realized through the Spirit’s testimony.
    - The Spirit’s role is central in moving adoption from objective status to subjective assurance.
    - "The Spirit of adoption is the one who assures us that we are children of God." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Adoption’s Eschatological Orientation**
    - Adoption is inaugurated in the present but awaits consummation at the resurrection.
    - The full realization of adoption is tied to the redemption of the body.
    - Present adoption is a foretaste of the final inheritance as sons and daughters.
    - The eschatological tension shapes the believer’s hope and perseverance.
    - "Our adoption is already real, but its fullness awaits the resurrection." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

5. **Integration with Justification and Sanctification**
    - Adoption is not to be separated from justification or sanctification in the ordo salutis.
    - All three are simultaneous benefits of union with Christ, not sequential steps.
    - The forensic and transformative aspects of salvation are held together in adoption.
    - This integration guards against a fragmented view of salvation.
    - "Justification, sanctification, and adoption are inseparable in the believer’s union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **adoption** within the context of **union with Christ** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in Pauline studies. His emphasis on the **pneumatological** and **eschatological** dimensions of adoption has encouraged a more holistic understanding of the believer’s identity and hope. Gaffin’s work continues to influence theological education, particularly at Westminster Theological Seminary, and remains a touchstone for discussions on the integration of the benefits of redemption.
