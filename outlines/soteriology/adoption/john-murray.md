# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray emphasized **adoption** as a distinct and vital aspect of **soteriology**, closely related to but not identical with **justification** and **regeneration**. He argued that adoption confers the status of **sonship** upon believers, grounding their privileges and responsibilities in the believer’s union with **Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Adoption is the apex of grace and privilege; it is the highest expression of the love of God in the order of salvation." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied (1955)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology (1977)
- The Epistle to the Romans (1959–1965)
- Principles of Conduct (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Redemptive Benefit**
    - Adoption is not merely a subset of justification or regeneration but a unique act of God’s grace.
    - It confers a new legal status: believers become children of God with all attendant rights.
    - Adoption is rooted in the believer’s union with Christ, the eternal Son.
    - It is a privilege distinct from the forensic aspect of justification.
    - "Adoption is an act of transfer from an alien family into the family of God himself." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Trinitarian Foundation of Adoption**
    - The Father’s love is the source of adoption.
    - The Son’s redemptive work secures adoption for believers.
    - The Holy Spirit applies adoption, bearing witness with our spirit.
    - Adoption reflects the coordinated work of all three persons of the Trinity.
    - "The Father destines, the Son secures, and the Spirit seals our adoption." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Legal and Relational Dimensions**
    - Adoption involves a legal change of status before God.
    - It also establishes a new, intimate relationship with God as Father.
    - Believers receive the privileges and responsibilities of sons and daughters.
    - The Spirit’s witness assures believers of their filial status.
    - "Adoption brings us into the intimacy of God’s family, not merely into his courtroom." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Privileges and Responsibilities of Sonship**
    - Adoption grants access to God, inheritance, and the Spirit of sonship.
    - It entails discipline and conformity to the image of Christ.
    - Believers are called to live as children of God in holiness.
    - The hope of future glorification is tied to adoption.
    - "The privileges of adoption are matched by the obligations of sonship." (Romans)

5. **Adoption’s Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Present adoption is real but awaits consummation at the resurrection.
    - The full realization of adoption is linked to the redemption of the body.
    - Believers now have the Spirit as a guarantee of future inheritance.
    - The hope of adoption sustains believers amid suffering.
    - "We wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies." (Romans 8:23)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of **adoption** as a distinct locus within the **ordo salutis** has shaped Reformed soteriology and pastoral theology. His careful exegesis and emphasis on the privileges of sonship have influenced generations of theologians and pastors. By grounding adoption in the work of the **Trinity** and highlighting both its present reality and future hope, Murray has contributed to a fuller understanding of the believer’s identity in Christ.
