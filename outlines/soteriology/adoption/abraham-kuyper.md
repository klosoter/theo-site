# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **adoption** within the broader framework of **union with Christ** and the **ordo salutis**, emphasizing the believer's new status as a child of God through the work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Kuyper, adoption is inseparable from **regeneration** and **justification**, manifesting the believer's participation in the privileges and responsibilities of God's family.

- "Adoption is the act whereby God, for Christ’s sake, receives those who are by nature children of wrath into His family and gives them the privileges of His children." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption flows from union with Christ**
    - Adoption is not a separate benefit but is grounded in the believer’s incorporation into Christ.
    - Through union, believers share in Christ’s sonship and receive the privileges of children.
    - Adoption is a legal and relational change effected by Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The benefits of adoption are inseparable from justification and sanctification.
    - "It is only in Christ that we are adopted as sons and daughters of God." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

2. **Adoption is distinct from regeneration**
    - Regeneration imparts new life; adoption confers new status and privileges.
    - The Spirit’s work in regeneration precedes and enables adoption.
    - Adoption is a forensic act, while regeneration is transformative.
    - Both are necessary for full participation in the family of God.
    - "Regeneration makes us children; adoption declares us so." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

3. **Adoption grants real privileges and responsibilities**
    - Believers receive the rights of inheritance as God’s children.
    - Adoption brings access to God as Father and the assurance of His love.
    - It entails the discipline and guidance appropriate to sons and daughters.
    - Adoption calls for a life of gratitude and obedience within God’s household.
    - "The privileges of adoption are not abstract, but are realized in the believer’s daily walk." (Het Werk van den Heiligen Geest)

4. **Adoption is rooted in God’s sovereign grace**
    - Adoption is not earned but flows from God’s electing love in Christ.
    - The initiative belongs wholly to God, not to human merit or effort.
    - It is a manifestation of God’s fatherly compassion and faithfulness.
    - Adoption is secured by the finished work of Christ and applied by the Spirit.
    - "All the blessings of adoption are gifts of sovereign grace." (De Gemeene Gratie)

5. **Adoption shapes the communal life of the church**
    - The church is the family of God, united by adoption in Christ.
    - Adoption creates a new identity that transcends natural relationships.
    - It fosters mutual love, service, and accountability among believers.
    - The adopted community anticipates the fullness of God’s household in glory.
    - "The church is the fellowship of the adopted, a foretaste of the eternal family." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s doctrine of **adoption** reinforced the Reformed emphasis on the believer’s new identity and privileges in Christ, shaping later discussions of the **ordo salutis** and the communal nature of salvation. His integration of adoption with union with Christ and the life of the church influenced both Dutch Reformed and broader evangelical theology. Kuyper’s holistic vision continues to inspire reflection on the practical and ecclesial implications of being children of God.
