# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of **adoption** is deeply integrated into his Christocentric understanding of **election** and **reconciliation**. For Barth, adoption is not a secondary benefit but the very heart of the gospel, as humanity is elected in Christ to become **children of God** through participation in the Son’s relationship with the Father. This adoption is realized in the history of Jesus Christ and is the foundation for the believer’s new identity and relationship with God.

- "In Jesus Christ God has adopted man and made him His child." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)

- Karl Barth: A Theology of Word and Spirit (Geoffrey Bromiley)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption is grounded in Christ’s election**
    - Adoption is not a separate act but is included in God’s **eternal election** of humanity in Christ.
    - Jesus Christ is both the **Electing God** and the **Elected Man**, embodying humanity’s adoption.
    - All who are in Christ share in His status as the **Son of God**.
    - Election is fundamentally the election to adoption, not merely to salvation.
    - "Jesus Christ is the One in whom God has chosen us to be His children." (CD II/2)

2. **Adoption is realized through reconciliation**
    - The work of **reconciliation** in Christ restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.
    - Through Christ’s obedience, believers are brought into the family of God.
    - Adoption is not merely legal but relational, involving participation in the life of the Triune God.
    - The Spirit enables believers to cry, “Abba, Father,” reflecting their new status.
    - "Reconciliation means that man is adopted into the family of God." (CD IV/1)

3. **Universal scope of adoption in Christ**
    - Barth emphasizes the **objective reality** of adoption accomplished in Christ for all humanity.
    - The distinction between the “children of God” and others is not one of exclusion but of realization.
    - Faith is the subjective recognition of an already-established adoption.
    - The church is the community that witnesses to this universal adoption.
    - "All men are included in the history of Jesus Christ, and therefore in the adoption of sons." (CD IV/1)

4. **Adoption as participation in the Son’s relationship**
    - Believers are adopted not as isolated individuals but as participants in the Son’s filial relationship to the Father.
    - The **Holy Spirit** mediates this participation, uniting believers to Christ.
    - Adoption is dynamic, involving growth into the likeness of the Son.
    - The filial status is both a gift and a calling to live as children of God.
    - "We are children of God because we are in the Son." (CD IV/1)

5. **Adoption shapes Christian identity and ethics**
    - Adoption provides the foundation for Christian assurance and identity.
    - It calls believers to live in gratitude and obedience as members of God’s family.
    - The ethical life is a response to the reality of adoption, not a means to achieve it.
    - The church’s mission is to proclaim and embody the reality of adoption in Christ.
    - "The Christian life is the life of the adopted child of God." (CD IV/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust doctrine of **adoption** has profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in its emphasis on the **Christological** and **Trinitarian** grounding of salvation. His integration of adoption with election and reconciliation has challenged both Reformed and broader Christian traditions to reconsider the centrality of filial identity in soteriology. Barth’s thought continues to shape ecumenical dialogues and contemporary discussions on the meaning of being children of God.
