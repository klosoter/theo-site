# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate **adoption** as a distinct benefit of **union with Christ**, received through **justification**. Adoption is presented as a gracious act by which believers are received into the number of God’s children, enjoying the **privileges** and **inheritance** of sons. This doctrine is rooted in the broader framework of **ordo salutis** and highlights the believer’s new status and relationship within the **covenant of grace**.

- "All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption." (Westminster Confession of Faith 12.1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Benefit of Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is not identical with justification or sanctification but is a unique benefit.
    - It is grounded in the believer’s union with Christ and flows from justification.
    - Adoption confers a new legal and relational status before God.
    - The Standards emphasize the privileges and responsibilities of sonship.
    - "All those that are justified...are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God." (WCF 12.1)

2. **Privileges of Adoption**
    - Adopted believers enjoy access to God as Father.
    - They receive the Spirit of adoption, enabling them to cry, "Abba, Father."
    - They are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by God as by a Father.
    - They are never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption and inherit the promises.
    - "They have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness..." (WLC 74)

3. **Adoption and the Covenant of Grace**
    - Adoption is a benefit of the covenant of grace, not of works.
    - It is received by faith alone in Christ, not by human merit.
    - The privileges of adoption are secured by Christ’s mediation.
    - The covenant context underscores the communal and familial aspects of adoption.
    - "In and for his only Son Jesus Christ, God vouchsafeth...the grace of adoption." (WCF 12.1)

4. **Adoption’s Legal and Relational Dimensions**
    - Adoption involves a legal change of status from alienation to sonship.
    - It also entails a relational transformation: God becomes the believer’s Father.
    - The Standards stress both the rights and the intimacy of the adopted child.
    - This dual aspect shapes the believer’s assurance and obedience.
    - "They are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God." (WSC 34)

5. **Adoption and Inheritance**
    - Adopted believers become heirs of everlasting salvation.
    - The inheritance includes both present privileges and future glory.
    - The Standards connect adoption to the eschatological hope of believers.
    - This inheritance is secured by Christ and guaranteed by the Spirit.
    - "As heirs of everlasting salvation, they are never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption." (WLC 74)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards’ doctrine of **adoption** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, distinguishing adoption as a unique and gracious benefit within the **ordo salutis**. Their careful articulation of both the legal and relational aspects of adoption has influenced subsequent confessional documents and pastoral theology. By grounding adoption in the **covenant of grace** and union with Christ, the Standards provide a robust framework for understanding the believer’s identity and privileges as a child of God. This legacy continues to inform Reformed teaching, preaching, and spiritual formation.
