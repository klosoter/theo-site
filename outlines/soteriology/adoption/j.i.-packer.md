# J.I. Packer (1926–2020)

J.I. Packer emphasized **adoption** as a central privilege of the **gospel**, distinguishing it from and elevating it above even **justification** in the believer’s experience. For Packer, adoption is the act by which God brings sinners into His **family**, granting them the status and privileges of **sons of God** through union with **Christ**. He saw this doctrine as foundational for understanding the believer’s relationship with God and the assurance, intimacy, and transformation that flow from it.

- "Adoption is the highest privilege that the gospel offers: higher even than justification." ("Knowing God")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as the Supreme Privilege of the Gospel**
    - Adoption surpasses justification in terms of relational privilege, though not in legal necessity.
    - It brings believers into a new status as **children of God**, not merely as pardoned sinners.
    - The familial relationship with God is central to Christian identity and assurance.
    - Adoption is rooted in the eternal purpose of God and accomplished through Christ.
    - "To be right with God the Judge is a great thing, but to be loved and cared for by God the Father is greater." (Knowing God)

2. **Adoption Through Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is inseparable from **union with Christ**, who is the eternal Son.
    - Believers share in Christ’s sonship by grace, not by nature.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them co-heirs with Him.
    - Adoption is a Trinitarian act, involving the Father’s love, the Son’s mediation, and the Spirit’s witness.
    - "Our sonship to God is a gift of grace through Jesus Christ." (Knowing God)

3. **The Transformative Power of Adoption**
    - Adoption leads to a new identity and way of life, marked by holiness and love.
    - The Spirit of adoption enables believers to cry “Abba, Father,” fostering intimacy and assurance.
    - It motivates obedience not out of fear, but out of filial love and gratitude.
    - Adoption entails both privilege and responsibility within God’s household.
    - "The entire Christian life has to be understood in terms of adoption." (Knowing God)

4. **Assurance and Intimacy with God**
    - Adoption grounds the believer’s assurance in God’s unchanging fatherly love.
    - It provides the basis for confident prayer and access to God.
    - The Spirit testifies to the believer’s status as God’s child, dispelling fear.
    - Intimacy with God is the hallmark of the adopted life.
    - "If you want to judge how well a person understands Christianity, find out how much he makes of the thought of being God’s child." (Knowing God)

5. **Adoption as the Framework for Christian Community**
    - Adoption creates a new family, the church, united as brothers and sisters in Christ.
    - It shapes the church’s ethos as a community of love, acceptance, and mutual care.
    - The privileges of adoption are shared corporately, not just individually.
    - The church’s mission is to invite others into God’s family through the gospel.
    - "The revelation to the believer that God is his Father is in a sense the climax of the Bible." (Knowing God)

## Legacy and Impact

Packer’s robust articulation of **adoption** has profoundly shaped evangelical and Reformed understandings of the doctrine, restoring it to a central place in systematic theology and Christian spirituality. His emphasis on the believer’s filial relationship with God has influenced pastoral practice, discipleship, and the ethos of Christian community. By highlighting adoption as the highest privilege of the gospel, Packer has helped generations of Christians grasp the depth of God’s love and the transformative power of being called His children.
