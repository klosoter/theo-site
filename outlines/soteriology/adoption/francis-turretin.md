# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, treats **adoption** as a distinct and gracious benefit of **union with Christ**, closely linked to **justification** but not identical with it. He emphasizes that adoption is a forensic act by which believers are received into the number of God's children, enjoying both the privileges and responsibilities of **sonship** within the **ordo salutis**.

- "Adoption is not a mere external relation, but a real and gracious privilege, by which we are made sons of God and heirs of eternal life." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially vol. 2, topics on justification and adoption)
- Reformed Dogmatics (as compiled and referenced in secondary literature)
- The Doctrine of Adoption in Reformed Orthodoxy (secondary analysis, e.g., J.V. Fesko, "Word, Water, and Spirit")
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as Turretin interacts with its formulations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption is a Forensic Benefit Distinct from Justification**
    - Adoption is a legal act, not a process of moral transformation.
    - It follows justification in the **ordo salutis**, yet is not reducible to it.
    - Through adoption, believers receive a new status as children of God.
    - The privileges of adoption are grounded in Christ’s merit, not human worthiness.
    - "Adoption is not the same as justification, but a distinct benefit, though inseparably connected with it." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Adoption Confers Real Privileges and Responsibilities**
    - Believers gain access to God as Father and enjoy filial communion.
    - Adoption grants the right to the inheritance of eternal life.
    - It entails both privileges (e.g., assurance, inheritance) and duties (e.g., obedience).
    - The Spirit of adoption enables believers to cry, "Abba, Father."
    - "By adoption, we are not only counted righteous, but also made heirs and sons." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Adoption is Rooted in Union with Christ**
    - All benefits of salvation, including adoption, flow from union with Christ.
    - Christ is the natural Son; believers are sons by grace and adoption.
    - Union with Christ ensures the believer’s participation in Christ’s sonship.
    - Adoption is inseparable from the work of the Mediator.
    - "We are adopted in Christ, the only begotten Son, that we may be sons by grace as he is by nature." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Adoption is an Act of God’s Free Grace**
    - It is not earned by works, but given solely by divine grace.
    - God’s electing love is the foundation of adoption.
    - The act is rooted in the eternal counsel of God.
    - Adoption displays the riches of God’s mercy and kindness.
    - "Adoption flows from the free grace and good pleasure of God, not from any merit in us." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Adoption is Eschatological in Orientation**
    - The full realization of adoption awaits the resurrection and glorification.
    - Presently, believers possess the Spirit as the guarantee of their inheritance.
    - The privileges of adoption are both already enjoyed and not yet consummated.
    - The hope of adoption sustains believers in their pilgrimage.
    - "We have the firstfruits of adoption now, but await its fullness in the redemption of our bodies." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of **adoption** as a distinct, forensic benefit within the **ordo salutis** has shaped Reformed confessional theology and subsequent systematic treatments of salvation. His careful distinction between **justification** and adoption influenced later theologians and confessions, including the Westminster Standards. Turretin’s emphasis on the privileges and responsibilities of sonship continues to inform contemporary discussions on the believer’s identity and assurance in Christ.
