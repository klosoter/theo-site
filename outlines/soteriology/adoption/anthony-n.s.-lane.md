# Anthony N.S. Lane (1950– )

Anthony N.S. Lane, a leading scholar of **Reformation theology**, has contributed significantly to the understanding of **adoption** as a distinct aspect of **soteriology**. Lane emphasizes the importance of **adoption** in the context of **union with Christ**, distinguishing it from **justification** and **sanctification** while highlighting its biblical and historical development, especially in the thought of **John Calvin**.

- "Adoption is a distinct benefit of union with Christ, closely related to justification but not to be confused with it." ("Calvin’s Doctrine of Adoption: A Historical and Theological Analysis")

## Key Works

- "Calvin’s Doctrine of Adoption: A Historical and Theological Analysis" (Evangelical Quarterly, 1991)
- "Justification by Faith in Catholic-Protestant Dialogue: An Evangelical Assessment" (2002)
- "A Concise History of Christian Doctrine" (2006)
- "John Calvin: Student of the Church Fathers" (1999)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Soteriological Benefit**
   - Adoption is not merely a subset of justification but a separate benefit granted in **union with Christ**.
   - Lane traces the biblical roots of adoption, especially in Pauline texts such as Romans 8 and Galatians 4.
   - He highlights the Reformation recovery of adoption, particularly in Calvin’s theology.
   - Adoption confers the status of **children of God**, with privileges distinct from those of justification.
   - "Adoption is not simply a metaphor for justification but a distinct act of God’s grace." ("Calvin’s Doctrine of Adoption")

2. **Relationship Between Adoption and Justification**
   - Lane argues that **justification** and **adoption** are closely related but must be distinguished.
   - Justification addresses the believer’s legal status; adoption addresses familial relationship.
   - Both are benefits of **union with Christ**, but adoption emphasizes intimacy and inheritance.
   - Confusing the two diminishes the richness of biblical soteriology.
   - "Justification and adoption are twin benefits, but adoption brings us into the family, not just the courtroom." ("Calvin’s Doctrine of Adoption")

3. **Adoption and the Work of the Spirit**
   - The **Holy Spirit** is central in applying adoption, enabling believers to cry, “Abba, Father.”
   - Lane underscores the experiential dimension of adoption through the Spirit’s witness.
   - Adoption is not only a change of status but also a transformation of relationship and assurance.
   - The Spirit’s role is prominent in both Pauline theology and Reformation thought.
   - "The Spirit of adoption is the one who assures us of our sonship and enables us to address God as Father." ("A Concise History of Christian Doctrine")

4. **Historical Development of Adoption Doctrine**
   - Lane documents the relative neglect of adoption in medieval theology.
   - He credits the **Reformers**, especially Calvin, with restoring adoption to its biblical prominence.
   - Adoption became a hallmark of Reformed soteriology, distinct from Roman Catholic formulations.
   - Lane’s historical analysis shows adoption’s theological significance across the centuries.
   - "It is with the Reformation, and especially with Calvin, that adoption comes into its own as a theological concept." ("Calvin’s Doctrine of Adoption")

5. **Adoption’s Ethical and Ecclesial Implications**
   - Adoption shapes the believer’s identity and ethical life as a member of God’s family.
   - It grounds Christian assurance and motivates love for fellow believers as brothers and sisters.
   - Lane notes the ecclesial dimension: adoption forms the basis for the church as the family of God.
   - The privileges and responsibilities of adoption extend to the life of the Christian community.
   - "Adoption is not only an individual blessing but also the foundation for the church as God’s household." ("A Concise History of Christian Doctrine")

## Legacy and Impact

Lane’s scholarship has renewed attention to **adoption** as a vital locus within **Reformed soteriology**, especially by clarifying its distinction from **justification** and its importance in the theology of **John Calvin**. His historical and biblical analysis has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions, encouraging a fuller appreciation of the believer’s status as a child of God. Lane’s work continues to shape contemporary understanding of adoption’s role in the **ordo salutis** and the life of the church.
