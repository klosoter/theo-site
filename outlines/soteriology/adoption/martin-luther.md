# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **adoption** is closely tied to his understanding of **justification by faith alone** and the believer’s union with **Christ**. While Luther does not develop adoption as a distinct locus, he affirms that through faith, believers are made **children of God**, receiving the privileges and status of sonship by virtue of their union with Christ, the true Son. This filial relationship is grounded in the **imputed righteousness of Christ** and the gracious initiative of God the Father.

- "Through faith in Christ, we are all sons of God." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- Small Catechism (1529)
- Large Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption flows from justification by faith**
    - Adoption is inseparable from **justification**, as both are received through faith alone.
    - The believer’s status as a child of God is not earned but granted by God’s grace.
    - Justification establishes a new relationship with God, making the believer an heir.
    - The legal declaration of righteousness includes the relational reality of sonship.
    - "Faith alone makes us children of God, not works." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Union with Christ as the basis for adoption**
    - Believers are united to Christ, the natural Son, and thus share in His sonship.
    - This union is effected by the Holy Spirit through faith.
    - All the benefits of Christ, including adoption, are communicated to the believer.
    - Adoption is not a separate gift but part of the whole Christ gives.
    - "Because we are in Christ, we are counted as sons and heirs." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Adoption as a gift of grace, not merit**
    - God’s act of adopting sinners is entirely gracious and unmerited.
    - Human works or efforts play no role in becoming children of God.
    - The initiative belongs to God, who chooses and calls His children.
    - Adoption underscores the radical nature of the gospel’s promise.
    - "It is by grace alone that we are called sons of God." (Commentary on Romans)

4. **Adoption entails new identity and privileges**
    - Believers receive a new identity as sons and daughters of God.
    - This status brings privileges such as access to God, inheritance, and the Spirit.
    - The believer’s relationship to God is transformed from fear to filial confidence.
    - Adoption assures believers of their acceptance and security in Christ.
    - "We have the Spirit of adoption, crying, Abba, Father." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **The Spirit’s witness to adoption**
    - The Holy Spirit confirms and assures believers of their status as God’s children.
    - The Spirit enables believers to call upon God as Father with confidence.
    - Assurance of adoption is a work of the Spirit, not human feeling or achievement.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is central to the believer’s experience of sonship.
    - "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God." (Commentary on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **adoption** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of the believer’s relationship to God, emphasizing the gracious and unmerited nature of sonship. His integration of adoption with **justification** and **union with Christ** influenced later Reformed and Lutheran theology, even though he did not treat adoption as a separate doctrinal locus. Luther’s focus on the filial confidence of the believer before God continues to inform discussions of Christian identity and assurance in the context of salvation by grace alone.
