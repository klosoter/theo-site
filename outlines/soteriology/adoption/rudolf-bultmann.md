# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not treat **adoption** as a distinct locus within **soteriology** but addressed related themes through his existential interpretation of **Pauline theology**. For Bultmann, the language of adoption in the New Testament is best understood as a mythological expression pointing to the believer’s new existential relationship with God, realized through faith in Christ and participation in the **kerygma**. He emphasized the **demythologization** of such terms to uncover their existential significance for the modern person.

- "The event of salvation is not a miraculous change in man's nature, but a new self-understanding brought about by the proclamation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (especially on Pauline soteriology)
- New Testament and Mythology
- Faith and Understanding
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Existence and Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Biblical Language**
    - Adoption and other soteriological terms are mythological expressions requiring existential interpretation.
    - The New Testament’s familial metaphors must be translated into categories meaningful for modern existence.
    - The focus is on the proclamation’s effect, not on ontological changes in status.
    - The existential encounter with the **kerygma** is central, not legal or forensic categories.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Understanding of Salvation**
    - Salvation, including adoption, is understood as a new self-understanding before God.
    - The believer’s relationship to God is redefined through faith, not through a change in metaphysical status.
    - Adoption language points to authentic existence as a child of God.
    - The existential decision is the locus of transformation, not ritual or legal transaction.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept existence as it comes from God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the means by which individuals experience adoption.
    - The kerygma confronts the hearer with a call to decision and new existence.
    - Adoption is realized in the present encounter with the word, not in a past event.
    - The church’s task is to proclaim, not to mediate ontological changes.
    - "The word of preaching is itself the event of salvation." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Forensic or Legalistic Categories**
    - Bultmann rejects the notion of adoption as a legal status conferred by God.
    - He critiques traditional doctrines that treat adoption as a juridical act.
    - The emphasis is on existential transformation, not forensic declaration.
    - The believer’s new status is existential, not legal or institutional.
    - "The concept of justification must be understood existentially, not legally." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Pauline Theology Interpreted Existentially**
    - Bultmann interprets Paul’s adoption language as symbolic of new existence in Christ.
    - The believer’s sonship is a metaphor for authentic life in faith.
    - The Spirit’s witness to adoption is the internal assurance of new self-understanding.
    - Pauline adoption is not about metaphysical change but about existential orientation.
    - "To be in Christ is to be a new creation; this is the existential meaning of adoption." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **adoption** has profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology**, especially in its emphasis on demythologization and existential interpretation. His work challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran categories, prompting ongoing debate about the meaning of biblical metaphors like adoption. While his views remain controversial, Bultmann’s influence endures in discussions about the relationship between biblical language and contemporary faith. His legacy is especially evident in the ongoing quest to make ancient theological concepts intelligible to the modern world.
