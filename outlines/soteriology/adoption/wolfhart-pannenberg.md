# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approaches **adoption** within the broader context of **soteriology** and **eschatology**, emphasizing the believer’s participation in the **Sonship of Christ**. For Pannenberg, **adoption** is not merely a legal declaration but a dynamic process rooted in the **resurrection of Jesus** and the unfolding of **God’s self-revelation** in history. This understanding situates adoption within the communal and future-oriented dimensions of salvation.

- "The adoption of believers as sons is grounded in their participation in the destiny of Jesus Christ, the Son." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology," Vol. 2 (especially sections on soteriology and Christology)
- "Jesus—God and Man"
- "Anthropology in Theological Perspective"
- "The Idea of God and Human Freedom"
- "The Theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg" (Stanley J. Grenz)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as Participation in Christ’s Sonship**
   - Adoption is inseparable from union with the resurrected Christ.
   - Believers share in the filial relationship Jesus has with the Father.
   - This participation is both present and anticipatory, awaiting consummation.
   - The Spirit mediates this filial relationship within the community.
   - "The sonship of believers is not an independent status but a participation in the Sonship of Jesus." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Adoption**
   - Adoption is oriented toward the final realization of salvation.
   - The fullness of adoption will be revealed at the resurrection of the dead.
   - Present experience of adoption is provisional and points to future glory.
   - The church lives in hope, anticipating the completion of adoption.
   - "The adoption of believers is an eschatological reality, fully manifest only in the resurrection." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Trinitarian Grounding of Adoption**
   - Adoption is rooted in the self-revelation of the Triune God.
   - The Father adopts through the Son by the work of the Spirit.
   - The relational dynamics of the Trinity shape the believer’s new identity.
   - Adoption reflects the communal nature of God’s own life.
   - "The trinitarian structure of revelation is the basis for understanding the adoption of believers." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 1)

4. **Historical Revelation and Adoption**
   - God’s self-disclosure in history culminates in Christ, enabling adoption.
   - The story of Israel and Jesus forms the narrative context for adoption.
   - Adoption is not an abstract doctrine but unfolds in redemptive history.
   - The believer’s status is tied to God’s ongoing historical action.
   - "The history of Jesus is the decisive event in which the adoption of humanity is made possible." ("Jesus—God and Man")

5. **Communal and Ecclesial Dimension**
   - Adoption is experienced within the community of faith.
   - The church is the sphere where adopted status is lived out and affirmed.
   - Baptism and participation in the life of the church signify adoption.
   - The communal aspect resists individualistic interpretations.
   - "The church is the community of those who, through the Spirit, participate in the Sonship of Christ." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s treatment of **adoption** has influenced contemporary discussions of **soteriology** by emphasizing its **Trinitarian** and **eschatological** dimensions. His focus on participation in Christ and the communal nature of adoption has shaped ecumenical dialogues and modern ecclesiology. Pannenberg’s integration of historical revelation with theological anthropology continues to inform constructive theology and the understanding of Christian identity.
