# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin understood **adoption** as a central benefit of union with Christ, inseparable from **justification** and rooted in the believer’s participation in Christ’s sonship. For Calvin, **adoption** is the gracious act by which God makes sinners His children, granting them the privileges and responsibilities of membership in the **family of God**. This doctrine is closely tied to Calvin’s emphasis on **union with Christ**, the work of the **Holy Spirit**, and the believer’s assurance of salvation.

- "For God could not receive us into his favor, nor acknowledge us as his children, unless he found in us something of his own image." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 1 and 11)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans (especially Romans 8)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Galatians (especially Galatians 4)
- Sermons on Ephesians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption flows from union with Christ**
    - Adoption is inseparable from being united to Christ by faith.
    - Christ’s own sonship is the ground for believers’ adoption.
    - Believers share in Christ’s privileges as sons of God.
    - Adoption is not a separate benefit but part of the whole salvation package in Christ.
    - "We are adopted in Christ, because he is the Son of God by nature, and we by grace." (Institutes, 3.1.2)

2. **Adoption is a legal and relational status**
    - Adoption grants both a new legal standing and a filial relationship with God.
    - The believer is no longer a slave but a son and heir.
    - This status is secured by Christ’s righteousness imputed to the believer.
    - Adoption brings with it the privileges and duties of sonship.
    - "He calls us his children, not only because he created us, but because he freely adopted us in Christ." (Commentary on John 1:12)

3. **The Holy Spirit assures and enables adoption**
    - The Spirit is the agent who testifies to the believer’s adoption.
    - The Spirit enables believers to cry, “Abba, Father.”
    - Assurance of adoption is a work of the Spirit, not human effort.
    - The Spirit’s witness is both internal (subjective) and grounded in the Word (objective).
    - "The Spirit of adoption is the witness of our adoption, and seals it in our hearts." (Commentary on Romans 8:15)

4. **Adoption entails inheritance and discipline**
    - Adoption makes believers heirs of eternal life and all God’s promises.
    - Discipline is a mark of true sonship, not a sign of rejection.
    - The inheritance is both present (spiritual blessings) and future (glorification).
    - Suffering with Christ is part of the path to inheritance.
    - "God does not treat us as strangers, but as sons whom he trains by the cross." (Institutes, 3.8.6)

5. **Adoption fosters assurance and gratitude**
    - Adoption grounds the believer’s assurance of God’s fatherly love.
    - It motivates gratitude and obedience, not presumption.
    - Assurance is rooted in God’s promise, not in human merit.
    - Adoption leads to a life of prayer, trust, and worship.
    - "Nothing is more certain than this adoption, for it rests on God’s immutable promise." (Commentary on Galatians 4:7)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **adoption** shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the believer’s filial relationship to God, emphasizing both the privileges and responsibilities of sonship. His integration of adoption with **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** provided a foundation for later Reformed confessions and pastoral theology. Calvin’s teaching continues to influence discussions on assurance, the Christian life, and the nature of salvation within the broader Reformed tradition.
