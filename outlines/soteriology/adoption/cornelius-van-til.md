# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **adoption** within the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing its place as a benefit of union with Christ and the believer’s participation in the **covenant of grace**. He understood adoption as a forensic and relational reality, rooted in the believer’s new status before God, and inseparable from the doctrines of **justification** and **sanctification**. Van Til’s apologetic method highlighted the **Trinitarian** basis of adoption, insisting that only the Christian worldview can account for the believer’s filial relationship to God.

- "The believer’s adoption into the family of God is possible only because the triune God has, in sovereign grace, established a covenantal relationship with his people." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Covenant Blessing**
   - Adoption is a benefit conferred within the context of the **covenant of grace**.
   - It is inseparable from other redemptive blessings such as **justification** and **sanctification**.
   - The believer’s status as a child of God is grounded in Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - Adoption reflects God’s sovereign initiative and grace toward his people.
   - "All the blessings of salvation, including adoption, flow from the covenantal relationship established by God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Trinitarian Foundation of Adoption**
   - Adoption is rooted in the eternal purpose of the **triune God**.
   - The Father elects, the Son accomplishes redemption, and the Spirit applies adoption to the believer.
   - The believer’s sonship mirrors the Son’s relationship to the Father, though analogically.
   - Only a Trinitarian worldview can account for the reality of adoption.
   - "It is only in the context of the Trinity that the doctrine of adoption has its full meaning." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Union with Christ as the Basis**
   - Adoption is realized through **union with Christ**.
   - All who are united to Christ share in his sonship and privileges.
   - This union is both legal (forensic) and vital (transformative).
   - Adoption is not an isolated benefit but part of the ordo salutis.
   - "Our adoption is inseparable from our union with Christ, in whom we receive every spiritual blessing." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Apologetic Significance of Adoption**
   - The doctrine of adoption demonstrates the uniqueness of the Christian worldview.
   - Non-Christian systems cannot account for a personal, covenantal relationship with God.
   - Adoption underscores the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
   - The believer’s identity as God’s child is foundational for Christian epistemology and ethics.
   - "Only the Christian can truly claim God as Father in the redemptive sense." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Ethical and Ecclesial Implications**
   - Adoption entails new ethical responsibilities as members of God’s family.
   - It grounds the believer’s assurance and motivation for sanctification.
   - The church is the community of the adopted, reflecting God’s familial love.
   - Adoption shapes the believer’s relationship to God, others, and the world.
   - "The church as the family of God is the visible expression of our adoption in Christ." (Essays on Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **adoption** into the broader framework of covenant theology and his insistence on its Trinitarian and apologetic significance have influenced generations of Reformed theologians and apologists. His work reinforced the centrality of **union with Christ** and the uniqueness of the Christian worldview in understanding salvation’s benefits. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the covenantal and communal dimensions of adoption within Reformed theology.
