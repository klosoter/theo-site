# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas addresses **adoption** primarily within the context of **divine filiation** and the **order of grace**. For Aquinas, adoption is a supernatural participation in the **sonship of Christ**, granted by God through **justification** and realized in the believer’s incorporation into the **Body of Christ**. This adoption is not natural but a gift of **grace** that transforms the believer’s status before God.

- "To be adopted is to be taken into the dignity of sons by a gratuitous gift of God." (Summa Theologiae III, q.23, a.3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, q.23 ("Of Adoption as Befitting to Christ")
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on Romans (notably on Romans 8)
- De Veritate

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as Participation in Divine Filiation**
    - Adoption is a sharing in the **sonship** of Christ, not by nature but by grace.
    - The believer becomes a son of God through **incorporation into Christ**.
    - This participation is real, though analogical, reflecting the unique sonship of Christ.
    - Adoption is grounded in the eternal **predestination** of God.
    - "Adoption is a certain likeness of natural sonship, for it consists in this, that men are made sons of God by a gift of grace." (ST III, q.23, a.1)

2. **Adoption Rooted in Justification**
    - Adoption occurs through the **infusion of sanctifying grace**.
    - It is inseparable from the process of **justification** and renewal.
    - The justified are given the **Holy Spirit**, who enables them to cry, "Abba, Father."
    - Adoption is both a present reality and a future hope, consummated in glory.
    - "By the grace of adoption men receive the Holy Spirit, by whom they are made sons of God." (ST III, q.23, a.3)

3. **Distinction Between Natural and Adoptive Sonship**
    - Christ is the Son of God by **nature**; believers are sons by **adoption**.
    - Adoptive sonship does not confer divinity but a new relational status.
    - The distinction safeguards the **uniqueness of Christ’s person**.
    - Adopted sons are conformed to Christ’s image, not His essence.
    - "Christ is the natural Son of God; others are sons by adoption, made so by grace." (ST III, q.23, a.2)

4. **Adoption as Gratuitous Gift**
    - Adoption is entirely a matter of **divine initiative and grace**.
    - No human merit can earn or cause adoption.
    - It is a manifestation of God’s **benevolence and love** toward the elect.
    - The gift of adoption is irrevocable, rooted in God’s eternal will.
    - "Adoption is not due to any merits, but is given by the liberality of God." (ST III, q.23, a.3)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Adoption**
    - The fullness of adoption will be realized in the **resurrection and glorification**.
    - Present adoption is the pledge of future inheritance.
    - The adopted sons will be conformed to Christ in glory.
    - The hope of adoption sustains the believer’s perseverance.
    - "We are said to be adopted sons in so far as we are predestined to the inheritance of eternal glory." (ST III, q.23, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **adoption** shaped later Catholic and Protestant understandings of **divine filiation** and the believer’s relationship to God. His careful distinction between **natural** and **adoptive sonship** provided a framework for discussing the uniqueness of Christ and the gracious character of salvation. Aquinas’s synthesis of biblical and philosophical sources on adoption continues to influence systematic theology, especially in discussions of grace, justification, and the believer’s eschatological hope.
