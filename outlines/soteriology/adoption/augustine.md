# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not develop a systematic doctrine of **adoption** as later Reformed theologians did, but he addressed the believer’s status as **children of God** within his broader theology of **salvation**, **grace**, and **union with Christ**. For Augustine, adoption is rooted in the believer’s participation in Christ, the true Son, and is realized through the transformative work of the **Holy Spirit** in the context of the **Church**. He connects adoption closely to the themes of **regeneration** and **inheritance** in Christ.

- "For He has given them power to become the sons of God, to them that believe on His name." (On the Gospel of John, Tractate 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption through Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is possible only because believers are united to Christ, the eternal Son.
    - Christ’s incarnation enables humans to become sons by grace, as He is Son by nature.
    - The believer’s new status is a participation in Christ’s own sonship.
    - This union is effected by faith and maintained within the Church.
    - "He, therefore, who was the Son of God made the sons of men to be sons of God." (Enchiridion 34)

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Adoption**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies adoption to the believer’s life.
    - Through the Spirit, believers receive the inner witness of their new identity.
    - The Spirit enables believers to cry, “Abba, Father,” signifying true filial relationship.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the sign and seal of adoption.
    - "It is by the Spirit that we are made sons of God." (On the Spirit and the Letter 27)

3. **Adoption as Gift of Grace**
    - Adoption is not earned but is a free gift of **divine grace**.
    - Human merit or effort plays no role in becoming a child of God.
    - Grace precedes and enables faith, which is the means of receiving adoption.
    - The initiative in adoption belongs entirely to God’s mercy.
    - "For what have we that we have not received?" (1 Corinthians 4:7, cited in various works)

4. **Adoption and Regeneration**
    - Adoption is closely linked to the new birth or **regeneration**.
    - Baptism is the sacramental means by which one is incorporated into the family of God.
    - Regeneration marks the transition from being children of wrath to children of God.
    - The new identity is both legal (status) and transformative (nature).
    - "By regeneration, we are made sons of God." (On the Gospel of John, Tractate 12)

5. **Adoption and Inheritance**
    - Adoption grants believers a share in the **inheritance** of Christ.
    - The inheritance is both present (spiritual blessings) and future (eternal life).
    - The Church is the context in which the inheritance is received and nurtured.
    - Full realization of the inheritance awaits the resurrection and final glorification.
    - "If sons, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." (City of God, Book XXII)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **adoption** laid foundational categories for later Western theology, especially in connecting adoption to **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. His emphasis on grace and the unmerited nature of becoming children of God shaped both medieval and Reformation thought. While he did not systematize adoption as a distinct locus, his insights continue to inform discussions on the believer’s identity and inheritance within the **Church**.
