# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **adoption** within the broader context of **reconciliation** and the believer’s relationship to God through **Jesus Christ**. For Brunner, adoption is not a distinct locus but is integrated into his doctrine of **justification** and **new creation**, emphasizing the personal and relational aspects of salvation. He stressed that through Christ, believers are brought into a filial relationship with God, marked by **divine grace** and **personal encounter**.

- "The heart of the Christian message is that in Jesus Christ we are made children of God." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Man in Revolt
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as Personal Relationship**
   - Adoption is fundamentally about entering a personal relationship with God as Father.
   - This relationship is established through the **mediatorship of Christ**.
   - Brunner rejects impersonal or merely legalistic accounts of salvation.
   - The believer’s new status is defined by **intimate fellowship** with God.
   - "Christian faith means to be taken up into the relationship of the Son to the Father." (The Mediator)

2. **Adoption Grounded in Reconciliation**
   - Adoption is inseparable from the work of **reconciliation** accomplished by Christ.
   - Through reconciliation, the barrier of sin is removed, enabling filial status.
   - Brunner sees adoption as the existential realization of reconciliation.
   - The believer’s adoption is both a gift and a calling to new life.
   - "Reconciliation means that we are accepted as children, not merely forgiven as sinners." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

3. **Adoption and the New Creation**
   - Adoption is part of the **new creation** inaugurated in Christ.
   - It signifies a transformation of the believer’s identity and destiny.
   - The Spirit’s work is essential in actualizing this new status.
   - Adoption entails participation in the life of the **new humanity**.
   - "In Christ, the new man is created, and with him, the new relationship to God as Father." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Adoption and Divine Grace**
   - Adoption is an act of **divine grace**, not human achievement.
   - Brunner emphasizes the initiative of God in making sinners His children.
   - Human response is necessary but always secondary to God’s action.
   - Grace is experienced personally in the encounter with the living God.
   - "It is by grace alone that we are called sons and daughters of God." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Adoption and Ethical Transformation**
   - Adoption leads to a new ethical orientation as children of God.
   - The believer is called to reflect the character of the Father.
   - Brunner links adoption to responsibility within the **community of faith**.
   - The filial relationship motivates love, obedience, and service.
   - "To be a child of God means to live as a brother among brothers." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s understanding of **adoption** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the relational and existential dimensions of salvation. His integration of adoption with **reconciliation** and **new creation** offered a holistic vision of the believer’s new status in Christ. While less systematic than some Reformed treatments, Brunner’s focus on **personal encounter** and divine grace continues to shape discussions of Christian identity and the meaning of being children of God.
