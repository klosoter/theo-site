# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm **adoption** as a gracious benefit of union with Christ, rooted in **justification** and **regeneration**. Adoption is presented as a distinct aspect of **salvation**, whereby believers are received into God's family, enjoy the privileges of **children of God**, and are assured of their inheritance through Christ.

- "God is, because of Christ’s merit, no longer my Judge but my Father." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 26)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 26, 33, 74, 120
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 20–23
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Heads of Doctrine I–V
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism* (secondary)
- Philip Schaff, *The Creeds of Christendom* (reference for texts and commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption flows from union with Christ**
    - Adoption is inseparable from **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith and thus share in His sonship.
    - The benefits of adoption are grounded in Christ’s merits alone.
    - Adoption is not a human achievement but a divine gift.
    - "Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 1)

2. **Adoption confers real filial status**
    - Believers are truly called and treated as **children of God**.
    - This status grants access to God as Father, not merely as Judge.
    - The privileges include inheritance, discipline, and assurance.
    - Adoption is a present reality, not only a future hope.
    - "God is, because of Christ’s merit, no longer my Judge but my Father." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 26)

3. **Adoption is received by faith alone**
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which adoption is appropriated.
    - Works play no role in attaining the status of God’s child.
    - Assurance of adoption is grounded in the promises of the gospel.
    - The sacraments, especially baptism, signify and seal adoption.
    - "We are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by faith only." (Belgic Confession, Article 22)

4. **Adoption entails covenant privileges and responsibilities**
    - Children of believers are included in the covenant and thus in adoption.
    - Baptism is a sign and seal of incorporation into God’s family.
    - Adoption brings both privileges (inheritance, access) and duties (obedience, gratitude).
    - The church community is the visible family of the adopted.
    - "Infants as well as adults are included in God’s covenant and people, and they, no less than adults, are promised deliverance from sin through Christ’s blood." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

5. **Adoption assures believers of their inheritance**
    - The adopted are heirs of eternal life and the kingdom of God.
    - Assurance is rooted in God’s unchanging promise, not human merit.
    - The Spirit testifies to believers’ adoption and inheritance.
    - Suffering and discipline are interpreted as fatherly, not punitive.
    - "If we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ." (Romans 8:17, cited in Catechism and Confession commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed teaching on **adoption**, emphasizing its inseparability from union with Christ and its grounding in the covenant of grace. Their catechetical and confessional clarity has influenced generations of Reformed churches, ensuring that adoption is understood as both a privilege and a responsibility for all believers. The robust connection between **adoption**, **justification**, and the life of the church continues to inform pastoral practice and theological reflection in the Reformed tradition.
