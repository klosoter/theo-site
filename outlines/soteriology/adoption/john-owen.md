# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen regarded **adoption** as a distinct and exalted benefit of union with Christ, closely linked to **justification** but possessing its own unique privileges. He emphasized the believer’s new status as a **child of God**, highlighting the experiential and relational dimensions of **sonship** within the broader framework of **covenant theology**.

- "Adoption is an act of the free grace of God, whereby believers are received into the number of the children of God, and have a right to all the privileges of the sons of God." ("The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed")

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed"
- "An Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews"
- "The Death of Death in the Death of Christ"
- "Communion with God"
- "A Brief Declaration and Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Privilege**
    - Adoption is not identical to **justification** but follows it as a separate grace.
    - It confers a new legal and relational status upon the believer.
    - The privileges of adoption include access to God, the Spirit of adoption, and inheritance.
    - Owen distinguishes adoption from regeneration, though both are benefits of union with Christ.
    - "Adoption is a privilege distinct from justification, and not comprehended in it." ("The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance")

2. **Trinitarian Foundation of Adoption**
    - The Father elects and adopts, the Son secures adoption through redemption, and the Spirit applies it.
    - Adoption is rooted in the eternal purpose of the Father.
    - The Spirit of adoption enables believers to cry, "Abba, Father."
    - The work of each Person of the Trinity is coordinated in granting adoption.
    - "It is the peculiar work of the Father to adopt us, of the Son to redeem us, and of the Spirit to seal us unto the day of redemption." ("Communion with God")

3. **Covenantal Context**
    - Adoption is a benefit of the **new covenant** in Christ.
    - It fulfills Old Testament types and promises regarding God’s people.
    - The privileges of adoption are secured by Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Owen connects adoption to the believer’s participation in the covenant community.
    - "All the privileges of adoption flow from the covenant of grace, established in Christ." ("Exposition of Hebrews")

4. **Experiential and Relational Dimensions**
    - Adoption brings believers into intimate fellowship with God as Father.
    - The Spirit assures believers of their sonship and enables filial confidence.
    - Owen stresses the experiential reality of adoption in the believer’s life.
    - Adoption entails both rights and responsibilities within God’s household.
    - "The Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are the children of God, giving us boldness and access." ("Communion with God")

5. **Eschatological Inheritance**
    - Adoption grants believers a right to the eternal inheritance reserved for the sons of God.
    - The fullness of adoption will be revealed at the resurrection.
    - Present privileges are a foretaste of the future consummation.
    - The hope of inheritance motivates perseverance and holiness.
    - "We are now the sons of God, but it doth not yet appear what we shall be." ("Exposition of Hebrews")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s robust doctrine of **adoption** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, distinguishing adoption as a unique benefit of union with Christ and emphasizing its relational and experiential aspects. His Trinitarian and covenantal approach has influenced later theologians, especially in the articulation of the privileges and assurance of believers. Owen’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of **sonship** and the believer’s identity in Christ.
