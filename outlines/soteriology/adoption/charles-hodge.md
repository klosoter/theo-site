# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Princeton Theology**, understood **adoption** as a distinct and gracious act of God within the broader scope of **salvation**. For Hodge, adoption is inseparable from **justification** and **sanctification**, yet it specifically confers the status and privileges of **sonship** upon believers, grounding their assurance and inheritance in Christ.

- "Adoption is the act of God whereby those who are justified are received into the family of God, and made his children and heirs." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on salvation and adoption)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on soteriology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Benefit of Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is not synonymous with **justification** or **regeneration**, but a separate benefit.
    - It is grounded in the believer’s **union with Christ** and follows justification.
    - Adoption confers a new legal status: from alienation to **children of God**.
    - The privileges of adoption include access to God, the indwelling of the Spirit, and the promise of inheritance.
    - "Adoption is a distinct gift, over and above justification, and is not to be confounded with it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Legal and Relational Dimensions**
    - Adoption involves both a change in legal standing and a new familial relationship.
    - Believers are given the rights and privileges of **sons and daughters**.
    - The Spirit testifies to the believer’s new status, producing assurance.
    - The believer’s inheritance is secured by this new relationship.
    - "It is not merely a change of state, but the introduction into a new relation, that of children to God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Grounded in Christ’s Redemptive Work**
    - Adoption is possible only through the **mediatorial work of Christ**.
    - Christ’s sonship is unique, but believers are adopted through Him.
    - The benefits of adoption flow from union with the risen Lord.
    - The Spirit of adoption is given on the basis of Christ’s finished work.
    - "We are sons of God only as we are in Christ, and by virtue of his mediation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Privileges and Responsibilities of Adoption**
    - Adoption grants believers access to God as Father.
    - It assures them of God’s love, care, and discipline.
    - Believers become heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
    - Adoption entails a call to holiness and obedience as children of God.
    - "The privileges of adoption are unspeakably great; they include all that is implied in being the children of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Assurance and the Witness of the Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is given as the Spirit of adoption.
    - The Spirit assures believers of their status as God’s children.
    - This assurance is both objective (based on God’s promise) and subjective (the Spirit’s inward testimony).
    - Assurance strengthens the believer’s hope and perseverance.
    - "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of **adoption** as a distinct and gracious benefit within the **ordo salutis** shaped Reformed soteriology for generations. His emphasis on both the legal and relational aspects of adoption influenced later systematic theologians and remains a standard reference in discussions of the doctrine. Hodge’s clear distinction between justification, adoption, and sanctification provided a framework that continues to inform evangelical and Reformed understandings of the believer’s privileges in Christ.
