# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck treats **adoption** as a distinct and essential benefit within the **ordo salutis**, closely related to but not identical with **justification** and **sanctification**. He grounds adoption in the finished work of Christ and its application by the **Holy Spirit**, emphasizing the legal and relational privileges of **sonship** within the covenant community.

- "Adoption is the legal act by which God, for Christ’s sake, receives sinners as his children and gives them a right to all the privileges of the family." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.254)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as a Distinct Benefit of Union with Christ**
    - Adoption is not identical to **justification** or **regeneration** but is a separate benefit conferred in Christ.
    - It is rooted in the believer’s **union with Christ**, who is the natural Son.
    - Adoption confers a new legal status, not merely a change in moral character.
    - It is inseparable from the other benefits of salvation but retains its own character.
    "Adoption is a benefit that, though closely related to justification, is not identical with it." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.254)

2. **Legal and Relational Dimensions**
    - Adoption is fundamentally a forensic act, changing the believer’s status before God.
    - It also initiates a new familial relationship with God as **Father**.
    - The privileges of adoption include access, inheritance, and discipline.
    - The believer’s relationship to God is transformed from that of a servant to that of a son.
    "It is a legal act, but it also brings with it a new relationship and fellowship with God." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.255)

3. **Grounded in Christ’s Sonship**
    - Christ is the eternal and natural Son; believers are sons by grace and adoption.
    - All the privileges of adoption flow from **union with the Son**.
    - The **Spirit of adoption** is given on the basis of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Adoption is possible only because of the believer’s incorporation into Christ.
    "We are children of God only in and through Christ, the natural Son." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.256)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** applies the reality of adoption to the believer’s heart.
    - The Spirit enables believers to cry, “Abba, Father,” confirming their status.
    - Assurance of adoption is a work of the Spirit, not merely human inference.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the evidence and seal of adoption.
    "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.257)

5. **Ethical and Eschatological Implications**
    - Adoption entails both privileges and responsibilities, including obedience and imitation of the Father.
    - It anticipates the future inheritance and glorification of believers.
    - The full realization of adoption awaits the resurrection and renewal of creation.
    - Adoption motivates ethical living as sons and heirs of God.
    "The full revelation of our adoption will occur at the resurrection of the body." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.258)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust doctrine of **adoption** has shaped Reformed soteriology by clarifying its distinct place within the **ordo salutis** and emphasizing both its legal and relational aspects. His integration of adoption with **union with Christ** and the work of the Holy Spirit has influenced subsequent theological reflection on the privileges of sonship. Bavinck’s careful distinctions continue to inform contemporary discussions on assurance, identity, and the ethical implications of being children of God.
