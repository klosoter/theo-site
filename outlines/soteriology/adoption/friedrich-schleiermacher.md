# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **adoption** not as a distinct forensic act within the ordo salutis, but as an aspect of the believer’s participation in the **Gemeinschaft mit Christus** (communion with Christ) and the consciousness of absolute dependence on God. For Schleiermacher, the reality of **divine sonship** is experienced through the transformative power of **redemption** and the formation of the Christian community, rather than through juridical categories. Thus, adoption is subsumed under the broader experience of **regeneration** and the communal life of the church.

- "The consciousness of being a child of God is the highest point of the religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adoption as Consciousness of Divine Sonship**
    - Adoption is not a legal status but an inward realization of being a child of God.
    - This consciousness arises from the believer’s relationship to Christ and participation in the Christian community.
    - The experience of adoption is inseparable from the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Divine sonship is the culmination of the religious self-consciousness.
    - "The consciousness of being a child of God is the highest point of the religious self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Christ as the Archetype of Divine Sonship**
    - Christ uniquely embodies the perfect God-consciousness and is the model for all believers.
    - Believers participate in adoption through union with Christ, the true Son.
    - The church mediates this participation by fostering the communal life in Christ.
    - Adoption is derivative, grounded in Christ’s unique relationship to the Father.
    - "In Him the divine essence is so completely present that He is the Redeemer and the Head of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Adoption within the Context of Redemption**
    - Adoption is inseparable from the broader process of redemption.
    - It is realized through the transformative work of Christ and the Spirit in the believer.
    - The experience of forgiveness, renewal, and adoption are interconnected.
    - The communal aspect of redemption is emphasized over individual legal standing.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the God-consciousness which was originally present in Christ." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
    - Schleiermacher downplays legal or forensic understandings of salvation, including adoption.
    - He prefers relational and experiential categories rooted in the believer’s consciousness.
    - Justification, adoption, and sanctification are not sharply distinguished.
    - The focus is on the transformation of the self, not on external status.
    - "All the elements of the state of grace are only different aspects of the same relation." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Adoption and the Church Community**
    - The church is the sphere in which divine sonship is realized and experienced.
    - Adoption is communal, not merely individual, reflecting the unity of believers in Christ.
    - The sacraments and communal worship nurture the consciousness of adoption.
    - The church’s life is the ongoing manifestation of the redeemed community of God’s children.
    - "The Church is the fellowship of those who are conscious of being children of God through Christ." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **adoption** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology by shifting the focus from juridical categories to the experiential and communal dimensions of salvation. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the centrality of the church community influenced later liberal and existential theologians. While his views diverge from classical Reformed formulations, Schleiermacher’s integration of adoption into the broader experience of redemption continues to inform contemporary discussions of Christian identity and ecclesiology.
