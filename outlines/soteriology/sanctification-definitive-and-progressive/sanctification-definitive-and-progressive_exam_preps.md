### TITLE
The Single Grace of Union: Holding Together Definitive and Progressive Sanctification in Reformed Soteriology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How to construe **sanctification** as both a once‑for‑all definitive act and an ongoing progressive work, without collapsing it into justification or moralism.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, John Owen, Herman Bavinck, Louis Berkhof, G C Berkouwer.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed confessional and scholastic theology, in dialogue with broader Protestantism and modern evangelicalism.
- Debates:
  - Internal: relation of **union with Christ** to sanctification, faith and works, the ordo salutis, perfectionism, and antinomianism;
  - External: Roman Catholic and Wesleyan accounts of sanctification, and broader moralistic or therapeutic paradigms;
  - Contemporary: legalism vs. grace, “gospel‑centered” debates, the status of the law, and identity‑based approaches to holiness.
- Defended position: Sanctification is a distinct but inseparable benefit of **union with Christ**, involving a real, ontological **definitive sanctification** that breaks sin’s dominion and a necessary **progressive sanctification** that imperfectly but truly renews the whole person, grounded in **justification** yet irreducible to it, and normed by God’s **law** and the pattern of Christ.

### ESSAY
Sanctification, in Reformed theology, names the work of the triune God by which those who are effectually called and justified are actually made holy in Christ. The central tension that must be handled with precision is this: Scripture speaks of believers as already sanctified and yet as being sanctified. The examiner will probe whether one has a coherent account of this duality, how it relates to justification and adoption, and whether the account preserves both the freeness of grace and the seriousness of obedience. I will argue that within a robust doctrine of **union with Christ**, sanctification is both **definitive** and **progressive**: a once‑for‑all break with the dominion of sin and consecration to God, and an ongoing Spirit‑wrought renewal of the whole person after the image of Christ. These are not two sanctifications, but two aspects of the one sanctifying grace, distinguished to safeguard exegesis and to answer recurrent pastoral and theological distortions.

John Calvin is decisive because he gives the classic Reformed architecture within which sanctification is set. In the Institutes, especially book 3, sanctification is not a detachable sequel to justification but the inescapable fruit of **union with Christ**. Calvin insists that as long as Christ remains outside of us and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us. By the Spirit’s uniting work, Christ becomes ours in a duplex gratia, a double grace: **justification** and **sanctification**. Calvin’s method is biblical theological and pastoral: he reads Romans, especially chapters 5 to 8, as locating both the forensic and renovative benefits within union. Christ’s righteousness is imputed for justification, and Christ himself, with his life‑giving Spirit, indwells believers for sanctification.

This double grace already contains the seed of the later distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification. In Calvin, sanctification is described as regeneration, mortification and vivification, the putting to death of the old man and the vivifying of the new. He speaks of a decisive transfer of lordship: those who were slaves of sin have become servants of righteousness. That transfer is not merely external but real and existential. At the same time, Calvin rejects any notion of perfection in this life. Believers are simul justus et peccator, justified and yet still sinners, though sin no longer reigns. Here the conceptual ingredients of **definitive sanctification** are present: a real break with sin’s dominion and a new spiritual state. Yet Calvin reserves the label “sanctification” mainly for the ongoing process of renewal. Later Reformed theologians would sharpen the terminology while remaining faithful to his core insight that justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable benefits of union with Christ.

John Owen, a second decisive figure, represents the mature Reformed scholastic and experiential development of these themes. In works such as “Of the Mortification of Sin” and “The Holy Spirit,” Owen treats sanctification as the proper work of the Spirit uniting us to Christ and conforming us to him. His method is both dogmatic and experimental: careful with distinctions, yet constantly oriented to the believer’s lived battle against sin. For Owen, the believer’s union with Christ yields a new state: the dominion of sin is broken, though its presence remains. He uses the language of a “new principle of spiritual life.” This is essentially a **definitive sanctification**: by virtue of union with Christ in his death and resurrection, the believer is transferred from the realm of the flesh to the realm of the Spirit. Romans 6 is central. Believers have died to sin and live to God in Christ Jesus. Owen will press that this is not a mere change of legal status but a real change of condition.

At the same time, Owen is aware that Romans 7 and 8 portray a continuing conflict. Thus he contends fiercely against both antinomianism and legalism. He insists that we must not confound justification and sanctification: all our righteousness before God is in Christ’s imputed righteousness alone; yet the justified must pursue holiness by the Spirit. For Owen, ongoing mortification of sin is necessary, but it is grounded in the already accomplished death to sin. His famous exhortation “be killing sin or it will be killing you” is unintelligible if one does not already possess the Spirit and a definitively altered relationship to sin. Owen therefore operates implicitly with a twofold sanctification: a fundamental death and resurrection with Christ, and a progressive outworking in daily dying to sin and living unto righteousness. The examiner might press whether this makes sanctification partly monergistic and partly synergistic. Owen’s answer, which is the classic Reformed answer, is that the Spirit is the sole efficient cause of all sanctifying grace, both definitive and progressive, but he works in and through the renewed faculties of the believer, so that we truly and freely act.

Moving into the modern period, Herman Bavinck plays a crucial role in systematizing and restating the doctrine in a changing intellectual climate. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck sets sanctification squarely within the ordo salutis as a benefit in Christ communicated by the Spirit. He emphasizes that the ordo is not a temporal sequence in the strict sense but a logical ordering of benefits flowing from **union with Christ**. Bavinck develops sanctification as renewal of the whole person after the image of God, locating it within a broader doctrine of **re‑creation** and the restoration of the cosmos. His method integrates biblical exegesis, historical theology, and engagement with modern psychology and ethics. Bavinck does not yet use the phrase “definitive sanctification” as a formal category, but he clearly affirms its substance: there is, at conversion, a decisive, once‑for‑all break with sin’s dominion. He writes that regeneration grants a new disposition, a new habitus, from which acts of faith and repentance arise. In this initial work, the “old man” is put to death and the “new man” is created. That is definitive.

Yet Bavinck is equally insistent on the gradual, conflict‑ridden character of sanctification in the believer’s life. Sin’s guilt is fully removed in justification, but sin’s pollution is removed only gradually. He resists any perfectionist reading of passages like 1 Thessalonians 5 or 1 John. He also, unlike some pietist strands, refuses to make the subjective degree of holiness the ground of assurance. For Bavinck, assurance is anchored in Christ and his promises, and from that assurance flows a robust pursuit of holiness. The sanctified life is therefore neither an anxious ladder to heaven nor an optional extra, but the necessary and grateful response to grace. Conceptually, Bavinck helps modern Reformed theology by linking sanctification not just to the individual but also to vocation and culture: holiness extends into calling, family, and society. This guards against a privatized moralism and situates progressive sanctification within God’s comprehensive **kingdom** purposes.

Louis Berkhof and G C Berkouwer represent two closely related but somewhat divergent twentieth‑century appropriations of this heritage. Berkhof, in his Systematic Theology, provides the concise, textbook formulation that has formed generations of pastors. He explicitly distinguishes **definitive sanctification** from **progressive sanctification**. Definitive sanctification is the instantaneous work of God at the inception of the Christian life whereby the believer is set apart from the world and the dominion of sin, and consecrated to God. It is grounded in union with Christ in his death and resurrection. Berkhof directly appeals to Romans 6, 1 Corinthians 1 and Hebrews 10, where believers are called saints and said to have been sanctified. Progressive sanctification, for Berkhof, is that gracious, continuous operation of the Holy Spirit, by which he delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin, renews his whole nature in the image of God, and enables him to perform good works. Berkhof’s method is analytic and ordo‑salutis oriented; his strength is clarity of definition.

Berkouwer, in his Faith and Sanctification, reacts against certain scholastic and pietistic distortions that he judged had turned sanctification into a quasi‑autonomous process alongside justification. He is worried that believers are being taught to look away from Christ to their own spiritual progress for assurance, creating a “sanctification problem” that competes with the “justification problem.” Berkouwer therefore insists on the absolute centrality of **union with Christ** and the constant looking to Christ in faith. Sanctification is nothing other than the outworking of the believer’s communion with the Savior. At points he appears suspicious of the language of a fixed “state” of sanctification, fearing that it may encourage self‑reliant moralism. Nevertheless, Berkouwer does not deny a real, decisive break with sin. He lenses it more in terms of the eschatological invasion of the age to come into the present, and the believer’s being caught up into Christ’s history. Sanctification is thus integrally related to the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.

Here, an internal Reformed debate emerges. Some later writers, influenced by Berkouwer and concerned to emphasize grace, have downplayed or rejected the category of **definitive sanctification**, preferring to speak only of positional sanctification and ongoing renewal. Others, following Berkhof, Murray, and others, insist that the category of definitive sanctification is exegetically necessary and pastorally vital. Romans 6 does not simply exhort believers to die to sin; it grounds the exhortation in an indicative: you have died to sin, you have been raised with Christ. Similarly, 1 Corinthians 1 calls the church “sanctified in Christ Jesus,” and Hebrews 10 speaks of those who “have been sanctified.” The Westminster Shorter Catechism captures both: sanctification is “the work of God’s free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness.” Examiners might ask whether this twofold description supports the definitive‑progressive distinction. The answer is that the “renewed in the whole man” points to the definitive break and new state, while the “more and more” captures the progressive aspect.

At this point, external debates must be faced. The Reformed doctrine of sanctification stands over against the Roman Catholic conception codified at Trent, where justification itself includes the infusion of righteousness and interior renewal. For Rome, there is no sharp conceptual distinction between justification and sanctification. The result is that justification is, by nature, progressive and dependent on inherent righteousness. The Reformed, from Calvin onward, insist on a forensic‑renovative distinction: **justification** is a declarative act based solely on the imputed righteousness of Christ received by faith alone, while **sanctification** is the renovative work of the Spirit within. Sanctification is certainly necessary for final salvation, but it is not the ground of our acceptance. The doctrine of **definitive sanctification**, properly understood, preserves both a real, internal change and the priority of grace. It recognizes that at the moment of effectual calling and faith, the Spirit not only unites us to Christ for righteousness but also definitively transfers us into a new sphere of life.

Another external challenge arises from Wesleyan perfectionism. John Wesley and certain Holiness traditions, seeking to take seriously the New Testament’s strong language about victory over sin, posit the possibility of entire sanctification in this life. This is construed sometimes as a second blessing after conversion, sometimes as an instantaneous crisis experience in which the root of sin is eradicated. The Reformed critique appeals to the realism of texts such as Romans 7, Galatians 5, James 3, and the Lord’s Prayer, which presuppose ongoing sin in believers. The Reformed affirm, with Calvin, Bavinck, and Berkhof, that believers may and do make real progress, that certain sins may be mortified in significant measure, and that there are degrees of growth in holiness. Yet **progressive sanctification** in this age remains imperfect and conflictual. The category of definitive sanctification allows the Reformed to affirm a real, already accomplished victory over sin’s reign, without claiming an eradication of sin’s presence.

Contemporary debates often replay older issues under new idioms. Within evangelicalism, there is renewed tension between those who emphasize obedience and those who emphasize grace. Some present sanctification almost entirely in terms of effort, disciplines, and strategies, sliding into moralism. Others, under banners like “gospel‑centered sanctification,” stress resting in one’s identity in Christ to such an extent that imperatives become muted. Here, the definitive‑progressive distinction within **union with Christ** offers crucial ballast. Definitive sanctification grounds the believer’s identity: you are no longer in Adam but in Christ, no longer slaves of sin but slaves of righteousness. This is purely of grace, a work of God’s free grace, and it is not undone by the believer’s fluctuating performance. Progressive sanctification, however, expresses the necessary consequence of that new identity: because you have died to sin, you must not let sin reign in your mortal body. The indicative fuels and shapes the imperative, but it does not replace it.

A likely examiner’s objection will be whether the notion of definitive sanctification undermines the urgency of the Christian struggle. If sin’s dominion is already broken, why is the battle so intense? The answer, following Owen and Bavinck, is that definitive sanctification changes the regime under which the believer lives but not the presence of the enemy. There is a transfer of lordship from sin to Christ; the Christian is no longer under sin as king, but sin as guerilla forces remain. This is why Paul can say both that believers have died to sin and that they must put to death what is earthly in them. The language of dominion and realm is crucial. It allows us to affirm that the believer can never finally apostatize in the sense of reverting to a state of slavery to sin, while also taking seriously the ongoing command to mortify remaining corruption.

Another likely line of questioning will probe the relation of sanctification to the **law of God**. Historically, Reformed theology affirms the third use of the law: the law as a rule of life for the believer. In contrast, some contemporary voices fear that stressing the law might undermine grace. Yet Calvin, Owen, and Bavinck all insist that the law, stripped of its condemning power in Christ, remains the norm of sanctification. Sanctification is not mere sincerity or generic spiritual formation; it is conformity to the image of Christ, who himself delighted in and fulfilled the law. The Spirit writes the law on the heart. Thus definitive sanctification, as consecration to God, necessarily implies a definitive reorientation to God’s law, and progressive sanctification is the gradual bringing of all of life into conformity with that norm. A Christocentric reading of the law avoids moralism, because the law is always read in union with the Law‑keeper and Redeemer.

The relation of sanctification to **assurance** is also a critical pastoral and doctrinal nexus. If progressive sanctification is necessary, does a weak or faltering holiness mean that one is unjustified? Calvin and Bavinck respond by distinguishing the ground of assurance from its confirmation. The ground lies extra nos, in Christ and his promises, apprehended by faith. The inward work of sanctification, though always imperfect and mixed with sin, confirms the genuineness of that faith. The Reformed standards speak of “things that accompany salvation.” Definitive sanctification ensures that every true believer has, at bottom, a new heart that will produce some fruit. Progressive sanctification clarifies and matures that fruit, but it is not tit‑for‑tat correlated with justification. An examiner might press whether someone could be justified with almost no sanctification. The proper answer is that there is no such thing as a justified person who is not also sanctified definitively and, in principle and increasingly, progressively. Yet the degree and perceptibility of progress may vary dramatically. The thief on the cross had little time for observable growth, but even there we see repentance and confession.

We must also connect sanctification to **ecclesiology** and the means of grace. Sanctification is not an autonomous individual project but the work of the Spirit through appointed means: the word, sacraments, and prayer within the body of Christ. Calvin and Owen both stress that Christ does not sanctify isolated souls but gathers them into a church where mutual exhortation, discipline, and encouragement occur. Definitive sanctification is signified and sealed in baptism, which marks a once‑for‑all consecration to God and union with Christ in his death and resurrection. Progressive sanctification is nourished at the Lord’s table and through the regular ministry of the word. This ecclesial framing protects against a voluntarist or purely therapeutic conception of holiness.

Finally, in contemporary culture, identity language pervades discussions of growth and morality. Many urge people to “live out of their identity,” sometimes in ways that obscure the call to die to self. A Reformed account of **definitive sanctification** provides a rich theology of identity: the believer’s deepest identity is in Christ, as a new creation, no longer defined by past sins or present struggles. But that identity includes the cross. To be in Christ is to share not only his privileges but also his pattern of suffering, death, and resurrection life. Progressive sanctification, therefore, will look cruciform. It is not a smooth self‑actualization but a life of repentance and faith, of putting off and putting on. Bavinck’s wide lens helps here: sanctification includes not only private piety but also the transformation of character in vocation, family, and society, as the believer manifests the **image of God** restored in Christ.

Summing up, the Reformed doctrine, developed from Calvin through Owen and Bavinck to Berkhof and Berkouwer, construes sanctification as the one sanctifying grace of the Spirit in union with Christ, viewed under two aspects. In **definitive sanctification**, God once for all breaks the dominion of sin, consecrates the believer to himself, and implants a new principle of life. In **progressive sanctification**, the same Spirit gradually conforms the believer to Christ in the whole person, through the means of grace, according to the law of God, in the fellowship of the church, until that work is perfected at glorification. This construction maintains a sharp distinction between justification and sanctification while preserving their inseparability, answers both perfectionism and antinomianism, and sustains rigorous pursuit of holiness under the banner of grace alone. It is, I submit, biblically compelled, confessionally faithful, and pastorally indispensable.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Sanctification is the work of God’s free grace in **union with Christ**, whereby believers are once‑for‑all set apart from sin’s dominion and unto God (**definitive sanctification**) and are then gradually renewed in the whole person into Christ’s image, dying more and more to sin and living more and more unto righteousness (**progressive sanctification**).
- Decisive figures:
  - Calvin: duplex gratia in union with Christ; sanctification inseparable from justification yet distinct, grounded in death to sin and life in Christ, rejecting perfectionism.
  - Owen: Spirit‑wrought mortification and vivification; real break with sin’s dominion and ongoing conflict; anti‑legalist and anti‑antinomian.
  - Bavinck: sanctification as renewal of the whole person and re‑creation; decisive break with sin plus gradual purification; connects holiness to vocation and culture.
  - Berkhof: explicit formalization of **definitive** versus **progressive** sanctification within the ordo salutis, with clear, analytic definitions.
  - Berkouwer: re‑centers sanctification on communion with Christ, warns against turning sanctification into a self‑focused project competing with justification.
- Debates:
  - Internal: relation of sanctification to justification and **union with Christ**, whether to retain the explicit category of definitive sanctification, extent of progress, role of the law, assurance and fruit.
  - External: Roman Catholic fusion of justification and sanctification, Wesleyan perfectionism and second blessing, moralistic and therapeutic accounts of “growth.”
  - Contemporary: “gospel‑centered” versus effort‑centered sanctification, law and grace, identity language, individualistic versus ecclesial sanctification.
- Defended position: One sanctifying grace in Christ, with a real, ontological **definitive sanctification** breaking sin’s dominion and consecrating the believer, and a necessary yet imperfect **progressive sanctification** renewing the whole person according to God’s law, both grounded in **justification** but irreducible to it, and mediated through the means of grace in the church.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - How do you distinguish justification and sanctification without separating them?  
    Justification is a once‑for‑all forensic declaration based on Christ’s imputed righteousness; sanctification is the Spirit’s renovative work flowing from that union, necessary but not foundational for acceptance.
  - What is definitive sanctification, and where is it in Scripture?  
    It is the once‑for‑all break with sin’s dominion and consecration to God at conversion, grounded in union with Christ’s death and resurrection as in Romans 6, 1 Corinthians 1, and Hebrews 10.
  - Does definitive sanctification imply perfectionism?  
    No, it changes sin’s status from ruling lord to defeated enemy, but leaves remaining corruption that requires lifelong mortification and growth.
  - How does sanctification relate to the law of God?  
    Freed from its condemning power, the law becomes the normative rule of life, with the Spirit writing it on the heart as he conforms us to Christ.
  - Is sanctification monergistic or synergistic?  
    God the Spirit is the sole efficient cause of both definitive and progressive sanctification, yet in progressive sanctification he enables and moves believers so that they truly and freely work.
