# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **sanctification** within his broader theology of **God-consciousness** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**. Rather than distinguishing sharply between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** as in later Reformed thought, he saw sanctification as the deepening of the believer’s participation in Christ through the ongoing transformation of consciousness within the Christian community.

- "Sanctification is nothing other than the constant increase of the God-consciousness and its dominance over all other impulses." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Christian Ethics
- Schleiermacher: Life and Thought (ed. Richard Crouter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Growth in God-Consciousness**
    - Sanctification is the intensification of the **God-consciousness** implanted by Christ.
    - It is not a forensic change but an existential transformation of the self.
    - The process is rooted in the believer’s increasing awareness of dependence on God.
    - This growth is communal, occurring within the life of the **church**.
    - "Sanctification is the ever-increasing predominance of the God-consciousness over the sensuous self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Definitiveness**
    - Schleiermacher does not affirm a once-for-all, definitive act of sanctification.
    - He critiques traditional **Reformed** distinctions between justification and sanctification.
    - Sanctification is not a legal status but an ongoing spiritual reality.
    - The process is inseparable from the life of faith and not a distinct event.
    - "There is no moment in which the believer is wholly sanctified, but only a continual becoming." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ as the Archetype and Mediator**
    - Christ embodies perfect **God-consciousness** and is the model for all believers.
    - Sanctification is participation in Christ’s own relationship to God.
    - The Spirit mediates Christ’s influence to the community, fostering transformation.
    - The church is the sphere where Christ’s sanctifying power is experienced.
    - "The Redeemer is the archetype of the new life, and sanctification is the reproduction of His consciousness in us." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Sanctification as Communal and Ethical**
    - The process is realized within the **Christian community**.
    - Ethical transformation is a fruit of deepening God-consciousness.
    - The church’s practices and relationships nurture sanctification.
    - Individual growth is inseparable from communal life and mission.
    - "The increase of God-consciousness in the individual is conditioned by the fellowship of believers." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Progressive, Not Perfectionistic**
    - Sanctification is always incomplete in this life.
    - The believer continually struggles with competing impulses.
    - Progress is marked by greater integration of faith and life, not sinless perfection.
    - The goal is the ever-closer approximation to Christ’s consciousness, not its full attainment.
    - "Sanctification is a process that never reaches its goal in this earthly existence." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s understanding of **sanctification** shifted the focus from legal categories to the transformation of consciousness and communal life. His approach influenced modern **liberal theology** and paved the way for existential and experiential accounts of Christian growth. While he departed from classic Reformed distinctions between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification**, his emphasis on the communal and ethical dimensions of sanctification continues to shape contemporary discussions. His legacy is seen in the ongoing dialogue between **systematic theology** and the lived experience of faith.
