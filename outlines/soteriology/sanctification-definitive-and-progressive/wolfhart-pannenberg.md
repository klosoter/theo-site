# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **sanctification** through the lens of **eschatology** and the dynamic self-realization of the human person in relation to the **resurrection of Christ**. He emphasized the communal and historical dimensions of both **definitive** and **progressive sanctification**, seeing the process as rooted in the anticipation of God's final consummation and the transformative work of the Spirit within history.

- "Sanctification is the anticipation of the future consummation of life in the power of the Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is fundamentally oriented toward the **eschatological future** realized in Christ.
    - The believer's holiness is a participation in the future reality of God's kingdom.
    - Both **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** are understood as anticipatory signs of the final resurrection.
    - The Spirit mediates the future into the present, shaping the believer's life.
    - "Sanctification is the anticipation of the eschatological consummation in the present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Christocentric Foundation**
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the ground and model for all sanctification.
    - Definitive sanctification is rooted in union with the risen Christ.
    - Progressive sanctification unfolds as believers are conformed to Christ's image.
    - Christ's victory over sin is both a once-for-all event and an ongoing reality in the church.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of the new life of sanctification." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Pneumatological Mediation**
    - The **Holy Spirit** actualizes sanctification in the life of the believer and the community.
    - The Spirit's work is both definitive (initiating new life) and progressive (empowering growth).
    - Sanctification is not merely moral improvement but participation in the Spirit's transformative power.
    - The Spirit connects the believer to the future reality of God's reign.
    - "The Spirit is the power of sanctification, making the future present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Communal and Historical Dimension**
    - Sanctification is not only individual but also communal, realized in the church.
    - The process unfolds within the history of God's people, not in isolation.
    - The church is the locus of the Spirit's sanctifying work in history.
    - The historical process of sanctification points toward the final unity of humanity in Christ.
    - "Sanctification is realized in the community of believers as a sign of the coming kingdom." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Integration of Anthropology and Eschatology**
    - Human selfhood is constituted in relation to God and oriented toward eschatological fulfillment.
    - Sanctification involves the transformation of the whole person, not just moral faculties.
    - The definitive aspect marks the new identity; the progressive aspect is the unfolding of that identity.
    - Anthropology and eschatology are inseparable in understanding sanctification.
    - "The sanctification of man is the realization of his destiny in the light of the eschaton." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg's integration of **eschatology** and sanctification has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in emphasizing the future-oriented and communal aspects of Christian holiness. His insistence on the **resurrection of Christ** as the foundation for both definitive and progressive sanctification has shaped ecumenical discussions and renewed interest in the role of the Spirit in ethical transformation. Pannenberg's work continues to challenge theologians to consider sanctification within the broader scope of salvation history and the ultimate destiny of humanity.
