# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **sanctification** that distinguished clearly between its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. He emphasized that believers are set apart once for all in union with Christ (**definitive sanctification**), while also being continually renewed in holiness throughout their lives (**progressive sanctification**), both grounded in the work of the **Holy Spirit** and the application of **justification**.

- "Sanctification is begun in this life, but is not perfected except in the life to come." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology," 17.1.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), esp. Vol. 2, Topics 17–18
- The Doctrine of Sanctification (sections within Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (secondary, for context)
- Richard A. Muller, "Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics" (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Definitive Sanctification as Union with Christ**
   - Believers are set apart once for all by virtue of their union with Christ.
   - This act is distinct from **justification** but inseparably connected to it.
   - Definitive sanctification marks the transition from the dominion of sin to the reign of grace.
   - It is accomplished by the Holy Spirit at the inception of faith.
   - "Sanctification is the real and internal renovation of man by which the image of God is restored." (Institutes, 17.1.1)

2. **Progressive Sanctification as Ongoing Renewal**
   - Sanctification continues throughout the believer’s life, increasing in degree.
   - It involves mortification of sin and vivification to righteousness.
   - The believer cooperates with the Spirit, though the Spirit is the primary agent.
   - Progress is real but never complete in this life.
   - "It is not perfected in this life, but is always advancing." (Institutes, 17.1.7)

3. **Distinction from Justification**
   - Sanctification is an internal work, whereas justification is forensic and external.
   - The two are inseparable but must not be confused.
   - Justification is the ground for sanctification, not its result.
   - Sanctification evidences the reality of justification.
   - "Justification and sanctification are distinct, the former being imputed, the latter inherent." (Institutes, 16.2.6)

4. **Role of the Law and Means of Grace**
   - The moral law remains a rule of life for the sanctified.
   - The means of grace—Word, sacraments, prayer—are instrumental in progressive sanctification.
   - The Spirit works through these means to effect growth in holiness.
   - Human effort is required, but always dependent on divine grace.
   - "The law is the rule, not the cause, of sanctification." (Institutes, 17.2.3)

5. **Imperfect but Certain Progress**
   - Complete perfection is unattainable in this life due to remaining sin.
   - Nevertheless, true believers will make real progress in holiness.
   - Assurance of sanctification rests on the promises of God and the presence of spiritual fruit.
   - Final perfection is promised in glorification.
   - "There is no perfection in this life, but there is a certain and necessary progress." (Institutes, 17.1.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy and provided a nuanced framework for understanding the believer’s growth in holiness. His influence is evident in subsequent confessional standards and in the work of later theologians such as Charles Hodge and Louis Berkhof. Turretin’s emphasis on the inseparability yet distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** remains foundational for Reformed soteriology. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to both the priority of grace and the necessity of personal holiness.
