# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **sanctification** through the lens of **existential interpretation** and **demythologization**, emphasizing the believer’s encounter with the **kerygma** rather than a process of moral improvement. For Bultmann, sanctification is not a metaphysical transformation but an existential event in which the individual is called to authentic existence through faith in Christ, making traditional distinctions between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** secondary to the existential decision of faith.

- "The gift of the Spirit is not a magical possession but the possibility of a new existence." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Existence and Faith" (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Existential Decision**
    - Sanctification is realized in the individual's response to the **kerygma**.
    - It is not a process of moral improvement but a call to authentic existence.
    - The decisive moment is the act of faith, not a gradual transformation.
    - The believer is continually confronted with the choice for or against God.
    - "Sanctification is not a state but an event that happens anew in every moment." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologization of Sanctification**
    - Traditional language of sanctification is reinterpreted existentially.
    - Rejects metaphysical or supernatural explanations of spiritual change.
    - Focuses on the meaning of sanctification for the individual's self-understanding.
    - The biblical language is a mythological expression of existential realities.
    - "Demythologizing does not eliminate the message but interprets it for existence." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Rejection of Definitive/Progressive Distinction**
    - The distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification is not central.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing existential decision rather than a two-stage process.
    - Sanctification is not a once-for-all act nor a measurable progression.
    - The believer's life is marked by continual openness to the call of God.
    - "The Christian life is not a possession but a task that is always before us." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is understood as the power of new existence, not a substance.
    - The Spirit enables authentic decision in response to the gospel.
    - There is no ontological change; the Spirit's work is existential and relational.
    - The Spirit is the possibility of living in faith, not a mystical force.
    - "The Spirit is the power by which man is enabled to exist authentically." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Ethics as Response to the Kerygma**
    - Ethical transformation is the result of hearing and responding to the gospel.
    - There is no autonomous moral progress apart from faith.
    - Ethics is grounded in the individual's encounter with Christ, not in law.
    - The new life is characterized by freedom and responsibility before God.
    - "Christian ethics is the ethic of decision, not of achievement." ("Faith and Understanding")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **sanctification** profoundly shaped 20th-century theology, especially in the realms of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. His rejection of traditional metaphysical categories challenged both Protestant and Catholic understandings of sanctification, prompting significant debate. While his views have been criticized for minimizing the transformative aspects of Christian life, his emphasis on the existential encounter with the gospel remains influential in contemporary theology.
