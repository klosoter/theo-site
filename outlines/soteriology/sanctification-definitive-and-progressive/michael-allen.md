# Michael Allen (1979– )

Michael Allen articulates **sanctification** as both a **definitive act** and an ongoing **progressive work** rooted in the believer’s **union with Christ**. He situates sanctification within the **covenantal context** of the church, emphasizing the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** and the retrieval of classical **Reformed categories** for contemporary theology.

- "Sanctification is not merely a process but also a definitive act, rooted in Christ’s accomplishment and applied by the Spirit." ("Sanctification", New Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Works

- Sanctification (New Studies in Dogmatics, 2017)
- Reformed Catholicity (with Scott R. Swain, 2015)
- Grounded in Heaven: Recentering Christian Hope and Life on God (2018)
- "Union with Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Problem of Order" (International Journal of Systematic Theology, 2011)
- "Sanctification, Ecclesiology, and the Gospel" (chapter in Five Views on Sanctification, 2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Both Definitive and Progressive**
    - Affirms a once-for-all **definitive sanctification** in Christ, alongside a lifelong **progressive sanctification**.
    - Stresses that the believer is set apart by virtue of **union with Christ** before any moral transformation.
    - Progressive growth is the **Spirit’s ongoing work**, not merely human effort.
    - Both aspects are inseparable and mutually informing within the **order of salvation**.
    "Sanctification is both an event and a process, rooted in Christ’s finished work and realized in the Spirit’s ongoing ministry." (Sanctification)

2. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - All sanctification flows from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - Definitive sanctification is participation in Christ’s holiness, not an autonomous moral achievement.
    - Progressive sanctification is the **Spirit’s application of Christ’s benefits**.
    - Union with Christ ensures sanctification is a **gift**, not a self-generated process.
    "Union with Christ is the fountainhead of all sanctifying grace." (Sanctification)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the principal agent of sanctification.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and empowers transformation.
    - Sanctification is a **supernatural work**, not reducible to moral improvement.
    - The Spirit’s work is both personal and communal, shaping the church as a holy people.
    "The Spirit’s agency is essential, lest sanctification devolve into mere self-help." (Sanctification)

4. **Covenantal and Ecclesial Context**
    - Sanctification is nurtured within the **covenant community**.
    - The church’s practices—Word, sacraments, discipline—are means of sanctifying grace.
    - Growth in holiness is inseparable from participation in the life of the **church**.
    - The communal dimension guards against individualistic or privatized sanctification.
    "Sanctification is ecclesial before it is individual." (Sanctification)

5. **Retrieval of Classical Reformed Categories**
    - Engages the **Reformed tradition’s** distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification.
    - Advocates for theological retrieval to clarify and enrich contemporary discussions.
    - Emphasizes the importance of **doctrinal precision** for spiritual vitality.
    - Seeks to integrate **historical theology** with constructive dogmatics.
    "The Reformed tradition offers vital resources for a robust doctrine of sanctification." (Sanctification)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Allen has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **sanctification** by retrieving and clarifying the distinction between definitive and progressive aspects within a robustly **Reformed theological framework**. His work has encouraged renewed attention to the role of **union with Christ**, the **Holy Spirit**, and the **church** in the believer’s growth in holiness. Allen’s integration of classical categories with constructive dogmatics has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice, fostering a deeper appreciation for the covenantal and communal dimensions of sanctification.
