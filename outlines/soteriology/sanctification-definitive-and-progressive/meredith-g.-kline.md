# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **sanctification** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects within the framework of redemptive history. He highlighted the believer’s **union with Christ** as the ground for a once-for-all break with sin (definitive sanctification) and the ongoing transformation by the Spirit (progressive sanctification), all within the context of the **new creation** inaugurated by Christ.

- "Sanctification is the ethical transformation that results from the definitive deliverance accomplished by Christ in the new covenant." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as New Creation Reality**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the eschatological new creation inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.
    - The believer’s transformation is participation in the new humanity.
    - The Spirit’s work is both forensic (definitive) and renovative (progressive).
    - The ethical life flows from the new creation order, not merely moral improvement.
    - "The new creation order is the sphere in which sanctification unfolds." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Definitive Sanctification: Once-for-All Break with Sin**
    - Christ’s redemptive work decisively transfers believers from the old age to the new.
    - Definitive sanctification is a covenantal act, not a process.
    - The believer is set apart by union with Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - This break is judicial and ontological, not merely ethical.
    - "Definitive sanctification is the eschatological breach with the old world of sin." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Progressive Sanctification: Ongoing Spirit-Driven Renewal**
    - Sanctification continues as a process of transformation by the Spirit.
    - The believer grows in conformity to Christ within the covenant community.
    - The means of grace (Word and sacrament) are central to this progress.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling ensures the perseverance and growth of the saints.
    - "Progressive sanctification is the outworking of the definitive in the life of the believer." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is inseparable from the structure of God’s covenants.
    - The ethical demands of the covenant are fulfilled in Christ and applied to the believer.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper signify and seal both definitive and progressive sanctification.
    - The covenant community is the context for sanctification’s outworking.
    - "Sanctification is covenantal in its origin, structure, and goal." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Sanctification and Kingdom Ethics**
    - The ethics of sanctification are grounded in the kingdom inaugurated by Christ.
    - Believers are called to manifest the reality of the new creation in their lives.
    - The law is fulfilled in Christ and reconstituted in the new covenant context.
    - Kingdom ethics are eschatological, anticipating the consummation.
    - "The sanctified life is the life of the kingdom, lived out in the overlap of the ages." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and eschatological approach to **sanctification** has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions on the relationship between **definitive and progressive sanctification**. His emphasis on the new creation and the ethical implications of union with Christ provided a robust theological framework for understanding the believer’s transformation. Kline’s insights continue to influence contemporary Reformed theology, especially in debates over the nature of sanctification and its relationship to covenant and kingdom.
