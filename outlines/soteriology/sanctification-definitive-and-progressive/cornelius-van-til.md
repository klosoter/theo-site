# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **sanctification** within the broader context of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects as rooted in union with Christ. He insisted that sanctification is not merely a human endeavor but the outworking of the believer’s participation in the **covenant of grace**, shaped by the antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate mind. Van Til’s understanding of sanctification is inseparable from his doctrines of **presuppositionalism** and the **Creator-creature distinction**, which frame the believer’s growth in holiness as a Spirit-wrought transformation in conformity to Christ.

- "The Christian life is a life of constant sanctification, a life of being more and more conformed to the image of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

- The Theology of James Daane (for interaction with sanctification themes)
- Essays in Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is rooted in union with Christ**
    - Believers are definitively set apart in Christ, sharing in his death and resurrection.
    - Progressive sanctification flows from this vital union, not from autonomous moral effort.
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s work, making sanctification both a gift and a calling.
    - All ethical transformation is grounded in the believer’s new identity in the covenant.
    - "It is only in Christ, by the Spirit, that man can be restored to true ethical living." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

2. **Definitive sanctification as a redemptive-historical act**
    - Sanctification begins with a once-for-all break from the dominion of sin.
    - This definitive aspect is inseparable from justification and adoption.
    - The believer is transferred from the realm of Adam to that of Christ.
    - Definitive sanctification marks the inauguration of the new creation in the individual.
    - "Sanctification is not first of all a process but a redemptive-historical event." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Progressive sanctification as Spirit-empowered transformation**
    - Growth in holiness is a continual, Spirit-driven process.
    - The believer’s life is characterized by ongoing mortification of sin and vivification in Christ.
    - Sanctification involves the renewal of the whole person—mind, will, and affections.
    - The process is never complete in this life but is assured by God’s covenant faithfulness.
    - "The Christian is called to a life of progressive sanctification, ever increasing in conformity to Christ." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Antithesis shapes the sanctified life**
    - The regenerate and unregenerate operate from fundamentally opposed presuppositions.
    - Sanctification involves a continual rejection of worldly thinking and practices.
    - The antithesis is not merely ethical but epistemological, affecting all of life.
    - The church is called to manifest this antithesis in its communal and individual holiness.
    - "There is no neutral ground; the Christian must live out the antithesis in every area of life." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Sanctification is covenantal and ecclesial**
    - Sanctification is nurtured within the context of the covenant community.
    - The means of grace—Word, sacraments, and prayer—are central to growth in holiness.
    - The church’s discipline and fellowship are instruments of sanctification.
    - The covenant structure ensures that sanctification is both individual and corporate.
    - "It is within the covenant community that the Spirit works to sanctify God’s people." (Essays in Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **sanctification** has influenced Reformed theology by integrating the doctrines of union with Christ, the antithesis, and the covenantal context of Christian growth. His emphasis on the definitive and progressive dimensions has shaped discussions on the believer’s identity and ethical transformation. Van Til’s presuppositional approach continues to inform contemporary debates on the relationship between doctrine and the Christian life, ensuring that sanctification is understood as both a divine act and an ongoing process within the church.
