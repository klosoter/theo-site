# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema articulated a robust doctrine of **sanctification** that emphasizes both its **definitive** and **progressive** dimensions. He maintained that believers are set apart once-for-all in union with **Christ** (definitive sanctification), while also being called to grow in holiness throughout their lives (progressive sanctification), always grounded in the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Sanctification is both a once-for-all gift and a continuing task." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Works

- "Saved by Grace" (1989)
- "The Holy Spirit" (1976)
- "Created in God's Image" (1986)
- "The Bible and the Future" (1979)
- "Five Views on Sanctification" (contributor, 1987)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Definitive Sanctification as a Redemptive-Historical Event**
    - Believers are decisively set apart from sin at conversion.
    - This act is rooted in union with **Christ’s death and resurrection**.
    - Definitive sanctification marks a real break with the dominion of sin.
    - It is not merely a change in status but an ontological transformation.
    - "Definitive sanctification means that the power of sin has been broken in the life of the believer." ("Saved by Grace")

2. **Progressive Sanctification as Lifelong Growth**
    - Sanctification continues throughout the Christian life.
    - The believer is called to active obedience and spiritual growth.
    - The process involves both divine initiative and human responsibility.
    - Growth in holiness is evidence of genuine faith.
    - "Sanctification is a process in which the Christian is called to cooperate with the Holy Spirit." ("Saved by Grace")

3. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - All aspects of sanctification flow from union with **Christ**.
    - Definitive and progressive sanctification are inseparable from this union.
    - The believer’s identity is fundamentally transformed in Christ.
    - Sanctification is not self-improvement but participation in Christ’s life.
    - "Our sanctification is rooted in our union with Christ, who is our sanctification." ("Saved by Grace")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Sanctification**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the primary agent of sanctification.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to believers.
    - Empowerment for holy living comes through the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - The Spirit produces the fruit of holiness in the believer’s life.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the sanctifier, enabling us to live in newness of life." ("The Holy Spirit")

5. **Sanctification and Assurance**
    - Growth in sanctification provides assurance of salvation.
    - Assurance is grounded in the objective work of Christ, not subjective achievement.
    - The presence of spiritual fruit confirms the Spirit’s work.
    - Assurance motivates further pursuit of holiness.
    - "The progress of sanctification in the believer’s life is a mark of true assurance." ("Saved by Grace")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** has significantly shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of the Christian life. His clear distinction and integration of these two aspects provided clarity amid confusion about holiness and assurance. By rooting sanctification in **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**, Hoekema offered a balanced and pastoral approach that continues to influence systematic theology and discipleship. His work remains a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded and theologically rich doctrine of sanctification.
