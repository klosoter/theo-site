# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame understands **sanctification** as both a **definitive** act of God and a **progressive** process in the believer, rooted in **union with Christ** and empowered by the **Holy Spirit**. Integrating classic **Reformed categories** with his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, Frame highlights the ethical, existential, and situational dimensions of sanctification in the Christian life.

- "Sanctification is both a definitive break with sin and a lifelong process of growing in holiness." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Definitive Sanctification in Union with Christ**
   - Sanctification begins with a decisive act of God at conversion.
   - Believers are set apart from sin and united to Christ.
   - This definitive aspect is rooted in the believer’s new identity.
   - It provides the foundation for all subsequent growth in holiness.
   "Sanctification is definitive in that God sets us apart for himself in Christ." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Progressive Sanctification as Lifelong Growth**
   - Sanctification continues throughout the believer’s life.
   - The Holy Spirit enables ongoing transformation and obedience.
   - Growth in holiness involves struggle against remaining sin.
   - Progress is real but never complete in this life.
   "Sanctification is also progressive, a process in which we grow in grace." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Triperspectival Approach to Sanctification**
   - Sanctification is understood through normative (law), existential (heart), and situational (context) perspectives.
   - Each perspective sheds light on the believer’s growth in holiness.
   - Ethical obedience, personal transformation, and contextual application are all essential.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in understanding sanctification.
   "We must see sanctification from the perspectives of God’s commands, our inward renewal, and our life circumstances." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Spirit is the primary agent of sanctification.
   - He applies the work of Christ to the believer’s life.
   - The Spirit empowers both the definitive break with sin and ongoing growth.
   - Dependence on the Spirit is essential for true holiness.
   "The Holy Spirit is the one who sanctifies us, both definitively and progressively." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Integration of Justification and Sanctification**
   - Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable benefits of union with Christ.
   - Justification grounds the believer’s acceptance; sanctification evidences transformation.
   - Both are gifts of grace, not human achievement.
   - Assurance of salvation is strengthened by the reality of sanctification.
   "Justification and sanctification are inseparable aspects of our salvation in Christ." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his **triperspectival** method. His emphasis on the believer’s **union with Christ** and the multidimensional work of the Holy Spirit has provided clarity and balance in discussions of Christian growth. Frame’s accessible yet rigorous approach continues to influence pastors, students, and theologians seeking a robust doctrine of sanctification.
