# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust understanding of **sanctification** as both **definitive**—rooted in the believer’s union with Christ—and **progressive**, unfolding throughout the Christian life. He emphasized the work of the **Holy Spirit** in applying the benefits of **redemption**, maintaining the distinction between **justification** and sanctification while upholding their inseparable connection within the **ordo salutis**.

- "Sanctification is not only a state into which we are introduced by the act of God, but also a process which is carried on by the operation of the Spirit." ("Perfectionism," in Works, vol. 7)

## Key Works

- "Perfectionism" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 7)
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Sanctification" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "Faith and Life"
- "The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit" (in Works, vol. 2)
- "The Plan of Salvation"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is both definitive and progressive**
    - Believers are set apart in Christ at conversion (definitive sanctification).
    - Sanctification continues throughout life as a process (progressive sanctification).
    - The two aspects are inseparable but distinct in function and emphasis.
    - Definitive sanctification grounds the ongoing moral transformation of the believer.
    - "Sanctification is thus both a state and a process." ("Perfectionism," Works, vol. 7)

2. **Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemption to believers.
    - Growth in holiness is not self-generated but Spirit-empowered.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is essential for both the beginning and continuation of sanctification.
    - The Spirit works through means, especially the Word and sacraments.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who sanctifies us, working in us to will and to do." ("The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit," Works, vol. 2)

3. **Sanctification is distinct from justification**
    - Justification is a declarative act; sanctification is a transformative process.
    - The two are inseparable in the believer’s experience but must not be confused.
    - Justification provides the foundation for sanctification, not vice versa.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on justification, while sanctification evidences true faith.
    - "Justification and sanctification are never to be confounded, though they are never separated." ("Faith and Life")

4. **Sanctification involves human responsibility and divine sovereignty**
    - Believers are called to active obedience and pursuit of holiness.
    - Human effort is real but always dependent on divine grace.
    - The imperative to be holy is grounded in the indicative of what God has done.
    - Sanctification is synergistic in experience but monergistic in origin.
    - "Work out your own salvation... for it is God who works in you." ("Faith and Life")

5. **Sanctification is rooted in union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the source of all spiritual blessings, including sanctification.
    - Definitive sanctification flows from being united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - Progressive sanctification is the outworking of this union in daily life.
    - The believer’s identity in Christ shapes the pursuit of holiness.
    - "All our sanctification is in Christ, and by virtue of our union with Him." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Sanctification," Selected Shorter Writings)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** provided a clear framework for Reformed soteriology in the twentieth century. His careful distinction between **justification** and sanctification influenced generations of theologians, especially within the Presbyterian and broader evangelical traditions. Warfield’s emphasis on the **Holy Spirit’s work** and the believer’s union with Christ remains foundational for contemporary discussions of Christian growth and holiness.
