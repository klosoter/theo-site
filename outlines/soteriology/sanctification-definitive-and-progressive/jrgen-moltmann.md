# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **sanctification** through the lens of **eschatology** and **participation in the life of the Triune God**, emphasizing the transformative power of the **Spirit** in both individual and communal existence. He reframes **definitive and progressive sanctification** as dimensions of the believer's participation in the new creation inaugurated by Christ's resurrection, focusing on the ongoing process of liberation and renewal within history. Moltmann’s theology situates sanctification within the broader horizon of **hope** and the coming **Kingdom of God**.

- "Sanctification is the process of the Spirit’s liberation, in which the new creation is already anticipated in the midst of the old." (The Spirit of Life)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Participation in the Spirit**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the believer’s participation in the **life-giving Spirit**.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers in the new creation.
    - This participation is both a gift (definitive) and a calling (progressive).
    - The Spirit’s work is communal, not merely individual.
    - "Sanctification is the Spirit’s work of making human beings participants in the divine life." (The Spirit of Life)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is oriented toward the **future fulfillment** of God’s promises.
    - The process anticipates the final transformation of all creation.
    - Definitive sanctification is grounded in Christ’s resurrection as the beginning of the new age.
    - Progressive sanctification unfolds as believers live in hope toward the coming **Kingdom**.
    - "The sanctification of life is the anticipation of the world to come in the world that is passing away." (The Coming of God)

3. **Liberation and Transformation**
    - Sanctification involves liberation from **sin**, oppression, and alienation.
    - The Spirit empowers believers to resist structures of injustice.
    - Transformation is both personal and social, reflecting God’s redemptive purposes.
    - The process is ongoing, marked by struggle and hope.
    - "The Spirit’s sanctifying work is liberation for life in the midst of death." (The Spirit of Life)

4. **Communal and Cosmic Dimensions**
    - Sanctification is not limited to individuals but encompasses the whole community.
    - The **church** is the sign and instrument of sanctification in the world.
    - The Spirit’s renewing work extends to all creation, not just humanity.
    - Definitive and progressive aspects are seen in the church’s witness and mission.
    - "Sanctification is the transformation of the world begun in the community of the Spirit." (The Spirit of Life)

5. **Integration of Justification and Sanctification**
    - Moltmann resists separating **justification** and sanctification as distinct stages.
    - Both are aspects of participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - Sanctification is the lived reality of the new status granted in justification.
    - The Spirit unites the believer’s identity and ethical transformation.
    - "Justification and sanctification are two sides of the same participation in Christ." (The Spirit of Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of sanctification has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **eschatology**, **pneumatology**, and the social implications of Christian life. His emphasis on the **Spirit’s liberating and transformative work** has influenced liberation, feminist, and ecological theologies. By framing sanctification within the context of hope and the coming **Kingdom**, Moltmann has broadened the doctrine’s relevance for both personal and communal renewal. His approach continues to challenge and inspire those seeking a holistic and future-oriented vision of Christian holiness.
