# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of **sanctification** that distinguished between its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. He emphasized that believers are set apart in Christ through a decisive act of God, while also being continually renewed by the **Holy Spirit** in conformity to **Christ’s image** throughout their lives.

- "Sanctification is both a gift and a task; it is a benefit received and a duty to be performed." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Definitive Sanctification as Union with Christ**
    - Believers are decisively set apart from sin through union with Christ.
    - This sanctification is rooted in Christ’s finished work and applied by the Holy Spirit.
    - It marks a fundamental break with the dominion of sin.
    - The believer’s new identity is established at the outset of the Christian life.
    - "In Christ, believers are sanctified once for all, separated from the world and dedicated to God." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

2. **Progressive Sanctification as Lifelong Renewal**
    - Sanctification continues as a gradual, Spirit-empowered transformation.
    - The believer is renewed in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness after God’s image.
    - This process involves active participation and struggle against sin.
    - Growth in sanctification is never complete in this life.
    - "Sanctification is a process that continues throughout the whole of life, never reaching perfection here." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

3. **Sanctification as Both Divine Gift and Human Responsibility**
    - God is the primary agent, but believers are called to active obedience.
    - Sanctification involves both God’s sovereign grace and human effort.
    - The believer’s will is renewed and enabled to pursue holiness.
    - Spiritual disciplines and means of grace are essential for growth.
    - "It is God who sanctifies, yet man must sanctify himself." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

4. **Sanctification Rooted in Justification and Regeneration**
    - Justification and regeneration are the foundation for sanctification.
    - Sanctification flows from the believer’s new status and new life in Christ.
    - The benefits of union with Christ are inseparable but distinct.
    - Assurance of sanctification is grounded in God’s promises, not human achievement.
    - "Sanctification is inseparably connected with justification and regeneration, yet it is a distinct benefit." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

5. **Eschatological Consummation of Sanctification**
    - Full sanctification will only be realized at the resurrection.
    - The present struggle with sin points to the need for future glorification.
    - The Spirit’s work now is a foretaste of the final renewal.
    - Hope in the consummation motivates present pursuit of holiness.
    - "The sanctification begun in this life will be perfected only in the life to come." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced distinction between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the believer’s transformation. His emphasis on the inseparability of **union with Christ**, the Spirit’s agency, and the believer’s responsibility continues to influence contemporary discussions on Christian holiness. Bavinck’s synthesis of biblical, historical, and systematic perspectives provides a comprehensive framework for addressing sanctification in both academic and pastoral contexts.
