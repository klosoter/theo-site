# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **sanctification** as a work of **grace** rooted in union with Christ, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** dimensions. He maintained that believers are set apart once-for-all in Christ, yet must continually grow in holiness through the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. Kuyper’s theology integrates sanctification with his broader vision of **sphere sovereignty** and the renewal of all creation.

- "Sanctification is not a mere improvement of the old nature, but a new creation in Christ Jesus." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is rooted in union with Christ**
    - Believers are sanctified by virtue of their incorporation into Christ.
    - This union is both the ground and source of all holiness.
    - Sanctification is inseparable from justification, yet distinct in its operation.
    - The benefits of Christ flow to the believer through the Spirit.
    - "All that is ours becomes His, and all that is His becomes ours, in this blessed union." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

2. **Definitive sanctification as a once-for-all act**
    - At conversion, the believer is set apart from the world and sin.
    - This definitive act is accomplished by the Holy Spirit applying Christ’s work.
    - It marks a real, ontological change in the believer’s status.
    - The old self is crucified, and a new principle of life is implanted.
    - "The break with sin is not gradual, but decisive and absolute." (Het Werk van den Heiligen Geest)

3. **Progressive sanctification as lifelong growth**
    - Sanctification continues throughout the Christian life.
    - The Spirit enables believers to mortify sin and cultivate holiness.
    - Growth in grace is gradual and involves struggle against remaining sin.
    - The means of grace, especially Word and sacrament, are essential.
    - "Sanctification is a process, a holy striving, a daily renewal after the image of God." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

4. **Sanctification involves both individual and communal dimensions**
    - Holiness is not merely personal but also corporate, affecting the church and society.
    - The church as a community is called to manifest sanctification in its life together.
    - Kuyper’s doctrine of sphere sovereignty shapes his view of sanctification’s reach.
    - The transformation of all spheres of life is part of God’s sanctifying work.
    - "The sanctification of the believer is inseparable from the sanctification of the body of Christ." (Pro Rege)

5. **Sanctification is empowered by the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit is the agent who applies Christ’s work to believers.
    - Sanctification is not achieved by human effort alone but by divine power.
    - The Spirit indwells, renews, and empowers for obedience.
    - Prayerful dependence on the Spirit is essential for growth in holiness.
    - "Without the Holy Spirit, sanctification is impossible; with Him, it is assured." (Het Werk van den Heiligen Geest)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust doctrine of **sanctification** has shaped Reformed theology by emphasizing both the definitive break with sin and the ongoing, Spirit-empowered growth in holiness. His integration of sanctification with **sphere sovereignty** has encouraged Christians to pursue holiness not only in personal piety but also in cultural and societal engagement. Kuyper’s influence endures in the Neo-Calvinist tradition, inspiring a holistic vision of Christian life that seeks the renewal of all creation under Christ’s lordship.
