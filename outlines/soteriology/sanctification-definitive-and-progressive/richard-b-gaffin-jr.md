# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **sanctification** emphasizes both its **definitive** and **progressive** dimensions, rooted in **union with Christ**. He insists that believers are decisively set apart in Christ’s death and resurrection (definitive sanctification), while also being called to ongoing transformation by the **Holy Spirit** (progressive sanctification).

- "Sanctification, then, is both definitive and progressive, and both are inseparably bound up with union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (in "The Glory of the Atonement")
- "Sanctification" (in "The New Dictionary of Theology")
- "Life in the Spirit: In Union with Christ by the Spirit" (in "The Westminster Theological Journal")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is definitive in Christ**
    - Believers are set apart once-for-all through Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - This definitive aspect is not merely positional but involves a real break with the power of sin.
    - It is inseparable from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - Definitive sanctification provides the foundation for all subsequent growth in holiness.
    "Definitive sanctification is the once-for-all act of God by which believers are transferred from the realm of sin to the realm of Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Sanctification is progressive by the Spirit**
    - Growth in holiness is an ongoing process throughout the Christian life.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables believers to mortify sin and live unto righteousness.
    - Progressive sanctification is grounded in the reality of definitive sanctification.
    - It involves both divine initiative and human responsibility.
    "Progressive sanctification is the continuing work of the Spirit in the believer, conforming them more and more to the image of Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Union with Christ is central to sanctification**
    - Both definitive and progressive sanctification flow from **union with the risen Christ**.
    - All benefits of salvation, including sanctification, are received in union with Him.
    - This union is effected by the **Holy Spirit** and is covenantal in nature.
    - Sanctification cannot be separated from **justification** or adoption, as all are benefits of union.
    "All the benefits of salvation, including sanctification, are found in union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Sanctification is eschatological**
    - The resurrection of Christ inaugurates the new age, and believers participate in this reality now.
    - Sanctification is shaped by the “already/not yet” tension of **redemptive history**.
    - The definitive aspect points to the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection.
    - Progressive sanctification anticipates final glorification at Christ’s return.
    "Sanctification is grounded in the eschatological reality of Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s participation in it." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

5. **Sanctification is distinct from but inseparable from justification**
    - **Justification** and sanctification are distinct benefits of salvation, but both are received in union with Christ.
    - Sanctification does not contribute to the ground of justification.
    - The two must not be confused, but neither can they be separated in the Christian life.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are rooted in the finished work of Christ.
    "Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of the believer’s salvation in Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its Pauline studies and soteriology. His emphasis on **union with Christ** as the locus of all redemptive benefits has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to sanctification. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a bridge between biblical exegesis and systematic theology, providing clarity on the relationship between Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s transformation. His legacy endures in the ongoing discussions of sanctification within confessional Reformed circles.
