### ESSAY
Sanctification is the Spirit’s work of making the saints what God has declared them to be in Christ. It is both definitive and progressive. Definitive sanctification names the once-for-all deliverance from the dominion of sin through union with the crucified and risen Lord, a consecration to God that repositions the person under a new lordship. Progressive sanctification names the Spirit’s ongoing renovation, conforming believers to Christ in the concrete habits of holiness, by which sin’s presence is increasingly weakened and the graces of faith, hope, and love are strengthened. These are not two different graces but two aspects of one grace flowing from **union with Christ** in the power of the Spirit. The doctrinal task is to render this unity with precision, guarding the **Creator–creature distinction**, maintaining the integrity of justification by faith, and tracing the **indicative–imperative** grammar of the New Testament without either flattening growth into a self-help project or mistaking definitive grace for final glorification.

The genealogy of the topic begins decisively with Augustine of Hippo. In the anti-Pelagian writings, Augustine argued that fallen humanity is incurvatus in se, bound by concupiscence, and unable to choose the good apart from prevenient and operative grace. This Augustinian grammar asserts the primacy of divine action and grounds sanctification in the healing of disordered love. Augustine’s sermons on the Psalms and his Enchiridion articulate sanctification as a process of being made righteous by the Spirit’s gift of charity, a growth that remains incomplete in this life yet real. He never separates sanctification from justification in the later Protestant sense, yet he preserves two crucial anchors for all later accounts: the radicality of grace and the ongoing struggle between the spirit and the flesh that persists until death. When examiners ask whether Augustine anticipated definitive sanctification, the best response is that he described a definitive translation by grace in regeneration and baptism that breaks sin’s reigning power, while keeping a robust account of concupiscence’s lingering presence. Augustine’s realism about sin and grace set both boundaries and trajectories for medieval and Reformation development.

Thomas Aquinas renders this Augustinian inheritance into a sacramental-habitus framework. For Aquinas, sanctifying grace is an infused habit that heals and elevates nature, with charity as its form. The sacraments are instrumental causes of this grace. As justification, sanctification, and adoption are formally one grace in his account, sanctification is constitutive of being made just. Aquinas thus secures the priority of God’s agency and the reality of inward renewal, while expressing sanctification as cooperation enabled by grace. He can speak of growth in grace as habits deepening through repeated acts. For a Reformed examiner the critical point is both appreciative and contrastive: Aquinas’s insistence on interior transformation and the sacramental economy underlines the ecclesial and participatory character of holiness, but the lack of a clear forensic distinction and the elevation of infused habits as the formal cause of justification generate the very Reformation protest that will guard justification and sanctification as distinct yet inseparable. Still, the insight that God uses habits and practices is a classical resource for contemporary questions about formation, provided we subordinate habitus to the **means of grace** and to union with the resurrected Christ rather than to a built-in facility of nature.

John Calvin places **union with Christ** at the center, reframing sanctification as the second benefit of the duplex gratia alongside justification. In the Institutes and his Romans commentary, Calvin portrays the Spirit as the bond of union who engrafts us into Christ so that we share in his death and life. The Reformation’s decisive move is to deny that our renewal is the basis of our acceptance before God. Nevertheless, Calvin refuses any divorce of the benefits; Christ cannot be torn to pieces. Hence sanctification is necessary, inevitable, and evidential, yet not meritorious. Calvin’s conceptual contribution is to locate sanctification under adoption and the gift of the Spirit, give it a trinitarian depth, and structure its rhythm as **mortification and vivification**. He also makes critical connections to **federal theology** by reading Romans 5 and 6 as humanity’s transition from the first Adam to the second Adam, which entails a real translation into a new realm where sin no longer reigns. Importantly, Calvin articulates the **third use of the law** as a normative guide for the regenerate, integrating the **indicative–imperative** pattern of apostolic exhortation. For examiners probing the pastoral edge, Calvin’s sturdy doctrine of assurance ties sanctification to Christ’s finished work and the Spirit’s witness rather than to perfectionistic introspection, while his pastoral acuity attends to the slow, uneven growth that belongs to pilgrims between the times.

John Owen extends Calvin’s framework with granular analysis of the Spirit’s agency and the believer’s agency in sanctification. In Of the Mortification of Sin and The Holy Spirit, Owen insists that only the Spirit mortifies sin, yet he critically resists quietism. Mortification is a Spirit-enabled duty through which believers, by faith, put sin to death. Owen integrates anthropology and hamartiology with unusual force: sin indwells as a law that aims at dominion, and the gospel furnishes both motive and power for its killing. He ties mortification to the cross of Christ, insisting that the efficacy of Christ’s death is applied to extinguish the vitality of sin’s lusts. He locates means. The word preached, sacramentally sealed, prayer, watchfulness, and communion with God are not optional aids but instruments ordained for holiness. Owen’s distinctive pastoral contribution is to insist that true mortification is not the modification of behavior alone but the weakening of sin at its root through a superior delight in God’s beauty. As for the role of the law, Owen holds its third use firmly while warning against legalistic self-reliance. To the examiner’s challenge about synergism, Owen answers with asymmetrical cooperation: the Spirit is the principal efficient cause, while the believer is a true though subordinate agent, whose activity is itself a fruit of grace. This preserves monergism in regeneration and ensures sanctification’s progress is neither automatic nor autonomous. Owen also secures the ecclesial frame. Holiness is nurtured in the communion of saints under ordained ministry, not in privatized heroics.

In the twentieth century John Murray sharpened the doctrine by arguing exegetically for **definitive sanctification**. His essays on Romans 6 and 1 Corinthians 6 press the point that Scripture attributes a once-for-all sanctifying event to those united to Christ. You have died to sin is not an aspirational slogan. It names a redemptive-historical reality grounded in Christ’s death and resurrection and applied by the Spirit in effectual calling. Murray does not deny progressive growth, but he insists that it is incoherent unless preceded by the decisive breach. He reads in 1 Corinthians 6 you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified as chronological or logical, with sanctification in the past tense identifying consecration by union. Hebrews 10 says we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all, and verse 14 says by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. Murray pulls these threads together: sanctification can be spoken of as done in terms of consecration to God and as ongoing in terms of renewal. The conceptual win is twofold. First, it anchors the imperatives in unshakeable indicatives that do not fluctuate with our performance. Second, it avoids a subtle moralism in which sanctification is imagined to await our initiative. Exam questions often push whether this blurs justification. Murray answers by distinguishing the aspects. Justification alters our status before God. Definitive sanctification alters our state with respect to sin’s dominion. Both are by union with Christ, yet they are not the same benefit. This precision guards forensic grace without diminishing transformative grace.

John Wesley provides a rival Protestant trajectory in his doctrine of entire sanctification. Wesley’s sermons and A Plain Account of Christian Perfection construct a second blessing paradigm in which believers, after justification and the new birth, may receive a distinct work of grace freeing them from the root of sin and enabling perfect love in this life. Wesley’s perfection is not absolute sinlessness but deliverance from voluntary transgressions, with involuntary sins covered by Christ. He combines a high view of methodical disciplines with a robust emphasis on the Spirit’s sanctifying power. The attraction here is pastoral urgency and confidence in real holiness. Yet the Reformed critique notes the exegetical and theological difficulties. The New Testament’s realism about the ongoing war of the flesh and Spirit, the model of Paul in Romans 7, and the inevitability of indwelling sin before glorification press against any second-blessing perfection. Moreover, positing a post-justification crisis experience risks dislocating sanctification from **union with Christ** and the ordinary **means of grace** into a pneumatic exceptionalism. Nevertheless, Wesley’s insistence on holiness as love corrects any tendency toward austere rule-keeping and calls attention to the teleology of sanctification as conformity to Christ’s charity.

With these figures in view, the Reformed doctrine can be defended with scriptural and dogmatic clarity. Romans 6 frames sanctification covenantally under **federal theology**. Those who are baptized into Christ Jesus are baptized into his death and raised in newness of life. Paul’s argument is not that believers should try to die to sin but that they have died to sin in Christ and must therefore not let it reign. This is **definitive sanctification**. Dominion language governs the passage. Sin shall not have dominion over you since you are under grace. The transition from Adam to Christ is a transfer of lordship. 1 Corinthians 1 sanctifies the church as those who call upon the name of the Lord, underlining consecration as identity. 1 Corinthians 6 asserts a past definitive cleansing. Hebrews 10 gives the once-for-all sanctification by Christ’s offering while acknowledging the ongoing being sanctified. Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 cast progressive sanctification in terms of putting off the old man and putting on the new, which presupposes a definitive putting off accomplished in Christ. First Thessalonians 4 presents sanctification as God’s will, particularly in sexual holiness, invoking the Spirit’s agency and the irreducible moral dimension. Philippians 2 unites divine and human agency in sanctification. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling for God works in you to will and to do. This is the Reformed asymmetry in a text, not a contradiction but a causal ordering in which God’s action grounds and enables ours.

Internal debates within the Reformed tradition cluster around four axes. First, how to articulate the relation of sanctification to justification. The confessional settlement insists on distinction without separation. To deny the distinction collapses into a Roman view that makes renewal the basis of acceptance. To separate them is antinomian. The right relation is that justification is the legal acceptance on account of Christ imputed righteousness while sanctification is the moral renovation by the same Christ through the Spirit, inseparably joined because both flow from **union with Christ**. The examiner’s trap is the phrase sanctification by faith alone. Clarify that faith alone justifies, and the same faith genuinely works through love in sanctification. Second, the debate about definitive sanctification. Murray’s proposal was contested by those who feared confusion with justification. The response is exegetical and conceptual. Scripture speaks both ways, and distinguishing dominion from presence of sin answers the worry. Definitive sanctification is not a change in legal status but in existential solidarities. Third, the role of the law. Some, wary of legalism, flatten the third use. Yet by Calvin’s reading, the **third use of the law** guides the regenerate, not as covenant of works but as norm of gratitude, driving us to Christ and shaping communal holiness. Fourth, the means of sanctification. A pietist impulse might center private disciplines alone. Reformed divinity anchors sanctification in the church’s **means of grace**: the word read and preached, the sacraments, and prayer. Private prudence, fasting, and rule are subordinated to ecclesial means. Owen is decisive here.

External debates sharpen the contours. Roman Catholic theology, evolving from Aquinas through Trent, identifies sanctification as integral to justification, with sanctifying grace infused through the sacraments, and the increase of grace meriting de condigno. From a Reformed standpoint, the critique is the confusion of the forensic and the renovative, which imperils assurance and eclipses the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness imputed. Yet there is an area of constructive overlap in the emphasis on real transformation and virtue. The Reformed gain is to preserve both forensic certainty and transformational reality by rooting both in Christ’s mediation under the **Creator–creature distinction** and by refusing deification as ontological participation. Lutheran law-gospel concerns register another pressure point. If the law always accuses, can there be a third use in sanctification that guides without condemning? The Reformed answer is that in Christ the curse of the law is removed, so the law can function normatively as a gift, even while the flesh still feels its accusatory bite. The gospel remains the power for holiness, and any use of the law severed from Christ’s person is deadly. Wesleyan and Keswick perfectionisms press the Reformed to defend nonperfectionist realism without lowering expectations. The Reformed rebut is to affirm the possibility of extraordinary growth and real victory over specific sins while denying total eradication of sin’s presence before resurrection. Pentecostal second-blessing models also face the abiding question of whether the New Testament norm is one baptism of the Spirit in conversion or a subsequent enduement. On sanctification, the Reformed insist the Spirit’s fullness may ebb and flow, but there is no class of two-tier Christians.

Contemporary debates shift registers to anthropology, culture, and pastoral practice. Secular formation theory foregrounds habits, identity, and community practices. The Reformed can appropriate the best of this in the idiom of **habitus** but must keep divine agency primary and maintain that the church’s forms of life are not merely natural techniques but sacramental and word-shaped means through which the Spirit works. Neuroscience raises questions about moral agency in addiction and trauma. The Reformed answer draws on Owen’s realism about indwelling sin and on pastoral patience. Sanctification involves the body, the emotions, and the neurobiological engravings of past sin and suffering. Growth can be uneven and slow. Yet the definitive breach with sin’s dominion is not rescinded by biological constraints. Progressive sanctification includes ordinary and clinical helps, with the church offering a stable community of grace. Sexual ethics and the digital environment expose sanctification’s concrete edge. First Thessalonians 4 makes sexual holiness a sanctification test case. The digital economy multiplies occasions of sinful dispositions and accelerates disintegration of attention. The church’s response is to reassert ascetical wisdom under gospel freedom, training in practices of presence to God and neighbor within the church’s rhythms, rather than baptizing secular productivity hacks. Social holiness and justice debates can confuse sanctification with activism. The Reformed can affirm that sanctification yields a public righteousness shaped by the **law of Christ**, including justice for the oppressed, while resisting a reduction of holiness to political performance. The church’s holiness is cruciform before it is influential.

This doctrine intersects adjacent loci that examiners will probe. With respect to **divine simplicity**, sanctification is participation in God’s holiness through union with the Son by the Spirit, not division of God’s attributes into transferable parts. God is his holiness, and he communicates a created share in this holiness without compromising the Creator–creature divide. With respect to Christology, sanctification is the Spirit’s ministry of conforming us to the image of the incarnate Son, whose human obedience and **active obedience** under **federal theology** not only counts for us but models new life. The ordo salutis places sanctification after justification and adoption and alongside perseverance. Yet under the historia salutis, all benefits flow from our union with the crucified and risen Christ. Ecclesiology matters because sanctification is not a private pilgrimage. The Spirit sanctifies a people, weaving growth through the disciplines of church life. Sacramentology belongs here. Baptism consecrates and seals our union with Christ, witnessing to the definitive breach with sin’s dominion. The Lord’s Supper nourishes progressive sanctification by feeding on Christ by faith. Assurance belongs not to perfection but to Christ’s promise, and the fruit of sanctification confirms rather than creates assurance.

Objections can be anticipated. Does a strong account of **definitive sanctification** generate complacency or denial of deep-seated sin? The answer is that Paul uses definitive sanctification to motivate warfare. Because you have died to sin, do not let it reign. Pastoral misuse is not a doctrinal flaw. Does speaking of cooperation in progressive sanctification violate monergism? Reformed theology is monergist in regeneration. In sanctification the regenerate act, but all their acting is enabled and sustained by the Spirit who works in them to will and to do. The asymmetry remains. Does the third use of the law obscure gospel freedom? No. The law functions for the justified as a rule of gratitude, driving us to Christ and guiding us in love. When the law accuses, it is functioning as a schoolmaster returning us to Christ’s sufficiency. Does denying perfectionism foster tolerant sin? Not if one takes Romans 8 seriously. The Spirit’s indwelling is a power of resurrection for real transformation, not an indulgence for mediocrity. Will emphasizing means of grace suppress attention to spiritual disciplines and psychological realities? On the contrary, it orders them. Word, sacrament, and prayer are the fountain. Prudential disciplines and clinical helps are streamlets that must not be expected to do what only the fountain can.

The constructive proposal then is simple and demanding. Sanctification is the triune God’s work of making a holy people in Christ. It is definitive because the cross and resurrection of Christ, applied by the Spirit, translate the believer into a new domain where sin no longer reigns. It is progressive because the Spirit, through the ordinary **means of grace**, renews the whole person, producing obedience to the **law of Christ**, deepening communion with God, and fitting saints for glory. The matrix is **union with Christ**. The grammar is the **indicative–imperative**. The method is **mortification and vivification**. The frame is ecclesial. The tone is hopeful realism. Augustine secures the primacy of grace. Aquinas reminds us of interior renovation and the ecclesial economy. Calvin centers union and the duplex gratia. Owen anatomizes Spirit-enabled duty and the textures of sin. Murray secures the definitive breach. Wesley’s summons to love warns against cold orthodoxy. Under the Westminster Standards, this account preserves doctrinal coherence across loci, answers rival frameworks, and equips pastors to preach holiness that is neither moralistic nor illusory, rooted wholly in the living Christ who is our sanctification.
