# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof offered a classic Reformed account of **sanctification**, distinguishing sharply between its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. He emphasized that believers are set apart in principle at regeneration (**definitive sanctification**), but also undergo a lifelong process of moral and spiritual renewal (**progressive sanctification**) by the Holy Spirit. Berkhof’s synthesis remains a standard in systematic theology for articulating the ordo salutis.

- "Sanctification may be defined as that gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit by which He delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin, renews his whole nature in the image of God, and enables him to perform good works." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Definitive Sanctification as a Distinct Act**
    - Sanctification begins with a decisive act of God at regeneration.
    - The believer is set apart from sin’s dominion and unto God.
    - This aspect is rooted in union with Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - It is not a process but a once-for-all event in the believer’s history.
    - "In principle, the believer is sanctified at the moment of his regeneration." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Progressive Sanctification as a Lifelong Process**
    - Sanctification continues throughout the Christian life.
    - The Holy Spirit gradually renews the believer’s character and conduct.
    - It involves active cooperation between the believer and the Spirit.
    - Sin’s presence is weakened, but not eradicated, until glorification.
    - "It is a process by which the Holy Spirit gradually delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Sanctification Rooted in Union with Christ**
    - Both definitive and progressive sanctification flow from union with Christ.
    - The believer participates in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - This union is the foundation for both the break with sin and ongoing renewal.
    - All benefits of salvation, including sanctification, are applied through this union.
    - "The mystical union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the principal agent of sanctification.
    - He works internally to renew the believer’s heart and will.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s redemptive work to the believer.
    - Human effort is real but always dependent on the Spirit’s enabling.
    - "Sanctification is ascribed primarily to the operation of the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Necessity of Human Responsibility and Means of Grace**
    - Believers are called to active obedience and use of the means of grace.
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are essential instruments in sanctification.
    - Growth in holiness requires diligence and self-denial.
    - Yet, all progress is ultimately attributed to God’s grace.
    - "While sanctification is a work of God, it is also a duty of man." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s treatment of **sanctification** has shaped generations of Reformed pastors and theologians, providing a clear distinction between its definitive and progressive dimensions. His careful articulation of the doctrine within the **ordo salutis** remains a touchstone for systematic theology curricula. Berkhof’s influence endures in both academic and pastoral contexts, ensuring that the balance between God’s sovereign work and human responsibility in sanctification remains central in Reformed thought.
