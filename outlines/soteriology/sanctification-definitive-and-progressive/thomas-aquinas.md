# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates **sanctification** primarily within the framework of **justification**, **grace**, and the **infused virtues**. He distinguishes between the initial transformation of the soul by **habitual grace** (akin to what later Reformed theology calls "definitive sanctification") and the ongoing process of growth in **holiness** (progressive sanctification), emphasizing the cooperation of human will with **divine grace**.

- "Grace, which is given by God, heals human nature and elevates it to participate in the divine good." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 109–114
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book II)
- De Veritate (On Truth)
- The Catechetical Instructions

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Participation in Divine Life**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the soul’s participation in the **divine nature** through grace.
    - The **infusion of grace** transforms the soul, enabling it to act in a God-pleasing manner.
    - This participation is both an initial act and an ongoing process.
    - The **theological virtues** (faith, hope, love) are infused as habits, forming the basis for sanctification.
    - "By grace man is made a partaker of the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 110, a. 3)

2. **Definitive Sanctification: Initial Infusion of Grace**
    - The initial act of God in the soul is a real, ontological change.
    - This is the moment when the soul is moved from the state of sin to the state of grace.
    - Aquinas sees this as the foundation for all subsequent growth in holiness.
    - The soul is cleansed from original and actual sin, and made righteous before God.
    - "The justification of the ungodly is wrought by the infusion of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 3)

3. **Progressive Sanctification: Growth in Virtue**
    - After the initial infusion, sanctification continues as a process of growing in virtue.
    - The **moral and theological virtues** are strengthened through repeated acts and cooperation with grace.
    - Human effort, enabled by grace, is necessary for progress in holiness.
    - This growth is not merely moral improvement but deeper participation in God’s life.
    - "Grace is given to us that we may merit eternal life and perform good works." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 114, a. 3)

4. **Cooperation of Free Will and Grace**
    - Human free will is not destroyed but healed and elevated by grace.
    - Sanctification requires the cooperation of the human will with God’s action.
    - The process is synergistic: God is the primary cause, but humans are true secondary agents.
    - This cooperation is itself made possible by prevenient grace.
    - "God so moves the will that man may also act." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 111, a. 2)

5. **Distinction Between Justification and Sanctification**
    - Aquinas does not sharply separate justification and sanctification as later Protestant theology does.
    - Both are aspects of the soul’s transformation by grace, though justification is the initial movement.
    - Sanctification is the ongoing effect of justification, as the soul grows in grace and virtue.
    - The distinction is more logical than temporal; both flow from the same grace.
    - "Justification includes the infusion of grace and the remission of guilt." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **sanctification** as both a definitive act and a progressive process profoundly shaped later Catholic and broader Christian theology. His emphasis on the **infused virtues** and the cooperation of grace and free will became foundational for Roman Catholic teaching and influenced debates during the Reformation. While his categories differ from later Reformed distinctions, his work remains a critical reference point for understanding the relationship between grace, virtue, and the Christian life. Aquinas’s thought continues to inform ecumenical dialogue on the nature of sanctification and the transformative power of grace.
