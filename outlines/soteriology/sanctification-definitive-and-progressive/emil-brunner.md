# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **sanctification** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the transformative encounter between the human person and the living God in Christ. He distinguished between the **definitive act of justification** and the ongoing, **progressive renewal** of the believer, yet insisted that sanctification is always grounded in the **personal relationship** established by God's grace. For Brunner, sanctification is both a gift and a task, realized in the context of the **community of faith**.

- "Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit, who leads the believer into the new life which is given in Christ." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Divine Imperative (1937)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II, 1952)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith (1934)
- Man in Revolt (1937)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Personal Encounter**
    - Sanctification arises from the believer’s direct encounter with the living Christ.
    - It is not merely moral improvement but a relational transformation.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates this encounter, making the believer new.
    - The process is dynamic, rooted in ongoing dialogue with God.
    - "Sanctification is not a human achievement, but the result of the divine-human encounter." (The Divine Imperative)

2. **Definitive and Progressive Dimensions**
    - Brunner affirms a definitive break with sin at conversion, grounded in justification.
    - Progressive sanctification unfolds as the believer responds to God’s call.
    - The definitive aspect is the new status; the progressive is the new life.
    - Both are inseparable, yet distinct in the believer’s experience.
    - "The new life is given once for all, but it must be continually appropriated." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

3. **Sanctification Rooted in Justification**
    - Justification is the foundation and ongoing context for sanctification.
    - Sanctification never becomes a ground for acceptance before God.
    - The believer’s growth is always dependent on grace, not merit.
    - Assurance rests in Christ’s work, not in sanctification’s progress.
    - "Sanctification is the fruit of justification, never its cause." (The Mediator)

4. **Ethical Imperative and Human Responsibility**
    - Sanctification involves a real ethical imperative: the call to obedience.
    - The believer is summoned to active participation in the new life.
    - Human response is essential, yet always enabled by the Spirit.
    - The ethical life is lived out in concrete, historical situations.
    - "The command of God is always a call to a new obedience." (The Divine Imperative)

5. **Community and the Church**
    - Sanctification is not an individualistic process but occurs within the church.
    - The community of faith supports and shapes the believer’s growth.
    - The sacraments and proclamation are means of sanctifying grace.
    - Mutual exhortation and accountability are vital for progress.
    - "The Church is the sphere in which sanctification becomes reality." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **sanctification** influenced 20th-century Protestant thought by emphasizing the relational and communal dimensions of the Christian life. His dialectical approach provided a corrective to both legalistic and purely existential accounts of sanctification. Brunner’s insistence on the inseparability of **justification and sanctification** continues to shape ecumenical discussions and practical theology, especially regarding the role of the church and the ethical imperative in Christian living.
