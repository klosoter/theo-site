# Kevin DeYoung (1977–)

Kevin DeYoung articulates a robustly Reformed understanding of **sanctification**, stressing both its **definitive** and **progressive** dimensions. He maintains that believers are set apart in Christ once for all, yet called to continual growth in **holiness** through the work of the **Holy Spirit** and the ordinary means of grace.

- "Sanctification is both a definitive act and an ongoing process." ("The Hole in Our Holiness")

## Key Works

- The Hole in Our Holiness (2012)
- "Sanctification 101" in Acting the Miracle (2013)
- The Good News We Almost Forgot (2010)
- Taking God at His Word (2014)
- "The Grace of God and the God of Grace: Sanctification and the Christian Life" (articles and sermons)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is both definitive and progressive**
    - Believers are definitively set apart in Christ at conversion.
    - Progressive sanctification is the lifelong process of growing in **holiness**.
    - Both aspects are grounded in **union with Christ**.
    - The distinction guards against both perfectionism and antinomianism.
    "Sanctification is a work of God’s free grace, but it is also a work in which we are active participants." (The Hole in Our Holiness)

2. **Union with Christ as the foundation**
    - Definitive sanctification flows from being united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - Progressive sanctification is the outworking of this union in daily life.
    - Union with Christ ensures sanctification is not merely moral improvement.
    - This union is both legal (**justification**) and transformative (**sanctification**).
    "We are sanctified because we are in Christ, and we grow in holiness as we live out that reality." (Sanctification 101)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit and means of grace**
    - The **Holy Spirit** indwells and empowers believers for sanctification.
    - Ordinary means—**Word**, sacraments, and prayer—are essential for growth.
    - The Spirit works through these means, not apart from them.
    - Sanctification is supernatural but not mystical or passive.
    "The Spirit works through the Word, prayer, and the fellowship of the church to make us holy." (The Hole in Our Holiness)

4. **Necessity of personal effort and obedience**
    - Sanctification requires intentional pursuit of **holiness**.
    - Believers are called to put sin to death and cultivate virtue.
    - Grace-driven effort is not opposed to the gospel.
    - Obedience is evidence, not the basis, of salvation.
    "Holiness is not a condition for salvation, but it is always a consequence." (The Hole in Our Holiness)

5. **Sanctification is distinct from justification**
    - **Justification** is a once-for-all legal declaration; sanctification is ongoing transformation.
    - Confusing the two leads to legalism or antinomianism.
    - Assurance is rooted in justification, but sanctification provides evidence.
    - Both are gifts of grace, but operate differently in the believer’s life.
    "We must never confuse justification and sanctification, but neither can we separate them." (The Hole in Our Holiness)

## Legacy and Impact

Kevin DeYoung has significantly contributed to the recovery of the **Reformed doctrine of sanctification** for a new generation, especially among evangelicals wary of legalism or antinomianism. His clear articulation of both **definitive** and **progressive** sanctification has shaped contemporary discussions on holiness, discipleship, and the Christian life. DeYoung’s work continues to influence pastors, students, and laypeople seeking a biblically faithful and practical approach to sanctification.
