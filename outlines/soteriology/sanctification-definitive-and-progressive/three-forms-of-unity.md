# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of **sanctification** as both **definitive** (a once-for-all setting apart in union with Christ) and **progressive** (a Spirit-empowered, lifelong growth in holiness). These confessions emphasize that **sanctification** flows from **justification** and is inseparable from true faith, while maintaining a clear distinction between the believer’s definitive break with sin and the ongoing process of renewal.

- "Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit after his own image, that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for his benefits." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 86)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 86–91
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 24–25
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine, esp. Articles 11–14
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism: Sources, History, and Theology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification flows from union with Christ**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, resulting in both justification and sanctification.
    - This union entails a definitive break with the dominion of sin.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s benefits, making believers new creatures.
    - Sanctification is inseparable from the new identity given in Christ.
    - "What is your only comfort in life and in death? That I am not my own, but belong...to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 1)

2. **Definitive sanctification: a real, once-for-all change**
    - At conversion, believers are set apart and delivered from the reign of sin.
    - This definitive aspect is grounded in Christ’s finished work and the Spirit’s application.
    - The old self is crucified, and a new principle of life is implanted.
    - This change is not partial but affects the whole person.
    - "By his power our old man is crucified, put to death, and buried with him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 89)

3. **Progressive sanctification: a lifelong process**
    - Sanctification continues throughout the believer’s life by the Spirit’s work.
    - Believers are called to strive against sin and grow in obedience.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of true faith, not its ground.
    - The process involves daily repentance and renewal after God’s image.
    - "Even the holiest men, while in this life, have only a small beginning of this obedience." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 114)

4. **Sanctification distinguished from justification**
    - Justification is by faith alone, apart from works; sanctification is the necessary fruit.
    - Good works do not merit salvation but flow from gratitude for grace received.
    - The confessions guard against confusing the basis of acceptance with the evidence of faith.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s righteousness, not the believer’s progress.
    - "We do good works, but not to merit by them...since it is by faith in Christ that we are justified." (Belgic Confession, Article 24)

5. **The role of the Holy Spirit and means of grace**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of both definitive and progressive sanctification.
    - The means of grace—Word, sacraments, and prayer—are essential for growth in holiness.
    - Sanctification is not self-generated but is God’s work in the believer.
    - The Spirit enables believers to will and to do according to God’s good pleasure.
    - "Faith is kindled in us by the preaching of the gospel and increased by the use of the sacraments." (Belgic Confession, Article 33)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed teaching on **sanctification**, providing a balanced and nuanced account of both its definitive and progressive aspects. Their careful distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** has safeguarded the doctrine of salvation by grace alone while promoting a vibrant, Spirit-empowered pursuit of holiness. These confessions continue to serve as foundational standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring clarity and fidelity in the doctrine of Christian growth.
