# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **sanctification** by emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects within the context of union with Christ. He rejected any notion of perfectionism, instead highlighting the ongoing, dynamic work of the **Holy Spirit** in the believer’s life, rooted in the reality of **justification** and the eschatological tension of the "already/not yet."

- "Sanctification is not a static possession but a dynamic reality in which the believer is continually called to new obedience." (Faith and Sanctification)

## Key Works

- Faith and Sanctification (De Geloof en de Heiliging)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Sanctification
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Justification
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ
- The Return of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Union with Christ**
    - Sanctification is inseparable from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - The definitive break with sin is grounded in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The believer’s new identity is shaped by participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Sanctification is not an autonomous process but flows from Christ’s accomplishment.
    - "Sanctification is always Christological in its orientation." (Faith and Sanctification)

2. **Definitive and Progressive Dimensions**
    - There is a definitive aspect: the believer is set apart at conversion.
    - The progressive aspect involves continual growth in holiness.
    - Both aspects are held together without confusion or separation.
    - The tension reflects the eschatological reality of salvation.
    - "The definitive and progressive are not two sanctifications, but two aspects of the one sanctification." (Faith and Sanctification)

3. **Rejection of Perfectionism**
    - Sanctification does not mean sinless perfection in this life.
    - The believer remains in a state of struggle against sin.
    - Growth in holiness is marked by humility and dependence on grace.
    - Assurance is rooted in Christ, not in subjective achievement.
    - "Sanctification is not a triumphal march, but a struggle in the midst of temptation." (Faith and Sanctification)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of sanctification.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s work to the believer’s life.
    - Sanctification is a work of grace, not human effort alone.
    - The Spirit empowers obedience and transformation.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the dynamic of sanctification." (Faith and Sanctification)

5. **Sanctification and Justification Distinguished but Inseparable**
    - Justification and sanctification are distinct benefits of salvation.
    - Justification is the ground; sanctification is the fruit.
    - Both flow from union with Christ and cannot be separated in the Christian life.
    - Confusing the two leads to legalism or antinomianism.
    - "Sanctification is never the ground of our acceptance, but the necessary consequence of it." (Faith and Sanctification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the Christian life, especially in relation to union with Christ and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. His rejection of perfectionism and emphasis on the eschatological tension of sanctification have provided a robust framework for pastoral ministry and theological reflection. Berkouwer’s influence endures in contemporary discussions on the relationship between justification and sanctification, and his work remains a touchstone for those seeking a balanced, Christ-centered approach to holiness.
