# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **sanctification** is rooted in his distinction between **justification** and sanctification, emphasizing that believers are declared righteous by faith alone while also being transformed by the **Holy Spirit**. He affirms both a **definitive break with sin** at conversion and an ongoing, **progressive renewal** throughout the Christian life, though he never sharply separates these as later Reformed theology does.

- "For faith is a divine work in us, which changes us and makes us to be born anew of God." (Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans)

## Key Works

- Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (1522)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification and Sanctification Distinguished but Inseparable**
    - Justification is by faith alone, apart from works, while sanctification is the fruit of faith.
    - Sanctification flows from union with Christ and is never the ground of acceptance before God.
    - The believer is simultaneously **simul iustus et peccator**—righteous and a sinner.
    - Good works are necessary as evidence of faith, not as a basis for salvation.
    - "Faith, however, is a divine work in us. It changes us and makes us to be born anew of God." (Romans Preface)

2. **Definitive Break with Sin at Conversion**
    - Conversion brings a real, decisive deliverance from the dominion of sin.
    - The believer is set free from the law’s condemnation and the tyranny of the devil.
    - This definitive aspect is grounded in union with Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The Christian’s new identity is as a child of God, no longer enslaved to sin.
    - "Thus a Christian man is the most free lord of all, subject to none." (The Freedom of a Christian)

3. **Progressive Renewal by the Holy Spirit**
    - Sanctification is a lifelong process of being conformed to Christ’s image.
    - The Holy Spirit works inwardly to renew desires, affections, and actions.
    - The old sinful nature remains, leading to ongoing struggle and repentance.
    - Growth in holiness is marked by daily repentance and faith.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given, who renews and sanctifies us." (Large Catechism)

4. **Role of the Means of Grace**
    - The Word and Sacraments are the primary means by which God sanctifies believers.
    - Participation in the church’s ministry sustains and strengthens faith.
    - Baptism signifies both the definitive washing from sin and the ongoing mortification of the flesh.
    - The Lord’s Supper nourishes believers for growth in grace.
    - "For where the Word is, there the Holy Spirit is at work." (Large Catechism)

5. **Sanctification as Daily Repentance**
    - The Christian life is characterized by continual turning from sin and returning to God.
    - Repentance is not a one-time act but a daily necessity.
    - The believer’s progress is marked by humility and dependence on Christ’s righteousness.
    - Assurance is found not in one’s own holiness, but in Christ’s finished work.
    - "Our whole life should be repentance." (First of the 95 Theses)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **sanctification** laid the foundation for later Protestant understandings of the Christian life, especially the distinction between **justification** and sanctification. His emphasis on the ongoing struggle with sin and the necessity of daily repentance shaped Lutheran and broader evangelical piety. While he did not develop a technical doctrine of "definitive" and "progressive" sanctification as in later Reformed theology, his insights remain central to discussions of the believer’s transformation in union with Christ.
