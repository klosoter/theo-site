# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **sanctification** not as a traditional process of moral transformation but as participation in **New Being** through **justification** and existential encounter with the **Ground of Being**. He reframed both **definitive** and **progressive sanctification** in terms of existential estrangement and reunion, emphasizing the ongoing dialectic between alienation and acceptance within the context of **faith** and **grace**.

- "Sanctification is the state of being grasped by the Spiritual Presence and being transformed by it." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Participation in New Being**
    - Sanctification is not primarily ethical improvement but existential transformation.
    - It is rooted in the individual's encounter with the **New Being** in Christ.
    - The process involves overcoming estrangement from the **Ground of Being**.
    - Definitive sanctification is realized in the acceptance of acceptance by God.
    - "Sanctification is the manifestation of the New Being under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Existential Estrangement and Reunion**
    - Human existence is marked by separation from God, self, and others.
    - Sanctification is the movement from estrangement to reunion through grace.
    - This movement is both a definitive event and a continuous process.
    - The dialectic of alienation and reconciliation is central to Tillich's view.
    - "The process of sanctification is the process of reunion with the ground of our being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Role of the Spiritual Presence**
    - The **Spiritual Presence** (Holy Spirit) is the agent of sanctification.
    - The Spirit mediates the power of the **New Being** into the believer's life.
    - Transformation is effected through the presence, not through moral striving alone.
    - The Spirit's work is both definitive (a new reality) and progressive (ongoing renewal).
    - "The Spiritual Presence is the power of sanctification in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Sanctification and Justification Interconnected**
    - Tillich rejects a strict separation between justification and sanctification.
    - Both are aspects of the same existential event: acceptance by God.
    - Definitive sanctification is inseparable from the moment of justification.
    - Progressive sanctification is the unfolding of this acceptance in life.
    - "Justification and sanctification are two sides of the same reality." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Sanctification as Ongoing, Never Complete**
    - Sanctification is always partial and anticipatory in this life.
    - The tension between the old and new being persists until eschatological fulfillment.
    - Progress is real but always provisional, marked by ambiguity and struggle.
    - The final consummation of sanctification lies beyond history.
    - "Sanctification is never finished in time and space; it is always fragmentary." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **sanctification** has influenced both Protestant and ecumenical theology, challenging traditional distinctions between **definitive** and **progressive sanctification**. His focus on the existential dynamics of estrangement and reunion has shaped discussions on the nature of spiritual transformation and the role of the **Spiritual Presence**. While his approach departs from classical Reformed categories, it continues to provoke dialogue on the relationship between **justification**, sanctification, and the human condition.
