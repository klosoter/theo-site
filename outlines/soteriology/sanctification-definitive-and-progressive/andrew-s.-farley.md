# Andrew S. Farley (1972– )

Andrew S. Farley is known for his distinctive approach to **sanctification**, emphasizing the believer’s **definitive sanctification** in Christ and critiquing traditional views of **progressive sanctification**. Farley teaches that Christians are made holy once for all through union with Christ, and that ongoing growth is a matter of discovering and living out this new identity rather than striving for incremental holiness. His perspective challenges common evangelical paradigms by stressing the believer’s **new identity** and **freedom from the law**.

- "We are not progressively getting more sanctified; we are sanctified people learning and growing." 

## Key Works

- The Naked Gospel (2009)
- God Without Religion (2011)
- Relaxing with God (2014)
- The Perfect You (2021)
- Clean and Close (2022)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is Definitive, Not Merely Progressive**
    - Believers are fully sanctified at conversion through union with Christ.
    - Sanctification is a completed status, not a process of becoming holier.
    - Growth involves understanding and living from this new identity, not achieving incremental sanctity.
    - Rejects the idea that sanctification is a gradual transformation of the believer’s core self.
    - "You have been set apart, once for all, by the offering of Jesus Christ." (The Naked Gospel)

2. **Union with Christ as the Basis of Sanctification**
    - The believer’s sanctification is rooted in spiritual union with Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - This union fundamentally changes the believer’s nature and standing before God.
    - Sanctification is not achieved by human effort but received through faith in Christ’s finished work.
    - The believer’s identity is now defined by Christ’s righteousness, not personal performance.
    - "Our closeness to God is a fact, not a feeling, because we are in Christ." (Relaxing with God)

3. **Freedom from the Law**
    - Christians are released from the Mosaic Law as a means of sanctification.
    - The law’s role was to reveal sin, not to empower holy living.
    - Sanctification is not maintained or advanced by law-keeping but by reliance on the Spirit.
    - The new covenant brings a new way of living apart from legalistic striving.
    - "We died to the law so that we might live to God." (God Without Religion)

4. **Progressive Growth as Mind Renewal, Not Increased Holiness**
    - Growth in the Christian life is about renewing the mind to align with the truth of the gospel.
    - The believer’s core identity does not change; what changes is understanding and behavior.
    - Spiritual maturity is marked by deeper trust in Christ’s sufficiency, not by becoming more sanctified.
    - The process is one of learning, not earning or achieving more holiness.
    - "We are learning who we already are in Jesus." (The Perfect You)

5. **Assurance and Security in Sanctification**
    - The believer’s sanctification is secure and unchangeable because it is grounded in Christ’s finished work.
    - Assurance flows from recognizing one’s permanent status as holy and righteous in Christ.
    - Sanctification is not lost or diminished by failure or sin.
    - Encourages believers to rest in their secure identity rather than fear losing sanctification.
    - "You are as safe and close to God as Jesus is, because you are in Him." (Clean and Close)

## Legacy and Impact

Farley’s teaching on **definitive sanctification** has sparked significant discussion within evangelical circles, especially among those questioning traditional models of progressive sanctification. His emphasis on the believer’s **new identity in Christ** and freedom from legalism has influenced many seeking assurance and rest in the Christian life. While his views are controversial and often critiqued by Reformed theologians, Farley’s work continues to shape conversations about the nature of sanctification and the believer’s relationship to the law.
