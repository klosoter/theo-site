# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **sanctification** is rooted in his understanding of **grace**, **regeneration**, and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He emphasizes that sanctification is both a definitive act—whereby the believer is set apart through **union with Christ**—and a progressive process, as the Christian grows in holiness throughout life by the power of **divine grace**.

- "Give what you command, and command what you will." (Confessions, X.29)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- On Nature and Grace
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification Begins with Regeneration**
   - The believer is definitively set apart at the moment of **regeneration**.
   - This initial sanctification is a work of **God’s sovereign grace**, not human effort.
   - Augustine links this to the **gift of the Holy Spirit** in baptism.
   - The old self is crucified, marking a real change in the believer’s status.
   - "For it is by God’s gift that man becomes good, so that he may do good." (On Nature and Grace, 26)

2. **Sanctification is Progressive**
   - Growth in holiness continues throughout the Christian life.
   - The believer remains in a state of conflict with **concupiscence** and sin.
   - Progress is possible only through continual dependence on **grace**.
   - The process is never complete in this life, requiring perseverance.
   - "The whole life of a good Christian is a holy longing." (Confessions, X.29)

3. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
   - Human will is insufficient for sanctification apart from **divine aid**.
   - Grace both initiates and sustains the believer’s growth in holiness.
   - Even the desire for holiness is itself a gift from God.
   - Augustine rejects any notion of **Pelagian self-sufficiency**.
   - "Without God’s help, man cannot be justified, nor can he live rightly." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 3)

4. **Role of the Law and the Spirit**
   - The **law** reveals sin but cannot empower obedience.
   - The **Holy Spirit** enables the believer to fulfill the law’s demands.
   - Sanctification involves an inward transformation, not mere external conformity.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling produces genuine love and virtue.
   - "The law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 21)

5. **Sanctification and Perseverance**
   - Final sanctification is inseparable from the gift of **perseverance**.
   - God alone preserves the believer in faith and holiness until the end.
   - Assurance rests not in self, but in God’s unchanging promise.
   - The church and sacraments are means by which God sustains sanctification.
   - "He who endures to the end shall be saved, but it is God who makes us endure." (Enchiridion, 32)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **sanctification** as both definitive and progressive profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in the doctrines of **grace** and the **Christian life**. His rejection of Pelagianism established the necessity of divine initiative in all aspects of salvation. Later theologians, including the Reformers, drew heavily on Augustine’s insights into the interplay of grace, will, and perseverance, making his work foundational for ongoing discussions of sanctification in both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
