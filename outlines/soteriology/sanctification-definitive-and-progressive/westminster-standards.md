# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **sanctification** that distinguishes between its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. Rooted in union with Christ, sanctification is described as a work of **God’s free grace** whereby believers are set apart from sin and enabled to pursue **holiness** throughout their lives, with definitive sanctification marking a decisive break from the dominion of sin and progressive sanctification involving continual growth in grace.

- "They, who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart, and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them." (Westminster Confession of Faith 13.1)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Work of God’s Free Grace**
    - Sanctification is not an act of human will but a work initiated and sustained by God.
    - It is grounded in the believer’s union with Christ and the application of redemption.
    - The Holy Spirit is the principal agent, applying Christ’s benefits to the elect.
    - Human effort is real but always subordinate to divine grace.
    - "Sanctification is a work of God’s free grace..." (Westminster Shorter Catechism 35)

2. **Definitive Sanctification: Break with Sin’s Dominion**
    - At regeneration, believers are definitively set apart from the reign of sin.
    - There is a real, objective change in status and relationship to sin.
    - This break is rooted in Christ’s death and resurrection applied to the believer.
    - Definitive sanctification marks the beginning of a new life in holiness.
    - "They are... enabled more and more to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness." (WCF 13.1)

3. **Progressive Sanctification: Ongoing Growth in Holiness**
    - Sanctification is also a lifelong process of being renewed after the image of God.
    - Believers are enabled to mortify sin and cultivate the fruits of the Spirit.
    - Progress is often gradual and involves continual struggle against remaining corruption.
    - The process is never complete in this life but advances through means of grace.
    - "The whole man is sanctified, yet imperfectly in this life..." (WCF 13.2)

4. **Role of the Means of Grace**
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are the ordinary means by which sanctification is advanced.
    - The Spirit works through these means to strengthen faith and obedience.
    - Participation in the visible church is essential for growth in holiness.
    - The means of grace are necessary but not automatically effective apart from the Spirit’s work.
    - "The Spirit applies to us the redemption purchased by Christ, by working faith in us..." (WSC 30)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance in Sanctification**
    - True believers will persevere in sanctification, though not without setbacks.
    - Assurance of sanctification is possible, grounded in God’s promises and the evidence of grace.
    - The struggle with indwelling sin remains, but it does not ultimately defeat the believer.
    - Final perfection is attained only at glorification, not in this life.
    - "There abideth still some remnants of corruption in every part..." (WCF 13.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on sanctification, providing a clear distinction between its definitive and progressive aspects. Their articulation of sanctification as both a decisive act and an ongoing process has influenced confessional documents and pastoral practice across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The emphasis on the means of grace and the role of the Holy Spirit remains foundational for contemporary discussions of Christian growth and holiness.
