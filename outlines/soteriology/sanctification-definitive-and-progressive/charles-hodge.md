# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of sanctification**, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects. He maintained that believers are set apart in Christ at conversion (**definitive sanctification**) and are continually renewed in holiness throughout their lives (**progressive sanctification**) by the work of the **Holy Spirit** through the means of grace.

- "Sanctification, in the scriptural sense of the term, is not only a separation from sin, but a real transformation of the soul." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is both definitive and progressive**
    - Believers are definitively set apart at regeneration, marking a real change in status.
    - Progressive sanctification involves a lifelong process of growth in holiness.
    - Both aspects are inseparable and grounded in union with Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures sanctification is not merely moral improvement but spiritual transformation.
    - "Sanctification, therefore, includes both the idea of consecration to God and the idea of inward cleansing." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause of sanctification in the believer.
    - Human effort is subordinate to the Spirit’s sovereign activity.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemption to the believer’s life.
    - Sanctification is not self-generated but divinely wrought.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who dwells in all believers, and who is the source of all spiritual life and strength." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Means of grace are essential for growth**
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are the primary means by which sanctification is advanced.
    - The Spirit works through these means to conform believers to Christ.
    - Neglect of the means of grace hinders progressive sanctification.
    - The church community supports and encourages sanctification.
    - "The means of sanctification are the truth, the sacraments, and prayer." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Sanctification is distinct from justification**
    - Justification is a legal declaration; sanctification is a moral and spiritual transformation.
    - The two are inseparable but must not be confused.
    - Sanctification follows justification and is evidence of true faith.
    - Assurance of salvation is strengthened by the fruits of sanctification.
    - "Justification is a forensic act; sanctification is a moral or spiritual work." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Sanctification involves human responsibility**
    - Believers are called to actively pursue holiness in dependence on God’s grace.
    - Mortification of sin and vivification of righteousness are ongoing duties.
    - The believer’s will is renewed and enabled by the Spirit to obey God’s law.
    - Growth in sanctification is marked by increasing conformity to Christ.
    - "The believer is required to work, because God works in him to will and to do." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **definitive and progressive sanctification** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in American Presbyterianism. His careful distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** helped clarify debates on assurance and Christian living. Hodge’s emphasis on the **means of grace** and the Spirit’s role continues to shape evangelical and Reformed discussions of holiness. His legacy endures in systematic theology and pastoral practice, providing a robust framework for understanding the believer’s growth in grace.
