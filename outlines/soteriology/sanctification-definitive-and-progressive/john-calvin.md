# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **sanctification** is grounded in union with Christ, emphasizing both a **definitive break with sin** and the ongoing, **progressive renewal** of the believer. He insists that all who are justified are also sanctified, with the **Holy Spirit** effecting real transformation in the Christian’s life, leading to increasing **conformity to Christ**.

- "Christ justifies no one whom he does not at the same time sanctify." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.16.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 3–10)
- Calvin’s Commentaries on Romans (notably Romans 6 and 8)
- Sermons on Ephesians
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition)
- Calvin and the Reformation: His Influence on the Modern World (ed. William J. Bouwsma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification flows from union with Christ**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, which is the source of all spiritual blessings.
    - Sanctification is inseparable from justification, both being benefits of union with Christ.
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s work, making believers partakers in his death and resurrection.
    - This union initiates both the definitive and progressive aspects of sanctification.
    - "We receive this grace by being made partakers of Christ, by whom we are both justified and sanctified." (Institutes 3.11.1)

2. **Definitive sanctification: a real break with sin**
    - At conversion, believers experience a decisive liberation from the dominion of sin.
    - This break is rooted in Christ’s death and resurrection, applied by the Spirit.
    - The old self is crucified, and a new principle of life is implanted.
    - This definitive aspect is the foundation for ongoing growth in holiness.
    - "We are restored by the grace of Christ to righteousness, from which we fell through Adam." (Institutes 2.1.1)

3. **Progressive sanctification: continual growth in holiness**
    - Sanctification is a lifelong process of being renewed in the image of God.
    - The Spirit continually mortifies sin and vivifies new obedience in believers.
    - Christians are called to strive for holiness, though perfection is not attained in this life.
    - Progress is marked by increasing conformity to Christ and the fruit of the Spirit.
    - "The restoration of the image of God in us is not accomplished in one moment, or in one day, or in one year; but by continual, and sometimes even slow advances." (Institutes 3.3.9)

4. **Necessity of sanctification for all believers**
    - Sanctification is not optional but an inevitable result of true faith.
    - There is no justification without sanctification; both are gifts of grace.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of genuine faith, not its basis.
    - Assurance is strengthened as believers see the Spirit’s work in their lives.
    - "Christ does not bestow free justification upon us in order that we should indulge in sin, but that we should live in righteousness and purity." (Commentary on Romans 6:1)

5. **Role of the law and means of grace**
    - The moral law guides believers in the path of sanctification.
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are means by which the Spirit sanctifies.
    - The law convicts of sin and drives believers to Christ, while also instructing in holiness.
    - The church community supports and encourages growth in grace.
    - "The law is a kind of mirror in which we discover our weaknesses, and, after considering them, betake ourselves to the grace of Christ." (Institutes 2.7.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **sanctification** has profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, emphasizing both the definitive and progressive aspects of the believer’s transformation. His insistence on the inseparability of **justification and sanctification** remains a hallmark of Reformed soteriology. Calvin’s teaching continues to influence discussions on the Christian life, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the pursuit of holiness within the church.
