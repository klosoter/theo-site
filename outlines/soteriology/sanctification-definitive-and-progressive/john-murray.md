# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a distinctive and influential account of **sanctification**, emphasizing both its **definitive** and **progressive** aspects within the framework of **union with Christ**. He argued that sanctification is not merely a gradual process but also involves a decisive break with the power of sin, grounded in the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.

- "Definitive sanctification is a once-for-all act, but it is not the end of sanctification; it is the beginning." ("Definitive Sanctification," Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Definitive Sanctification" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- Principles of Conduct
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- Collected Writings of John Murray

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is both definitive and progressive**
    - Definitive sanctification marks a radical, once-for-all break with the dominion of sin.
    - Progressive sanctification is the ongoing work of the Spirit conforming believers to Christ.
    - Both aspects are inseparably connected in the believer’s life.
    - The distinction clarifies the believer’s new status and ongoing transformation.
    - "Sanctification is a process that begins with a definitive act and continues throughout the life of the believer." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Union with Christ as the foundation**
    - Sanctification flows from the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - This union is both judicial and vital, affecting status and life.
    - All benefits of redemption, including sanctification, are applied through this union.
    - The believer’s identity is fundamentally altered by participation in Christ.
    - "It is in Christ and through union with him that the power of sin is broken." ("Definitive Sanctification," Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies Christ’s work to the believer.
    - The Spirit enables both the initial break with sin and ongoing growth in holiness.
    - Human effort is real but always dependent on the Spirit’s enabling power.
    - The Spirit’s work is both monergistic in the definitive aspect and synergistic in the progressive.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and it is by his indwelling that we are sanctified." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Sanctification involves mortification and vivification**
    - Mortification is the putting to death of sinful desires and practices.
    - Vivification is the bringing to life of new obedience and godly affections.
    - Both are necessary and ongoing in the Christian life.
    - This dynamic is rooted in the believer’s participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - "Sanctification consists in the mortification of sin and the vivification of the new life." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Sanctification is inseparable from justification but distinct**
    - Justification and sanctification are both benefits of union with Christ.
    - Justification is a declarative act; sanctification is transformative.
    - The two must not be confused, but neither can they be separated in the believer’s experience.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are grounded in the reality of both.
    - "Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of salvation in Christ." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **definitive sanctification** has significantly shaped Reformed theology, clarifying the believer’s decisive break with sin and the ongoing process of growth in holiness. His careful distinction between definitive and progressive aspects has influenced generations of pastors and theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. By rooting sanctification in **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**, Murray provided a robust framework that continues to inform contemporary discussions on the Christian life.
