# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, a foundational figure in **Reformed biblical theology**, strongly affirmed the classic doctrine of **justification by faith alone** and was critical of any movement, such as the **Federal Vision**, that blurred the distinction between **law and gospel** or compromised the **imputed righteousness of Christ**. Vos insisted that **union with Christ** is the context for justification, but maintained that justification is a forensic act, not based on works or covenantal faithfulness.

- "The act of justification is a declarative act of God, pronouncing the sinner righteous on the ground of Christ’s righteousness, received by faith alone." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Soteriology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic and declarative**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - It is grounded solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which justification is received.
    - Any addition of works or covenantal faithfulness undermines the gospel.
    - "Justification is not a making righteous, but a declaring righteous." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Law and gospel distinction is essential**
    - The law reveals the standard of righteousness and the need for grace.
    - The gospel proclaims the provision of righteousness in Christ.
    - Blurring law and gospel leads to confusion about the basis of acceptance with God.
    - The Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness risks conflating these categories.
    - "The gospel is not an improvement of the law, but a new principle altogether." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Union with Christ is the context, not the ground, of justification**
    - Union with Christ encompasses all benefits of salvation, including justification.
    - Justification is distinct within the ordo salutis as a forensic benefit.
    - The ground of justification remains Christ’s obedience, not our covenantal status.
    - Federal Vision’s redefinition of union risks collapsing justification into sanctification.
    - "Union with Christ is the source of every saving blessing, but justification retains its forensic character." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Covenant theology upholds sola fide**
    - The covenant of grace is administered through faith alone, not works.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** must be distinguished.
    - Federal Vision’s monocovenantalism undermines the Reformed law/gospel contrast.
    - Faithfulness is the fruit, not the instrument, of justification.
    - "The Reformed doctrine of the covenant preserves the gratuitous character of salvation." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

5. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness is central**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is imputed to believers.
    - Imputation is not merely covenantal inclusion but a legal reckoning.
    - Any denial of imputation undermines assurance and the gospel itself.
    - Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenant membership risks neglecting imputation.
    - "The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is the heart of the gospel." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust defense of **justification by faith alone** and his careful articulation of the **law/gospel distinction** have shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially in response to movements like the Federal Vision. His biblical-theological method provided a framework for understanding justification within the unfolding of redemptive history, while maintaining its forensic and gracious character. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary debates, safeguarding the centrality of **imputed righteousness** and the integrity of the Reformed doctrine of justification.
