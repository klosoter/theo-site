# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann, a leading figure in twentieth-century **New Testament scholarship**, approached the doctrine of **justification by faith** through the lens of existential interpretation and **demythologization**. While not directly engaged with the **Federal Vision** controversy, Bultmann’s views on **faith**, **justification**, and the **kerygma** challenge traditional Reformed categories by emphasizing existential encounter over forensic categories and covenantal frameworks.

- "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept the divine judgment." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Existential Event**
    - Justification is not a legal declaration but an existential transformation.
    - Faith is understood as personal trust and openness to God’s word.
    - The encounter with the **kerygma** brings about a new self-understanding.
    - Traditional forensic categories are reinterpreted through existential philosophy.
    - "Justification is not a change in man's status before God, but a change in his existence." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologization of Pauline Doctrine**
    - Biblical language about justification is mythological and must be reinterpreted.
    - The Pauline doctrine is seen as expressing existential realities, not metaphysical truths.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind ancient formulations.
    - The focus is on the individual's response to the proclaimed word.
    - "Mythological statements must be interpreted existentially." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Faith as Response to the Kerygma**
    - Faith arises from hearing the proclamation of Christ.
    - It is not assent to doctrine but an existential decision.
    - Faith involves a radical reorientation of life.
    - The act of faith is inseparable from obedience.
    - "Faith is the act in which man gives up every security and basis for boasting." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Rejection of Objective Covenant Structures**
    - Bultmann does not ground justification in covenantal or ecclesial frameworks.
    - The individual's encounter with God is primary, not corporate identity.
    - Sacramental or covenantal means of grace are de-emphasized.
    - The existential moment of faith transcends institutional mediation.
    - "The church is not the bearer of salvation, but the place where the word is proclaimed." ("Faith and Understanding")

5. **Critique of Forensic and Federal Categories**
    - Forensic/legal metaphors are seen as inadequate for expressing the gospel’s existential claim.
    - The Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenant objectivity is foreign to Bultmann’s approach.
    - Justification is not about status before God but about authentic existence.
    - Theological categories must be reinterpreted for modern existential understanding.
    - "The real question is not about legal status, but about authentic existence before God." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential interpretation of **justification by faith** profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in its move away from traditional **Reformed** and covenantal categories. His emphasis on the **kerygma** and existential decision challenged both confessional and contemporary approaches, including those found in the Federal Vision debate. While his views are often critiqued by Reformed theologians, Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in discussions about the meaning of faith, justification, and the relevance of biblical language for modern believers.
