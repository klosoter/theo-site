### ESSAY
The controversy over Federal Vision and justification by faith exposes fault lines within contemporary Reformed theology at precisely the point where Westminster examiners will press most intensely: how **covenant theology**, **union with Christ**, and the doctrine of **justification by faith alone** cohere without collapsing into either antinomianism or a form of final justification on the basis of works. To handle this well one must disentangle the historical development that made Federal Vision plausible, assess the theological moves of its principal advocates, and then defend a position that is both confessionally rigorous and pastorally credible.

The most decisive starting point is Norman Shepherd, whose teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary in the 1970s and early 1980s created the immediate prehistory of the Federal Vision. Shepherd did not use the label “Federal Vision,” yet his proposals reconfigured the grammar of justification that later Federal Vision authors would adopt and radicalize. His critique of a sharp **law–gospel** contrast, his formulation that justification is “by faith in union with Christ” and that this faith is “obedient faith,” and his frontal denial of the imputation of Christ’s active obedience all contributed to a trajectory in which the classic Reformed notion of a once‑for‑all forensic verdict grounded in Christ’s imputed righteousness was functionally displaced by a more holistic or relational account of acceptance with God.

Shepherd’s method combined a biblicist appeal to James, Romans, and covenantal themes with a suspicion that classical Reformed exegesis had been unduly shaped by Lutheran dichotomies and scholastic categories. His 1979 “Thirty‑Four Theses on Justification in Relation to Faith, Repentance, and Good Works” asserted that faith is “active in obedience” and that “good works…are necessary for salvation.” When pressed by colleagues, Shepherd insisted he was not teaching justification by works but a necessary obedience within the covenant condition of faith. The internal debate at Westminster, culminating in his dismissal in 1982, revealed the core tension: can one say that works are “necessary for salvation” and that justification is “through faith and the obedience of faith” without undermining **sola fide** as confessed in Westminster Confession 11 and Larger Catechism 70–73

Examiner‑style challenge will push here: did Shepherd deny justification by faith alone in a formal, confessional sense, or only in a materially dangerous sense To answer, one must observe that Shepherd explicitly rejected the idea that works contribute any meritorious ground. His rejection was formal. However, he altered the instrumentality of faith and the finality of justification. By folding works into the condition of salvation under the term “obedient faith,” he effectively denied that faith as receiving and resting on Christ alone is sufficient as the sole instrument of justification. Moreover, by downplaying the once‑for‑all character of justification and the distinctness of sanctification, he made room for a scheme in which perseverance in obedience functions as an ongoing condition for retaining the justified status. Even where a teacher denies merit, the confessional concern is that the function of works has shifted from evidential to conditional. On that point, Shepherd’s formulations fall outside confessional Reformed bounds.

Norman Shepherd’s ideas later intersected with the Federal Vision movement that emerged around the 2002 “Auburn Avenue Pastors Conference.” Among Federal Vision leaders, Douglas Wilson has been the most influential popularizer, synthesizer, and defender. Wilson’s work, especially in books like “Reformed Is Not Enough” and his participation in the 2007 “Joint Federal Vision Profession of Faith,” articulates the Federal Vision emphasis on **covenant objectivity**. The baptized person, Wilson argues, is not to be regarded as merely externally related to Christ but truly united to him in the covenant. Baptism confers “real, vital union with Christ,” though not all the baptized persevere. This move aims to recover a robust ecclesial and sacramental theology against revivalistic individualism and Baptist subjectivism.

Wilson’s most controversial point, however, lies in how this **covenantal objectivity** interfaces with justification. On the one hand, Wilson explicitly denies that he teaches Rome’s infused righteousness or that works contribute to the ground of justification. He affirms, in his own terms, a forensic justification. On the other hand, his formulations introduce a distinction between an initial justification and a final justification that overtly consider works. He will say that faith alone justifies, but that the faith which justifies is living, obedient, and that final judgment will be “in accordance with” or “according to” works in a way that can sound like a second, eschatological justification that takes works into its ratio.

Examiners may press: how does this differ from classic Reformed teaching that we are justified by faith alone but judged according to works One must distinguish: the Reformed tradition has always affirmed that good works are necessary as the fruit and evidence of true faith and that they will be considered in the public vindication of believers at the last day. But this “judgment according to works” does not introduce a second instrument or basis of justification. The same **justifying righteousness of Christ** imputed and received by faith alone in this life is the sole ground on which believers are accepted in the final assize. Works manifest the reality of union with Christ; they do not complete or co‑constitute the justifying verdict. Federal Vision formulations frequently blur this line. By integrating faith and faithfulness into a single condition for both covenant membership and eschatological salvation, Wilson and others functionally relocate assurance from a once‑for‑all forensic declaration to an ongoing assessment of covenant loyalty.

A third decisive figure is N. T. Wright, whose New Perspective on Paul is not organically Federal Vision but supplies key conceptual tools. Wright redefines **justification** primarily as the declaration that one is a member of the covenant family, a verdict rendered on the basis of faith in the present but reaffirmed in the final judgment “on the basis of the whole life lived.” For Wright, “the righteousness of God” is his covenant faithfulness, not a moral status imputed to the believer. The “righteousness” of the believer is a law‑court verdict that one is in the right as part of the people of God. While Wright is an Anglican bishop and not a Reformed confessional theologian, his work appealed to some Federal Vision advocates because it made justification an ecclesial and covenantal category and gave theological weight to future judgment according to works.

The external debate here is crucial. Classic Roman Catholic theology teaches an infused righteousness in which faith formed by love is the formal cause of justification, and justification is inherently transformative and progressive. The New Perspective, represented by Wright, denies imputation and treats justification as declarative, but relocates the center from God’s reckoning of Christ’s obedience to the believer to God’s declaration of covenant membership in Christ. Federal Vision theologians, drawing sometimes on Wright, sometimes on Shepherd, try to combine a forensic declaration with a covenantal ontology in which union with Christ is sacramentally conferred and maintained through faithful obedience.

The Reformed confessional position, which I defend, insists on the **imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience** as the only ground of justification, received by **faith alone** as a purely receptive, non‑working instrument. Here John Murray becomes a decisive figure, because his nuanced work on **union with Christ** and **definitive sanctification** has sometimes been recruited, selectively, by those sympathetic to Federal Vision. Murray in “The Epistle to the Romans” and “Redemption Accomplished and Applied” insisted that union with Christ is the central soteriological reality from which justification, adoption, and sanctification all flow. He also warned against separating justification and sanctification as if they were entirely distinct benefits. Some have argued that this opens the way to a more integrative view of justification and transformation.

Yet Murray also defended with great care the forensic character of justification and the necessity of **imputed righteousness**. For Murray, union with Christ is the overarching relation, but within that relation justification remains a distinct, once‑for‑all act of God’s free grace. Faith is the instrument of justification precisely as receiving and resting on Christ, not as including works. When Murray spoke of the inseparability of justification and sanctification, he was stressing that union with Christ necessarily brings both, not that the one is conditioned on the other. To invoke Murray against confessional **sola fide** is therefore a misuse of his work. His thought shows that one can affirm robust union and definitive sanctification while preserving an uncompromised forensic justification.

Cornelis Venema, a contemporary Reformed theologian and churchman, is decisive as a systematic critic of both New Perspective and Federal Vision from within the Dutch Reformed tradition. Venema’s works, including “The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ” and essays on covenant theology, articulate a careful reading of the Three Forms of Unity on **covenant of grace**, **election**, and **perseverance**. He argues that Federal Vision’s talk of “covenantal election” and “temporary union with Christ” confuses the confessional distinction between **decretal election** and outward membership in the covenant community. While Reformed theology has always acknowledged an internal–external distinction within the covenant, it has not spoken of reprobate persons being united to Christ in such a way that they are justified, adopted, and then later apostatize from these benefits. That language threatens the doctrines of perseverance and the indefectibility of grace in the elect.

Here the internal debate within the Reformed tradition about the relation of covenant and election comes into focus. Some, especially in the Dutch tradition, emphasize a close coordination of covenant and election, arguing that the covenant of grace is the historical administration of God’s eternal decree to save the elect. Others give a more expansive account of the covenant that includes non‑elect in a fuller sense, speaking of “covenantal election” and “covenantal union” that can be lost. Federal Vision radicalizes this second tendency. But the Westminster Standards and the Three Forms carefully preserve a hierarchy: not all in the administration of the covenant are elect, and though non‑elect members receive real **covenantal privileges** and even some operations of the Spirit, they never share savingly in union with Christ or justification. To say otherwise is to attribute to Christ a union that fails to save and to sever the bond between union and perseverance.

Examiners will often ask: does Federal Vision actually teach a loss of justification or only a loss of covenant status The honest answer, drawn from their own formulations, is that Federal Vision teachers frequently speak in ways that imply the former. They say that the baptized are “justified,” “united to Christ,” and “adopted” in the covenant, and that those who apostatize fall from these realities. If pressed, some will retreat to saying that these were only covenantal in a provisional sense. Yet the effect is to devalue the confessional meanings of justification and union. The Reformed confessions treat justification as inseparable from definitive transfer from death to life and as infallibly connected to perseverance. Any theological scheme that normalizes loss of “justification” is at odds with this.

Another line of internal debate concerns the **law–gospel distinction**. Federal Vision voices tend to reject any strong contrast between law and gospel, preferring to view the covenant as one gracious arrangement with conditions of faithfulness throughout. Norman Shepherd already attacked a Lutheran‑influenced law–gospel hermeneutic as foreign to Scripture. Some Federal Vision teaching, in reaction to a perceived antinomianism, collapses law and gospel into a single covenantal path of obedience‑in‑faith. By contrast, classic Reformed theology, while more nuanced than some Lutheran formulations, nevertheless maintains a real distinction. **Law** in its covenant of works aspect demands perfect, personal obedience as the condition of life. **Gospel** announces that this obedience has been fulfilled by Christ as the second Adam and is imputed to us through faith apart from works. The moral law continues in its third use as a rule of life for the justified, but never reenters as a condition for attaining or retaining justification.

If an examiner asks whether one can affirm the third use of the law robustly without Federal Vision, the answer is unequivocally yes. The Reformed Orthodox already taught that faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone, being always accompanied by all other saving graces. That is Westminster Confession 11.2. The necessity of good works is not grounded in their instrumental role in justification but in God’s ordained way of sanctifying and assuring his people. Antinomianism is resisted not by modifying justification but by expounding union with Christ, regeneration, and the internal work of the Spirit.

A further contemporary layer involves pastoral practice and sacramental theology. Federal Vision rightly criticizes a form of evangelicalism that treats the church as a voluntary association and sacraments as mere symbols. Its emphasis on **covenant objectivity** has pressed some Reformed churches to recover a stronger doctrine of the means of grace. The response should not be to retreat into a purely invisible‑church ecclesiology or a quasi‑Zwinglian sacramentalism. Rather, a confessional Reformed stance can affirm that baptism truly incorporates into the visible church, that the Supper truly communicates Christ to faith through the Spirit, and that the covenant offers Christ to all within its administration. Yet to avoid Federal Vision confusions, we must maintain that sacramental union is not identical with saving union, and that the efficacy of the sacraments is tied to **election** and faith, not automatically conferred by external participation.

Behind all these debates stands the anchoring doctrine of **divine simplicity** and the coherence of God’s saving work. If God’s decree is simple and immutable, and if the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable, then any account of covenant and justification must reflect that unity. Federal Vision theology tends to fragment God’s work into a decretal level and a covenantal level such that the latter can be reversed without touching the former. That move might seem to protect unconditional election, but it introduces a practical dualism that erodes assurance. Believers are left to wonder whether they enjoy only provisional, covenantal benefits that may be lost. Confessional Reformed theology, by contrast, insists that the covenant of grace is the historical form of God’s eternal purpose, and that those who are truly united to Christ can never be finally cast out. The warning passages address hypocrites and self‑deceived within the covenant community and function as means to secure the perseverance of the elect, not as descriptions of elect persons losing justification.

The position I defend, then, can be summarized as follows. First, justification is a once‑for‑all, forensic act of God whereby he pardons all our sins and accepts us as righteous in his sight only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us and received by **faith alone**. Second, this justifying verdict is grounded entirely in the **active and passive obedience of Christ** as the second Adam, fulfilling the covenant of works and bearing its curse in our place. Third, faith is the sole instrument of justification precisely as receiving and resting, though it is never alone but always accompanied by repentance and good works as fruits. Fourth, union with Christ is the comprehensive soteriological reality from which justification and sanctification both flow, but these benefits remain distinct in nature and in the role of works. Fifth, the covenant of grace is the historical outworking of God’s eternal election, embracing both elect and non‑elect in its administration, but only the elect receive its saving substance. Sixth, sacraments truly offer and communicate Christ by the Spirit to the elect, yet they do not confer justification or union ex opere operato.

Against Federal Vision, this position rejects talk of covenantal justification and union that can be lost, denies any formulation that makes works co‑instrumental or co‑conditional with faith for justification, and resists attempts to redefine justification as primarily covenantal membership rather than a divine judicial verdict. It welcomes Federal Vision’s desire to strengthen ecclesiology and sacramental piety but insists these goods must be pursued within the bounds of **sola fide** and the confessional doctrine of **covenant theology**. When challenged whether such a stance is merely Lutheranizing or overly scholastic, one should respond by pointing to Reformed confessions and theologians like Calvin, Turretin, and Murray, who all harmonize rich covenantal and union motifs with an uncompromised forensic justification.

In an oral defense, the key is to show that one understands Federal Vision sympathetically enough to represent it accurately but critically enough to expose its divergences. One should be able to describe how Shepherd’s theology of obedient faith, Wilson’s covenant objectivity, Wright’s covenantal justification, and Venema’s confessional critique interlock in a live controversy about the gospel itself. Above all, one must demonstrate the ability to articulate and defend **justification by faith alone** as the articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae, in organic relation to **union with Christ**, **covenant of grace**, and **perseverance of the saints**, safeguarding both the freeness of grace and the necessity of holiness without allowing obedience to invade the ground or instrument of our righteous standing before God.

### RECAP NOTES

  - Contemporary: ecclesial discipline of Federal Vision proponents, confessional integrity in Reformed churches, pastoral handling of assurance and apostasy.  
- Defended position: Classic confessional Reformed **sola fide** with **imputed righteousness of Christ**, faith as the sole instrument of justification, inviolable union with Christ and perseverance of the elect, robust but non‑automatic means of grace, and a clear distinction between **decretal election** and broader **covenantal membership**.  
- Likely examiner questions:  
  - Did Shepherd formally deny justification by faith alone? → He denied meritorious works but materially undermined **sola fide** by redefining faith and making works conditionally necessary for salvation.  
  - How is “judgment according to works” compatible with sola fide? → Works are evidential, not instrumental or co‑conditional; the ground of acceptance remains Christ’s righteousness alone.  
  - Can someone truly justified fall away? → No; true justification and saving union are inseparable from perseverance, though covenant members without saving faith can apostatize.  
  - Is a strong law–gospel distinction necessary in Reformed theology? → Yes, as a covenantal distinction between works‑principle and grace‑principle, while retaining the third use of the law.  
  - How does baptism relate to union with Christ? → Baptism truly incorporates into the visible church and offers Christ, but saving union is by the Spirit through faith, not conferred infallibly to all baptized.
