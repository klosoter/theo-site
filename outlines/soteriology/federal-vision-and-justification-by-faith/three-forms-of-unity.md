# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of justification by faith alone**. They sharply distinguish **justification** from **sanctification**, grounding acceptance with God solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ** received by **faith apart from works**. The Federal Vision movement’s views on covenant and justification stand in tension with these confessions’ insistence on the forensic, gracious, and exclusive character of justification.

- "We are justified by faith alone, or by faith apart from works." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 22–24
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 21, 56, 59–61
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–II
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected editions)
- Cornelis P. Venema, The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ (secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is by faith alone**
    - Justification is a **forensic act** whereby God declares sinners righteous solely for Christ’s sake.
    - Faith is the **sole instrument** of justification, not faith plus works or faithfulness.
    - Works are categorically excluded as any ground or instrument of justification.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on Christ’s merits, not human performance.
    - "How are you righteous before God? Only by true faith in Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

2. **Imputed righteousness of Christ**
    - Christ’s righteousness is **imputed** to believers, not infused or inherent.
    - Believers are accepted before God only because of Christ’s obedience and satisfaction.
    - Human works, even those done after regeneration, cannot contribute to justification.
    - The ground of justification is entirely outside the believer (extra nos).
    - "His merits and perfect holiness are as if they were our own." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

3. **Faith is a gift, not a work**
    - Faith itself is a gift of God, produced by the Holy Spirit through the gospel.
    - Faith is not a meritorious work or a condition that earns justification.
    - Faith receives and rests upon Christ, not upon itself or its fruits.
    - The act of believing does not justify; rather, Christ justifies, and faith is the means of receiving Him.
    - "Faith is only the instrument by which we embrace Christ." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

4. **Good works are the fruit, not the basis, of justification**
    - Good works necessarily flow from true faith but do not contribute to justification.
    - Sanctification and justification are inseparably joined but must be distinguished.
    - The believer’s good works are always imperfect and cannot withstand God’s judgment.
    - Assurance and acceptance are not grounded in works but in Christ alone.
    - "Our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 24)

5. **Covenant and perseverance are gracious, not conditional upon works**
    - The covenant of grace is established and maintained by God’s sovereign mercy.
    - Perseverance in faith is the result of God’s preservation, not human effort or covenantal faithfulness.
    - The elect cannot lose justification, for it is grounded in Christ’s finished work.
    - Any teaching that makes covenant membership or final justification contingent on works is rejected.
    - "God preserves, continues, and perfects His work by the hearing and reading of His Word, by meditation thereon, and by the exhortations, threatenings, and promises thereof." (Canons of Dort, V.14)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided the definitive confessional standard for Reformed churches in the Netherlands and beyond, shaping the doctrine of **justification by faith alone** for centuries. Their clear distinction between justification and sanctification stands as a bulwark against any teaching—such as the Federal Vision—that blurs the line between faith and works in the believer’s standing before God. These confessions continue to serve as a touchstone for evaluating contemporary debates on **covenant theology** and the nature of saving faith. Their influence remains central in the ongoing defense of the **Reformed doctrine of justification**.
