# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **justification by faith alone** in opposition to both Roman Catholic and later heterodox views. He insisted on the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** as the sole ground of acceptance before God, sharply distinguishing between **faith as the instrument** and **works as the evidence** of justification. Turretin’s formulations stand in marked contrast to the later **Federal Vision** movement, which he would have viewed as a departure from classic Reformed orthodoxy.

- "We are justified before God... not by our own works or merits, but only by the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, imputed to us by God and received by faith alone." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (vol. 2, esp. topics on justification)
- The Doctrine of Justification (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)
- The Covenant of Grace (sections within Institutes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
    - Justification is a forensic act, not a process of moral transformation.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which believers receive Christ’s righteousness.
    - Works play no role in the ground or instrumentality of justification.
    - The distinction between justification and sanctification is essential and must not be blurred.
    - "Faith justifies not as a work, nor as a virtue, but only as an instrument by which we apprehend Christ." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is imputed to believers.
    - Imputation is legal, not infused or inherent righteousness.
    - The righteousness imputed is external to the believer.
    - This imputation is the exclusive basis for acceptance before God.
    - "The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, not infused in us." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Covenant of Grace and Federal Theology**
    - The Covenant of Grace is distinct from the Covenant of Works.
    - Justification in the Covenant of Grace is grounded in Christ’s merit, not covenantal faithfulness or works.
    - Faith is required as the means, but not as a meritorious cause.
    - The federal headship of Christ secures the believer’s justification.
    - "The covenant of grace rests wholly on the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, not on our own works." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Opposition to Rome and Neonomianism**
    - Turretin rejects the Roman Catholic view of justification as both forgiveness and inward renewal.
    - He opposes any doctrine that introduces works as a condition of justification.
    - Neonomianism (making the gospel a new law) is seen as a threat to sola fide.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in Christ’s work, not human performance.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, without the works of the law, either ceremonial or moral." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Faith Distinguished from Works**
    - Faith is not itself a work or virtue that justifies.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of justification, not its ground.
    - The role of works is in sanctification, not justification.
    - Any confusion of faith and works undermines the gospel.
    - "Works are the effects and evidences of faith, not the causes of justification." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of **justification by faith alone** became foundational for later Reformed confessional standards and polemics against both Roman Catholicism and later deviations such as the **Federal Vision**. His careful distinctions between **imputation**, faith, and works have shaped orthodox Reformed responses to any teaching that blurs the line between justification and sanctification. Turretin’s influence endures in Reformed seminaries and confessional documents, providing a bulwark against doctrinal innovations that compromise the gospel of grace.
