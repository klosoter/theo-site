# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas, though writing centuries before the **Federal Vision** controversy, developed a comprehensive doctrine of **justification** rooted in **grace**, **faith**, and the **infusion of righteousness**. For Aquinas, justification is a process involving the transformation of the soul by **sanctifying grace**, distinct from later **Reformation** emphases on forensic imputation. His theology stands in contrast to both the **Federal Vision**'s covenantal approach and the classic **Protestant** doctrine of justification by faith alone.

- "Justification includes the remission of sins, the infusion of grace and of the virtues, and the movement of the free will towards God through faith." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, Questions 106–114
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Aquinas on Faith, Hope, and Love (selected translations and secondary analyses)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as a Transformative Process**
   - Justification is not merely a legal declaration but involves an actual change in the person.
   - The process includes the remission of sins and the infusion of **sanctifying grace**.
   - Human cooperation with grace is essential, though grace is primary.
   - Faith is the beginning of justification, but love (charity) completes it.
   - "The justification of the ungodly is brought about by the infusion of grace which heals the soul." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.3)

2. **Faith Formed by Love**
   - Faith alone is insufficient for justification; it must be "formed" by charity.
   - The **virtue of faith** is perfected by the presence of love in the soul.
   - This formed faith leads to the fulfillment of the law through love.
   - The distinction between "unformed" and "formed" faith is central to Aquinas's soteriology.
   - "Faith without charity does not unite man perfectly to Christ, and therefore does not justify fully." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q.4, a.7)

3. **Infusion of Grace and Virtues**
   - Justification entails the infusion of **sanctifying grace** and the theological virtues.
   - This grace is a created habit in the soul, enabling participation in the divine nature.
   - The virtues of faith, hope, and charity are given simultaneously with grace.
   - The process is initiated by God but involves the free response of the human will.
   - "Grace is given to us that we may merit eternal life, which exceeds the capacity of human nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.109, a.5)

4. **Role of the Sacraments**
   - The **sacraments** are instrumental causes of grace and justification.
   - Baptism is the primary sacrament of justification, effecting the remission of sins.
   - The Eucharist nourishes and strengthens the justified soul.
   - Sacramental participation is necessary for the full realization of justification.
   - "The sacraments of the New Law are necessary for salvation inasmuch as they are the ordinary means of grace." (Summa Theologiae III, q.61, a.1)

5. **Merit and Final Justification**
   - Good works, performed in grace, have true **merit** before God.
   - Final justification includes the reward of eternal life, granted in accord with God's justice and mercy.
   - Merit is possible only because of the prior gift of grace.
   - The justified person must persevere in grace to attain final salvation.
   - "Eternal life is both a gift of grace and a reward due to merit, according to the order of divine justice." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.114, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas's doctrine of **justification** became foundational for later **Roman Catholic** theology, especially at the Council of Trent, and serves as a major contrast to both **Reformation** and **Federal Vision** perspectives. His emphasis on the transformative nature of grace and the necessity of both faith and charity continues to shape Catholic-Protestant dialogues. While Aquinas does not address the covenantal categories central to the Federal Vision, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between faith, works, and salvation.
