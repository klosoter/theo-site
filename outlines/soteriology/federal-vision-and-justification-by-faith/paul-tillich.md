# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich was not directly involved in the **Federal Vision** controversy, nor did he write explicitly on **justification by faith** in the Reformed sense. However, his existential approach to **justification**, **faith**, and the **relationship between law and grace** offers a critical contrast to both traditional Reformed theology and the Federal Vision movement. Tillich emphasized the **existential dimension of faith** and the **unconditional acceptance of the individual by God**, reframing justification as an ontological rather than a forensic event.

- "Justification by faith is the acceptance of that which is unacceptable." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

- A History of Christian Thought

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Ontological Acceptance**
    - Justification is not a legal declaration but the existential acceptance of the estranged by God.
    - It addresses the **state of alienation** and reunites the individual with the **ground of being**.
    - The focus is on transformation of existence, not imputation of righteousness.
    - Justification is inseparable from **participation in the New Being** revealed in Christ.
    - "Justification is the acceptance of the unacceptable, the reunion of the estranged." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

2. **Faith as Ultimate Concern**
    - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned, transcending mere intellectual assent.
    - It involves total surrender to the **ground of being**, not simply trust in a forensic transaction.
    - Faith is existential and dynamic, not reducible to doctrinal formulations.
    - The act of faith itself is a participation in the reality of justification.
    - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Law and Grace as Existential Polarities**
    - Law represents the demand for structure and order in human existence.
    - Grace is the unconditional acceptance that overcomes the anxiety produced by law.
    - The dialectic of law and grace is resolved in the **New Being** of Christ.
    - Justification is the existential experience of grace overcoming the condemnation of law.
    - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected according to the law." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

4. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ is not primarily a legal substitute but the manifestation of the **New Being**.
    - Justification is participation in the New Being, not merely a change in legal status.
    - The work of Christ is ontological, effecting a real transformation in human existence.
    - The **union with Christ** is existential, not forensic or covenantal in the Reformed sense.
    - "In Christ, the New Being has appeared, and in him, justification is real." (Systematic Theology, vol. 2)

5. **Critique of Forensic and Covenantal Models**
    - Tillich rejects the purely forensic understanding of justification as insufficiently existential.
    - He does not affirm the Federal Vision's emphasis on covenantal objectivity or sacramental efficacy.
    - Justification is not mediated through covenantal structures but through existential encounter with God.
    - The focus is on the individual's transformation, not on ecclesial or covenantal categories.
    - "The Protestant principle is the critical correlation of the ultimate and the conditional." (The Protestant Era)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **justification** stands in marked contrast to both traditional Reformed and Federal Vision perspectives, challenging the adequacy of **forensic** and **covenantal** models. His emphasis on the **ontological transformation** of the individual and the existential nature of faith has influenced modern theology, especially in the dialogue between existentialism and Christian doctrine. While not directly engaged with the Federal Vision debate, Tillich’s work provides a critical lens for evaluating the theological assumptions underlying contemporary discussions of justification by faith.
