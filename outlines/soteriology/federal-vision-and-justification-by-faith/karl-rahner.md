# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner, a leading Roman Catholic theologian, approached the doctrine of **justification** through the lens of **transcendental theology** and the **grace-nature relationship**. While not directly engaging the **Federal Vision** controversy, Rahner’s understanding of **faith**, **grace**, and **justification** emphasizes the transformative encounter with God’s self-communication, differing significantly from both Reformed and Federal Vision emphases on **imputed righteousness** and **covenant objectivity**.

- "Justification is the event in which man, by the free gift of God’s grace, is made just and holy in the sight of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church
- The Shape of the Church to Come
- Grace in Freedom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Transformative Participation**
   - Justification is not merely a legal declaration but an inner transformation by **sanctifying grace**.
   - The justified person is truly made righteous, not only regarded as such.
   - Emphasizes the ontological change in the believer through God’s self-communication.
   - Contrasts with the Reformed focus on **imputed righteousness**.
   - "Justification is the making just of the sinner, not merely the accounting of him as just." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

2. **Grace as God’s Self-Communication**
   - Grace is understood as God’s free self-gift, not a created substance.
   - Every person is oriented toward God by a **supernatural existential**.
   - Justification is the fulfillment of this orientation in explicit faith and love.
   - The event of justification is inseparable from the ongoing presence of grace.
   - "Grace is nothing other than God’s self-communication to man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Faith and Freedom in Justification**
   - Faith is a personal, existential response to God’s offer of grace.
   - Human freedom cooperates with grace in the act of justification.
   - Rejects any notion of justification by faith alone apart from love and transformation.
   - Faith, hope, and love are inseparable in the justified person.
   - "Faith without love is not the faith that justifies." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 6)

4. **Rejection of Forensic-Only Models**
   - Critiques Protestant models that emphasize a purely forensic or external justification.
   - Argues that justification must include real inner renewal.
   - The legal metaphor is subordinate to the reality of **divinization**.
   - Stresses the unity of justification and sanctification.
   - "The Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone is not adequate to the biblical witness." (Nature and Grace)

5. **Ecclesial Mediation of Justification**
   - Justification is mediated through the **Church** and its sacraments.
   - The Church is the ordinary means by which grace is communicated.
   - Baptism is the foundational sacrament of justification.
   - The communal and sacramental context is essential for understanding justification.
   - "The Church is the sacrament of the world’s justification." (The Shape of the Church to Come)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **justification** has profoundly shaped post-Vatican II Catholic thought, emphasizing the transformative and participatory nature of grace. His rejection of a purely forensic understanding stands in contrast to both Reformed and Federal Vision perspectives, foregrounding the ontological renewal of the believer. Rahner’s influence endures in contemporary Catholic discussions of **grace**, **faith**, and the relationship between **nature and the supernatural**. While not engaging the Federal Vision directly, his work remains a critical reference point in ecumenical dialogues on justification.
