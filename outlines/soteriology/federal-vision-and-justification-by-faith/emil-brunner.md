# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, critiqued both **Reformed orthodoxy** and modern liberalism on the doctrine of **justification by faith**. While not directly engaged in the **Federal Vision** controversy, Brunner’s theology emphasized the existential encounter with God in Christ and the necessity of **faith** as a personal trust, rather than mere assent to doctrine or participation in covenantal structures.

- "Faith is not a work, but the cessation of all work, the opening of the hand to receive the gift." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Divine Act**
    - Justification is a unilateral act of **God’s grace** toward the sinner.
    - It is not grounded in human achievement or covenantal faithfulness.
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed, not infused or earned.
    - Human response is reception, not contribution.
    - "Justification is the act in which God declares the sinner righteous for Christ’s sake." (The Mediator)

2. **Faith as Personal Encounter**
    - Faith is existential trust, not mere assent to doctrinal propositions.
    - It involves a personal relationship with the living Christ.
    - Faith arises from the encounter with the Word, not from sacramental or covenantal status.
    - The act of faith is itself a gift of God’s grace.
    - "Faith is the personal relationship to the living Christ, not a general religious attitude." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Critique of Covenant Objectivism**
    - Brunner rejects any view that makes covenant membership the ground of justification.
    - He warns against confusing external participation with internal faith.
    - The church and sacraments are means, not guarantees, of grace.
    - Justification is not mediated by ecclesial or covenantal structures.
    - "The Church is not the mediator of salvation, but its witness." (Dogmatics I)

4. **Rejection of Legalistic or Sacramental Works**
    - Brunner opposes any notion that works, rituals, or sacraments contribute to justification.
    - He critiques both Roman Catholic and Protestant tendencies toward legalism.
    - The grace of God is always prior and decisive.
    - Human works are the fruit, not the root, of justification.
    - "Grace excludes all human merit, even the merit of faith itself." (The Mediator)

5. **Emphasis on Christ Alone**
    - Christ’s person and work are the sole basis of justification.
    - No human institution or covenantal identity can supplement Christ’s sufficiency.
    - The believer is justified solely by union with Christ through faith.
    - All assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not on covenantal performance.
    - "Christ alone is our righteousness; nothing can be added to Him." (Dogmatics II)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s robust defense of **justification by faith alone** positioned him as a critical voice against both legalism and covenantal objectivism, themes echoed in later debates such as the **Federal Vision** controversy. His insistence on the existential and personal nature of faith challenged both sacramentalism and mere intellectual assent. While not directly addressing Federal Vision, Brunner’s theology remains a significant resource for those upholding the primacy of faith and the sufficiency of Christ in the doctrine of justification. His influence endures in discussions of **Reformed soteriology** and the ongoing dialogue between confessional and neo-orthodox traditions.
