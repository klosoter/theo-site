# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray was a staunch defender of the **Reformed doctrine of justification by faith alone**, emphasizing the **imputed righteousness of Christ** and the **forensic nature of justification**. He rejected any conflation of **justification** and **sanctification**, and his writings stand in clear contrast to the **Federal Vision** movement, which he viewed as compromising the distinctiveness of **sola fide** and the **covenant of grace**.

- "Justification is once for all, a declarative act of God, constituting the person righteous in his sight." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Covenant of Grace" (essay)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic and declarative**
    - Justification is a legal act, not a process or transformation.
    - It involves God's declaration of righteousness based on Christ's obedience.
    - The believer's status is changed before God, not their nature.
    - This act is distinct from sanctification or regeneration.
    - "Justification is not a process but a once-for-all act." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - The righteousness of Christ is reckoned to the believer by faith.
    - There is no mingling of the believer's works in justification.
    - Imputation is central to the believer's acceptance before God.
    - This upholds the Reformation principle of sola fide.
    - "The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us and constitutes the ground of our justification." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Faith as the sole instrument of justification**
    - Faith alone receives and rests upon Christ and his righteousness.
    - Faith is not a work or meritorious cause.
    - Any addition of works to faith undermines the gospel.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ, not in covenantal faithfulness or works.
    - "Faith is not the ground of justification; it is the instrument by which we receive Christ." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Covenant of grace is monergistic**
    - The covenant of grace is established and fulfilled by God alone.
    - Human response is the result, not the cause, of covenant inclusion.
    - The covenant is not conditioned on human faithfulness for justification.
    - Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness blurs this distinction.
    - "The covenant of grace is sovereignly administered and maintained by God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Clear distinction between justification and sanctification**
    - Justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct benefits of union with Christ.
    - Justification is about status; sanctification is about transformation.
    - Confusing the two leads to doctrinal error and assurance issues.
    - Federal Vision tendencies to merge these threaten Reformed orthodoxy.
    - "Sanctification is not to be confused with justification; the distinction is vital." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous defense of **justification by faith alone** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and pastors, especially in response to movements like Federal Vision. His careful articulation of the **forensic nature of justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** remains a standard in Reformed soteriology. Murray’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against doctrinal innovations that threaten the clarity of the gospel and the distinctiveness of Reformed covenant theology.
