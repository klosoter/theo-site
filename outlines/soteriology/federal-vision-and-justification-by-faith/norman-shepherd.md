# Norman Shepherd (1933–2020)

Norman Shepherd is known for his controversial views on **justification by faith** and his association with the **Federal Vision** movement. He challenged traditional Reformed formulations by emphasizing the necessity of **obedient faith** and the covenantal context of salvation, arguing that **justification** is by a living, active faith that includes faithfulness. Shepherd’s position sparked significant debate over the nature of **faith**, **works**, and the doctrine of **imputation** within the Reformed tradition.

- "Justifying faith is obedient faith, that is, 'faith working through love' (Gal. 5:6)." (Thirty-four Theses on Justification, 1978)

## Key Works

- "Thirty-four Theses on Justification" (1978, unpublished but widely circulated)
- The Call of Grace: How the Covenant Illuminates Salvation and Evangelism (2000)
- "Justification by Faith in Pauline and Reformed Theology" (Presbyterion, 1979)
- The Shepherd Controversy: The Points at Issue (various OPC reports and documents)
- Covenant and Justification Debate (ed. Mark W. Karlberg, secondary source)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is by Faith Working through Love**
   - Faith that justifies is never alone but is always accompanied by obedience.
   - Emphasizes the active, living character of faith as essential to justification.
   - Rejects a purely forensic or imputed righteousness apart from covenantal faithfulness.
   - Argues that **obedient faith** is the instrument of justification.
   - "Faith, if it is genuine, is always a living and active faith, and it is this faith that justifies." (Thirty-four Theses)

2. **Covenantal Context of Salvation**
   - Salvation is administered through the covenant, not merely through individual election.
   - The covenant includes both promises and obligations for its members.
   - All baptized members are truly in covenant with Christ and receive real benefits.
   - Covenant membership entails both privileges and responsibilities, including persevering faith.
   - "The covenant is the context in which all of God’s saving blessings are received." (The Call of Grace)

3. **Rejection of the Law/Gospel Dichotomy**
   - Critiques the sharp distinction between law and gospel in traditional Reformed theology.
   - Argues that the gospel includes commands and the law includes promises.
   - Sees continuity between the demands of the covenant and the offer of grace.
   - Maintains that the call to faith is also a call to obedience.
   - "The gospel is not antithetical to the law, but fulfills it in Christ and in us." (The Call of Grace)

4. **Union with Christ as Central to Justification**
   - Justification is inseparable from union with Christ, which is covenantal and relational.
   - All benefits of salvation, including justification, flow from union with Christ.
   - Union with Christ is established by the Spirit through faith and maintained by faithfulness.
   - The forensic and transformative aspects of salvation are united in this relationship.
   - "Union with Christ is the fountainhead of every saving blessing, including justification." (Presbyterion, 1979)

5. **Critique of Imputed Active Obedience**
   - Questions the traditional doctrine of the imputation of Christ’s active obedience.
   - Argues that Christ’s obedience is not transferred as a legal status but shared in union.
   - Emphasizes the believer’s participation in Christ rather than a mere legal transaction.
   - Suggests that justification is not grounded in a double imputation but in covenantal faithfulness.
   - "The righteousness of Christ is not a legal fiction imputed to us, but is ours in union with Him." (Thirty-four Theses)

## Legacy and Impact

Norman Shepherd’s views on **justification by faith** and the **Federal Vision** have had a profound and polarizing effect on Reformed theology in North America. His emphasis on **obedient faith** and the covenantal structure of salvation led to significant controversy, particularly within the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Westminster Theological Seminary. Shepherd’s theology contributed to the rise of the Federal Vision movement, prompting widespread debate over the nature of faith, works, and assurance. While many in the Reformed tradition have strongly opposed his views, his work continues to provoke discussion on the relationship between faith, obedience, and justification.
