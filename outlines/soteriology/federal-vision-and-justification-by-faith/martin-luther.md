# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **justification by faith alone** stands in sharp contrast to later movements like the **Federal Vision**, which challenge the strict forensic distinction between **faith** and **works**. For Luther, **justification** is a declarative act of God, received solely through **faith** apart from any human merit, and this conviction became foundational for the Protestant Reformation. He rejected any conflation of **justification** and **sanctification**, insisting that the believer’s righteousness before God is entirely **alien** and imputed.

- "Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone." (Commentary on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Commentary on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences (95 Theses)
- Preface to the Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
    - Justification is a forensic declaration by God, not a process.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which righteousness is received.
    - Works are excluded from the ground or instrument of justification.
    - The believer is simultaneously **just** and **sinner** (simul iustus et peccator).
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Romans Commentary)

2. **Imputed, Not Infused, Righteousness**
    - Righteousness is counted to the believer, not infused or inherent.
    - Christ’s righteousness is alien (extra nos) and external to the believer.
    - The believer’s status before God is based on Christ’s obedience, not personal transformation.
    - Any mingling of justification and sanctification undermines the gospel.
    - "This is the truth of the gospel. It is also the principal article of all Christian doctrine." (Galatians Commentary)

3. **Faith as Trust in Christ’s Promise**
    - Faith is not mere assent but personal trust in Christ’s finished work.
    - Faith clings to the promise of forgiveness in the gospel.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s objective work, not subjective experience.
    - The sacraments serve to confirm faith, not to add to justification.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace." (Preface to Romans)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The law reveals sin and drives the sinner to Christ.
    - The gospel announces free forgiveness and justification in Christ.
    - Confusing law and gospel leads to either legalism or antinomianism.
    - The believer lives under the gospel, not under the law, for justification.
    - "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Galatians Commentary)

5. **Rejection of Any Synergism in Justification**
    - Human cooperation or covenantal faithfulness plays no role in justification.
    - All human works, even those done in faith, are excluded from the basis of justification.
    - The grace of God alone initiates and completes the work of salvation.
    - Any system that conditions justification on obedience is a return to bondage.
    - "If the article of justification is lost, all Christian doctrine is lost at the same time." (Galatians Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust articulation of **justification by faith alone** became the cornerstone of Protestant soteriology and a critical benchmark for evaluating later theological movements, including the Federal Vision. His sharp distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** continues to shape Reformed and Lutheran confessional identity. While the Federal Vision seeks to integrate covenantal obedience into the justification schema, Luther’s legacy stands as a bulwark against any erosion of the gospel’s forensic character. His influence remains decisive in debates over the nature of faith, works, and the believer’s standing before God.
