# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til did not directly address the **Federal Vision** controversy, as it arose after his lifetime, but his work on **justification by faith** and **covenant theology** has significantly shaped Reformed responses to such debates. Van Til emphasized the necessity of **imputed righteousness** and the antithesis between **Reformed orthodoxy** and any system that undermines **sola fide**. His presuppositional apologetic framework insists that all theological formulations must be grounded in the self-attesting authority of **Scripture**.

- "The Reformed faith maintains that justification is by faith alone, on the basis of the righteousness of Christ alone." (The Defense of the Faith)

- Essays on Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is a forensic act, grounded solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which believers receive justification, excluding all works.
    - Any system that conflates faith and works in justification is fundamentally opposed to the **Reformed doctrine**.
    - The assurance of salvation rests on the objective work of Christ, not on human performance.
    - "Justification is by faith alone, and this faith is itself the gift of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenant Theology as Redemptive Framework**
    - The **covenant of grace** is the structure for understanding salvation history.
    - The unity of the covenant opposes any dualism between law and gospel that would undermine justification.
    - The covenant promises are fulfilled in Christ, whose obedience is credited to believers.
    - The church is the covenant community, but membership does not guarantee justification apart from faith.
    - "The covenant is the means by which God brings his people into saving relationship with himself." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Antithesis Between Reformed and Non-Reformed Systems**
    - There is a fundamental antithesis between **Reformed orthodoxy** and all forms of synergism or semi-Pelagianism.
    - Attempts to blend faith and works in justification are seen as a return to Roman Catholic or Arminian errors.
    - The Reformed position maintains the Creator-creature distinction in all theological formulations.
    - Theological compromise on justification undermines the gospel itself.
    - "There is no neutral ground between the Reformed faith and its alternatives." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Scripture as Self-Attesting Authority**
    - All doctrines, including justification, must be derived from the self-authenticating Word of God.
    - Human reason is subordinate to **Scripture** and cannot judge divine revelation.
    - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are essential for guarding the doctrine of justification.
    - Extra-biblical traditions or innovations are to be rejected if they conflict with biblical teaching.
    - "Scripture alone is the final authority in matters of faith and life." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Presuppositional Critique of Theological Innovation**
    - Theological systems must be critiqued at the level of presuppositions, not just conclusions.
    - The **Federal Vision** approach, by blurring the distinction between faith and works, is subject to presuppositional critique.
    - True theology begins with submission to God's revelation, not human speculation.
    - The purity of the gospel is maintained only by rigorous adherence to Reformed presuppositions.
    - "All reasoning must be by presupposition, and the only true presupposition is that of the self-attesting Christ of Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **justification by faith alone** has been foundational for confessional Reformed responses to the Federal Vision controversy. His insistence on the antithesis between Reformed and non-Reformed systems has shaped critiques of any movement perceived to compromise **sola fide**. Van Til’s presuppositional method continues to influence Reformed theologians in defending the integrity of the gospel and the authority of Scripture. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to the centrality of **imputed righteousness** in justification.
