# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **justification by faith** not through the traditional forensic or covenantal categories, but as an expression of the individual's **God-consciousness** realized in the community of faith. While he predates the **Federal Vision** controversy, Schleiermacher’s emphasis on the **subjective experience of faith** and the communal aspects of salvation stands in marked contrast to both classic Reformed and Federal Vision formulations, which stress **covenant theology** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**.

- "Justification is nothing else than the being in the Christian state, as such, or the having a share in the common Christian spirit." (The Christian Faith, §121)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Participation in Christ**
    - Justification is understood as the believer’s participation in the **life of Christ** rather than a legal declaration.
    - Emphasizes the transformation of the individual’s **God-consciousness**.
    - Downplays the forensic and covenantal aspects central to **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **Federal Vision**.
    - Views justification as inseparable from **regeneration** and sanctification.
    - "Justification is not a mere imputation, but a real participation in the new life." (The Christian Faith, §121)

2. **Faith as Feeling of Absolute Dependence**
    - Faith is primarily a **feeling of absolute dependence** on God, not assent to doctrinal propositions.
    - This subjective orientation contrasts with the Federal Vision’s focus on **objective covenant membership**.
    - Faith is the means by which the individual experiences justification, not merely trusts in an external promise.
    - The communal aspect of faith is emphasized, but always rooted in individual experience.
    - "Faith is the vital act of the Christian, the consciousness of being in Christ." (The Christian Faith, §111)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
    - Schleiermacher rejects the classic Reformed doctrine of the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**.
    - Justification is not a legal fiction but a real change in the believer’s relationship to God.
    - The righteousness of Christ is communicated through the **Spirit** and the life of the church.
    - This stands in contrast to both Federal Vision and Reformed views, which maintain a forensic element.
    - "The communication of Christ’s righteousness is not forensic, but vital and spiritual." (The Christian Faith, §123)

4. **Community and the Church**
    - The church is the context in which **God-consciousness** is nurtured and justification experienced.
    - Justification is not an individualistic event but occurs within the **Christian community**.
    - The sacraments are means of deepening the believer’s participation in Christ, not covenantal boundary markers.
    - Schleiermacher’s ecclesiology is more mystical than covenantal.
    - "The church is the fellowship of those who share in the Redeemer’s God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §122)

5. **Integration of Justification and Sanctification**
    - Justification and sanctification are not sharply distinguished, but are aspects of the same spiritual reality.
    - Both are rooted in the believer’s participation in the **life of Christ**.
    - This blurring of categories differs from both Federal Vision (which distinguishes covenantal membership and perseverance) and classic Reformed theology.
    - The process of salvation is holistic and dynamic, not static or merely declarative.
    - "Sanctification is the progressive realization of justification in the life of the believer." (The Christian Faith, §130)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **justification by faith** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology, shifting the focus from **forensic and covenantal categories** to the **subjective experience of faith** and the communal life of the church. While his views stand in sharp contrast to both Reformed orthodoxy and the Federal Vision, his influence is seen in later liberal and existential theologies. His legacy is a decisive move toward the **experiential and relational dimensions** of salvation, challenging subsequent generations to reconsider the meaning of justification in the modern context.
