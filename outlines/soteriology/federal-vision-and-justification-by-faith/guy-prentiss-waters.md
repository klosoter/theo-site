# Guy Prentiss Waters (1971–)

Guy Prentiss Waters is a leading Reformed theologian and critic of the **Federal Vision** movement, particularly regarding its challenges to the classic Reformed doctrine of **justification by faith alone**. Waters contends that Federal Vision theology undermines the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** and the **distinction between law and gospel**, thereby threatening the heart of the **Reformed soteriological framework**.

- "The Federal Vision’s doctrine of justification is not the doctrine of justification taught in the Westminster Standards." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

## Key Works

- The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology: A Comparative Analysis
- Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul: A Review and Response
- By Faith Alone: Answering the Challenges to the Doctrine of Justification (contributor)
- How Jesus Runs the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
    - Affirms that **justification** is a forensic act of God, declaring sinners righteous solely on the basis of **Christ’s imputed righteousness**.
    - Rejects any notion that **works** or covenantal faithfulness contribute to justification.
    - Emphasizes the **distinction between justification and sanctification**.
    - Argues that Federal Vision theology confuses or collapses this distinction.
    - "Justification is by faith alone, not by faith and works, nor by faithfulness." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Maintains that the believer’s righteousness is entirely **alien** and imputed, not infused or inherent.
    - Critiques Federal Vision for denying or redefining the imputation of Christ’s active obedience.
    - Stresses that both the **active and passive obedience** of Christ are credited to believers.
    - Warns that alternative views compromise the **gospel’s sufficiency**.
    - "The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is essential to the Reformed doctrine of justification." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

3. **Covenant and Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Upholds a clear distinction between **law and gospel** in the administration of the covenant.
    - Argues that Federal Vision blurs this distinction by making covenant membership and faithfulness determinative for justification.
    - Insists that the **covenant of grace** is received by faith alone, not by faith plus works.
    - Sees the law-gospel distinction as vital for preserving the **Reformation’s soteriology**.
    - "The law-gospel distinction is not a minor point but a safeguard of the gospel itself." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

4. **Sacramental Theology and Union with Christ**
    - Critiques Federal Vision’s view that **baptism** confers a non-final, covenantal union with Christ that can be lost.
    - Affirms that union with Christ, while signified in the sacraments, is received by faith alone and is unbreakable.
    - Warns against confusing **external covenant membership** with the internal reality of salvation.
    - Emphasizes the Reformed distinction between the visible and invisible church.
    - "Union with Christ is by faith, not by sacrament alone or by mere covenant membership." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

5. **Confessional Fidelity**
    - Defends the **Westminster Standards** as the faithful summary of biblical teaching on justification.
    - Argues that Federal Vision theology departs from confessional Reformed orthodoxy.
    - Stresses the importance of doctrinal clarity and subscription for church unity and purity.
    - Calls for vigilance against innovations that undermine the gospel.
    - "The Westminster Confession’s doctrine of justification must remain the church’s standard." (The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Guy Prentiss Waters has played a pivotal role in articulating and defending the **Reformed doctrine of justification** against the challenges posed by the Federal Vision movement. His scholarship has shaped denominational reports, seminary curricula, and broader evangelical discourse on **covenant theology** and **soteriology**. Waters’ work remains a touchstone for those seeking clarity on the relationship between faith, works, and justification within the Reformed tradition.
