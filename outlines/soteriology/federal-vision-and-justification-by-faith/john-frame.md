# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame has engaged the **Federal Vision** controversy with a mediating and critical approach, emphasizing the centrality of **justification by faith alone** within the Reformed tradition. He affirms the necessity of **sola fide** while critiquing both the excesses of Federal Vision proponents and the sometimes reactionary responses of their critics, advocating for clarity in distinguishing between **covenant membership** and **saving faith**.

- "Justification is by faith alone, but faith is never alone; it is always accompanied by the other graces of the Spirit." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "N. T. Wright and the New Perspective on Paul" (in The Collected Shorter Theological Writings, Vol. 2)

   - Upholds the necessity of personal faith for justification.
   - "Membership in the covenant community does not guarantee justification before God." (The Doctrine of God)

   - Warns that ambiguous language can undermine the doctrine of **sola fide**.
   - Calls for precise theological definitions to avoid confusion.
   - Sees value in some Federal Vision emphases but rejects their formulations on justification.
   - "Ambiguity in theological language can lead to serious doctrinal error." (Collected Shorter Theological Writings)

4. **Importance of Reformed Confessional Standards**

   - Argues that deviations from confessional standards on justification are serious errors.
   - Encourages adherence to historic Reformed formulations.
   - Sees the confessions as a safeguard against doctrinal innovation.
   - "The confessions are not infallible, but they are wise guides to the teaching of Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

   - Urges charity and careful listening in debates over justification and Federal Vision.
   - Warns against divisiveness and misrepresentation of opponents.
   - Seeks to mediate between polarized camps within Reformed circles.
