# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of **justification by faith** stands at the heart of his theology, emphasizing the believer’s acceptance before God solely on the basis of **Christ’s righteousness** imputed through faith. He sharply distinguishes **justification** from **sanctification**, rejecting any confusion of the two, and would strongly oppose the **Federal Vision** tendency to conflate faith and works in the instrumentality of justification. For Calvin, justification is a forensic act, not a process, and is received by faith alone apart from works.

- "We say that faith justifies, not because it is a worthy work in itself, but because it receives the righteousness of Christ." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.11.7)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3, chapters 11–18)
- Commentary on Romans
- Commentary on Galatians
- The Necessity of Reforming the Church
- Calvin’s Tracts and Letters (selected correspondence on justification)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic and declarative**
   - God declares the sinner righteous on the basis of Christ’s righteousness, not by infusing righteousness.
   - Justification is a legal verdict, not a transformative process.
   - The believer’s status before God is changed, not his nature.
   - This declaration is once-for-all and not dependent on subsequent works.
   - "He is justified who is reckoned righteous in the judgment of God." (Institutes, 3.11.2)

2. **Faith alone as the sole instrument**
   - Faith is the only means by which the believer receives justification.
   - Works play no instrumental role in justification.
   - Faith itself is not meritorious; it is the empty hand receiving Christ.
   - Any addition of works undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
   - "We maintain that faith, having no worth in itself, justifies only because it receives Christ." (Institutes, 3.11.7)

3. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
   - The righteousness that justifies is entirely external to the believer.
   - Christ’s obedience and satisfaction are credited to the believer.
   - There is a double imputation: our sin to Christ, his righteousness to us.
   - This imputation is the ground of our acceptance before God.
   - "We are justified by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, not by our own merit." (Institutes, 3.11.23)

4. **Clear distinction between justification and sanctification**
   - Justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct benefits of union with Christ.
   - Justification concerns status; sanctification concerns transformation.
   - Confusing the two undermines assurance and the gospel itself.
   - Good works are the fruit of justification, not its basis or instrument.
   - "As Christ cannot be torn into parts, so these two which we perceive in him together and conjointly are inseparable—namely, righteousness and sanctification." (Institutes, 3.11.6)

5. **Assurance grounded in Christ, not covenantal faithfulness**
   - Assurance of salvation rests on the finished work of Christ, not on the believer’s covenantal obedience.
   - The believer’s confidence is rooted in God’s promise and Christ’s sufficiency.
   - Any system that conditions justification on ongoing faithfulness (as in Federal Vision) is rejected.
   - The believer’s perseverance is the result, not the cause, of justification.
   - "Our assurance of salvation does not depend upon our works, but upon the promise of God in Christ." (Commentary on Romans 8:33)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of **justification by faith alone** became foundational for Reformed confessions and a bulwark against any teaching that mingles faith and works in the act of justification. His clear distinction between justification and sanctification directly counters the **Federal Vision** approach, which Calvin would see as a serious threat to the gospel. Calvin’s influence endures in Reformed theology’s insistence on the forensic, imputed nature of justification and the necessity of faith alone as its sole instrument.
