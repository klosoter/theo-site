# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **justification** centers on the transformative work of **grace** in the believer, emphasizing the necessity of **faith** initiated by God and completed through **love**. While he predates the **Federal Vision** controversy, Augustine’s views on the relationship between **faith, works, and justification** have been foundational for later debates, including those concerning the nature of **imputed righteousness** and the role of the **sacraments**.

- "He who created you without you will not justify you without you." (Sermon 169)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- On Nature and Grace
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Transformative, Not Merely Forensic**
    - Justification involves an inner renewal by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Righteousness is not only declared but also imparted to the believer.
    - Faith is the beginning, but **love** completes justification.
    - The process is ongoing, not a single legal act.
    - "Justification itself is not only the remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the inner man." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

2. **Primacy of Divine Grace**
    - Human will is incapacitated by **original sin**.
    - All movement toward God begins with **prevenient grace**.
    - Even faith itself is a gift from God, not a human achievement.
    - Grace is necessary both to initiate and to sustain faith and obedience.
    - "Without God’s help, no one can turn to God." (On Nature and Grace)

3. **Faith Working Through Love**
    - Faith alone does not justify unless it is active in **love**.
    - **Charity** is the form and fulfillment of faith.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of genuine faith.
    - Justification is not by faith alone in the later Protestant sense.
    - "Faith without love is nothing." (Enchiridion)

4. **Role of the Sacraments in Salvation**
    - **Baptism** is instrumental in the remission of sins and entrance into the Church.
    - The sacraments are means by which grace is conveyed.
    - Participation in the sacraments is necessary for growth in righteousness.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on God, not the worthiness of the recipient.
    - "The sacrament of baptism is most assuredly the sacrament of regeneration." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance**
    - Final perseverance is itself a gift of grace, not guaranteed by initial faith.
    - Assurance of salvation is possible but not absolute in this life.
    - Believers must continually rely on God’s mercy and grace.
    - The Church is a mixed body; not all baptized persevere.
    - "He who endures to the end will be saved." (City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology of **grace, faith, and justification** profoundly shaped Western Christianity and provided the groundwork for later debates on these issues. His emphasis on the necessity of **divine grace** and the transformative nature of justification influenced both medieval and Reformation thought, even as later controversies like the **Federal Vision** would revisit questions he first raised. While not addressing Federal Vision directly, Augustine’s synthesis of faith and works remains a touchstone for discussions of justification in both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
