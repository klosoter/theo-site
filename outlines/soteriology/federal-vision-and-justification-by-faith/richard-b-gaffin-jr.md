# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has critically engaged the **Federal Vision** movement, especially regarding its views on **justification by faith**. Gaffin strongly affirms the classic Reformed doctrine of **justification by faith alone** and has warned against any formulations that blur the distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** or compromise the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.

- "Justification is by faith alone, on the basis of Christ’s righteousness alone, and not in any sense on the basis of works, whether initial or final." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The New Perspective on Paul: An Analysis and Assessment" (in Justification and Variegated Nomism, Vol. 2)
- "Justification and Eschatology" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (for context on covenant theology)
- Articles and essays critiquing Federal Vision in various Reformed journals

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
    - Justification is a **forensic act** of God, declaring sinners righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s work.
    - Faith is the **sole instrument** of justification, not faith plus works.
    - Works are the fruit of justification, not its ground or instrument.
    - Any confusion of justification and sanctification undermines the gospel.
    - "The faith that justifies is never alone, but justification is by faith alone." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Imputed Righteousness of Christ**
    - The righteousness of Christ is **imputed**, not infused, to believers.
    - Believers are accepted before God solely because of Christ’s obedience.
    - Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenant faithfulness risks conflating justification and sanctification.
    - The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is essential to the Reformed doctrine of salvation.
    - "Our standing before God rests entirely on the imputed righteousness of Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Distinct but Inseparable Union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the context for all benefits of salvation, including justification and sanctification.
    - Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of salvation.
    - Federal Vision tendencies to collapse these categories are rejected.
    - The ordo salutis must preserve the unique role of justification.
    - "Union with Christ is the overarching reality, but justification and sanctification must not be confused." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Covenant and the Order of Salvation**
    - The covenant is the framework for understanding salvation, but does not redefine justification.
    - Federal Vision’s covenantal objectivity language can obscure the forensic nature of justification.
    - The covenant includes both the promise and the requirement of faith, but justification remains by faith alone.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not covenantal faithfulness.
    - "The covenant is the context, but justification is always forensic and by faith alone." (Justification and Variegated Nomism)

5. **Critique of Federal Vision and New Perspectives**
    - Federal Vision and New Perspective on Paul threaten the clarity of the Reformed doctrine of justification.
    - Both movements tend to redefine justification in terms of covenant membership or faithfulness.
    - Gaffin insists on the historic Reformed confessional standards regarding justification.
    - He calls for vigilance in preserving the gospel’s core: justification by faith alone.
    - "Any teaching that makes works in any sense the ground or instrument of justification is contrary to the gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s rigorous defense of **justification by faith alone** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed responses to the Federal Vision and New Perspective movements. His work has reinforced the importance of maintaining the **forensic distinction** between justification and sanctification within the context of union with Christ. Gaffin’s scholarship continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students committed to confessional Reformed theology, ensuring the centrality of the gospel in the church’s doctrine and life.
