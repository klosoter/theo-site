# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a staunch critic of the **Federal Vision** movement, particularly regarding its challenges to the classic **Reformed doctrine of justification by faith alone**. Kline emphasized the absolute distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, insisting that **justification** is grounded solely in the imputed righteousness of Christ, received by faith apart from works. He viewed Federal Vision as a serious threat to the integrity of the gospel and the confessional standards of Reformed theology.

- "The Federal Vision program is a radical revision of the Reformed doctrine of justification, and as such, it is a betrayal of the gospel." (Covenant Theology Under Attack)

## Key Works

- "Covenant Theology Under Attack" (Presbyterion, 2004)
- By Oath Consigned (1968)
- Kingdom Prologue (2000)
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon (2006)
- Structure of Biblical Authority (1972)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Law-Gospel Distinction**
   - Maintains a clear separation between the **covenant of works** (law) and the **covenant of grace** (gospel).
   - Argues that blurring this distinction undermines the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.
   - Critiques Federal Vision for introducing works into the ground of justification.
   - Insists that the Mosaic covenant is fundamentally a republication of the works principle.
   - "The law-gospel antithesis is at the heart of the biblical covenants." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Justification by Faith Alone**
   - Affirms that **justification** is by faith apart from any works, including covenant faithfulness or obedience.
   - Rejects any notion that faithfulness or covenant membership contributes to justification.
   - Emphasizes the forensic, declarative nature of justification.
   - Warns that Federal Vision's views compromise the Reformation's core teaching.
   - "Justification is a verdict pronounced, not a process performed." (Covenant Theology Under Attack)

3. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
   - Stresses that the believer’s righteousness is entirely **imputed**, not infused or earned.
   - Argues that Christ’s active and passive obedience is the sole ground of justification.
   - Rejects any system that makes personal obedience a co-instrument or ground of acceptance.
   - Sees Federal Vision as undermining the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness.
   - "The righteousness by which we are justified is alien, not inherent." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Covenant Structure and Merit**
   - Teaches that the **covenant of works** with Adam was based on merit, not grace.
   - Holds that Christ, as the second Adam, fulfilled the works principle on behalf of the elect.
   - Argues that the **covenant of grace** is fundamentally different, being grounded in promise, not performance.
   - Criticizes Federal Vision for collapsing the distinction between works and grace.
   - "The works principle is not grace; it is the antithesis of grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Confessional Fidelity**
   - Upholds the **Westminster Standards** as faithful expressions of biblical doctrine.
   - Warns that Federal Vision theology departs from confessional Reformed orthodoxy.
   - Advocates for doctrinal clarity and ecclesiastical discipline regarding justification.
   - Sees the preservation of the doctrine of justification as essential to the church’s witness.
   - "To abandon justification by faith alone is to abandon the Reformed faith itself." (Covenant Theology Under Attack)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s rigorous defense of the **law-gospel distinction** and **justification by faith alone** has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to the Federal Vision controversy. His covenant theology has provided a robust framework for critiquing any movement that blurs the boundaries between works and grace. Kline’s influence endures in both academic and ecclesiastical settings, reinforcing the centrality of justification in Reformed theology and safeguarding the gospel against doctrinal innovation.
