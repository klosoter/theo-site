# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a staunch defender of **Reformed orthodoxy** and a leading critic of any doctrine that threatened the classical understanding of **justification by faith alone**. He rejected any system, such as the later **Federal Vision**, that blurred the distinction between **justification** and **sanctification**, or that compromised the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** as the sole ground of acceptance before God.

- "The doctrine which Paul teaches is, that the ground of our justification is not our own obedience, but the righteousness of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- "Justification by Faith" (Princeton Review, 1856)
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic, not transformative**
    - Justification is a legal declaration by God, not an infusion of righteousness.
    - The believer is declared righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s merit.
    - There is a categorical distinction between justification and sanctification.
    - Any doctrine conflating the two undermines the gospel.
    - "Justification is not the infusion of righteousness, nor making righteous, but declaring righteous." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Faith is the sole instrument of justification**
    - Faith alone unites the believer to Christ and appropriates His righteousness.
    - Works, even as fruit of faith, play no role in the ground or instrumentality of justification.
    - The act of faith is not meritorious; it is receptive.
    - Assurance flows from the sufficiency of Christ’s work, not from covenantal faithfulness.
    - "Faith is not the ground of justification; it is not the righteousness for which we are justified." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness is central**
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed, not imparted, to the believer.
    - Both Christ’s active and passive obedience are credited to the believer’s account.
    - Imputation safeguards the objective basis of salvation.
    - Denial of imputation is tantamount to a denial of the gospel.
    - "The righteousness of Christ is the ground of our justification, and is imputed to us as our own." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Covenant theology upholds, not undermines, justification by faith alone**
    - The covenant of grace is fulfilled in Christ and received by faith alone.
    - Covenant membership does not guarantee justification apart from true faith.
    - The visible/invisible church distinction is crucial for understanding covenant blessings.
    - Any view that ties justification to covenantal faithfulness or sacraments is rejected.
    - "The covenant of grace is a dispensation of gratuitous mercy, and its blessings are received by faith alone." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Opposition to neonomianism and sacramentalism**
    - Hodge opposed any teaching that made obedience or sacraments co-instruments of justification.
    - He critiqued neonomian tendencies that made faithfulness a condition of final justification.
    - Sacraments are means of grace, not grounds or instruments of justification.
    - Assurance is not found in covenantal participation but in Christ’s finished work.
    - "The doctrine of justification by faith is the great barrier against all forms of legalism." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s rigorous defense of **justification by faith alone** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and provided a bulwark against later movements like the **Federal Vision**. His articulation of the **forensic nature of justification** and the centrality of **imputation** remains foundational in confessional Presbyterianism. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the relationship between faith, works, and covenant in the doctrine of salvation.
