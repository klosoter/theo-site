# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a nuanced understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology**. He affirmed that while **common grace** restrains sin and bestows temporal blessings on all humanity, only **special (saving) grace** leads to regeneration and salvation. Hodge maintained that any preparatory work in the unregenerate is insufficient for salvation apart from the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Common grace is not to be confounded with saving grace, for it does not renew the heart or secure salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- “The Plan of Salvation”

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - Common grace is universal, restraining sin and enabling civil good.
    - Special grace is effectual and particular, resulting in salvation.
    - The two types of grace differ in purpose, scope, and efficacy.
    - Only special grace renews the heart and unites to Christ.
    - "Common grace is not to be confounded with saving grace, for it does not renew the heart or secure salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Grace**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of both common and special grace.
    - In common grace, the Spirit restrains evil and promotes societal order.
    - In special grace, the Spirit effectually calls and regenerates the elect.
    - No amount of common or preparatory grace can substitute for regeneration.
    - "The Spirit operates on the minds of men in different ways and with different effects." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Preparatory Grace as Insufficient for Salvation**
    - Preparatory grace may awaken moral concern or conviction of sin.
    - Such grace does not guarantee conversion or saving faith.
    - It can lead to outward reform without inward renewal.
    - Only the effectual call transforms the heart unto salvation.
    - "No degree of mere moral preparation can secure regeneration." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Means of Grace and Human Responsibility**
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) are used by God in both common and special grace.
    - Human responsibility is real, but efficacy depends on God’s sovereign action.
    - Exposure to the means of grace may prepare the heart, but does not ensure salvation.
    - The distinction upholds both divine sovereignty and human accountability.
    - "The means of grace are not efficacious of themselves, but only as attended by the power of the Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Providence and Restraint of Sin**
    - God’s providence extends common grace to all, restraining evil in the world.
    - Civil order, conscience, and societal good are fruits of common grace.
    - This restraint is temporary and does not change the sinful nature.
    - The ultimate purpose is to display God’s goodness and prepare for the gospel.
    - "God restrains the evil passions of men, and thus makes human society possible." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has shaped the contours of American Reformed theology, especially in distinguishing the universal operations of God’s goodness from the particularity of saving grace. His careful distinctions have influenced later Princeton theologians and provided a framework for understanding the relationship between grace, human responsibility, and the sovereignty of God. Hodge’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of grace and the work of the Holy Spirit in the world.
