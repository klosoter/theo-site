# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, addressed **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within the framework of classic Reformed theology, emphasizing the distinction between God's universal benevolence and the particular grace that leads to salvation. He affirmed that while **common grace** restrains sin and enables cultural development, it does not prepare the sinner for regeneration, which is solely the work of **special (saving) grace**. Hoekema was critical of any view that blurred the line between the two, insisting on the necessity of **effectual calling** for salvation.

- "Common grace does not prepare a person for saving grace; only the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit can do that." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Works

- "Saved by Grace" (1989)
- "Created in God's Image" (1986)
- "The Four Major Cults" (1963) [for broader context on grace and salvation]
- "The Bible and the Future" (1979)
- "Holy Spirit Baptism" (1972)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Non-Salvific**
    - Common grace restrains sin and enables societal good but does not lead to salvation.
    - It is distinct from **special grace**, which alone brings about regeneration.
    - Hoekema rejects any notion that common grace can prepare the heart for faith.
    - The benefits of common grace are temporal and do not secure eternal life.
    - "Common grace is not a halfway house to salvation." ("Saved by Grace")

2. **Preparatory Grace and Total Depravity**
    - Fallen humanity is totally depraved and incapable of preparing itself for salvation.
    - Any movement toward God must originate in **regenerating grace**, not in human effort or common grace.
    - Hoekema upholds the Reformed doctrine of **total inability**.
    - He denies that there is a "preparatory stage" in which sinners cooperate with grace.
    - "Man, dead in sin, cannot even begin to prepare himself for salvation." ("Saved by Grace")

3. **Effectual Calling as the Beginning of Salvation**
    - The transition from death to life is effected by the **effectual call** of the Holy Spirit.
    - This call is irresistible and always results in regeneration.
    - Hoekema distinguishes sharply between the general call of the gospel and the effectual call.
    - Only those who receive the effectual call are enabled to respond in faith.
    - "The effectual call is the first step in the application of salvation." ("Saved by Grace")

4. **Purpose of Common Grace in Redemptive History**
    - Common grace preserves the world for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.
    - It allows for cultural development and the restraint of evil.
    - Hoekema sees common grace as serving the church's mission by maintaining a context for gospel proclamation.
    - He affirms that all good gifts, even among the unregenerate, are from God.
    - "God’s common grace serves to preserve humanity until the full number of the elect is gathered in." ("Created in God's Image")

5. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagian Preparatory Grace**
    - Hoekema opposes any view that suggests humans can prepare themselves for grace.
    - He critiques Roman Catholic and Arminian notions of **prevenient grace** as insufficiently biblical.
    - Salvation is monergistic, not synergistic; God alone initiates and completes the work.
    - Any "preparation" for grace is itself the result of God's sovereign action.
    - "There is no room for a synergistic cooperation in the initial stages of salvation." ("Saved by Grace")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s rigorous distinction between **common grace** and **special grace** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the doctrine of grace and the ordo salutis. His insistence on the monergistic nature of salvation and the inability of common grace to prepare sinners for regeneration has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking clarity on the boundaries of grace in Reformed soteriology. His careful articulation continues to inform debates on the relationship between God’s universal benevolence and the particularity of saving grace.
