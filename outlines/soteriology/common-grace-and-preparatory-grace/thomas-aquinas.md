# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced account of **grace**, distinguishing between **common (or prevenient) grace** and **sanctifying grace**. He taught that **natural reason** and **virtue** are possible through God's general gifts to all humanity, but that **preparatory grace** is necessary to dispose the soul for the reception of **saving grace**. Aquinas’s synthesis of **nature and grace** remains foundational for later discussions on the gradations and operations of grace.

- "Man cannot prepare himself for the light of grace except insofar as he is moved by God." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 6)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Nature and Grace**
    - Human nature, though wounded by sin, retains certain capacities due to **common grace**.
    - **Grace** does not destroy nature but perfects it, elevating it to its supernatural end.
    - Natural virtues and knowledge are possible apart from **sanctifying grace**.
    - **Preparatory grace** is required for the soul to be disposed toward justification.
    - "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 1, a. 8)

2. **Prevenient (Preparatory) Grace**
    - God moves the will prior to any human act toward salvation.
    - **Preparatory grace** enables the first turning of the soul toward God.
    - This grace is entirely unmerited and precedes any cooperation.
    - It is necessary because of the incapacity of fallen human nature to initiate salvation.
    - "No one can begin to will or to do good without God’s preventing grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 6)

3. **Common Grace and Natural Virtue**
    - All people receive certain gifts from God enabling civil order and moral action.
    - **Common grace** allows for genuine, though limited, virtue among non-believers.
    - Such virtue is insufficient for attaining supernatural beatitude.
    - These gifts are ordered to the preservation of creation and society.
    - "Even after sin, man retains a certain natural good, namely, his natural knowledge and will." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 85, a. 2)

4. **Necessity of Sanctifying Grace for Salvation**
    - **Sanctifying grace** is required for the soul to be justified and united to God.
    - **Preparatory grace** disposes but does not itself justify.
    - Only through the infusion of sanctifying grace does one become truly righteous.
    - Human cooperation is possible only after the initial movement by grace.
    - "The justification of the ungodly requires the movement of God infusing grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 3)

5. **Synergy of Divine and Human Action**
    - God’s grace precedes, accompanies, and follows every good act.
    - Human free will is real but always dependent on God’s prior movement.
    - **Preparatory grace** enables the will to cooperate with subsequent grace.
    - The process of justification involves both divine initiative and human response.
    - "God works in us both to will and to accomplish." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 111, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s distinctions between **common grace**, **preparatory grace**, and **sanctifying grace** profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian theology. His synthesis of **nature and grace** provided a framework for later debates on the relationship between human ability and divine initiative. Reformed and Protestant theologians often engaged Aquinas critically, but his careful articulation of grace’s gradations remains a touchstone in discussions of **prevenient grace** and the order of salvation.
