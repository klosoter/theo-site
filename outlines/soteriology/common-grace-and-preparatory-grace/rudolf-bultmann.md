# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the issues of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation of the New Testament. He was skeptical of any notion of universal or preparatory grace as a metaphysical reality, instead emphasizing the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with the **Word of God** as the locus of divine action. For Bultmann, grace is not a general or preparatory phenomenon but is experienced only in the existential response of faith.

- "Man does not possess a capacity for God; he is confronted by the word of God as one who is wholly incapable of understanding or accepting it." ("New Testament and Mythology," in Kerygma and Myth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
    - Denies that human reason or nature provides access to God apart from revelation.
    - Critiques any notion of **common grace** as a natural capacity for God.
    - Emphasizes the radical otherness of God and the necessity of revelation.
    - Argues that all knowledge of God is mediated through the **kerygma**.
    - "There is no point at which man can grasp God or his grace apart from the word." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization and Existential Encounter**
    - Insists that biblical language about grace must be interpreted existentially, not metaphysically.
    - Views grace as an event in which the individual is addressed by God in the present.
    - Rejects preparatory stages of grace as objective realities.
    - Focuses on the existential decision in response to the proclamation.
    - "Faith is not a religious disposition but the response to the call of God in the kerygma." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Grace as Event, Not Substance**
    - Understands grace as the act of God confronting the individual through the Word.
    - Rejects the idea of grace as a quality or substance imparted to humanity.
    - Sees no preparatory process leading up to grace; it is always a new event.
    - The encounter with grace is always disruptive and transformative.
    - "Grace is not a thing given, but the event of God’s address." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Radical Inability and the Necessity of Revelation**
    - Humanity is wholly incapable of preparing itself for God’s grace.
    - There is no inherent point of contact between human nature and divine grace.
    - The initiative is entirely God’s, breaking into human existence from outside.
    - Any notion of preparatory grace undermines the radical nature of revelation.
    - "Man is closed to God except where God himself opens the way." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Faith as the Only Response to Grace**
    - Only through faith, awakened by the proclamation, does grace become effective.
    - Rejects any gradation or stages leading up to faith (i.e., no preparatory grace).
    - Faith is a decision, not a process or natural development.
    - The moment of faith is the moment of grace; there is no prior preparation.
    - "Faith arises only where the word is heard and accepted in obedience." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **grace** challenged traditional doctrines of **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, influencing both Protestant theology and New Testament studies. His emphasis on the radical discontinuity between God and humanity led to a reevaluation of the relationship between revelation and human nature. While his views were controversial, especially among confessional theologians, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the nature of grace, revelation, and the existential encounter with the divine. His legacy endures in debates over the relevance of **natural theology** and the interpretation of biblical texts in the modern era.
