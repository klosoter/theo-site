# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. addresses **common grace** and **preparatory grace** by emphasizing the redemptive-historical distinctiveness of **special grace** in Christ. He affirms God's general goodness to all humanity but insists that only the **Holy Spirit** working in union with Christ brings about salvation, maintaining a clear distinction between **common grace** and the **Reformed ordo salutis**.

- "Common grace is not a halfway house to special grace, nor does it in any way prepare sinners for salvation apart from the sovereign work of the Spirit." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Westminster Confession and the Relationship of Law and Gospel" (in various essays)
- "The Holy Spirit" (contributions in edited volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - Common grace is God's non-saving favor shown to all humanity, distinct from the saving grace given to the elect.
    - Special grace is exclusively mediated through union with Christ and the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
    - Common grace restrains sin and preserves order but does not move sinners toward salvation.
    - The distinction safeguards the uniqueness of redemption accomplished and applied.
    "Common grace and special grace must not be confused or blended in the application of redemption." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Preparatory Grace Is Not Salvific**
    - Gaffin rejects the idea that common or preparatory grace can make sinners more receptive to the gospel.
    - Any movement toward Christ is the result of effectual calling, not a prior, lesser grace.
    - The Reformed ordo salutis insists on the necessity of regeneration for any spiritual good.
    - There is no continuum from common to special grace; the transition is a sovereign act of God.
    "There is no gradation from common to special grace; the transition is radical and sovereign." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The history of redemption climaxes in Christ, and all saving grace is located in him.
    - Common grace is subordinate to the unfolding of special grace in redemptive history.
    - The eschatological new creation is the ultimate goal of special grace, not common grace.
    - The church is the locus of special grace, distinct from the broader world.
    "Redemptive history centers on Christ, and only in him is saving grace found." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is the exclusive agent of regeneration and saving faith.
    - Common grace does not impart the Spirit or any capacity for spiritual response.
    - The Spirit’s work in special grace is effectual, personal, and transformative.
    - Any spiritual preparation for salvation is the immediate result of the Spirit’s sovereign action.
    "The Spirit’s work is not preparatory but effectual in bringing about new life." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Guarding the Sovereignty of Grace**
    - Gaffin insists that grace is monergistic, not synergistic.
    - Any notion of preparatory grace that enables human cooperation undermines the sovereignty of God in salvation.
    - The Reformed doctrine of total depravity excludes the possibility of self-preparation for grace.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on God’s initiative, not on any humanly acquired disposition.
    "Salvation is of the Lord from beginning to end; grace is never a cooperative venture." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has reinforced the Reformed distinction between God's general benevolence and his saving work in Christ. His work has shaped contemporary discussions on the **ordo salutis**, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the nature of redemptive history. Gaffin’s influence is especially notable in debates over the relationship between law and gospel and the boundaries of Reformed soteriology. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the sovereignty and exclusivity of special grace within confessional Reformed theology.
