# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner developed a nuanced understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, emphasizing the ongoing presence of God's grace in the world even outside the boundaries of explicit Christian faith. He argued that while **general revelation** and **common grace** do not save, they maintain the possibility of human response to God and prepare the way for **special revelation**. Brunner’s approach sought to affirm the reality of human encounter with God in creation and conscience, while maintaining the necessity of Christ for salvation.

- "There is a preparatory grace, a prevenient grace, which does not save, but which makes salvation possible." ("The Mediator")

## Key Works

- "The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith"
- "Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge"
- "Man in Revolt: A Christian Anthropology"
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "Dogmatics, Volume I: The Christian Doctrine of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common grace as the preservation of creation**
    - God’s grace is universally operative, sustaining the world and restraining evil.
    - This grace is distinct from saving grace but is necessary for the ongoing existence of humanity.
    - Common grace allows for the possibility of truth, goodness, and beauty outside the church.
    - It maintains the order and structures of creation despite human sinfulness.
    - "God’s preserving grace is the foundation of all that is good in the world." ("Dogmatics I")

2. **Preparatory grace as enabling response**
    - Preparatory grace makes humans receptive to the gospel without effecting salvation itself.
    - It bridges the gap between human incapacity and the call of God in Christ.
    - This grace is seen in conscience, moral awareness, and the search for meaning.
    - It is a necessary precondition for the encounter with **special revelation**.
    - "Preparatory grace does not save, but it prepares the way for saving grace." ("The Mediator")

3. **General revelation’s real but limited efficacy**
    - Brunner affirms that God reveals Himself in nature, history, and conscience.
    - Such revelation is sufficient to hold humanity accountable but insufficient for salvation.
    - General revelation is a function of common and preparatory grace.
    - It points toward, but does not replace, the need for **special revelation** in Christ.
    - "General revelation is real, but it is not redemptive." ("Revelation and Reason")

4. **Humanity’s capacity for encounter**
    - Despite the fall, humans retain a capacity for encounter with God due to grace.
    - This capacity is not meritorious but is itself a work of God’s preparatory grace.
    - Brunner rejects total depravity in the sense of utter incapacity for God.
    - The human spirit remains open to God’s address through creation and conscience.
    - "Man is addressed by God even before he is redeemed by Him." ("Man in Revolt")

5. **Necessity of Christ for salvation**
    - All forms of grace outside Christ are non-saving and preparatory.
    - Brunner insists that only through Christ and the gospel is saving grace given.
    - Common and preparatory grace serve to direct humanity toward Christ.
    - The uniqueness of Christ is not compromised by the reality of grace outside the church.
    - "Only in Christ does grace become saving grace." ("The Mediator")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** influenced twentieth-century Protestant theology, especially in the dialogue between **Reformed** and **neo-orthodox** traditions. His insistence on the reality of general revelation and the preparatory work of God outside the church contributed to ecumenical discussions and debates with contemporaries like Karl Barth. Brunner’s thought remains significant for contemporary conversations on the relationship between nature and grace, and the possibility of truth and goodness beyond explicit Christian faith. His nuanced distinctions continue to shape theological reflection on the boundaries and universality of God’s grace.
