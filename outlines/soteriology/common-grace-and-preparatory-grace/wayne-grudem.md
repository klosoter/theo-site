# Wayne Grudem (1948– )

Wayne Grudem affirms the reality of **common grace** as God's undeserved favor given to all humanity, distinct from **saving grace** which leads to salvation. He recognizes **preparatory grace** as the work of the Holy Spirit in drawing people toward Christ, while maintaining a clear distinction between this and **regenerating grace**. Grudem emphasizes that common grace restrains sin and enables cultural good, but does not save.

- "Common grace is the grace of God by which he gives people innumerable blessings that are not part of salvation." ("Systematic Theology," p. 657)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (1994)
- Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith (1999)
- Christian Beliefs: Twenty Basics Every Christian Should Know (2005)
- "Common Grace" entry in the ESV Study Bible (2008)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace is Universal but Non-Saving**
    - God bestows blessings such as morality, knowledge, and societal order on all people.
    - These blessings are distinct from the **special grace** that leads to salvation.
    - Common grace explains the presence of good in non-believers and cultures.
    - It demonstrates God's patience and kindness toward the world.
    - "Common grace does not save people, but it is still a real grace from God." (Systematic Theology, p. 657)

2. **Preparatory Grace Precedes Regeneration**
    - The Holy Spirit may convict, enlighten, or draw individuals before conversion.
    - This grace is not effectual for salvation unless accompanied by **regenerating grace**.
    - Preparatory experiences can soften hearts or increase awareness of sin.
    - Grudem distinguishes this from the **effectual calling** that ensures salvation.
    - "There may be a kind of preparatory work of the Holy Spirit in people’s lives before they come to faith." (Systematic Theology, p. 700)

3. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - Common grace is given to all, while special grace is reserved for the elect.
    - Special grace results in salvation, whereas common grace does not.
    - The purposes and effects of each type of grace are fundamentally different.
    - This distinction safeguards the doctrine of **particular redemption**.
    - "Common grace is different from saving grace in its results and its recipients." (Systematic Theology, p. 657)

4. **Purpose of Common Grace Includes Restraining Sin**
    - God uses common grace to limit the effects of sin in the world.
    - This restraint allows for societal stability and human flourishing.
    - It provides a context for the proclamation of the **gospel**.
    - The restraint is temporary and does not change the sinful nature.
    - "God’s common grace restrains sin and maintains order in human society." (Systematic Theology, p. 658)

5. **Common Grace Demonstrates God’s Goodness and Justice**
    - The blessings of common grace reflect God's character to all people.
    - It serves as a testimony to God's generosity and patience.
    - Common grace leaves humanity without excuse for ingratitude.
    - It upholds God's justice in the eventual judgment of those who reject the gospel.
    - "The fact that God gives many blessings to unbelievers shows his goodness and mercy, even to those who do not deserve it." (Systematic Theology, p. 658)

## Legacy and Impact

Grudem’s articulation of **common grace** has influenced evangelical theology by providing a clear, accessible distinction between God’s general benevolence and his saving work. His systematic approach has shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between the church and culture, and the theological understanding of non-Christian virtue and achievement. Grudem’s work remains a standard reference for students and pastors seeking to understand the biblical basis and implications of God’s grace in its various forms.
