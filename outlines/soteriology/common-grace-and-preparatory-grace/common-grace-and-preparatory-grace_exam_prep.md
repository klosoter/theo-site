### ESSAY
The phrase common grace names a complex of divine favors that extend to all humans, elect and reprobate alike: the restraint of sin and judgment, the preservation of creaturely goods, the distribution of gifts and order, and the possibility of true, though not saving, knowledge of God. Preparatory grace names a different claim, namely that there are divine or human operations prior to regeneration that dispose the sinner for salvation as a condition for or contribution to the actual bestowal of saving grace. The test of a doctrine here is whether it honors the antithesis between belief and unbelief while explaining the real phenomena of civic righteousness, culture, conscience, and conviction; whether it safeguards the monergism of **effectual calling** while accounting for the pre-conversion awakenings the Scriptures and experience attest. I will argue that a robustly Reformed account affirms **common grace** as a covenantally ordered, Christologically mediated aspect of providence, grants real though non-saving goods to the unjust, and recognizes Spirit-wrought preludes to conversion, yet denies any synergistic **preparatory grace** that conditions or enables God’s regenerating work. The decisive line is not chronology but causal order: nothing in the sinner prepares God to save; God prepares the sinner when and as he saves through the **external call** and the **internal call**.

Augustine established the grammar. Against Pelagius and the softening pressures of Semi-Pelagianism, he argued that postlapsarian human will is incurvatus in se, ruined in its powers for God, and that only **prevenient** and **operative** grace can initiate and effect conversion. While he does not use the later Reformed phrase **common grace**, Augustine treats the cosmic order, political peace, and civil virtues as testimonies to God’s providence and beneficence toward the unrighteous. Roman order can be admirable without being unto God. He distinguishes between civic virtues that direct toward temporal peace and the theological virtue of charity that orders to God. In De Civitate Dei he insists that the two cities intermingle in history, sharing the use of earthly peace, while ordered to different ends. This is the seed of what later Reformed thinkers will call the common realm under **providence**, and it guards the category of genuine created good without eroding the antithesis of loves. On the other hand, Augustine refuses any suggestion that human acts can prepare the soul for grace. Grace precedes and creates the good will. The later Roman Catholic development of preparatory merit, even in its mitigated Thomistic form, runs against Augustine’s insistence that the move from death to life is God’s alone and that any prior moral seriousness apart from grace remains captive to pride. The Augustinian stress is critical: any Reformed doctrine of **preparatory grace** that leans toward cooperative causality betrays the ontology of sin and the causality of regeneration that Augustine nailed to the church’s conscience.

John Calvin consolidates and sharpens this line. In the Institutes he attributes to unregenerate humanity a capacity for arts, languages, laws, political wisdom, and even a disciplined form of virtue, and he calls these gifts the Spirit’s distributed endowments to humanity. The restraining work of the magistrate is a divine kindness. At the same time he insists on the **noetic effects of sin** and on the suppression of the knowledge of God. Thus Calvin embodies the paradox: the unbeliever can contribute to civic good and can know many truths, but he cannot convert himself, nor know God savingly, nor truly will God as God. Calvin also already draws the distinction between the **external call** of the word and the **internal call** effectuated by the Spirit. The law can produce fear and even a kind of repentance unto the avoidance of consequences, but only the Spirit writes the law on the heart. Calvin’s doctrine is not so much a treaty with a nature–grace schema as it is a natural outworking of **divine simplicity** and **providence**: the one God who is good does good to all his creatures while accomplishing the salvation of his elect. Common favors are real. Saving favors are qualitatively distinct. And while the law can strike the conscience and press the sinner toward the physician, the pressure does not prepare merit or co-cause life. Calvin’s occasional language of God’s “invitation” or “wooing” must be read under the rubric of the twofold call and the hiddenness of the elect. He anticipates, as a doctrinal trajectory, later disputes over **preparatory grace** within Puritanism and the Reformed orthodox by framing any pre-regenerate “motions” as effects of God’s governance, not human contributions.

Francis Turretin codifies the Reformed scholastic consensus with the distinctions the topic requires. His The Institutes of Elenctic Theology devotes careful attention to grace, drawing precise lines between gratia communis and gratia specialis, and then sharpening the point on gratia praeparatoria. Turretin’s method is to gather adversaria, define terms narrowly, test them against the confessional ordo salutis, and deploy an array of arguments from Scripture, anthropology, and the doctrine of God. He grants that there are pre-conversion dispositions, such as fear of judgment, sorrow for consequences, attentiveness to the word, and a certain moral sobriety. He assigns these effects either to **common grace**, through the word and providence, or to the **external call** joined to the Spirit’s non-saving operations. He denies that they are morally or causally preparatory in a way that conditions the Spirit’s regenerating act. In Reformed idiom: they are not dispositive causes of conversion but they can be occasions. The formal cause of conversion is God’s efficacious grace. Any talk of preparation is an improper locution unless cleared of synergism. Turretin’s polemical horizon includes Roman Catholic claims of congruent merit and Arminian notions of prevenient grace that restores libertas indifferentiae. Against both, he insists that human freedom is not indifference but spontaneity, and that the bondage of the will excludes any pre-elicited cooperation in regeneration. This is the doctrinal firewall that later debates about Puritan “preparationism” must respect. It also gives us the conceptual tools to deny an unbounded Kuyperianism that would smuggle common grace into soteriology.

Abraham Kuyper reframed the discussion by elevating **common grace** from a marginal note in providence to a structural doctrine undergirding culture, science, and public life. In his Lectures on Calvinism and in the multivolume Gemeene Gratie, he argued that after the fall God instituted a restraining order whereby sin’s effects are checked, human society is sustained, and a genuine cultural development is made possible. He tied **common grace** to the Noahic administration, saw it as an operation of the Spirit in the world at large, and made it the precondition for the Christian’s engagement with the arts, politics, and scholarship. Sphere sovereignty expresses how common grace differentiates domains of life and protects their integrity under God. Kuyper acknowledged the antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate, but he refused to let antithesis collapse culture into sectarian retreat. The 1924 Synod of the Christian Reformed Church formalized three points: God displays favor to all, restrains sin, and enables civic righteousness. Kuyper’s conceptual contribution is decisive because it relocates **common grace** from the periphery to the architecture of a Reformed worldview, with direct implications for political theology, education, and science. It also provoked internal contestation. Herman Hoeksema rejected the notion that God favors the reprobate at any level, thereby attacking the first plank of 1924. In Hoeksema’s reading, rain on the unjust is not favor but a more aggravated occasion for judgment. He feared that common grace softens the antithesis and nurtures theological liberalism. Kuyperians countered that Scripture’s explicit language of divine kindness, patience, and goodness toward the unjust obligates us to speak of favor, while refusing to confuse it with election or reconciliation. The examiner will likely press you here: does Kuyper make **common grace** a bridge to **special grace**? The answer must be no. Kuyper narrates how common grace sustains the theater in which special grace saves, but he never makes the former an instrumental cause of the latter. If some of his rhetoric about the Spirit’s general operations suggests soteriological ambiguity, the careful reader will maintain Turretin’s causal lines and Kuypers’s cultural insight.

Cornelius Van Til supplies the epistemological grammar for this balancing act, particularly salient for Westminster examiners. Van Til insists on the antithesis between belief and unbelief as principial. Because of **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction, all human knowledge of God is **analogical knowledge**, true yet never univocal with God’s self-knowledge. Sin introduces a radical ethical antithesis in all thinking. Yet Van Til also affirms **common grace** as that by which God restrains the noetic catastrophe and grants the unbeliever to know many truths and even to know something of God, such that all are without excuse. This yields the **point of contact**: not a neutral zone, but the unbeliever himself as image of God under covenant, who knows God and suppresses the truth. Apologetically, one can press the unbeliever precisely because **common grace** ensures that human rationality still functions and because the moral world remains ordered. Van Til refuses to soften antithesis into neutrality, but he equally refuses to sever common operations from real knowledge. He thus recovers Augustine and Calvin for a late modern setting, while resisting both the Roman Catholic attempt to erect a natural theology without presupposing revelation and the Barthian demolition of any nature–grace grammar. He also answers Hoeksema’s fear by locating common grace within the Creator’s sovereign plan rather than within an autonomous sphere. Commonness is a mode of **providence** and a temporary economy under Christ’s mediatorial kingship that serves the ingathering of the elect and the display of God’s justice.

The internal Reformed debates over preparationism need sober adjudication. Puritan divines such as William Perkins and Thomas Hooker spoke of preparatory works that God ordinarily uses before conversion, including conviction of sin, fear of hell, and reformation of life. Later, Jonathan Edwards wrestled with the religious affections and distinguished truly gracious affections from those that arise from natural principles. The pastoral wisdom was to avoid promoting a false security while naming the Spirit’s awakenings short of regeneration. The danger was that in some practical preaching, the language of necessary prerequisites crept in, tilted toward a psychological or moral conditioning of grace. The best of the Reformed orthodox, following Turretin, insisted that these are not meritorious or causally conditioning. The examiner may demand whether one can call these activities grace at all. The defensible answer is to tie them either to **common grace** or to the **external call**, refusing to grant them a place in the **ordo salutis** as if they stood as formal steps before **effectual calling**. The Holy Spirit is free. He can convert the jailer in one night or educate a Nicodemus over time; in neither case is the prior moral state a cause. In this sense, we deny **preparatory grace** as a synergistic doctrine while acknowledging pre-conversion operations as real and divinely caused.

At the boundary with external debates, Roman Catholic theology, especially as articulated in Trent and expanded in scholastic treatments, introduces the idea of gratia praeveniens that disposes the will to cooperate with further grace, sometimes under the rubric of congruent merit. The Reformed rejection targets the causal structure. To say that certain acts, even if elicited by grace, are more congruent and so draw further grace is to smuggle in cooperative causality that conditions the divine gift. Here the Reformed insist on **irresistible grace** as God’s efficacious action that overcomes resistance and enlivens the will unto faith. Arminian prevenient grace similarly proposes a universally bestowed enabling that restores libertarian freedom, leaving the decisive turn to the sinner. The Reformed response returns to the anthropology of **total depravity** and to the monergism of the new birth. Christ’s word that no one can come unless drawn, and that all whom the Father gives will come, rules out any distributive schema that conditions effectivity on human compliance. Barth adds a different external pressure by denying any stable nature–grace structure, making revelation sheer event. While Barth’s zeal to center revelation is salutary, his demolition complicates the theological account of natural goods, domesticates creation within reconciliation, and interrupts **natural law** as a common grammar. The Reformed insistence that creation and covenant are not dissolved by redemption but presupposed by it underwrites common norms while maintaining the radicality of **special grace**.

Contemporary debates intensify older lines. The retrieval of **natural law** among Reformed thinkers asks whether there are universal moral norms accessible to reason and binding in pluralistic societies. A Kuypers–Van Til synthesis can affirm natural law as a common good under the Noahic covenant while refusing any epistemic autonomy. The moral law is written on the heart and known, albeit suppressed. Civil polity can rightly draft laws against theft and murder without confessing Nicene orthodoxy. This has immediate implications for political theology, especially in contexts of deep pluralism: **common grace** gives warrant for cooperation in civic righteousness, for alliances across confessions in matters of justice, for participation in the arts and sciences, for gratitude when unbelieving neighbors demonstrate self-sacrifice. The antithesis is not thereby erased, because ends remain divergent and sin perverts. In the academy, **common grace** should embolden Christians to practice patient, critical collaboration in science and the humanities, resisting both separatism and naïve assimilation. In the counseling of converts, the psychology of moral awakening and conviction must be framed as the Spirit’s use of law and providence rather than as a ladder of preparation. The pastor must name false signs with Edwards and press to the cross. In evangelism, the doctrine grants courage: every image bearer has a **point of contact**; you do not address an empty canvas but a contested conscience. The practical upshot is that “pre-evangelism” is not a neutral rationalism but an aggressive, gracious encounter with the truths the unbeliever already knows and suppresses by **common grace**. 

A potential examiner objection is that robust **common grace** seems to risk universalism by making divine favor too expansive. The answer is to anchor common grace covenantally in the **Noahic covenant**, as many Reformed theologians including Meredith Kline have argued, and to insist that its telos is preservation, not redemption. Christ as mediator of creation upholds the world for the sake of his redemptive purpose. The scope of temporal favor does not index the scope of **special grace**. Another objection asks whether unbelievers can perform any good work. The answer is to distinguish orders and ends. In the civil order, unbelievers can perform works that conform to the law and are relatively good, because the law is good and the image remains. Before God as judge, those works lack charity and faith and so cannot please God in the theological sense. Yet they are to be commended, used, and even learned from under **common grace**. A third objection presses whether granting the reality of pre-conversion operations undercuts the exclusivity of **irresistible grace**. Here the answer is Turretin’s and Calvin’s: the operations are real and can be both intense and extensive, but they do not cross the ontological threshold of regeneration. Hebrews speaks of those who taste and share in common operations and yet fall away. The line is God’s to draw, and the pastor’s to respect.

If the arguments stand, then the defended position can be stated thus. **Common grace** is a mode of God’s **providence** whereby he preserves, orders, and enriches the created order after the fall, restrains sin, distributes gifts and knowledge, and provides a platform for civic righteousness, learning, and culture. It is covenantally grounded in the order established with Noah and Christologically mediated by the one Lord through whom all things are upheld. It guarantees no salvation, creates no saving disposition, and is not a half-way house to the new birth. **Preparatory grace**, if it means any creaturely disposition that conditions **effectual calling**, must be rejected as synergistic. The Spirit’s pre-conversion operations through law, conscience, and providence are real and often necessary pastorally, but they are effects of divine mercy that do not contribute to or cause conversion; they are either aspects of **common grace** or the **external call**. The **internal call** and regeneration belong to **special grace** alone and are efficacious. Apologetically, **common grace** establishes a **point of contact** without conceding neutrality; ethically, it grounds **natural law** as accessible and binding; politically, it authorizes principled cooperation in just causes without diluting the antithesis of ultimate ends.

This doctrine integrates seamlessly with adjacent loci. Under **divine simplicity**, God’s favor is one, though diversely ordered in its effects toward creatures, and his will to save the elect does not require denying his creaturely kindness to the reprobate. In **anthropology**, the image of God remains after the fall, ensuring the capacity for culture and law, while **total depravity** describes the moral inability to turn to God. In **covenant theology**, the universal covenant with Noah frames preservation, while the Abrahamic and new covenants frame redemption. In the **ordo salutis**, **effectual calling** is monergistic and precedes in causal order any acts of faith and repentance. In **ecclesiology**, the church lives in two ages, gratefully receiving common goods while stewarding the **means of grace** as the unique instruments of salvation. In **mission**, the church expects and seeks pre-conversion awakenings, yet ascribes conversion solely to God.

When examiners press, keep the through-lines. The antithesis is ethical and eschatological, not metaphysical: unbelievers remain image bearers in God’s world. There is no **preparatory grace** that sets terms for God; there is preparatory providence and preparatory conviction that sets the sinner under God’s terms. Kuyper’s cultural confidence stands only when chained to Turretin’s soteriological precision and interpreted through Van Til’s denial of neutrality. Augustine’s grace rules out Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian schemes, while Calvin’s twofold call disciplines pastoral expectations. The relevance today is as sharp as ever: a Reformed doctrine of **common grace** can produce cultural humility, political patience, and missionary nerve, precisely because it refuses to mistake common goods for saving goods. By preserving this distinction and locating all real good under the one Lord, the doctrine allows the church to say yes and no, to bless and to confront, to cooperate and to witness, without confusing the orders. That ambidexterity is not a compromise but the fruit of theological clarity.

### RECAP NOTES
- Definition: **Common grace** is God’s providential favor that restrains sin, preserves order, and grants true though non-saving goods to all; **preparatory grace**, if construed as a creaturely condition for **effectual calling**, is denied, while acknowledging Spirit-wrought pre-conversion operations as non-meritorious and subordinate to **special grace**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: grace precedes and effects conversion; civic goods are real but ordered to temporal peace, not salvation.
  - Calvin: civic righteousness and knowledge as Spirit’s gifts; strict divide between **external** and **internal call**.
  - Turretin: formal distinction between **common** and **special grace**; rejects gratia praeparatoria as synergistic; pre-conversion effects are occasions, not causes.
  - Kuyper: elevated **common grace** to cultural architecture; sphere sovereignty; 1924 three points; must not collapse into soteriology.
  - Van Til: principial antithesis with a **point of contact** via **common grace**; no neutrality; affirms true but analogical knowledge.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Kuyper versus Hoeksema on divine favor; Puritan preparationism constrained by monergism; framing under the **Noahic covenant**.
  - External: Roman Catholic and Arminian preparatory schemes rejected for synergism; Barth’s nature–grace collapse resisted.
  - Contemporary: natural law retrieval under **common grace**; pluralism and political cooperation; evangelism and conversion psychology; apologetics without neutrality.
- Defended position: Robust, covenantally grounded **common grace**; absolute monergism in **effectual calling**; deny synergistic **preparatory grace** while recognizing pre-conversion convictions as real divine operations that do not condition salvation.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does common grace imply divine favor to the reprobate? Yes, temporal favor under **providence**, not salvific love.
  - Are unbelievers’ good works truly good? Civilly good and to be commended, but not God-pleasing without faith.
  - Do pre-conversion awakenings prepare for grace? They are divine operations and occasions, not causal conditions of regeneration.
  - Is there neutral ground in apologetics? No; the **point of contact** arises from **common grace** and suppressed knowledge.
  - How does common grace relate to the Noahic covenant? It is its covenantal frame, ordering preservation for redemptive ends.
