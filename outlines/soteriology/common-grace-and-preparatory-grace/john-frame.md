# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **common grace** and **preparatory grace** through the lens of his **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the multifaceted ways in which God relates to creation. He affirms that **common grace** restrains sin and enables cultural development, while **preparatory grace** refers to God's work in bringing individuals toward saving faith, though never apart from the necessity of **regeneration**. Frame insists that all grace, whether common or special, is ultimately rooted in God's sovereign purpose and serves to display His glory.

- "Common grace is God’s favor shown to all people, restraining sin and enabling cultural achievements, but it does not save." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Divine Favor to All**
    - God bestows **non-saving blessings** on all humanity, including unbelievers.
    - These blessings include the restraint of sin, societal order, and cultural achievements.
    - Common grace is distinct from **saving grace** but flows from the same divine goodness.
    - It demonstrates God's patience and kindness, even toward those who ultimately reject Him.
    - "God’s common grace is his goodness to all, not leading to salvation but making life possible and bearable." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Preparatory Grace and the Ordo Salutis**
    - **Preparatory grace** refers to God's providential acts that lead individuals toward the gospel.
    - It includes external influences such as Christian upbringing, conscience, and exposure to Scripture.
    - Preparatory grace is not effectual for salvation apart from **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
    - Frame warns against confusing preparatory grace with **prevenient grace** in Arminian theology.
    - "God may prepare people for salvation in many ways, but only regeneration brings new life." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Triperspectival Analysis of Grace**
    - Frame interprets grace through **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives.
    - Common and preparatory grace are understood in relation to God’s law, the world, and the individual.
    - This approach highlights the complexity and unity of God’s gracious dealings.
    - It guards against reductionism in understanding the scope and purpose of grace.
    - "We must see grace as multifaceted, touching every aspect of human existence." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Sovereignty of God in All Grace**
    - All forms of grace, whether common or special, are rooted in God’s sovereign will.
    - God dispenses grace according to His purpose, not human merit or initiative.
    - The distinction between common and special grace serves God’s redemptive plan.
    - Frame emphasizes that even common grace ultimately serves to glorify God.
    - "God’s sovereignty is the foundation of every gracious act, whether saving or not." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Antithesis and the Limits of Common Grace**
    - Frame affirms the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, even amidst common grace.
    - Common grace does not erase the fundamental spiritual divide established by the fall.
    - Cultural achievements by unbelievers are real but do not bridge the gap to saving faith.
    - The reality of common grace should not lead to theological compromise with secularism.
    - "Common grace does not eliminate the antithesis between the church and the world." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s nuanced articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially among those seeking to integrate doctrinal precision with practical engagement in culture. His **triperspectivalism** provides a flexible yet robust framework for understanding the diversity of God’s gracious dealings with humanity. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between the church and the world, emphasizing both the reality of God’s universal kindness and the necessity of **regeneration** for salvation.
