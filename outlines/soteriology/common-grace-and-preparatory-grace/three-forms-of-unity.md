# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the reality of **common grace** as God’s general favor and goodness to all humanity, while sharply distinguishing it from **saving (special) grace**. These confessions also address **preparatory grace** in the context of human inability and the necessity of **regeneration** for salvation, rejecting any notion that fallen humans can prepare themselves for grace apart from the Spirit’s work.

- "Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are by nature children of wrath, incapable of any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their sins, and slaves to sin; and without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit they neither will nor can return to God, reform their distorted nature, or dispose themselves to reform." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.3)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–16, 24
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 8, 21, 60, 65
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- Cornelis P. Venema, But for the Grace of God: An Exposition of the Canons of Dort

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as God’s Universal Goodness**
    - God shows **goodness, patience, and providence** to all people, not only the elect.
    - This grace restrains sin and enables civil order and culture.
    - It does not confer **saving faith** or spiritual renewal.
    - Common grace is distinguished from the **effectual call** and regeneration.
    - "He showers his gifts on all people, but especially on his own children." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 27)

2. **Total Inability Without Regenerating Grace**
    - Humanity is **dead in sin** and incapable of any saving good.
    - No one can prepare themselves for grace by their own efforts.
    - The **Holy Spirit’s regenerating work** is necessary for any movement toward God.
    - Even the first motions toward faith are gifts of grace.
    - "Without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit they neither will nor can return to God." (Canons of Dort III/IV.3)

3. **Preparatory Grace is Entirely Monergistic**
    - Any preparation for salvation is the result of God’s initiative.
    - The confessions reject the idea that humans can cooperate with grace prior to regeneration.
    - **Effectual calling** is solely the work of God’s Spirit.
    - All boasting in human preparation is excluded.
    - "Faith is not from ourselves, but it is the gift of God." (Canons of Dort III/IV.14)

4. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - **Common grace** pertains to temporal blessings and the restraint of evil.
    - **Special (saving) grace** brings about faith, repentance, and salvation.
    - The confessions maintain a clear boundary between these two operations of God.
    - Only special grace results in union with Christ.
    - "God grants his Spirit to the elect, working in them true conversion." (Canons of Dort III/IV.10)

5. **Means of Grace and the Role of the Word**
    - The **Word of God** is the ordinary means by which grace is dispensed.
    - The Spirit uses the Word to effectually call and regenerate the elect.
    - The external call may be heard by all, but only the elect receive it savingly.
    - The confessions emphasize the necessity of preaching and sacraments.
    - "Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 65)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of **common grace** and the utter necessity of **regenerating grace** for salvation. Their clear distinction between common and special grace has influenced later debates on the relationship between nature and grace, and their monergistic stance on preparatory grace remains foundational in confessional Reformed circles. These confessions continue to serve as doctrinal standards, ensuring clarity on the limits of human ability and the sovereignty of divine grace.
