# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **common grace** and **preparatory grace** through his distinctive **eschatological theology**, emphasizing the **universality of God's redemptive action**. He understands grace as active in all creation, not only sustaining life but also preparing the world for the **coming Kingdom of God**. For Moltmann, grace is not confined to the church but is a dynamic force drawing all people and creation toward reconciliation and hope.

- "God’s Spirit is present in all things, opening them up for the future of God’s kingdom." (The Spirit of Life)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation (1991)
- God in Creation (1985)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universal Scope of Grace**
    - God's grace extends to all humanity and creation, not only the elect.
    - **Common grace** is God's sustaining and renewing presence in the world.
    - Grace prepares the world for **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ.
    - The Spirit works beyond the boundaries of the visible church.
    - "The Spirit of God is the power of life, present in all living things." (The Spirit of Life)

2. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Grace is fundamentally oriented toward the future and the coming Kingdom.
    - **Preparatory grace** anticipates God's final reconciliation.
    - History moves toward a universal consummation in Christ.
    - The church participates as a sign and instrument of this movement.
    - "Christian faith lives from the raising of the crucified Christ, and strains after the promises of the universal future of Christ." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of both common and preparatory grace.
    - The Spirit's presence is not confined to believers but is active in the world.
    - The Spirit prepares hearts and societies for the reception of the gospel.
    - This work of the Spirit anticipates the **new creation**.
    - "The Spirit is the power of hope, the force that draws all things into the future of God." (The Spirit of Life)

4. **Creation and Redemption Interconnected**
    - **Common grace** is rooted in God's ongoing relationship with creation.
    - Redemption is the fulfillment, not the negation, of creation.
    - The world is the arena of God's preparatory work for salvation.
    - Grace affirms the goodness and purpose of creation.
    - "Creation and redemption are not two separate acts of God, but one and the same process." (God in Creation)

5. **Dialogical Openness**
    - Moltmann affirms the presence of grace in non-Christian religions and cultures.
    - **Preparatory grace** operates wherever there is longing for justice, peace, and hope.
    - This openness affirms God's universal outreach while maintaining the uniqueness of Christ.
    - Dialogue with the world helps discern the Spirit's preparatory work.
    - "The Spirit goes before us, preparing the world for the coming of Christ." (Experiences in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has broadened Reformed discussions by emphasizing the **universal and eschatological dimensions** of God’s action in the world. His work has influenced ecumenical dialogue, liberation theology, and contemporary debates on the relationship between creation and redemption. By rooting grace in the Spirit’s universal presence, Moltmann challenges the church to recognize God’s work beyond its own boundaries and to participate in the hope of the coming Kingdom. His vision continues to inspire theological engagement with issues of justice, ecology, and global reconciliation.
