# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth decisively rejected the traditional Reformed doctrines of **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, arguing that all grace is found exclusively in **Jesus Christ** and is thus always particular, never general. For Barth, any notion of a grace that operates outside or prior to the self-revelation of God in Christ undermines the radical **sovereignty of divine revelation** and the total dependence of humanity on God's initiative.

- "There is no such thing as a preparatio evangelica or a preparatio fidei; there is only the grace of God which is Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Church Dogmatics I/2 (The Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Church Dogmatics II/1 (The Doctrine of God)
- "No!" (Barth’s response to Emil Brunner in Natural Theology)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is exclusively in Christ**
   - All knowledge of God is mediated through the **self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ**.
   - There is no natural or preparatory knowledge of God apart from Christ.
   - Any so-called "common grace" is subsumed under the one grace revealed in Christ.
   - Barth opposes any dualism between nature and grace.
   - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God whom we have to hear and whom we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of autonomous natural theology**
   - Barth denies the validity of any **natural theology** or human capacity to prepare for grace.
   - Human reason and culture cannot serve as a foundation for receiving divine grace.
   - All attempts to find God apart from revelation are idolatrous.
   - The knowledge of God is always a miracle of grace, not a human achievement.
   - "The revelation of God does not allow itself to be anticipated by any human preparation." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Grace is always particular, never general**
   - Barth insists that **grace** is not a general quality distributed to all, but is always the concrete act of God in Christ.
   - There is no "common" or "preparatory" grace that precedes or enables saving grace.
   - The distinction between common and special grace is rejected as unbiblical.
   - All true grace is identical with the event of Christ’s coming and work.
   - "Grace is not a quality, nor is it a substance; it is the living act of God Himself." (Church Dogmatics II/1)

4. **Sinful incapacity and the need for divine initiative**
   - Humanity is utterly incapable of moving toward God apart from God’s own action.
   - There is no human capacity or disposition that can be prepared for grace.
   - The **radicality of sin** means that only God’s sovereign act can bring about salvation.
   - Any doctrine of preparatory grace diminishes the seriousness of human sinfulness.
   - "Man cannot prepare himself for the Word of God; he can only receive it as a gift." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

5. **Critique of traditional Reformed distinctions**
   - Barth challenges the classic Reformed distinction between **common grace** and **special grace**.
   - He sees such distinctions as compromising the uniqueness of Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - Theological systems that posit preparatory stages to grace are, for Barth, forms of semi-Pelagianism.
   - True theology must begin and end with the event of God’s self-revelation in Christ.
   - "The grace of God is not a presupposition, but a conclusion; not a possibility, but a reality in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Protestant theology, especially in its critique of **natural theology** and human religious capacity. His Christocentric approach reoriented discussions of grace, revelation, and salvation, challenging both liberal and traditional Reformed positions. Barth’s influence endures in debates over the relationship between revelation, grace, and human nature, and his work remains a touchstone for those who emphasize the absolute priority of divine initiative in salvation.
