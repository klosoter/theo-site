# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a nuanced understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within his broader doctrine of **providence** and **salvation**. While he affirmed that God bestows certain gifts and benefits upon all humanity, Calvin distinguished these from the **saving grace** reserved for the elect, emphasizing the limits of human response apart from **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.

- "There is a universal call, by which God, through the external preaching of the word, invites all men alike, even those for whom he designs it as a savour of death, and the ground of a severer condemnation." (Institutes 3.24.8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Universal Goodness in Creation**
    - God’s **providence** extends to all people, sustaining creation and bestowing gifts.
    - Human faculties such as reason, culture, and civil order are expressions of God’s goodness to all.
    - These benefits are not salvific but serve to restrain evil and promote societal flourishing.
    - The distinction between **common grace** and **special grace** is maintained.
    - "Whenever we come upon these matters in secular writers, let that admirable light of truth shining in them teach us that the mind of man, though fallen and perverted from its wholeness, is nevertheless clothed and ornamented with God’s excellent gifts." (Institutes 2.2.15)

2. **Distinction Between Common and Saving Grace**
    - **Common grace** refers to God’s non-saving gifts to all humanity.
    - **Saving grace** is effectual and reserved for the elect, resulting in regeneration and faith.
    - No amount of common grace can lead to salvation apart from the Spirit’s work.
    - The external call of the gospel is genuinely offered but only efficacious for the elect.
    - "The Spirit is promised to none except to God’s children, who are to be renewed to a holy and blameless life." (Institutes 3.1.2)

3. **Preparatory Grace and Human Inability**
    - Calvin denied that fallen humans can prepare themselves for grace by their own efforts.
    - Any movement toward God is itself the result of **prevenient grace**.
    - The will is bound and cannot cooperate with grace prior to regeneration.
    - God alone initiates and completes the work of salvation.
    - "Man is so enslaved by the yoke of sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or actual pursuit." (Institutes 2.3.5)

4. **Means of Grace and the External Call**
    - The preaching of the Word and sacraments are means by which God calls all people.
    - The **external call** is universal, but only the **internal call** by the Spirit is effective.
    - The sacraments and Word may have a restraining or preparatory effect, but not saving apart from faith.
    - The distinction upholds God’s justice and the sincerity of the gospel offer.
    - "The word of God is like the sun, shining on all, but it only gives sight to those whom the Lord opens their eyes." (Commentary on Isaiah 6:9-10)

5. **Purpose of Common Grace in God’s Redemptive Plan**
    - Common grace serves to preserve the world for the sake of the elect.
    - It provides a context for the spread of the gospel and the church’s mission.
    - God’s patience with the reprobate demonstrates his mercy and justice.
    - The blessings of common grace leave humanity without excuse before God.
    - "God holds out the light of his truth indiscriminately to all, but it is only the elect whom he enlightens." (Institutes 3.24.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **common grace** and the limits of **preparatory grace** profoundly shaped later Reformed theology, especially in debates over the extent of God’s benevolence toward the non-elect. His careful distinction between **common** and **saving grace** influenced the development of covenant theology and the doctrine of effectual calling. Calvin’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between grace, human responsibility, and the universality of God’s gifts.
