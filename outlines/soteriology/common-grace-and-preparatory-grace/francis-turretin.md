# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading voice in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a nuanced doctrine of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within the broader framework of **covenant theology**. He maintained a sharp distinction between the **saving grace** reserved for the elect and the **non-saving operations** of the Spirit that restrain evil, promote civil order, and prepare some for the reception of the gospel, without effecting regeneration.

- "There is a certain general grace which is extended to all men, by which God restrains sin and promotes civil good, but it is not saving grace." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 8–10)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (Richard A. Muller, ed.)
- The Doctrine of the Atonement and Its Application (secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
    - Common grace is given to all humanity, restraining sin and enabling civil virtue.
    - Special (saving) grace is bestowed only on the elect and leads to regeneration.
    - Common grace does not confer spiritual life or faith.
    - Both graces flow from God's goodness, but with distinct ends and effects.
    - "Common grace is not sufficient for salvation, but only for the preservation of order and the restraint of evil." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Preparatory Grace as Non-Efficacious**
    - Preparatory grace may dispose or prepare a person for the gospel externally.
    - It does not guarantee or effect conversion or regeneration.
    - Such grace includes external calls, moral persuasion, and conviction of sin.
    - Only efficacious grace, not preparatory, brings about saving faith.
    - "Preparatory grace leaves the will still impotent and unwilling to turn to God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Role of the Law and Conscience**
    - The natural law and conscience are means by which common grace operates.
    - These restrain outward sin and promote social order among all people.
    - The law convicts of sin but cannot regenerate or justify.
    - The universal moral sense is a fruit of God’s common goodness.
    - "The law is a schoolmaster, but it cannot give life." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Divine Sovereignty in the Distribution of Grace**
    - God freely dispenses common and special grace according to His will.
    - No one has a claim on grace; all is of divine mercy.
    - The distinction upholds God’s justice and the gratuity of election.
    - The limitation of saving grace to the elect magnifies God’s sovereignty.
    - "Grace is not owed to any, but is given according to the counsel of God’s will." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagianism**
    - Turretin opposes the idea that humans can cooperate with grace in their own strength.
    - Preparatory acts do not contribute to regeneration or merit saving grace.
    - All movement toward God is initiated and completed by the Spirit.
    - Any ability to respond savingly is itself a gift of efficacious grace.
    - "Man cannot prepare himself for grace, for even the first motions to good are from God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions regarding **common grace** and **preparatory grace** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy, especially in debates over the extent and purpose of God’s favor toward the non-elect. His influence is evident in the formulations of the **Westminster Standards** and in the polemics against both Arminianism and Roman Catholic synergism. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the sovereignty of grace and the necessity of regeneration for salvation.
