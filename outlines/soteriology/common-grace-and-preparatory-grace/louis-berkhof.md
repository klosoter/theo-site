# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine of common grace**, distinguishing it sharply from **special (saving) grace**. He emphasized that **common grace** restrains sin and enables cultural development, while **preparatory grace** refers to non-saving influences that may precede regeneration but do not guarantee conversion. Berkhof’s careful delineation of these categories helped clarify the boundaries between God’s general benevolence and His effectual work in salvation.

- "Common grace is the grace of God by which He gives His people innumerable blessings that are not part of salvation." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially chapters on Common Grace and the Ordo Salutis)
- The History of Christian Doctrines
- Manual of Christian Doctrine
- Introductory Volume to Systematic Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace is Distinct from Special Grace**
    - Common grace is universal and non-saving, while special grace is particular and salvific.
    - It restrains the effects of **sin** in the world and enables societal good.
    - Special grace alone results in **regeneration** and **faith**.
    - The two must not be confused, as only special grace leads to salvation.
    - "Common grace does not remove the guilt of sin nor renew human nature." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Common Grace Restrains Sin and Promotes Good**
    - God’s common grace limits the expression of human depravity.
    - It enables moral order, justice, and cultural achievements among the unregenerate.
    - This grace is seen in the conscience, civil government, and societal institutions.
    - It is a manifestation of God’s goodness to all humanity.
    - "It is due to common grace that sin does not make human society impossible." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Preparatory Grace Precedes but Does Not Ensure Salvation**
    - Preparatory grace includes non-saving influences such as conviction of sin and moral enlightenment.
    - These influences may make one receptive to the gospel but are not effectual for salvation.
    - Only the **effectual call** and **regenerating grace** bring about true conversion.
    - Preparatory grace is often mistaken for saving grace but lacks its efficacy.
    - "Preparatory grace is not sufficient to bring man to a saving knowledge of Christ." (Systematic Theology)

4. **The Purpose of Common Grace is the Preservation of the World**
    - God uses common grace to preserve creation and maintain order until the consummation.
    - It serves the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan by sustaining the world for the elect.
    - Common grace allows for the development of culture, science, and the arts.
    - It is ultimately subordinate to God’s purpose in **redemption**.
    - "The world is preserved for the sake of the Church and the realization of the plan of redemption." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Semi-Pelagian Views of Grace**
    - Berkhof opposes any notion that common or preparatory grace enables self-initiated faith.
    - He insists that fallen humanity remains spiritually dead apart from **regenerating grace**.
    - All saving movements toward God are the result of sovereign, effectual grace.
    - Common and preparatory grace do not cooperate with human will to achieve salvation.
    - "Man can never of himself cooperate with common grace so as to attain to saving faith." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s clear articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has shaped Reformed theology and provided a standard reference for generations of pastors and theologians. His distinctions have helped clarify debates on the relationship between God’s universal benevolence and His particular saving work. Berkhof’s influence endures in systematic theology curricula and continues to inform contemporary discussions on grace, culture, and the doctrine of salvation.
