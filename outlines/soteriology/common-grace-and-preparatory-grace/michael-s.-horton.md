# Michael Horton (1964– )

Michael Horton articulates a robust Reformed understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, emphasizing their distinction from **saving grace** and the necessity of God's sovereign initiative in salvation. He maintains that **common grace** preserves the created order and restrains sin but never leads to salvation, while **preparatory grace** does not imply any human cooperation in regeneration.

- "Common grace is not a halfway house between wrath and mercy, but the context in which the drama of redemption unfolds." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- "The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way"
- "Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ"
- "God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology"
- "People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology"
- "Covenant and Eschatology: The Divine Drama"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Non-Saving Favor**
    - Common grace is God's benevolence to all humanity, restraining evil and enabling societal good.
    - It is categorically distinct from **special grace**, which alone brings salvation.
    - Common grace upholds the created order and allows for human flourishing after the Fall.
    - Horton rejects any notion that common grace is a preparatory step toward regeneration.
    "Common grace is not redemptive; it is the context, not the cause, of salvation." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Preparatory Grace and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Preparatory grace does not involve human cooperation in salvation.
    - Any movement toward God is the result of God's sovereign initiative, not human effort.
    - Horton affirms **monergism**: regeneration is solely the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - He critiques views that blur the line between preparatory and saving grace.
    "There is no preparatory stage in which the sinner assists grace; grace is always and only God's work." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
    - Horton insists on a clear distinction between the **law** (which reveals sin) and the **gospel** (which announces salvation).
    - Common grace operates in the realm of law, sustaining civil order.
    - Saving grace is mediated through the gospel, effecting **union with Christ**.
    - Confusing law and gospel leads to moralism or legalism.
    "The law can restrain but not redeem; only the gospel brings saving grace." ("Covenant and Salvation")

4. **Covenant Theology as Framework**
    - Horton situates common and preparatory grace within the broader context of **covenant theology**.
    - The **covenant of creation** is preserved by common grace after the Fall.
    - The **covenant of grace** is established solely by God's initiative and saving work.
    - This framework guards against synergism and upholds the gratuity of salvation.
    "Covenant theology helps us distinguish between God's universal kindness and his particular saving mercy." ("God of Promise")

5. **Affirmation of the Antithesis**
    - Horton maintains the **antithesis** between the regenerate and unregenerate, even as common grace allows for shared cultural endeavors.
    - He warns against overestimating the spiritual value of common grace achievements.
    - The antithesis is ultimately eschatological, revealed fully at Christ's return.
    - Common grace does not erase the fundamental divide between those in Adam and those in Christ.
    "Common grace is real, but it does not bridge the antithesis between the church and the world." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, clarifying their roles within **covenant theology** and the doctrine of salvation. His insistence on the distinction between **common** and **saving grace** has helped guard Reformed soteriology against both synergism and moralism. Horton's work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking a robust, confessional approach to grace in the Christian life and public square.
