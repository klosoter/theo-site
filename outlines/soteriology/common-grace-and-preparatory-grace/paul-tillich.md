# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **common grace** and **preparatory grace** through his broader framework of **revelation**, **existential estrangement**, and the **divine-human encounter**. He saw grace as the manifestation of the **New Being** in Christ, which addresses the universal condition of alienation and is present in all cultural and religious expressions, preparing humanity for the reception of **saving grace**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universal Presence of Grace**
   - Grace is not limited to the church but is present wherever the **Spirit** works in human existence.
   - All cultural, religious, and philosophical systems can mediate aspects of **common grace**.
   - The **New Being** in Christ is the ultimate revelation, but its effects are not confined to explicit Christian contexts.
   - Grace is the answer to the universal human condition of **estrangement**.
   - "There is no place to which grace does not penetrate." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Preparatory Grace as Existential Readiness**
   - Human beings experience a sense of **ultimate concern** that prepares them for the reception of grace.
   - **Preparatory grace** is the movement from existential anxiety toward openness to the divine.
   - This readiness is not meritorious but is itself a work of grace within the structures of existence.
   - Tillich rejects any notion of purely natural preparation apart from the divine initiative.
   - "The question of God is asked wherever man is aware of his existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Revelation in Culture and Religion**
   - All genuine religion contains elements of **revelation** and thus participates in **common grace**.
   - Non-Christian religions and secular culture can serve as vehicles for preparatory grace.
   - The **boundary line** between sacred and secular is porous due to the omnipresence of grace.
   - Christ is the criterion by which all revelation is judged, but grace is not restricted to explicit knowledge of Christ.
   - "Revelation is always given in a cultural form." (Theology of Culture)

4. **Grace as Healing of Estrangement**
   - The human predicament is defined by **estrangement** from God, self, and others.
   - Grace is the power that reconciles and heals this estrangement.
   - Both common and preparatory grace are expressions of the divine initiative to overcome alienation.
   - The **New Being** is the manifestation of this healing grace in history.
   - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

5. **Dynamic, Not Static, View of Grace**
   - Grace is not a static possession but a dynamic event in the encounter between God and humanity.
   - The movement from **preparation** to **salvation** is a continual process, not a one-time act.
   - Human freedom and divine action are dialectically related in the experience of grace.
   - The church is the community where the dynamics of grace are most fully realized, but not exclusively so.
   - "Grace transforms fate into destiny." (The Courage to Be)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s theology of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has profoundly influenced discussions on the relationship between Christianity and culture, interreligious dialogue, and the universality of **revelation**. His existential and ontological approach provided a framework for understanding grace as both universally present and dynamically active in all human experience. While some critics argue that his views blur the distinction between special and common grace, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for contemporary theology engaging with pluralism and the human condition.
