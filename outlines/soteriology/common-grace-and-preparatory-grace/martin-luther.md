# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** is rooted in his doctrine of the radical incapacity of fallen humanity and the absolute necessity of **justifying grace**. While Luther acknowledged the presence of God's goodness in creation and the restraint of evil through **civil righteousness**, he denied that such grace could prepare the sinner for **saving faith** apart from the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Luther, any movement toward God is entirely the result of **divine initiative** and not the product of human cooperation with grace.

- "Free will, after the fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able, it commits a mortal sin." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Heidelberg Disputation
- Commentary on Galatians
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity, after the Fall, is utterly incapable of moving toward God by its own power.
    - Even the best human works are tainted by sin and cannot merit favor with God.
    - **Common grace** may restrain evil but does not enable spiritual good.
    - Any apparent righteousness outside of faith is ultimately sinful before God.
    - "For man without the Spirit of God does not do evil against his will...but he wills and desires to do evil." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Distinction Between Civil and Spiritual Righteousness**
    - Luther recognized a form of righteousness in society, upheld by God's providence.
    - This **civil righteousness** is not salvific and pertains only to external order.
    - It is a manifestation of God's goodness to all, not a step toward salvation.
    - The distinction underscores the futility of works-based approaches to grace.
    - "Before God, therefore, such works and righteousness are nothing, or rather, they are sins." (Heidelberg Disputation)

3. **Denial of Preparatory Grace as Enabling Faith**
    - Luther rejected the medieval notion that humans could prepare themselves for grace.
    - All movement toward God is initiated by **God’s monergistic grace**.
    - There is no synergistic cooperation between human will and divine grace in conversion.
    - The human will remains bound until liberated by the Holy Spirit.
    - "It is not in our power to think a good thought or to prepare ourselves for grace." (Lectures on Romans)

4. **Role of the Law and Gospel**
    - The **Law** exposes sin and reveals human inability, driving sinners to despair of self.
    - The **Gospel** alone brings the promise of grace and the gift of faith.
    - The Law cannot prepare the heart for grace; it only kills and condemns.
    - The Gospel is the sole means by which God grants new life and faith.
    - "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. Grace says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Sovereign Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit alone creates faith and brings about regeneration.
    - No human preparation or disposition can prompt the Spirit’s work.
    - The Spirit works through the **Word and Sacraments** to effect salvation.
    - Assurance of salvation rests entirely on God’s promise, not human effort.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given to no one except through the Word." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s uncompromising emphasis on **total depravity** and the necessity of **monergistic grace** profoundly shaped Protestant soteriology, especially in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. His rejection of **preparatory grace** as a humanly achievable state marked a decisive break from medieval scholasticism. Luther’s distinction between **common grace** (civil righteousness) and saving grace continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between nature and grace, and the limits of human ability after the Fall.
