# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner’s approach to **common grace** and **preparatory grace** centers on his concept of the **supernatural existential**, which posits that all humans are endowed with a latent openness to God’s self-communication. Rahner maintains that **God’s grace** is universally offered, making every person a potential recipient of **salvific grace** even outside explicit Christian faith. This universality undergirds his theology of **anonymous Christianity**, where preparatory movements toward God are possible through the presence of grace in all human experience.

- "God offers his grace to every human being, and every person is, in a hidden way, confronted with the possibility of accepting or rejecting this grace." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Supernatural Existential**
    - Every human is endowed with a supernatural orientation toward God.
    - This existential is not earned but is a permanent structure of human existence.
    - It grounds the universal possibility of receiving **grace**.
    - It bridges the gap between **nature and grace** without collapsing their distinction.
    - "The supernatural existential is the radical orientation of man toward God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Universal Offer of Grace**
    - God’s salvific will is genuinely universal, extending to all people.
    - Grace is not limited to the explicitly baptized or professing Christians.
    - The offer of grace is mediated through history, culture, and conscience.
    - This universality undergirds Rahner’s concept of **anonymous Christianity**.
    - "Grace is offered to every person, even if he is not aware of it." (Theological Investigations, vol. 6)

3. **Anonymous Christianity**
    - Non-Christians can respond positively to God’s grace without explicit knowledge of Christ.
    - The presence of grace is discerned in authentic moral response and openness to transcendence.
    - This concept does not negate the uniqueness of Christ but expands the scope of salvation.
    - It is a theological explanation for the preparatory work of grace outside the visible church.
    - "A person can be an anonymous Christian even if he does not know Christ explicitly." (Theological Investigations, vol. 6)

4. **Grace as God’s Self-Communication**
    - Grace is fundamentally God’s self-gift, not merely a created effect.
    - This self-communication is the basis for any authentic human response to God.
    - Preparatory grace is not a separate category but the initial movement of God’s self-gift.
    - The distinction between **actual grace** and **sanctifying grace** is reframed in this context.
    - "Grace is nothing other than God’s self-communication to man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Transcendental Experience and Conscience**
    - Human openness to God is mediated through transcendental experience and conscience.
    - Preparatory grace operates through the structures of human subjectivity.
    - The **hearer of the word** is the one who, in conscience, is addressed by God’s call.
    - This approach integrates existential philosophy with Catholic theology of grace.
    - "Man is always already the hearer of the word, even before explicit revelation." (Hearer of the Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** profoundly shaped post-Vatican II Catholic thought, especially in its approach to religious pluralism and the possibility of salvation outside the visible church. His concept of the **supernatural existential** provided a philosophical and theological foundation for understanding grace as universally operative. Rahner’s influence persists in contemporary debates about inclusivism, the relationship between **nature and grace**, and the church’s mission in a pluralistic world.
