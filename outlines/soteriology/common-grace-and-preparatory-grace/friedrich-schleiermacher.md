# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined the understanding of **grace** by grounding it in the universal human experience of **God-consciousness**. He did not affirm **common grace** or **preparatory grace** in the traditional Reformed sense, but instead saw all human religious awareness as a manifestation of the divine, with **redemption** intensifying what is already present in human nature rather than introducing a distinct supernatural grace.

- "Every religious affection is a modification of the feeling of absolute dependence." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (Richard Crouter, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God-consciousness as the essence of religion**
    - Human beings possess an innate **God-consciousness** that underlies all religious experience.
    - This consciousness is universal and not limited to the regenerate.
    - Religious feeling is a direct awareness of dependence on God.
    - The distinction between regenerate and unregenerate is one of degree, not kind.
    - "Religion is to seek this and find this in all that lives and moves, in all growth and change, in all doing and suffering." (On Religion)

2. **Rejection of traditional common grace**
    - Schleiermacher does not affirm a separate category of **common grace** as in Reformed theology.
    - All human faculties and experiences are already grounded in the divine.
    - There is no strict separation between natural and supernatural operations of grace.
    - Grace is not a substance given but an intensification of God-consciousness.
    - "There is no opposition between the natural and the supernatural, but only a difference of degree." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Preparatory grace as universal religious capacity**
    - What Reformed theology calls **preparatory grace** is, for Schleiermacher, the universal capacity for religious feeling.
    - All humans are capable of responding to the divine, not just the elect.
    - The work of Christ and the church is to awaken and deepen this latent capacity.
    - Conversion is a process of self-realization, not a supernatural intervention.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the God-consciousness in its highest potency." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Redemption as fulfillment, not transformation**
    - Redemption does not introduce a new principle but fulfills what is already present in human nature.
    - The difference between the redeemed and unredeemed is quantitative, not qualitative.
    - The historical work of Christ is the supreme realization of God-consciousness.
    - The church is the community where this consciousness is most fully developed.
    - "The Redeemer is distinguished from all others by the constant potency of his God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Grace mediated through community and history**
    - The means of grace are found in the communal life of the church.
    - Historical development and cultural context shape the experience of grace.
    - The church serves as the bearer and transmitter of heightened God-consciousness.
    - Grace is experienced through participation in the Christian community and its practices.
    - "The church is the fellowship in which the divine life is communicated and preserved." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reconfiguration of **grace** as rooted in universal **God-consciousness** profoundly influenced modern liberal theology and the study of religion. His views challenged the Reformed categories of **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, shifting the focus from supernatural intervention to the immanent presence of the divine in all humanity. This legacy shaped later discussions on religious experience, the nature of redemption, and the role of the church in mediating grace. Schleiermacher remains a pivotal figure in the transition from classical Protestant orthodoxy to modern theological thought.
