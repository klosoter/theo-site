# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **common grace** and **preparatory grace** through his distinctive emphasis on the **universality of revelation** and the **eschatological openness** of all reality to God. He argued that God's self-disclosure in history and creation provides a foundation for understanding how all people, regardless of explicit faith, experience God's gracious presence and are drawn toward the fullness of **salvation**. For Pannenberg, the work of grace is not confined to the church but is operative in the whole of humanity as history moves toward its consummation in Christ.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Universality of Revelation**
    - God’s self-revelation is accessible to all people through history and creation.
    - Revelation is not restricted to special moments but is the horizon of all reality.
    - The knowledge of God is mediated through the openness of human experience to the divine.
    - This universality undergirds the possibility of **common grace**.
    - "Revelation is the self-disclosure of God in the history of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Grace**
    - All of history is oriented toward its fulfillment in the eschaton.
    - Grace is preparatory in that it draws humanity toward its ultimate destiny in Christ.
    - The future of God’s kingdom shapes the present experience of grace.
    - **Preparatory grace** is thus both historical and anticipatory.
    - "The future of God is the horizon of all reality and the basis of hope." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Grace as the Foundation of Human Openness to God**
    - Human beings are constituted by their openness to the transcendent.
    - This openness is itself a work of divine grace, enabling response to revelation.
    - Even outside explicit faith, people can be recipients of God’s preparatory work.
    - The universality of this openness is a sign of **common grace**.
    - "Man’s openness to the world is grounded in his openness to God." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

4. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Grace**
    - The person and work of Christ are the culmination of all preparatory movements of grace.
    - All experiences of grace find their meaning and fulfillment in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The church witnesses to the universality of grace by proclaiming Christ as the center of history.
    - **Common grace** is not salvific apart from its fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the proleptic revelation of the end of history." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Integration of Theology and Secular Knowledge**
    - Pannenberg sought to bridge theology with philosophy, science, and history.
    - He argued that **common grace** is evident in the achievements of culture and reason.
    - Theological anthropology must account for human development in light of God’s universal action.
    - This integration affirms the preparatory role of grace in all spheres of life.
    - "Theology must take seriously the claims of secular knowledge as expressions of God’s providence." (Basic Questions in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s theology of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the universality of revelation and the relationship between church and world. His insistence on the openness of all reality to God’s eschatological future challenged both exclusivist and purely naturalistic accounts of grace. By rooting grace in the historical and cosmic scope of God’s action, Pannenberg provided a robust framework for engaging culture, science, and interreligious dialogue. His influence endures in systematic theology, especially in debates on revelation, anthropology, and the scope of salvation.
