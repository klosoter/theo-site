Common Grace and Preparatory Grace: Restraining Sin without Weakening Particular Redemption

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How can God’s **common grace** truly benefit and in some sense prepare sinners without collapsing into a synergistic **preparatory grace** that compromises **total depravity** and **particular redemption**.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, Francis Turretin, Abraham Kuyper, Louis Berkhof, Karl Barth.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed orthodoxy and **federal theology**, Dutch Neo-Calvinism, Roman Catholic scholasticism on **prevenient grace**, and modern Reformed responses to Barthian and evangelical revisions.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed disputes over the extent and structure of **common grace**, the legitimacy of “preparatory” language, and the relation to the **covenant of grace** and effectual calling.
  - External: Roman Catholic doctrines of **prevenient grace** and merit, Arminian synergism, Barth’s critique of “natural theology,” and Anabaptist or Radical Two-Kingdom suspicions of cultural participation.
  - Contemporary: Natural law and public theology, religious pluralism, theological anthropology in a secular age, and missiological strategies that appeal to “points of contact.”
- Defended position: Common grace is a real, non-saving divine favor that restrains sin and preserves creational goods, and it can function instrumentally as a providential **preparation for special grace**, yet without conferring spiritual ability, lessening human guilt, or undermining monergistic regeneration.

### ESSAY
The theological tension at the heart of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** is how to speak of God’s genuine goodness toward the non-elect without softening the Reformed commitment to **total depravity**, **particular redemption**, and **irresistible grace**. Examiners will press whether one can affirm real benefits and a kind of “preparation” in history and in the human subject without smuggling in an Arminian or Roman Catholic notion of cooperative **prevenient grace**. My thesis is that Reformed theology, properly understood, may affirm common grace as a true but non-saving favor of God that orders history and human life so that many are outwardly predisposed and situated for the reception of the gospel, yet that this “preparation” remains external, conditional, and non-meritorious, never giving the sinner any intrinsic spiritual ability to cooperate with grace and never diminishing the radical necessity of sovereign regeneration.

John Calvin is the foundational figure. His development of **common grace** is not a systematic locus under that name, but his exegesis and doctrinal synthesis decisively shape the issue. In the Institutes and in his commentaries, Calvin maintains an uncompromising account of the noetic effects of sin and the moral bondage of the will, and yet he speaks in rich terms of the gifts God scatters among unbelievers. In Institutes 2.2 he famously acknowledges “excellent gifts of the Spirit” distributed to the reprobate, particularly for the management of civil life and the advancement of arts and sciences. Here he grounds these gifts in the Spirit’s universal work as Creator and Sustainer. Examiners may ask whether this language of “gifts of the Spirit” threatens to blur saving and non-saving operations. Calvin avoids that by sharply distinguishing between what he calls “special grace” given in Christ and the “general grace” or “common operations” of the Spirit given to humanity in general. The “excellent gifts” are real and are due to none other than the Holy Spirit, but they leave the heart unchanged before God and thus do not move one inch toward justification.

Calvin also introduces a key dimension that later Reformed orthodoxy will refine: the restraint of sin. His exposition of Romans 13 treats the civil magistrate as an instrument of divine goodness in preserving order and punishing evil. In this framework, unbelieving rulers, even tyrants, may unwittingly serve God’s purposes. The Spirit “holds in check” the ungodly so that human society remains possible. This is not yet a full doctrine of **common grace**, but the seeds are evident: God maintains and orders the fallen creation in ways that are genuinely beneficial even to those under wrath. Calvin’s theology of providence, where God “bridles Satan” and channels even wicked intentions to good ends, undergirds the later Reformed insistence that common grace is not a different attribute in God but a particular mode of his **goodness** and **providence** in a fallen world.

On “preparation,” Calvin is more restrained. He strongly rejects any notion that the fallen will contains a latent capacity to turn to God if merely spurred externally. Regeneration is a sovereign, unilateral work: God “bends, forms, and directs” the heart. Yet he speaks of the **law** as a “tutor to Christ,” of providential afflictions as chisels that drive sinners to seek refuge, and of the preached word as an instrument that “breaks down” pride. These external means do not make the heart less dead but place sinners under means that God is pleased to use when he decides to regenerate. The exam question is whether this set of realities can be labeled “preparatory grace.” My answer, following Calvin’s instincts, is that the concept is legitimate if “preparatory” refers to the ordering of circumstances, relationships, knowledge, and conscience by God, not to an infused potency in the faculty of the will. The preparation is historical and situational, not ontological.

Francis Turretin represents the high Reformed scholastic consolidation and precise conceptualization of these themes. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology, Turretin treats **common grace** explicitly, distinguishing it from saving grace with great care. He defines it as that grace “by which God, in a certain measure, communicates good things to all creatures, especially to men, whether with respect to their nature or to their external condition.” Turretin breaks this down into gifts of creation, preservation, civic virtue, restraint of sin, and the external call of the gospel. Notice that already common grace stretches beyond merely “natural” gifts; the external call itself, when not accompanied by the Spirit’s internal illumination, is a non-saving grace that genuinely bestows privilege and heightens responsibility. Examiners might probe whether such “grace” toward those who will be finally condemned is coherent. Turretin responds by distinguishing between diverse ends: God can truly will a temporal good and a revelational privilege for a person while not willing their eternal salvation. That is, there is a multiplicity of divine volitions ad extra ordered under the simplicity and freedom of the divine will. Here Turretin also pre-empts the later Barthian objection that any “twofold will in God” must be rejected as contradictory. He insists that **divine simplicity** does not preclude diversified relations and designs toward creatures.

On **preparatory grace**, Turretin’s polemical target is Rome. The Council of Trent and Roman scholasticism had developed a robust account of **prevenient grace** that, while rejecting Pelagianism, ascribed to the sinner a real, though grace-enabled, cooperation in the first movements toward God. Grace “prepares” the will, but the will then must “assent,” and this synergistic cooperation becomes the material for merit. Turretin rejects not only the meritorious structure but the metaphysical picture beneath it, namely that there can be a divinely activated intermediate state between death in sin and life in Christ. For Turretin, any true preparation for regeneration is itself the first act of regeneration. There is no spiritual halfway house. He permits a kind of “preparation” in the broad sense of external dealings, legal conviction, fear of punishment, and even an ineffectual “taste” of the heavenly gift, but all of these fall short of any spiritual ability to close with Christ. They increase responsibility and often harden. The examiner’s likely challenge is whether this makes the concept of preparatory grace vacuous. Turretin would say it is not vacuous, because it marks a real divine work that shapes history and conscience; but it must be fenced from the Roman idea of cooperative grace and from any implication that God becomes obliged by these preliminaries.

Abraham Kuyper is decisive for the modern articulation and expansion of **common grace**, especially in the Dutch Neo-Calvinist tradition. In his multi-volume work on Common Grace and in his broader cultural program, Kuyper takes the earlier Reformed strands and turns them into a full-blown theology of culture. He grounds common grace in the **Noahic covenant**, viewing it as God’s commitment to maintain the basic conditions of creation after the flood so that history can continue until the consummation. On this basis Kuyper develops three main aspects: the restraint of sin, the preservation and unfolding of created structures, and the bestowal of non-saving gifts that allow unbelievers to contribute to science, art, and political life. For Kuyper, the fact that unbelievers can discover medicines, compose symphonies, and administer justice is not a natural remainder untouched by the fall but the fruit of **common grace**. He speaks boldly of an “antithesis” between belief and unbelief, yet within the one creation upheld by God’s universal favor.

Kuyper pushes the preparatory line further than earlier Reformed writers. Because common grace preserves and develops the institutional and cultural fabric of human life, it also creates a platform on which the **covenant of grace** and the gospel mission operate. Christian schools, free churches, and even the protection of religious liberty are, in Kuyper’s vision, fruits of common grace that indirectly prepare peoples and nations to encounter the gospel. When pressed, Kuyper insists that none of this imparts spiritual ability or diminishes human inability. It is a “preparation” of the field, not of the heart. Yet here internal Reformed debates emerge. Some, especially in the Dutch tradition, worried that Kuyper’s strong affirmation of common grace blunted the sense of antithesis and encouraged an uncritical embrace of modern culture. Theological examiners will often ask whether Kuyper’s doctrine risks turning common grace into a quasi-autonomous realm where Christ’s lordship is de facto suspended. A robust Kuyperian answer is that common grace is always subordinate to special grace and to Christ’s kingship: God’s universal favor is ordered toward the gathering of the church and the preservation of a stage on which redemption is publicly displayed.

Louis Berkhof stands as a twentieth-century systematizer and a bridge to contemporary Reformed discussions. In his Systematic Theology he offers the classic threefold division of **common grace**: the universal operations of the Holy Spirit in restraining sin and maintaining order, the bestowal of natural gifts and cultural development, and the general operations connected to the external call and moral influence of Christianity in the world. Berkhof explicitly distinguishes common grace from the “general offer” of the gospel and from special grace, yet he subsumes under common grace many of the providential influences of Christianity on society. This framework has become standard for Westminster-type exam questions.

On **preparatory grace**, Berkhof is cautious but not silent. He speaks of a “non-saving gracious work of the Holy Spirit” that may produce conviction of sin, fear of punishment, and an ineffectual “historical faith” even in reprobates. These influences may “prepare” in the sense of making the gospel intelligible, humbling pride, and exposing the inadequacy of self-righteousness. But Berkhof denies that these preparations contain any spiritual power to embrace Christ. Here he appropriates, but carefully fences, the older Protestant notion that the **law** prepares for the **gospel**. Preparation is thus logical and pedagogical, not metaphysical. An examiner might press: if the same work of conviction occurs in elect and reprobate, is there any difference before regeneration? Berkhof, in line with Reformed orthodoxy, would answer that the same external work is used by God as an instrument in the case of the elect but left barren in the reprobate. The distinction lies not in the quality of the preparatory experiences themselves but in God’s secret decree and his decision either to accompany those experiences with regenerating power or not.

Karl Barth must be treated as a decisive external critic whose influence reshaped the conversation on common grace and any notion of preparation. Barth rejects the very category of “common grace” as a distinct theological locus. For him, there is only the grace of God in Jesus Christ, and any talk of a generic divine favor toward humanity apart from explicit Christological reference is a slide into natural theology. In Church Dogmatics, Barth polemicizes against the idea of a “point of contact” in human nature or culture that can function as a neutral bridge for the gospel. He sees classical Reformed talk of common grace, especially in its Kuyperian form, as granting too much autonomy to creation and to human religious capacity. Examiners sympathetic to Barth will argue that a robust doctrine of sin requires us to deny that anything in fallen humanity can serve as a genuine preparation for the gospel; the Word creates its own point of contact.

From a confessional Reformed standpoint, Barth’s critique has salutary warnings but is ultimately unsustainable. It is salutary in reminding us that all divine favor is rooted in the one eternal decree of election in Christ and that there is no independent realm of nature that stands over against grace. It is also a necessary warning against turning cultural achievements into sacraments of the kingdom. Yet Barth’s collapse of all grace into Christological grace ends up flattening the biblical distinctions between God’s different dealings with his creatures. The rain that falls on the just and unjust is not the same as the blood of Christ applied to the elect, even if both arise from the one good will of the triune God. Moreover, Scripture itself identifies creational and historical realities that function as “preparations” in a non-meritorious sense: the pedagogical function of the Mosaic law, the role of the Athenians’ altar to the unknown god for Paul’s proclamation, or the way in which pagan poets can articulate partial truths. These are not latent spiritual capacities but providentially ordered structures which, when confronted by the gospel, may serve as points of address and confrontation. To deny all such preparations is to risk positing a sheerly arbitrary Word with no meaningful continuity with the created order it redeems.

The internal Reformed debate about common grace and preparatory grace can now be seen in sharper relief. On one side, some fear that an expansive doctrine of common grace and any affirmation of “preparation” inevitably weakens the doctrines of **radical corruption**, **effectual calling**, and the antithesis between church and world. They warn that appeals to common grace often function rhetorically to baptize worldly cultural forms or to justify naive optimism about the moral achievements of unbelievers. On the other side, many argue that without a robust doctrine of common grace, Reformed theology cannot give an adequate account of cultural development, civic virtue, and the real though ambiguous benefits unbelievers enjoy. It would also lack resources for engaging in **public theology**, natural law reasoning, and dialogue with other religions.

The position I defend seeks to stabilize the classical Reformed consensus while learning from these tensions. Common grace must be affirmed as a real, positive expression of God’s **goodness** toward the non-elect in this life. It includes the preservation of human nature, the endurance of family, state, and economy, the spread of learning and the arts, and the restraint of sin through conscience, law, and civil order. It also includes the external call of the gospel, which genuinely invites all hearers and discloses God’s benevolent disposition toward them as creatures, while not revealing his decretal will to save. These realities can be described as “preparatory” in that they fit people and societies to hear the gospel, create categories for understanding guilt and mercy, and sometimes lead to crises that make the message of Christ existentially pressing. Yet none of this is a halfway step to salvation. It does not heal the will, does not impart saving faith, and often results in greater hardness and judgment when resisted.

Objections will come from multiple directions. One likely examiner question is whether this view compromises **particular redemption** by suggesting that God has a kind of saving intention toward all in common grace and preparatory dealings. The answer is to distinguish between diverse orders of intention: God wills in one sense that all come to repentance, in that he genuinely commands and invites, delights not in the death of the wicked, and bestows many goods that should lead to repentance. Yet he wills in another, deeper sense to save the elect efficaciously by Christ’s atonement. These are not contradictory but layered volitions ordered within the one simple will. Common grace and preparatory dealings reveal God’s benign disposition as Creator and moral Governor; special grace reveals his electing mercy as Redeemer.

Another exam question will challenge whether common grace lessens human guilt. If God restrains sin and gives light, is it not unfair to punish those who never receive special grace? On the contrary, common grace increases culpability. The more light and restraint one receives, the more clearly sin stands as a revolt against known goodness. Paul’s indictment in Romans 1 presupposes that general revelation, conscience, and providential kindness render people “without excuse.” Common grace is not a mitigation of justice but part of the ground for a righteous judgment. Preparatory grace, in the sense of legal conviction and external gospel exposure without conversion, further intensifies responsibility.

Conversely, some will ask whether this doctrine implies that those who grow up in Christian cultures, under strong common grace and preparatory influences, have a genuine advantage over those who do not, and whether this squares with divine justice. Scripture simply affirms that some are more privileged than others. Israel had the oracles of God, which was “much in every way,” yet many remained unconverted. Likewise, contemporary hearers of the gospel in stable societies enjoy enormous preparatory benefits. This is not injustice but sheer generosity. God remains free to pour out his special grace where he wills; he is not bound to equalize the distribution of common or preparatory graces. For examination purposes, it is crucial to insist that inequality of grace does not violate justice, because grace, by definition, is undeserved.

These doctrines connect integrally to other loci. To **anthropology**, by clarifying that the image of God is effaced but not erased, and that **common grace** is the mode by which God upholds a still-human humanity in Adam. To **covenant theology**, as common grace is anchored in the Noahic covenant, while special grace unfolds in the Abrahamic and new covenants. To **Christology**, because all grace, common and special, flows from the one mediatorial kingship of Christ, who as the last Adam sustains creation even as he redeems his bride. To **ecclesiology** and **missiology**, by shaping how the church engages the world: recognizing real truth, beauty, and justice outside its borders as fruits of common grace, yet refusing to confuse these with the kingdom of God. And to **eschatology**, since common grace is temporary; at the final judgment, God will remove restraints, hand the impenitent over fully to their desires, and the continuity between present cultural goods and the glory of the new creation will be purified through fire.

In a late modern context, debates over natural law, religious liberty, and public ethics have revived interest in common grace and preparatory realities. Reformed proponents of natural law argue that common grace maintains sufficient moral awareness among unbelievers to sustain public discourse and shared norms. They appeal to the work of the law written on the heart and to the Spirit’s restraining work. Others, more Barthian or Anabaptist in instinct, deny that fallen reason can deliver any stable moral knowledge and thus downplay or reject natural law and common grace as grounds for public argument. The position I defend sides with a chastened affirmation: common grace preserves a real but fragmentary and often suppressed moral awareness that permits genuine, though temporary and unstable, cooperation in the civil realm. This furnishes a limited “preparation” for receiving the law and gospel, but not in a way that makes public culture a neutral space.

Finally, in interreligious and secular-dialogue contexts, common grace provides a framework to acknowledge truth and goodness in other religions and worldviews without granting them soteriological efficacy. The fact that a Muslim affirms the oneness of God or a secular philosopher defends human dignity can be seen as a fruit of **common grace** and as a providential point of address for gospel proclamation. But these are not salvific preparations in the Roman sense; they are ambivalent goods that either become stepping-stones when united with special grace or stumbling blocks when absolutized against Christ.

Thus, common grace and preparatory grace, properly distinguished and ordered, enable Reformed theology to speak honestly about God’s universal goodness, the complexity of human culture, and the varied ways God orders history for the sake of his saving purposes, all without surrendering the radicality of sin or the sovereignty of saving grace. The examiner’s test is whether one can maintain these tensions without equivocation: affirming real favor without universalism, real preparation without synergism, and real cultural goods without capitulation. The classic Reformed tradition from Calvin and Turretin through Kuyper and Berkhof, corrected against Barth’s excesses yet heeding his cautions, offers a coherent way to do so.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Common grace** is God’s real but non-saving favor by which he restrains sin, preserves and develops created goods, and bestows gifts on all people; **preparatory grace** names God’s non-meritorious ordering of law, providence, conscience, and external gospel call that situationally “prepares” sinners to hear the gospel without imparting spiritual ability.
- Decisive figures:
  - Calvin: Affirms “excellent gifts” and restraint of sin as general operations of the Spirit, while denying any preparatory healing of the will.
  - Turretin: Defines common grace precisely and rejects Roman **prevenient grace** as a cooperative halfway state; allows only external, non-saving preparations.
  - Kuyper: Expands common grace via the **Noahic covenant**, grounds cultural development in it, and speaks of historical preparation for the kingdom.
  - Berkhof: Systematizes the standard Reformed categories and cautiously affirms preparatory convictions that lack saving power.
  - Barth: Critiques common grace and “points of contact,” collapsing all grace into Christological grace and warning against natural theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Scope and structure of common grace, legitimacy and meaning of “preparatory grace,” relation to **total depravity**, antithesis, and **federal theology**.
  - External: Roman Catholic synergistic **prevenient grace**, Arminian cooperation, Barth’s rejection of common grace, and separatist distrust of cultural engagement.
  - Contemporary: Natural law and public theology, religious pluralism and “points of contact,” secular moral insight, and missiological use of cultural goods.
- Defended position: Common grace is a genuine but non-saving expression of God’s **goodness** that can function as historical and situational preparation for special grace, yet it never confers spiritual ability, never lessens guilt, and never competes with or conditions monergistic regeneration and **particular redemption**.
- Likely examiner questions and answers:
  - Does common grace imply a universal saving will in God?  
    No; it expresses God’s benevolence as Creator, distinct from his efficacious will to save the elect in Christ.
  - Does preparatory grace soften total depravity?  
    No; it prepares only externally and pedagogically, leaving the will spiritually dead until regeneration.
  - How is this different from Roman prevenient grace?  
    Rome posits a cooperative halfway state in the will; Reformed theology restricts preparation to non-meritorious, non-abilitating dealings.
  - Does common grace reduce human guilt?  
    No; it increases responsibility by adding light, restraint, and privilege that are then resisted.
  - Can we speak of “points of contact” without natural theology?  
    Yes, if we mean providentially maintained creational structures and insights that the gospel addresses and judges, not innate capacities that secure knowledge of God apart from revelation.
