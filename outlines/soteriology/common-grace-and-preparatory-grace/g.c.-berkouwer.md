# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **common grace** and **preparatory grace** with a nuanced Reformed perspective, emphasizing the distinction between God's general benevolence to all humanity and the particular, effectual grace given in **salvation**. He critiqued both natural theology and overly sharp separations between **creation** and **redemption**, arguing that common grace is not salvific but serves to uphold the world and prepare for the proclamation of the **gospel**.

- "Common grace is not a halfway house to salvation, but a testimony to the patience and goodness of God in a fallen world." ("General Revelation", Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Works

- General Revelation (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification
- Man: The Image of God
- The Providence of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Divine Forbearance**
    - Common grace is God's restraint of sin and bestowal of blessings on all people.
    - It preserves the created order despite the effects of the **fall**.
    - It is distinct from **saving grace** and does not regenerate or redeem.
    - Common grace demonstrates God's patience and goodness toward humanity.
    - "Common grace is not a preliminary stage of redemption but a manifestation of God's patience." (General Revelation)

2. **Preparatory Grace and the Limits of Human Response**
    - Preparatory grace refers to God's work in preparing individuals for the gospel.
    - It does not guarantee conversion or salvation.
    - Human response remains dependent on the effectual call of **special grace**.
    - Berkouwer warns against confusing preparatory grace with meritorious works.
    - "Preparation for faith is not itself faith, nor does it create a bridge to faith." (Faith and Justification)

3. **Rejection of Natural Theology**
    - Berkouwer critiques attempts to ground knowledge of God in reason apart from revelation.
    - He argues that **general revelation** is always interpreted through the lens of sin.
    - Common grace does not provide a neutral platform for natural theology.
    - The knowledge of God is always dependent on divine initiative.
    - "The reality of sin colors all human knowledge, even that which arises from common grace." (General Revelation)

4. **Unity of Creation and Redemption**
    - Berkouwer resists dualisms that separate creation from redemption.
    - Common grace maintains the world as the arena for redemptive history.
    - The preservation of creation is purposeful, oriented toward the coming of the **kingdom of God**.
    - Redemption does not abolish creation but fulfills it.
    - "The world upheld by common grace is the world in which redemption unfolds." (Sin)

5. **Critical Engagement with Kuyperian Tradition**
    - Berkouwer appreciates Kuyper's emphasis on common grace but offers critical revisions.
    - He questions the tendency to see common grace as a cultural mandate apart from redemption.
    - He stresses the eschatological orientation of both common and special grace.
    - The church must discern the limits and purposes of common grace in society.
    - "Common grace must not be absolutized as an end in itself, but seen in light of God's redemptive plan." (General Revelation)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s analysis of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** influenced Reformed theology by clarifying the boundaries between God’s general benevolence and the particularity of salvation. His work challenged both natural theology and simplistic cultural optimism, urging a more integrated view of **creation** and **redemption**. Berkouwer’s careful distinctions continue to shape contemporary discussions on the relationship between the church and the world, and his legacy endures in debates over the theological significance of common grace.
