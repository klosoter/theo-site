# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s theology of **grace** is foundational for Western Christianity, though he does not explicitly develop the later Reformed categories of **common grace** or **preparatory grace**. He distinguishes sharply between the **gratia communis** given to all humanity (such as natural gifts and providence) and the **gratia specialis** that effectually brings about **regeneration** and **salvation**. For Augustine, any movement toward God is ultimately dependent on **divine initiative**, and he is skeptical of the efficacy of merely preparatory or natural capacities apart from **effectual calling**.

- "For not all who are called are chosen; but all who are chosen are most certainly called, according to the purpose." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Common and Special Grace**
    - God bestows certain **natural goods** (life, reason, societal order) on all people.
    - Only the **elect** receive the **grace that saves** and leads to eternal life.
    - Common grace restrains evil and enables civil virtue but does not heal the will.
    - Special grace is necessary for **conversion** and **perseverance**.
    - "There is a grace peculiar to the elect, to whom alone it is given to believe and persevere." (On the Gift of Perseverance)

2. **Necessity of Effectual Grace for Salvation**
    - Fallen humanity is **incapable** of turning to God without divine intervention.
    - **Preparatory acts** (such as hearing the gospel) are insufficient without inward renewal.
    - Grace is not merely an aid but the **efficient cause** of faith and obedience.
    - The will is liberated only by the **infusion of love** through the Holy Spirit.
    - "It is not by the law and teaching, but by the operation within, that God makes men to will good." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

3. **Ambivalence Toward Preparatory Grace**
    - Augustine acknowledges **external means** (preaching, sacraments) as occasions for grace.
    - He denies that these means, apart from **regenerating grace**, can prepare the heart for faith.
    - Any positive movement toward God is itself a result of **prevenient grace**.
    - Human cooperation is always secondary and dependent on God’s prior action.
    - "The very beginning of faith is of itself a gift of God." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

4. **Providence and Restraint of Evil**
    - God’s providence orders all things, including the restraint of human sin.
    - Even the unregenerate benefit from God’s ordering of creation and society.
    - Such benefits do not confer spiritual merit or move one toward salvation.
    - The **civic virtues** of pagans are possible through God’s sustaining power, not saving grace.
    - "The virtues which the pagans had... were only vices in disguise, unless they were referred to the true God." (City of God)

5. **Irresistibility and Particularity of Saving Grace**
    - Saving grace is **irresistible** and given only to those predestined.
    - There is no **universal preparatory grace** that enables all to believe.
    - The distinction between those who merely hear and those who truly believe is rooted in God’s eternal choice.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on God’s unmerited gift, not human preparation.
    - "Those who are not predestined to be called according to purpose are not called in such a way as to be made obedient." (On the Predestination of the Saints)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **grace** profoundly shaped later debates on **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, especially in the Reformed tradition. While he did not articulate these categories in their mature form, his emphasis on the necessity and particularity of **effectual grace** set the stage for later distinctions. His thought remains a touchstone for discussions of **predestination**, the limits of natural virtue, and the relationship between divine sovereignty and human will.
