# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck developed a nuanced doctrine of **common grace** that distinguished it from **special (saving) grace**, emphasizing God's benevolence to all humanity while maintaining the necessity of **regeneration** for salvation. He affirmed that **preparatory grace**—God's restraining and enabling work in the world—preserves creation and provides the context for the proclamation of the **gospel**, but does not itself lead to salvation apart from **effectual calling**.

- "Common grace does not take away sin nor regenerate man, but it restrains sin and maintains the order of the world." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 3.34)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Universal Divine Favor**
   - God shows a non-saving, benevolent disposition to all people after the Fall.
   - This grace preserves the created order and restrains the full effects of **sin**.
   - It undergirds cultural development, science, and societal good.
   - Common grace is distinct from the **particular grace** given in salvation.
   - "Common grace is the favor of God by which he maintains the world, restrains sin, and enables the unregenerate to perform civil good." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 3.34)

2. **Preparatory Grace and the Order of Salvation**
   - Preparatory grace refers to God's providential acts that prepare individuals and societies for the gospel.
   - It includes external influences, moral awareness, and the operations of conscience.
   - This grace is not regenerative and does not guarantee conversion.
   - It provides the historical and existential context for the **effectual call**.
   - "Preparatory grace does not regenerate, but it does prepare the soil for the seed of the Word." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.4.3)

3. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
   - Common grace is universal; special grace is particular and redemptive.
   - Special grace alone brings about **regeneration**, faith, and salvation.
   - The two graces operate in different spheres but are never in conflict.
   - Common grace serves the redemptive purposes of special grace in history.
   - "The two are not opposed, but common grace serves as the stage for special grace." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 3.35)

4. **Restraint of Sin and Promotion of Civic Good**
   - Through common grace, God restrains the full expression of human depravity.
   - This restraint allows for justice, order, and relative good in society.
   - Even the unregenerate can perform acts of civic virtue due to this grace.
   - Such acts, however, lack true spiritual merit before God.
   - "By common grace, God curbs sin and enables the unregenerate to do what is right in a civil sense." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 3.34)

5. **Theological and Apologetic Significance of Common Grace**
   - Common grace provides a theological basis for engaging culture and science.
   - It explains the presence of truth, beauty, and goodness outside the church.
   - This doctrine guards against both cultural withdrawal and uncritical assimilation.
   - It affirms the ongoing relevance of **general revelation**.
   - "Common grace is the foundation for all that is good and true in the world, even outside the sphere of redemption." ("Essays on Religion, Science, and Society")

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s doctrine of **common grace** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its engagement with culture, science, and society. His careful distinction between common and special grace provided a framework for understanding the goodness found outside the church without compromising the necessity of **regeneration**. Bavinck’s insights continue to influence neo-Calvinist thought and contemporary discussions on the relationship between grace, nature, and culture.
