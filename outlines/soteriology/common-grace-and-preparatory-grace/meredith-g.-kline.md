# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline offered a distinctive approach to **common grace** and **preparatory grace**, emphasizing their roles within the broader framework of **covenant theology** and **redemptive history**. He argued that **common grace** serves to preserve the created order and restrain evil, while **preparatory grace** functions as a sovereign work of God that readies the elect for the reception of **special grace**. Kline’s views are marked by his commitment to the **covenantal structure** of Scripture and the distinction between the **common** and **redemptive** spheres.

- "Common grace is not redemptive; it is preservative and provisional, maintaining the world for the sake of the accomplishment of God's redemptive purposes." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Preservative, Not Redemptive**
    - Distinguishes **common grace** from **special (saving) grace** in both purpose and effect.
    - Sees common grace as God’s means of restraining evil and sustaining creation after the Fall.
    - Argues that common grace is temporary and oriented toward the fulfillment of redemptive history.
    - Maintains that common grace ultimately gives way to final judgment or redemption.
    - "Common grace is not a halfway house to salvation but a temporary measure for the preservation of the world." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Structure of Grace**
    - Frames both common and special grace within the context of **covenant theology**.
    - Emphasizes the **Noahic covenant** as paradigmatic for common grace, securing the stability of creation.
    - Contrasts the **covenant of grace** (redemptive) with the **covenant of common grace** (preservative).
    - Views preparatory grace as operating within the covenantal administration of redemption.
    - "The Noahic covenant is the charter for common grace, not for redemptive grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Preparatory Grace as Sovereign and Effectual**
    - Defines preparatory grace as God’s sovereign work preparing the elect for salvation.
    - Rejects any notion that preparatory grace is a human achievement or neutral ground.
    - Sees preparatory grace as distinct from common grace, being particular and effectual.
    - Connects preparatory grace to the Spirit’s work in regeneration and calling.
    - "Preparatory grace is the Spirit’s sovereign act, not a mere potentiality latent in common grace." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Antithesis Between Common and Special Grace**
    - Stresses the **antithesis** between the **city of God** and the **city of man**.
    - Argues that common grace does not erase the fundamental spiritual divide post-Fall.
    - Maintains that cultural achievements under common grace remain distinct from redemptive blessings.
    - Warns against conflating common grace benefits with saving grace.
    - "The line between the holy and the profane is not blurred by common grace; it is clarified." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

5. **Eschatological Termination of Common Grace**
    - Teaches that common grace is provisional and will be withdrawn at the consummation.
    - Links the end of common grace to the final judgment and the establishment of the new creation.
    - Views the patience of God in common grace as oriented toward the ingathering of the elect.
    - Emphasizes the ultimate triumph of special grace in the eschaton.
    - "Common grace is destined to pass away, making room for the unmitigated reign of special grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s nuanced articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** has significantly shaped Reformed covenant theology, especially in distinguishing the **preservative** and **redemptive** purposes of God’s dealings with humanity. His emphasis on the **Noahic covenant** as foundational for understanding common grace has influenced both academic and ecclesiastical discussions. Kline’s work continues to provoke debate and refinement regarding the relationship between the church and culture, as well as the boundaries of grace in the history of redemption.
