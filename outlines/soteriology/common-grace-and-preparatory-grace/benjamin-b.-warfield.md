# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a nuanced understanding of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology**. He distinguished between God's universal benevolence to all humanity and the special, effectual grace given only to the elect, emphasizing the restraint of sin and the provision of good in the world as manifestations of God's **sovereignty** and **providence**. Warfield maintained that while common grace prepares the context for the gospel, it does not itself regenerate or save.

- "Common grace is not saving grace; it does not regenerate, nor does it redeem." ("Calvinism," in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 5)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace as Divine Restraint**
   - God restrains the full expression of human sinfulness in the world.
   - This restraint is an act of God's **providence** and kindness to all, not limited to the elect.
   - Common grace preserves social order and enables cultural development.
   - It is distinct from the **regenerating grace** that leads to salvation.
   - "It is by the operation of common grace that the world is kept from running into utter chaos." ("Calvinism")

2. **Preparatory Grace and the Gospel Context**
   - Preparatory grace refers to God's work in preparing individuals and societies for the reception of the gospel.
   - It includes intellectual, moral, and cultural influences that make people receptive to Christian truth.
   - This grace is non-saving but may precede effectual calling.
   - It highlights God's sovereignty in orchestrating the circumstances for the spread of the gospel.
   - "Preparatory grace is not itself salvation, but it is the divine ordering of things for the coming of salvation." ("The Plan of Salvation")

3. **Distinction Between Common and Special Grace**
   - Common grace is universal, while special (saving) grace is particular to the elect.
   - Special grace alone results in regeneration and faith.
   - The distinction safeguards the **doctrine of election** and **particular redemption**.
   - Warfield insists that no amount of common grace can effect conversion.
   - "The difference between common and special grace is not one of degree, but of kind." ("Calvinism")

4. **Affirmation of Total Depravity Despite Common Grace**
   - Common grace does not negate the reality of **total depravity**.
   - Human nature remains corrupt and unable to turn to God apart from special grace.
   - Any good found in humanity is due to God's restraining influence, not intrinsic ability.
   - Warfield upholds the necessity of **regeneration** for salvation.
   - "Man, even under common grace, is still wholly dependent on the supernatural work of the Spirit for salvation." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation")

5. **Common Grace and the Goodness of Creation**
   - Warfield sees common grace as an affirmation of the ongoing goodness of creation under God's providence.
   - It allows for the appreciation of truth, beauty, and virtue outside the church.
   - Common grace demonstrates God's benevolence and patience toward fallen humanity.
   - It serves as a witness to God's character and as a context for gospel proclamation.
   - "The gifts of common grace are tokens of the Creator's goodness to all His creatures." ("Calvinism")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield's articulation of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** provided a crucial bridge between classic Reformed theology and modern concerns about culture, society, and evangelism. His careful distinctions influenced later theologians, especially within the **Princeton tradition** and the broader Reformed world. Warfield's thought remains foundational for discussions on the relationship between God's universal benevolence and particular redemption, shaping contemporary debates on grace, culture, and the mission of the church.
