# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed a distinctively Reformed doctrine of **common grace**, emphasizing the persistent **antithesis** between the regenerate and unregenerate. He argued that while **common grace** restrains sin and enables cultural development, it never bridges the spiritual gulf that only **special grace** can overcome.

- "Common grace does not mean that there is a neutral area where the sinner is not in opposition to God." ("Common Grace and the Gospel")

## Key Works

- "Common Grace and the Gospel" (1948)
- "The Defense of the Faith" (1955)
- "Christian Apologetics" (1976)
- "Introduction to Systematic Theology" (1974)
- John Frame, "Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought" (1995)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Antithesis between Believer and Unbeliever**
    - Humanity is divided into those in **covenant with God** and those in rebellion.
    - **Common grace** does not erase the fundamental spiritual opposition between these groups.
    - All human thought and culture are shaped by this antithesis.
    - Any cooperation in culture is due to God's restraining grace, not shared neutrality.
    "The difference between the regenerate and the unregenerate is basic and all-pervasive." ("Common Grace and the Gospel")

2. **Affirmation of Common Grace’s Reality**
    - God shows genuine goodness to all people, providing blessings and restraining evil.
    - **Common grace** allows for societal order, scientific progress, and cultural achievements.
    - These benefits are not salvific but display God's patience and mercy.
    - The doctrine guards against both pessimism about culture and naive optimism.
    "God gives gifts to men, even though they are sinners, and enables them to do things that are outwardly good." ("Common Grace and the Gospel")

3. **Preparatory Grace is Insufficient for Salvation**
    - No amount of **preparatory grace** can bring a sinner to faith apart from **regeneration**.
    - The unregenerate may experience moral improvement or intellectual enlightenment, but not saving faith.
    - **Special grace** alone overcomes spiritual deadness.
    - Any positive movement toward God is the result of the Holy Spirit’s sovereign work.
    "There is no bridge from common grace to saving grace except the miracle of regeneration." ("Common Grace and the Gospel")

4. **Epistemological Implications of Common Grace**
    - Even in shared cultural endeavors, the unbeliever suppresses the truth in unrighteousness.
    - **Common grace** explains why unbelievers can know and do truth, but never autonomously.
    - All knowledge is ultimately dependent on **revelation** and the work of the Spirit.
    - Apologetics must account for both the reality of common grace and the antithesis.
    "The unbeliever knows God, but he does not want to know Him as he should." ("The Defense of the Faith")

5. **Redemptive-Historical Priority of Special Grace**
    - The ultimate purpose of **common grace** is to serve the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - God’s patience with the world is for the sake of the elect and the accomplishment of redemption.
    - **Common grace** is always subordinate to God’s saving purposes.
    - History is moving toward the consummation where only special grace will remain.
    "Common grace is subordinate to and serves the interests of special grace." ("Common Grace and the Gospel")

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust articulation of **common grace** and its limits has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of apologetics and cultural engagement. His insistence on the **antithesis** continues to influence debates about Christian participation in the broader world. While some have critiqued his approach as overly dualistic, his legacy endures in the ongoing development of **presuppositional apologetics** and Reformed understandings of grace.
