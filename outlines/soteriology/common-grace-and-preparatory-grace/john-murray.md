# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a careful and critical analysis of **common grace** and **preparatory grace** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the necessity of distinguishing these from **saving grace**. He argued that while God’s goodness is manifest to all humanity in various forms, there is no biblical warrant for a grace that prepares the unregenerate for salvation apart from the effectual call. Murray’s approach sought to uphold the distinctiveness of **regeneration** and the **sovereignty of God** in salvation.

- "There is no such thing as preparatory grace in the sense of a grace that enables the unregenerate to perform acts that approximate to saving faith or repentance." ("The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith")

## Key Works

- "Common Grace" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith"
- "Redemption: Accomplished and Applied"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Calvin on the So-Called Preparatory Movements" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Common Grace is Distinct from Saving Grace**
    - Common grace refers to God’s non-saving goodness to all humanity.
    - It includes blessings such as restraint of sin, providential care, and cultural benefits.
    - It does not result in regeneration or salvation.
    - The distinction preserves the uniqueness of **effectual calling**.
    - "Common grace is not to be equated with saving grace, nor is it preparatory to it." ("Common Grace")

2. **Denial of Preparatory Grace as Salvific**
    - Murray rejects the idea that there is a grace that prepares the unregenerate for faith.
    - Any movement toward God is the result of **regenerating grace**, not a separate preparatory grace.
    - He critiques the notion that fallen humans can cooperate with grace before regeneration.
    - The biblical order of salvation (ordo salutis) does not include preparatory grace.
    - "There is no evidence that the unregenerate are the subjects of a grace that brings them nearer to salvation." ("Calvin on the So-Called Preparatory Movements")

3. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Fallen humanity is wholly unable to respond to God apart from sovereign grace.
    - Common grace restrains sin but does not renew the heart.
    - The doctrine of **total depravity** necessitates effectual, not preparatory, grace.
    - Any spiritual good in the unregenerate is excluded by their depravity.
    - "The incapacity of the natural man is total and nothing short of regeneration can remedy it." ("Redemption: Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Sovereignty of God in Salvation**
    - Salvation is entirely the work of God from beginning to end.
    - God’s sovereignty ensures that grace is effectual for the elect.
    - There is no intermediate stage between death in sin and new life in Christ.
    - The application of redemption is monergistic, not synergistic.
    - "The initiative and accomplishment of salvation are wholly of God’s sovereign grace." ("Redemption: Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Affirmation of Real Benefits in Common Grace**
    - Common grace is real and meaningful, not merely a theoretical category.
    - It accounts for moral order, cultural achievements, and societal good.
    - These benefits are not redemptive but reflect God’s goodness to all.
    - The reality of common grace does not undermine the necessity of special grace for salvation.
    - "God’s goodness to all men is a testimony to his character, but it is not to be confused with his saving purpose." ("Common Grace")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous distinction between **common grace** and **saving grace** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in debates over the ordo salutis and the nature of God’s dealings with the unregenerate. His rejection of **preparatory grace** as a distinct category has influenced confessional Presbyterianism and clarified the boundaries of Reformed soteriology. Murray’s careful exegesis and theological precision continue to serve as a standard for those seeking to articulate the doctrines of grace in the context of modern challenges.
