# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of his **Christocentric theology**. He rejected classical Reformed notions of an ordo salutis in favor of viewing all aspects of salvation as grounded in the singular event of **God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ**, emphasizing the **sovereignty of grace** and the universal scope of Christ’s work.

- "In Jesus Christ God has spoken once for all, and every man is already included in this event." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics IV/2: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Church Dogmatics IV/3: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: A New Introduction to His Theology (Hunsinger)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the locus of regeneration**
   - Regeneration is not a discrete event in the individual but is accomplished objectively in Christ.
   - All humanity is included in the **reconciliation** achieved by Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection.
   - The subjective realization of regeneration occurs as persons are confronted by the Word.
   - The Spirit applies what is already accomplished in Christ, not a new ontological change in the soul.
   - "The event of regeneration is the event of the encounter between man and Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

2. **Effectual calling as divine summons in Christ**
   - Effectual calling is God’s sovereign act of addressing humanity through Christ.
   - The call is universal in scope but particular in its realization as persons respond in faith.
   - The Word and Spirit together constitute the call, making it truly effectual.
   - Human response is enabled and determined by God’s prior action in Christ.
   - "The call of God is the call to participate in the history of Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

3. **Rejection of the traditional ordo salutis**
   - Barth denies a sequential order of salvation events applied to individuals.
   - Salvation is a single, unified act in Christ, not a series of steps.
   - The focus shifts from individual experience to the objective work of Christ for all.
   - The ordo salutis is subordinated to the historia salutis (history of salvation).
   - "The so-called ordo salutis is swallowed up in the one event of Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Universal scope of reconciliation**
   - Christ’s work is for all humanity, not just the elect in a limited sense.
   - Regeneration and calling are realities grounded in Christ’s universal mediation.
   - Election is redefined as God’s election of all in Christ, though not all respond.
   - The church witnesses to the universal scope of God’s saving act.
   - "He is the Reconciler not only for some but for all." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Primacy of the Word and Spirit**
   - The Word of God is the means by which regeneration and calling are realized.
   - The Holy Spirit makes the objective work of Christ subjectively real in persons.
   - Faith is the response evoked by the Spirit through the proclamation of the Word.
   - The efficacy of the call is grounded in God’s freedom, not human capacity.
   - "The Holy Spirit is the power by which the Word becomes event in us." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** challenged the traditional Reformed understanding and shifted the focus to the **objective, Christ-centered reality of salvation**. His theology has influenced ecumenical dialogues and contemporary discussions on the relationship between **election, grace, and human response**. While controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, Barth’s insights continue to provoke debate and inspire theological reflection on the nature of salvation and the scope of Christ’s work.
