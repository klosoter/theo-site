# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards present a robust doctrine of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**. They emphasize the sovereign initiative of **God the Holy Spirit** in imparting new life to the elect, ensuring that the call of the gospel is not merely external but inwardly effective, resulting in genuine faith and repentance.

- "All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in His appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by His Word and Spirit..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 10.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 10: "Of Effectual Calling"
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 67–69
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 29–31
- The Westminster Assembly’s Minutes and Papers (for historical context)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Effectual Calling is Sovereign and Particular**
    - God alone initiates effectual calling according to His eternal purpose.
    - The call is extended only to the elect, not universally.
    - The means are the **Word and Spirit**, working together.
    - The call is inwardly powerful, not merely external.
    - "This effectual call is of God’s free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man..." (WCF 10.2)

2. **Regeneration Precedes Faith**
    - Regeneration is the act of God imparting spiritual life to the soul.
    - It enables the elect to respond in faith and repentance.
    - The human will is renewed and made willing to embrace Christ.
    - Regeneration is distinct from, but inseparable from, effectual calling.
    - "Being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call..." (WLC 67)

3. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit applies the redemption purchased by Christ.
    - He enlightens the minds of the elect spiritually and savingly.
    - The Spirit renews the will, making sinners willing to come to Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work is irresistible and unfailing in the elect.
    - "He doth persuade and enable them to embrace Jesus Christ..." (WSC 31)

4. **Distinction Between Outward and Inward Call**
    - The outward call is the general proclamation of the gospel.
    - The inward call is the secret, effectual work of the Spirit.
    - Not all who hear the outward call receive the inward call.
    - The inward call infallibly brings about conversion in the elect.
    - "Others, not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the Word... can never truly come to Christ." (WCF 10.4)

5. **Monergism and the Exclusion of Human Merit**
    - Salvation is entirely of God’s grace, excluding all human merit.
    - The elect contribute nothing to their regeneration or effectual calling.
    - Faith and repentance are themselves gifts granted in the call.
    - The doctrine upholds the total inability of fallen humanity.
    - "All of God’s elect, and they only, are effectually called, without any cooperation from their own free will." (WLC 68)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of salvation**, especially regarding the necessity and efficacy of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**. Their clear articulation of the Spirit’s sovereign work has influenced confessional Presbyterianism and broader evangelical theology. The distinction between outward and inward call remains a hallmark of Reformed soteriology, ensuring a God-centered understanding of conversion and the new birth. Their formulations continue to serve as doctrinal standards for churches and seminaries worldwide.
