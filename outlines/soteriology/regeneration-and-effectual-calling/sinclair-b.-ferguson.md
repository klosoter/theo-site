# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson articulates a classically Reformed understanding of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of the **Holy Spirit** in applying **redemption**. He maintains that regeneration is a monergistic act, inseparably linked to effectual calling, which brings the elect into union with **Christ** and enables saving faith.

- "Regeneration is the act of God by which new life is implanted in the heart, and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy." ("The Holy Spirit")

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (Contours of Christian Theology, 1996)
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction (1981)
- Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister is Called to Be (2017)
- “Effectual Calling and Regeneration” in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair B. Ferguson, David F. Wright, 1988)
- Children of the Living God (1989)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Work of the Spirit**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of the **Holy Spirit**, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - It precedes and enables any human response to the gospel.
    - The Spirit’s work is both mysterious and effectual, producing a real inward change.
    - Regeneration is necessary due to the total depravity of fallen humanity.
    - "Regeneration is not the fruit or result of faith, but its cause." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Effectual Calling and Union with Christ**
    - Effectual calling is the outward call of the gospel made inwardly effective by the Spirit.
    - It results in actual union with **Christ**, not merely a potential relationship.
    - The call is particular and efficacious for the elect alone.
    - This calling brings about all the benefits of salvation, beginning with regeneration.
    - "The call of God is not merely an invitation, but a summons that brings about what it commands." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Monergism in Salvation**
    - Salvation, including regeneration and calling, is entirely of God’s initiative.
    - Human will is passive in regeneration; faith and repentance are gifts resulting from new birth.
    - Monergism safeguards the doctrines of **grace** and the glory of God in salvation.
    - This view opposes synergistic or semi-Pelagian understandings of conversion.
    - "The new birth is not the result of human decision, but of divine action." (The Holy Spirit)

4. **Word and Spirit in Regeneration**
    - The Spirit works through the **Word of God** to bring about regeneration.
    - There is no regeneration apart from the proclamation of the gospel.
    - The external call of the Word is made effectual by the internal work of the Spirit.
    - This maintains the necessity of preaching and evangelism within God’s sovereign plan.
    - "The Spirit never works apart from the Word, and the Word is never effectual apart from the Spirit." (The Holy Spirit)

5. **Transformation and New Identity**
    - Regeneration results in a new heart and a transformed disposition toward God.
    - The believer receives a new identity as a child of God, with new affections and desires.
    - This transformation is the foundation for sanctification and perseverance.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s regenerating work and its fruits.
    - "Regeneration is the beginning of the new creation in the believer." (Children of the Living God)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s teaching on **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has reinforced the classical Reformed emphasis on the sovereignty of God in salvation, shaping contemporary evangelical and Presbyterian thought. His clear articulation of the monergistic work of the Spirit has provided pastors and theologians with robust resources for preaching and discipleship. Ferguson’s influence extends through his writings, lectures, and pastoral ministry, making him a key voice in the ongoing recovery of Reformed soteriology.
