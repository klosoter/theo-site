# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, emphasized the **sovereign initiative of God** in **regeneration** and **effectual calling**, situating these doctrines firmly within the framework of **union with Christ** and **ordo salutis**. He argued that regeneration is a **monergistic work of the Holy Spirit**, preceding and enabling faith, and that effectual calling is the means by which God brings the elect into saving relationship with Himself.

- "Regeneration is the act of God by which the principle of the new life is implanted in man, and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy." ("Saved by Grace," p. 101)

## Key Works

- "Saved by Grace" (1989)
- "The Bible and the Future" (1979)
- "Created in God's Image" (1986)
- "The Four Major Cults" (1963) [for comparative soteriology]
- "The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination" (contributor, various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign, Monergistic Act**
   - Regeneration is exclusively the work of the **Holy Spirit** without human cooperation.
   - It is the **implantation of new spiritual life**, not merely a moral reformation.
   - This act precedes and enables the sinner’s response in faith and repentance.
   - The human will is renewed and liberated from bondage to sin.
   - "Regeneration is not a cooperative effort between God and man, but is accomplished by God alone." ("Saved by Grace," p. 101)

2. **Effectual Calling as the Application of Redemption**
   - Effectual calling is distinguished from the general, external call of the gospel.
   - It is the **internal, irresistible summons** by which God draws the elect to Himself.
   - This call is always successful in bringing about the intended response—faith.
   - Effectual calling is grounded in Christ’s atoning work and the Spirit’s application.
   - "The effectual call is that act of God whereby He powerfully summons persons to Himself in such a way that they respond in saving faith." ("Saved by Grace," p. 94)

3. **Union with Christ as the Context for Regeneration**
   - All benefits of salvation, including regeneration, flow from **union with Christ**.
   - Regeneration is not an isolated event but part of the believer’s incorporation into Christ.
   - The Spirit unites the believer to Christ, making regeneration possible and effectual.
   - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (new life).
   - "All the blessings of salvation flow from our union with Christ, including regeneration." ("Saved by Grace," p. 64)

4. **Ordo Salutis: Logical, Not Temporal, Sequence**
   - Hoekema affirms a logical order in the application of salvation: calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification.
   - Regeneration logically precedes faith, as spiritual life is necessary for a faith response.
   - The ordo salutis is not strictly chronological but reflects the interrelatedness of salvation’s aspects.
   - This order safeguards the priority of divine grace over human response.
   - "Regeneration must precede faith, for only those who have been made alive by the Spirit can believe." ("Saved by Grace," p. 103)

5. **Transformation of the Whole Person**
   - Regeneration involves a radical transformation of the heart, mind, and will.
   - The image of God, marred by sin, begins to be restored in the regenerate.
   - This transformation is the foundation for sanctification and perseverance.
   - Regeneration results in new desires, affections, and orientation toward God.
   - "Regeneration is the beginning of the renewal of the whole man after the image of God." ("Created in God's Image," p. 98)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in emphasizing the Spirit’s sovereign initiative and the centrality of **union with Christ**. His clear, pastoral exposition of these doctrines has influenced both academic theology and church teaching. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for understanding the Reformed view of the application of redemption and the transformation wrought by the Holy Spirit in salvation.
