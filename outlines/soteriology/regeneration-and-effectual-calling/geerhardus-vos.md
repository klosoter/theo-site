# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of regeneration and effectual calling**, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of God in the application of **redemption**. For Vos, **regeneration** is a monergistic act of the **Holy Spirit**, inseparably linked to the **ordo salutis**, and serves as the foundation for all subsequent saving benefits, including **effectual calling** and **faith**.

- "Regeneration is the implanting of the new life, effectual calling is the calling forth of this life into activity." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3")

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Soteriology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (Princeton Theological Review)
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign, Monergistic Act**
    - Regeneration is exclusively the work of **God the Holy Spirit**, without human cooperation.
    - It is the initial impartation of **spiritual life** to the elect.
    - Human will plays no preparatory or cooperative role in regeneration.
    - Regeneration precedes all conscious acts of faith and repentance.
    - "Regeneration is not a process in which man co-operates with God, but a creative act of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Distinction Between Regeneration and Effectual Calling**
    - Regeneration is the ontological change; effectual calling is the summons to faith.
    - Effectual calling is the external and internal call, made effective by the Spirit.
    - The two are inseparable but logically distinct in the **ordo salutis**.
    - Regeneration enables the response to the effectual call.
    - "The call is effectual because it is accompanied by the creative act of regeneration." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Centrality of Union with Christ**
    - All saving benefits, including regeneration and calling, flow from **union with Christ**.
    - Regeneration is the means by which believers are incorporated into Christ.
    - Effectual calling is the historical realization of this union in the life of the elect.
    - The Spirit applies the work of Christ to individuals through these acts.
    - "Union with Christ underlies every step in the application of redemption." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Biblical-Theological Emphasis on Redemptive History**
    - Vos situates regeneration and calling within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - He stresses the continuity of the Spirit’s work from Old to New Testament.
    - The application of redemption is grounded in the accomplishment of redemption.
    - The eschatological gift of the Spirit is the source of new life.
    - "The Spirit’s work in the believer is the continuation of the redemptive process begun in Christ." (The Pauline Eschatology)

5. **Faith as the First Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Faith is not the cause but the result of regeneration.
    - The Spirit enables the elect to respond in faith through the effectual call.
    - Regeneration produces the capacity for spiritual perception and trust.
    - This order safeguards the priority of grace in salvation.
    - "Faith is the first conscious exercise of the new principle of life implanted in regeneration." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **regeneration and effectual calling** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, especially in emphasizing the monergistic work of the Spirit and the priority of grace. His integration of biblical theology with systematic categories provided a framework for understanding the application of redemption within the broader sweep of **redemptive history**. Vos’s influence endures in both academic and pastoral contexts, reinforcing the distinctiveness of the Reformed doctrine of salvation.
