# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **regeneration** and **effectual calling** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected traditional supernaturalist accounts, instead emphasizing the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** as the moment of authentic decision and transformation. For Bultmann, the call of God is realized in the existential response of faith, not in a metaphysical change of nature.

- "It is the word of proclamation that confronts man with the possibility of decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Regeneration**
   - Regeneration is not a supernatural event but a metaphor for existential transformation.
   - The biblical language of new birth is reinterpreted as the individual's awakening to authentic existence.
   - Myths about spiritual rebirth are to be translated into existential categories.
   - The focus is on the meaning of the text for the present hearer, not on metaphysical change.
   - "The mythological event of rebirth is to be understood as the existential event of coming to faith." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Effectual Calling**
   - Effectual calling is the existential summons to decision in response to the kerygma.
   - The call is not irresistible grace but the confrontation with the possibility of authentic existence.
   - Human freedom and responsibility are central to responding to the call.
   - The event of hearing the word is where the call becomes real for the individual.
   - "Faith is decision, not a supernatural gift." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation of Christ is the medium through which regeneration and calling occur.
   - The kerygma is not about historical facts but about the existential challenge to the hearer.
   - The transformative power lies in the message, not in external rites or sacraments.
   - The encounter with the kerygma demands a personal, existential response.
   - "The kerygma confronts man with himself and with God." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Rejection of Objective Supernaturalism**
   - Bultmann denies that God acts in history in supernatural ways as traditionally conceived.
   - Regeneration is not an ontological change but a new self-understanding.
   - Effectual calling is not a metaphysical act but an existential event.
   - The supernatural is reinterpreted as the breaking-in of meaning in the present.
   - "We cannot use electric light and radio and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

5. **Faith as Existential Decision**
   - Faith is the individual's response to the call, not a passive reception of grace.
   - Regeneration and calling are realized in the act of existential trust and commitment.
   - The decision of faith is a radical reorientation of existence.
   - Assurance comes not from objective change but from authentic self-understanding before God.
   - "To believe is to be open to the future, to be ready for the new." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to **regeneration** and **effectual calling** profoundly shaped 20th-century theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical transformation to existential encounter. His method of **demythologization** influenced both biblical scholarship and existentialist theology, challenging traditional Reformed categories. While controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann's work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between faith, history, and human existence. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of salvation and the interpretation of biblical language.
