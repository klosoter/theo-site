# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within his broader project of grounding theology in **religious experience** rather than metaphysical or forensic categories. For Schleiermacher, regeneration is the awakening of **God-consciousness** in the individual, effected not by an external call but by participation in the **life of Christ** as mediated through the **Christian community**. He thus shifts the focus from supernatural intervention to the transformation of consciousness within the context of communal faith.

- "Regeneration is nothing else than the transition from the natural state to the state of grace." (The Christian Faith, §121)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Awakening of God-Consciousness**
    - Regeneration is the emergence of a new **God-consciousness** within the individual.
    - It is not a metaphysical change of substance but a transformation of self-awareness.
    - The process is continuous and dynamic, not a single momentary event.
    - The experience of Christ’s influence is central to this awakening.
    - "Regeneration is the communication of the God-consciousness, which was originally present in Christ, to the individual." (The Christian Faith, §121)

2. **Effectual Calling as Mediation through the Community**
    - The call to faith is mediated through the **Christian community** rather than direct divine action.
    - The community embodies and transmits the life of Christ to its members.
    - Participation in communal worship and practice is essential for effectual calling.
    - The Spirit works immanently within the historical church.
    - "The communication of the divine life proceeds from the Redeemer through the fellowship of believers." (The Christian Faith, §122)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Theology is rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Regeneration is understood as a deepening of this fundamental experience.
    - Doctrinal formulations are secondary to lived experience.
    - The subjective appropriation of faith is central to salvation.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith, §19)

4. **Rejection of Forensic and Mechanistic Models**
    - Schleiermacher rejects the forensic model of justification and regeneration.
    - He opposes the idea of an external, irresistible call.
    - Salvation is not a legal transaction but an existential transformation.
    - The process is organic, not mechanical or juridical.
    - "The transition from the state of sin to the state of grace is not to be conceived as a forensic act." (The Christian Faith, §114)

5. **Christ as the Archetype and Mediator of Regeneration**
    - Christ’s perfect God-consciousness is the source of regeneration for all believers.
    - The historical person of Jesus is essential for the transmission of divine life.
    - Union with Christ is realized through participation in his community.
    - Christ mediates the new life, not by substitution, but by communication of his consciousness.
    - "In Christ, the divine has become personal and historical, and only through him is regeneration possible." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, shifting emphasis from metaphysical change to **religious experience** and communal mediation. His approach laid the groundwork for later liberal and existential theologies, challenging classical Reformed categories. While criticized by confessional traditions, his thought remains foundational for understanding the development of modern doctrines of salvation and the role of the **church** in mediating faith.
