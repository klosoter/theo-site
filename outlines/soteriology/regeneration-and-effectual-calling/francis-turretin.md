# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of **Reformed scholasticism**. He emphasized the **monergistic** work of the **Holy Spirit** in imparting new spiritual life, distinguishing sharply between external gospel call and the internal, efficacious call that results in true conversion. Turretin’s careful distinctions and polemics against both Roman Catholic and Arminian views shaped later Reformed understandings of these doctrines.

- "Regeneration is not only a change of life, but a change of the very nature itself, and is effected by the supernatural and irresistible operation of the Holy Spirit." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, XV.5.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics XV–XVII)
- The Doctrine of Effectual Calling and Regeneration (sections within Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)
- Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for Turretin’s context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is a Supernatural Work**
    - Regeneration is not a mere moral persuasion or external reformation.
    - It is a creative act of God, producing a new principle of spiritual life.
    - The human will is passive in regeneration, being acted upon by the Holy Spirit.
    - This work is distinct from the external call of the gospel.
    - "Regeneration is properly the supernatural act of God by which the spiritual life is first infused into the elect." (Institutes XV.5.4)

2. **Distinction Between External and Internal Call**
    - The external call is the preaching of the Word to all.
    - The internal call is the efficacious work of the Spirit in the elect alone.
    - Only the internal call results in saving faith and repentance.
    - This distinction safeguards the doctrine of particular grace.
    - "The external call is made by the word; the internal by the Spirit." (Institutes XV.14.1)

3. **Monergism in Effectual Calling**
    - God alone is the efficient cause of effectual calling.
    - Human cooperation is excluded at the moment of regeneration.
    - The Spirit’s work is invincible and cannot be resisted by the elect.
    - Faith and repentance are fruits, not causes, of regeneration.
    - "The calling of God is not only moral but also physical and efficacious." (Institutes XV.4.10)

4. **Irresistibility and Particularity**
    - Effectual calling is granted only to the elect, according to God’s sovereign will.
    - The grace given in effectual calling cannot ultimately be resisted.
    - This ensures the certainty of salvation for those whom God calls.
    - The doctrine opposes both universalism and synergism.
    - "Effectual calling is peculiar to the elect and infallibly brings them to faith." (Institutes XV.14.3)

5. **Regeneration Precedes Faith**
    - Regeneration is logically prior to acts of faith and repentance.
    - The new birth enables the sinner to respond to the gospel.
    - Faith is the first act of the renewed will, not its cause.
    - This order preserves the sovereignty of divine grace.
    - "Regeneration is prior to faith, as the cause is prior to the effect." (Institutes XV.5.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, especially in the development of the doctrine of **monergistic grace**. His distinctions between external and internal call, and his defense of the Spirit’s sovereign initiative, influenced the Westminster Standards and subsequent Reformed confessions. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the necessity and efficacy of the Spirit’s work in salvation within confessional Reformed theology.
