# Louis Berkhof (1873–1957)

Louis Berkhof, a leading figure in 20th-century Reformed theology, articulated a classic understanding of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of **ordo salutis**. He emphasized the **sovereign initiative of God** in salvation, distinguishing sharply between the external call of the gospel and the internal, efficacious work of the **Holy Spirit** that brings about new birth.

- "Regeneration is that act of God by which the principle of the new life is implanted in man, and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially chapters on Soteriology)
- Manual of Christian Doctrine
- The Assurance of Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Monergistic Act**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of **God**, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - It is an instantaneous change, not a process.
    - The human will is **passive** in regeneration; it is acted upon by the Holy Spirit.
    - This act implants a new principle of spiritual life in the soul.
    - "Regeneration is a creative work of the Holy Spirit, in which man is entirely passive." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Distinction Between External and Effectual Calling**
    - The **external call** is the universal proclamation of the gospel.
    - The **effectual call** is the inward call by the Spirit, which infallibly brings about faith.
    - Only the elect receive the effectual call, which is always successful.
    - The effectual call is closely linked to regeneration, often considered simultaneous.
    - "The external call comes through the preaching of the Word, but the internal call is the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Regeneration Precedes Faith**
    - Faith is the result, not the cause, of regeneration.
    - The sinner is spiritually dead and must be made alive before believing.
    - Regeneration enables the exercise of saving faith.
    - This order preserves the **sovereignty of grace** in salvation.
    - "Regeneration logically, though not always temporally, precedes faith." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Irresistibility of Effectual Calling**
    - The effectual call cannot be resisted by those whom God intends to save.
    - The Spirit overcomes all resistance, ensuring the response of faith.
    - This is rooted in the doctrine of **irresistible grace**.
    - The efficacy of the call is grounded in God's eternal decree.
    - "The calling of God is effectual in that it infallibly accomplishes its purpose." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Transformation of the Whole Person**
    - Regeneration affects the intellect, will, and affections.
    - It results in a new disposition oriented toward God and holiness.
    - The change is radical, not merely moral or external.
    - This transformation is the foundation for all subsequent aspects of salvation.
    - "Regeneration is a radical change, affecting the whole man, and is the beginning of sanctification." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkhof’s articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has become a standard reference in Reformed dogmatics, shaping generations of pastors and theologians. His clear distinctions and systematic approach have provided clarity on the relationship between divine sovereignty and human response in salvation. Berkhof’s influence endures especially through his widely used Systematic Theology, which remains a foundational text in Reformed seminaries and among those studying the **ordo salutis**.
