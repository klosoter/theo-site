# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **regeneration** and **effectual calling** are sovereign acts of God, rooted in **divine election** and accomplished by the **Holy Spirit**. He emphasized that the human will is utterly incapable of turning to God apart from this gracious work, and that **faith** itself is a gift produced through the Spirit’s inward renewal.

- "God by his Spirit draws us, and so forms us anew, that the will, being changed, follows his leading." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.3.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 3)
- Commentaries on John (notably John 3 and John 6)
- Sermons on Ephesians (notably Ephesians 2)
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin’s Calvinism (Baker edition; esp. “The Secret Providence of God”)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity is utterly corrupted by sin and unable to initiate salvation.
    - The will is in bondage and cannot choose God apart from grace.
    - Regeneration is necessary because fallen humans are spiritually dead.
    - The need for effectual calling arises from this radical inability.
    - "Man is so enslaved by the yoke of sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or actual pursuit." (Institutes, 2.3.5)

2. **Sovereign Grace in Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is a unilateral work of the Holy Spirit.
    - God alone awakens the dead heart and implants new spiritual life.
    - This act is not a cooperation between God and man, but a divine initiative.
    - The Spirit’s work is both mysterious and effectual.
    - "Regeneration is not only the remission of sins, but also the effectual working of the Spirit, who reforms us to the obedience of God." (Institutes, 3.3.9)

3. **Effectual Calling Distinguished from External Call**
    - The gospel is proclaimed outwardly to all, but only the elect receive the inward call.
    - The external call can be resisted, but the effectual call cannot fail.
    - Effectual calling is the internal work of the Spirit, making the Word efficacious.
    - This calling unites the elect to Christ and produces faith.
    - "By the secret energy of the Spirit, the gospel penetrates into our minds and hearts, so as to become effectual." (Institutes, 3.24.8)

4. **Faith as the Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Faith does not precede regeneration but is its result.
    - The Spirit enables the regenerated person to respond in faith.
    - Faith is not a human achievement but a divine gift.
    - Regeneration and faith are inseparably linked in the order of salvation.
    - "Faith itself is the fruit of spiritual regeneration." (Commentary on John 1:13)

5. **Union with Christ as the Goal**
    - Regeneration and calling unite the believer to Christ.
    - All benefits of salvation flow from this union.
    - The Spirit’s work brings the elect into fellowship with Christ.
    - Assurance and sanctification are grounded in this vital union.
    - "We are regenerated by faith; and by regeneration we receive a new life, by which we become new creatures and are made partakers of the divine nature." (Institutes, 3.3.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of **regeneration and effectual calling** has profoundly shaped the **Reformed tradition**, especially in its understanding of salvation as a monergistic work of God. His clear distinction between the external and internal call influenced later confessional standards and debates on the nature of conversion. Calvin’s emphasis on the Spirit’s sovereign initiative continues to inform discussions on the ordo salutis and the relationship between faith and regeneration. His legacy endures in both academic theology and pastoral practice.
