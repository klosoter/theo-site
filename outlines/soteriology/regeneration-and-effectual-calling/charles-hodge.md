# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed doctrine** of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of the **Holy Spirit** in imparting spiritual life to the elect. He distinguished between the external call of the gospel and the internal, efficacious work of God that results in genuine conversion, grounding his views in the **Westminster Standards** and a high view of **divine sovereignty**.

- "Regeneration is the instantaneous change from spiritual death to spiritual life, imparted by the almighty power of the Holy Spirit." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. 2 & 3)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Sermons
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Act of God**
    - Regeneration is not a cooperative process but a unilateral act of **divine grace**.
    - The human will is passive in regeneration; it is God who initiates and completes the work.
    - This change is instantaneous, not gradual, marking the beginning of spiritual life.
    - Regeneration precedes faith, enabling the sinner to respond to the gospel.
    - "Regeneration, therefore, is not the act of the sinner, but of God." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

2. **Distinction Between External and Effectual Calling**
    - The external call is the general proclamation of the gospel to all people.
    - The effectual call is the inward work of the Spirit, making the call effective for the elect.
    - Only those who are effectually called are regenerated and come to saving faith.
    - This distinction upholds the particularity of salvation and the necessity of the Spirit's work.
    - "The call becomes effectual only through the inward operation of the Holy Spirit." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Necessity of the Holy Spirit’s Work**
    - Fallen humanity is spiritually dead and unable to respond to God apart from the Spirit.
    - The Spirit alone can overcome the bondage of the will and impart new life.
    - Regeneration is a supernatural work, not achievable by human effort or persuasion.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **redemption** to the elect in time.
    - "The Spirit acts immediately upon the soul, producing a radical change in its character." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

4. **Faith as the Immediate Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Faith does not cause regeneration; rather, regeneration enables faith.
    - The regenerated person is given a new disposition, inclining them to trust in Christ.
    - This order preserves the monergistic nature of salvation.
    - Assurance and sanctification flow from the new life imparted in regeneration.
    - "Faith is the first and immediate effect of regeneration." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

5. **Union with Christ Initiated in Regeneration**
    - Regeneration establishes the vital union between the believer and Christ.
    - This union is spiritual, effected by the Holy Spirit, and foundational for all subsequent blessings.
    - Through union with Christ, believers receive justification, adoption, and sanctification.
    - The new birth marks the beginning of this union and all its benefits.
    - "Union with Christ is the source of all spiritual life, and is effected in regeneration." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** became a standard for American Presbyterian and Reformed theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians at Princeton and beyond. His careful distinctions between the external and internal call, and his emphasis on the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit, reinforced the monergistic character of salvation in the Reformed tradition. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **ordo salutis** and the doctrine of grace, providing a clear, confessional framework for understanding the application of redemption.
