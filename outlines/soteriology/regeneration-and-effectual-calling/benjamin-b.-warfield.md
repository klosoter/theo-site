# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a leading defender of the **Reformed doctrine** of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**, emphasizing the absolute sovereignty of **God’s grace** in the salvation of sinners. He taught that **regeneration** is a monergistic act of the **Holy Spirit** that precedes and enables faith, and that **effectual calling** is the means by which God inwardly brings the elect to new life.

- "The call of God is not merely an invitation; it is an effectual act by which the soul is brought to life." ("The Plan of Salvation")

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "Regeneration" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Holy Spirit" (in Studies in Theology)
- "Faith and Life"
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is a sovereign, immediate act of God**
    - Regeneration is the unilateral work of the **Holy Spirit**, not a cooperative process.
    - It is instantaneous, imparting new spiritual life to the sinner.
    - The human will plays no role in initiating regeneration.
    - The result is a radical transformation of the sinner’s nature.
    "Regeneration is the creative act of the Holy Spirit, implanting the new principle of life." ("Regeneration")

2. **Effectual calling is distinct from the general call**
    - The general call is the external preaching of the gospel to all people.
    - Effectual calling is the internal, efficacious work of God in the elect.
    - Only those whom God effectually calls respond in faith.
    - This distinction upholds the doctrine of **particular redemption**.
    "The outward call is made effectual only by the inward operation of the Spirit." ("The Plan of Salvation")

3. **Faith is the result, not the cause, of regeneration**
    - Regeneration precedes and enables saving faith.
    - The sinner, being spiritually dead, cannot believe apart from new birth.
    - Faith is the first act of the renewed heart.
    - This order preserves the monergism of salvation.
    "It is not faith that produces the new birth, but the new birth that produces faith." ("Faith and Life")

4. **Monergism in salvation**
    - Salvation is entirely the work of God from beginning to end.
    - Human cooperation is excluded at the point of regeneration.
    - The will is made willing by the renewing work of the Spirit.
    - This commitment undergirds Warfield’s opposition to synergistic views.
    "The whole work is of God, and man contributes nothing to his own regeneration." ("The Plan of Salvation")

5. **Union with Christ as the context for regeneration and calling**
    - Regeneration unites the believer to **Christ** by the Spirit.
    - Effectual calling is the means by which one is brought into this union.
    - All the benefits of salvation flow from this vital union.
    - This union is both legal and vital, grounding **justification** and **sanctification**.
    "All the saving acts of God are rooted in our union with Christ." ("The Holy Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** solidified the Reformed emphasis on the sovereignty of divine grace in salvation. His rigorous defense of **monergism** shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond, influencing twentieth-century Reformed soteriology. Warfield’s distinctions between the general and effectual call remain foundational in contemporary discussions of the ordo salutis. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the Spirit’s decisive role in bringing sinners to new life in Christ.
