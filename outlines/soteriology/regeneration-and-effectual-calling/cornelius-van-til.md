# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til regarded **regeneration** and **effectual calling** as essential elements of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing that the **sovereign grace** of God and the **work of the Holy Spirit** are indispensable for salvation. He maintained that, due to **total depravity**, fallen humanity is utterly unable to respond to the gospel apart from God’s monergistic action.

- "Regeneration is the prerequisite for any true knowledge of God and for any saving response to the gospel." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- The Reformed Pastor and Modern Thought (articles and essays)
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration precedes faith**
    - Fallen humans are spiritually dead and incapable of self-initiated faith.
    - The Holy Spirit sovereignly imparts new life, enabling a saving response.
    - Faith is the fruit, not the cause, of regeneration.
    - This order preserves the monergistic nature of salvation.
    "It is only the regenerated heart that can truly respond to the call of the gospel." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Effectual calling is distinct from external calling**
    - The external call is the universal proclamation of the gospel.
    - The internal, or effectual, call is the Spirit’s work in the elect.
    - Only the effectual call results in conversion and faith.
    - This distinction upholds the particularity of grace.
    "The call of God is effectual only for those whom the Spirit regenerates." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Total depravity necessitates sovereign grace**
    - Human nature is wholly corrupted by sin, affecting mind, will, and affections.
    - No one seeks God or responds rightly apart from divine intervention.
    - Regeneration overcomes the noetic effects of sin.
    - Salvation is entirely of the Lord, not of human cooperation.
    "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Covenantal context of regeneration**
    - Regeneration occurs within the covenant of grace, not as an isolated event.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s redemptive work to the elect in history.
    - The means of grace (Word and sacrament) are instruments in effectual calling.
    - The covenant community is the ordinary sphere of the Spirit’s regenerating work.
    "God’s covenantal dealings are the context in which regeneration and calling take place." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetic implications of regeneration**
    - Only the regenerate can properly interpret reality according to God’s revelation.
    - Unregenerate reasoning is fundamentally suppressive of the truth.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the necessity of regeneration for true knowledge.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in the work of the Spirit.
    "The difference between the believer and the unbeliever is ultimately a matter of regeneration." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** reinforced the Reformed focus on the sovereignty of God in salvation and the radical inability of fallen humanity. His integration of these doctrines with **presuppositional apologetics** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary. Van Til’s insistence on the necessity of the Spirit’s work for both salvation and epistemology continues to influence discussions of **Reformed soteriology** and the relationship between theology and apologetics.
