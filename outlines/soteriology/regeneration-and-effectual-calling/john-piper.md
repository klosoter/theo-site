# John Piper (1946–)

John Piper emphasizes the **sovereign initiative of God** in **regeneration** and **effectual calling**, teaching that the new birth is a monergistic act of the Holy Spirit that irresistibly brings spiritually dead sinners to life. He closely links **regeneration** with the awakening of faith, arguing that faith is the immediate fruit, not the cause, of the new birth, and that **effectual calling** is the means by which God applies redemption to the elect. Piper’s approach is deeply rooted in the **Reformed tradition**, highlighting the necessity and power of God’s grace in salvation.

- "The new birth is not the improvement of your old human nature, but the creation of a new human nature—a nature that is really you and is really new and is really created by God." ("Finally Alive")

## Key Works

- "Finally Alive: What Happens When We Are Born Again?" (2009)
- "Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist" (1986)
- "Five Points: Towards a Deeper Experience of God’s Grace" (2013)
- "The Justification of God" (1983)
- "What Happens in the New Birth?" (sermon series)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is a Sovereign, Monergistic Work**
    - God alone acts in **regeneration**; human will plays no initiating role.
    - The Holy Spirit imparts spiritual life to those who are spiritually dead.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables faith, not vice versa.
    - This new birth is a supernatural creation, not a moral improvement.
    - "The decisive act of new birth is God’s, not man’s." ("Finally Alive")

2. **Effectual Calling is Irresistible and Particular**
    - God’s call to the elect is always effective, bringing about the intended response.
    - The external call of the gospel becomes internal and effectual by the Spirit.
    - Effectual calling is inseparable from **regeneration**; both are aspects of God’s saving work.
    - Only those whom God calls inwardly will respond in faith.
    - "God’s call creates what it commands." ("Five Points")

3. **Faith is the Immediate Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Saving faith is not the cause but the result of being born again.
    - The new birth enables the sinner to see and savor Christ as supremely valuable.
    - Faith is both a gift and a response, made possible by the Spirit’s work.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in the evidence of faith and new affections.
    - "We do not believe in order to be born again; we are born again in order to believe." ("Finally Alive")

4. **The Word of God as the Means of Regeneration**
    - The Spirit uses the preaching of the **gospel** as the instrument of new birth.
    - The Word awakens spiritual life by revealing the glory of Christ.
    - Regeneration is not disconnected from the means of grace, especially Scripture.
    - The new birth is always accompanied by a new love for God’s Word.
    - "The new birth comes through the living and abiding word of God." ("Finally Alive")

5. **Transformation of Desires and Affections**
    - Regeneration results in a radical change of heart, producing new desires.
    - The believer’s supreme joy becomes God Himself, not merely His gifts.
    - True conversion is marked by a delight in God and hatred of sin.
    - The new birth is evidenced by a life increasingly conformed to Christ.
    - "The evidence of the new birth is not perfection but a new direction." ("Desiring God")

## Legacy and Impact

John Piper has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical and **Reformed soteriology**, especially regarding the doctrines of **regeneration** and **effectual calling**. His clear articulation of the Spirit’s sovereign work in salvation has influenced pastors, theologians, and laypeople worldwide. Piper’s emphasis on the experiential and transformative aspects of the new birth has helped recover a robust, God-centered view of conversion within the church. His writings and sermons continue to inspire a deeper appreciation for the necessity and power of God’s grace in the salvation of sinners.
