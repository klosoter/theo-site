# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther taught that **regeneration** and **effectual calling** are entirely the work of God through the **Word** and **Spirit**, emphasizing the utter inability of fallen humanity to contribute to their own salvation. He insisted that the **bondage of the will** makes divine initiative necessary, and that faith itself is a gift granted in the moment of regeneration by the proclamation of the **Gospel**.

- "For man’s will is like a beast standing between two riders. If God rides it, it wills and goes where God wills... If Satan rides, it wills and goes where Satan wills." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Key Works

- The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)
- Lectures on Romans
- Small and Large Catechisms
- Commentary on Galatians
- Luther’s Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Total Inability and Bondage of the Will**
    - Humanity is utterly incapable of turning to God apart from divine intervention.
    - The will is enslaved to sin after the Fall, unable to choose spiritual good.
    - Regeneration is necessary because of this radical corruption.
    - Any movement toward God is initiated by God alone.
    - "Free will, after the fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able to do, it commits a mortal sin." (The Bondage of the Will)

2. **Regeneration by the Word and Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit works through the external Word to create new life.
    - Regeneration is not a human achievement but a divine act.
    - The means of grace (Word and Sacrament) are the instruments of regeneration.
    - Faith is produced in the heart by the Spirit’s sovereign work.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given to no one without, or outside, the Word." (Preface to Romans)

3. **Effectual Calling through the Gospel**
    - The Gospel call is the means by which God summons the elect to faith.
    - This call is not merely external but is made effectual by the Spirit’s inward work.
    - The preached Word is the vehicle for God’s saving summons.
    - The efficacy of the call depends on God’s will, not human response.
    - "The Word does not become fruitful by our doing, but by the power of God." (Lectures on Romans)

4. **Faith as Gift, Not Human Work**
    - Faith is not a human decision but a gift granted in regeneration.
    - The sinner is passive in receiving faith, which is worked by God alone.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ and appropriates the benefits of salvation.
    - Assurance rests on God’s promise, not on human effort.
    - "Faith is a divine work in us. It changes us and makes us to be born anew of God." (Preface to Romans)

5. **Monergism in Salvation**
    - Salvation is the work of God alone from start to finish.
    - Human cooperation is excluded in the initial act of regeneration.
    - The Spirit alone brings about the new birth and effectual calling.
    - All boasting is excluded, and glory belongs to God alone.
    - "It is not in our power to think, to will, or to do anything, but only in the power of God." (The Bondage of the Will)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of **monergism** and the utter dependence of sinners on God’s sovereign grace shaped the Protestant understanding of regeneration and effectual calling. His emphasis on the **bondage of the will** and the necessity of the **Word and Spirit** influenced both Lutheran and Reformed traditions. Luther’s teaching continues to be foundational for discussions of human inability, the nature of faith, and the means by which God brings sinners to new life in Christ.
