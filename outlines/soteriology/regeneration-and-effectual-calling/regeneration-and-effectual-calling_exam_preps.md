- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, Francis Turretin, Jonathan Edwards, Herman Bavinck.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian and medieval **grace** theology, Reformed **federal theology** and scholasticism, Puritan and Edwardsian developments, post-Reformation debates with Arminianism and modern evangelical revisions.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: ordo salutis relations of **effectual calling**, **regeneration**, and faith; the nature of the call; preparatory grace and means; extent of monergism.

- Defended position: A classically Reformed, Augustinian view in which **effectual calling** is the triune God’s sovereign, verbal summons in union with Christ, and **regeneration** is the instantaneous, monergistic, supernatural re-creation of the sinner’s heart that infallibly produces repentance and faith through the ordained means of the Word.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of **regeneration and effectual calling** forces precision on several pressure points where Reformed soteriology either stands coherently or dissolves: the nature of grace, the reality of human inability, the relation of Word and Spirit, the ordo salutis, and the grounding of assurance. At its core, the Reformed confessional tradition, exemplified in Westminster Confession of Faith 10, speaks of an **effectual calling** by which God, out of his free and special grace alone, calls his elect in time through the Word and Spirit, taking away their heart of stone and giving a heart of flesh, renewing the will, and so drawing them that they come most freely, being made willing by his grace. This description already bundles several conceptual strands: an outward gospel call addressed indiscriminately, an inward call or **regeneration** by the Spirit, the renovation of mind and will, and the consequent exercise of faith and repentance. To defend this under oral examination, one needs to move fluidly from exegesis to dogmatics, and from historical development to contemporary distortions, while holding one clear thesis: God alone, by **monergistic regeneration** through the Word and Spirit, effectually calls the elect so that they freely and infallibly believe in Christ.

Augustine is the first decisive figure because the entire later debate about **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace** runs along channels he cut in his anti-Pelagian writings. Early in his career, Augustine could speak in more synergistic tones, but in works like On the Spirit and the Letter and On the Predestination of the Saints he sharpened his language to insist that fallen humans are not merely weak but spiritually dead, in bondage to concupiscence, and therefore unable even to begin to will the good without prior, sovereign grace. For Augustine, the law commands but cannot give what it demands; only the Spirit writes the law on the heart. Here the seeds of **regeneration** as an internal transformation appear. He distinguishes between the external preaching of the gospel and an internal gift of delight in the good. Grace is not merely the offer of help but the effective bestowal of a new love. This is the Augustinian anticipation of what Reformed theology will later call **effectual calling**.

An examiner might press: Does Augustine yet clearly have a notion of a distinct regenerative moment? The answer is that Augustine’s ordo salutis is less schematized than later Reformed constructions, but the substance is there. His insistence that the “gift of perseverance” is infallibly given to the elect, and that the will is irresistibly but non-coercively sweetly drawn, anticipates the Reformed defense of **irresistible grace**. Against Pelagius, Augustine insists that grace gives not only the possibility of believing but actual faith itself. Against semi-Pelagians, he denies that God elects on foreseen faith. Yet Augustine retains a strong emphasis on the preached Word and sacraments, so his view is not a bare metaphysical change detached from the means of grace. This trajectory makes him the deep root of later debates: Roman Catholic synergism tries to retain Augustine’s language but modifies its logic; Arminianism and Wesleyanism claim to be faithful to Augustine while softening his account of inability and efficacious grace; the Reformed confessions claim continuity with Augustine’s strongest anti-Pelagian claims.

John Calvin represents a second decisive figure and must be treated in more detail, because he reframes the doctrine around union with Christ and the duplex grace of justification and sanctification. In the Institutes, particularly book 3, Calvin insists that as long as Christ remains outside us and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done is of no value to us. The Spirit is therefore given as the bond of **union with Christ**, and this union is realized by faith. But immediately the question arises: how does a spiritually dead sinner come to faith? Calvin’s answer is that the Spirit works a **secret regeneration** in the heart which produces faith. He can speak both of **regeneration** as the entire lifelong process of renewal and, in some places, as the initial quickening that gives rise to faith. Examiners will frequently probe this ambiguity: does Calvin place regeneration logically prior to faith or identify them?

The best reading, supported by scholars like Richard Muller and in line with later confessional theology, is that Calvin materially affirms what later Reformed theology will call a pre-faith **effectual calling**. Calvin states that faith is the work of the Holy Spirit, that the human heart is so corrupt that only the Spirit’s illumination can cause us to assent to the gospel, and that the Spirit’s work is not merely moral persuasion but a new creation. His commentary on John 6 is decisive: all whom the Father draws come to Christ; this drawing is efficacious, not a mere invitation. Calvin therefore stands squarely in the Augustinian line of **irresistible grace**, now integrated with a robust account of **divine sovereignty** and **providence**.

Calvin also clarifies the relation of Word and Spirit. The preaching of the gospel is the outward call, and the Spirit’s internal work is inseparable from this Word yet not bound to it ex opere operato. Here a key Reformed commitment emerges: **regeneration** is ordinarily wrought by the Spirit through the Word, not apart from it. If an examiner presses whether infants can be regenerated apart from the preached Word, Calvin allows that God is free to work in infants sovereignly, yet he refuses to loosen the ordinary link between Word and Spirit. This protects against a mystical interiorism, on the one hand, and a bare externalism on the other.

Francis Turretin, as a third decisive figure, represents the high Reformed scholastic clarification of this entire complex. His Institutes of Elenctic Theology systematically treats **effectual calling** and **regeneration** within a carefully articulated ordo salutis. Turretin explicitly distinguishes between the external call by the Word and the internal call by the Spirit, and he defines **effectual calling** as that internal, supernatural, immediate operation of God by which he efficaciously illuminates the mind, bends the will, and infallibly leads the sinner to Christ. Turretin’s method is elenctic: he lists the questions, the opposing positions, and then answers with exegesis and dogmatic reasoning. He explicitly rejects the Lutheran identification of calling and justification, and the Remonstrant view that grace is resistible. For Turretin, the external call is sincere and well meant to all who hear, grounded in the revealed will of God. Yet only in the elect does God add internal grace, making the call efficacious.

Turretin’s precision on **monergism** is crucial for oral defense. He denies any cooperative causality in the first moment of conversion. The human will is indeed active and free in conversion, but its freedom is the result of prior liberating grace, not a co-initiating cause. He carefully distinguishes physical and moral necessity: grace does not compel the will physically but changes its moral disposition so that it chooses Christ willingly, yet infallibly. This is how Turretin answers the common objection: If grace is irresistible, does it not destroy freedom? The reply is that freedom is not indifference but the ability to act according to one’s renewed nature. Thus **effectual calling** restores, rather than cancels, true freedom.

Turretin also refines the relation between **regeneration** and faith. He argues that in the strict sense, **regeneration** is logically and causally prior to the first act of faith: an infused habitus or new principle of spiritual life from which faith as an act proceeds. Yet he is quick to add that chronologically the two are simultaneous. There is no temporal gap in which the regenerate lack faith; the Spirit’s work is instantaneous, and faith is the immediate, inevitable fruit. This distinction between logical and temporal priority is a classic Reformed move and will be tested by examiners. It safeguards two things: that faith is genuinely our act, not the Spirit believing instead of us, and that no autonomous natural power of faith exists in the unregenerate.

Jonathan Edwards, as a fourth decisive figure, brings a profound psychological and metaphysical analysis to the doctrine, with lasting impact on evangelical and Reformed thought. In his Treatise on Religious Affections and Freedom of the Will, Edwards takes the Augustinian and Reformed conviction of moral inability and explicates it in terms of the “greatest apparent good.” The will is not a self-determining faculty but always follows the strongest motive as perceived by the mind. The fallen sinner inevitably perceives God and his law as odious or at least not supremely lovely, and therefore inevitably chooses sin. **Regeneration**, for Edwards, is the infusion of “a new sense, new taste” of the heart, a new disposition by which the sinner now sees God’s beauty and glory as supremely excellent. At that moment, the motives are transformed, and the will necessarily but noncoercively chooses Christ.

Edwards is especially helpful for defending the “efficacy” in **effectual calling**. He can respond to the libertarian free will objection with philosophical rigor: if freedom required the power of contrary choice in the very moment of decision, then God himself would not be free, for he cannot choose evil. Genuine freedom is the ability to act according to one’s moral nature. Regeneration gives a new nature. Thus, the newly regenerated person necessarily believes and repents, yet does so with maximal freedom. Examiners may press whether this removes contingency and thus responsibility. Edwards counters that responsibility is grounded in the alignment of the act with the agent’s own desires and character, not in metaphysical indifference. On the pastoral front, Edwards also warns against confusing mere moral reformation or passing religious impressions with true **regeneration**, insisting on a changed affectional center and durable fruit.

Yet Edwards also sits at the cusp of revivalist distortions. His attempts to defend the revivals helped shape later evangelical emphasis on the crisis moment of being “born again.” This emphasis, detached from his deep metaphysics and affections theology, could slide toward grounding assurance in a remembered experience rather than ongoing faith in Christ and observable **sanctification**. A candidate should be ready to distinguish Edwards’s rich account from later “decisionism” that effectively makes human decision the decisive cause and flattens **effectual calling** into mere persuasion.

Herman Bavinck, as a fifth decisive figure, offers a synthetic, dogmatically rich account that can serve as a model for contemporary articulation. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck insists that **regeneration**, in the narrow sense, is a sovereign, immediate act of God in the subconscious depth of human existence, by which a new disposition is created. He then distinguishes **calling**, **regeneration**, **conversion**, and **faith**, while emphasizing that in the concrete life of the believer these are inseparably intertwined. Bavinck is particularly concerned to preserve both the sovereign freedom of God and the integrity of the human person. Against mechanistic or magical accounts, he insists that God works in a way that fully respects the created nature of the human psyche. The Spirit renews the heart, but does so in and through the mind, conscience, and will, especially by means of Scripture.

Bavinck also addresses modern objections about **divine sovereignty** and personality. If **effectual calling** is monergistic, is the person merely a passive object? Bavinck replies that in the first instants of **regeneration** the person is indeed passive, in the sense that he or she does not cooperate as a cause. But the immediate fruit of regeneration is an active response: faith, repentance, new obedience. Thus the regenerate is never a mere puppet. This aligns with the Reformed insistence that **regeneration** is not an end in itself but the principium of the whole Christian life, oriented toward **union with Christ**, **justification**, and **sanctification**.

Having traced these figures, we can map the main internal Reformed debates. One concerns the precise relation of **effectual calling**, **regeneration**, and faith in the ordo salutis. Some seventeenth-century divines used “regeneration” broadly to cover the whole process of inner renewal, others more narrowly for the initial quickening. The Westminster Standards speak of effectual calling in language that, in later usage, overlaps with regeneration: God enlightens the mind, renews the will, and effectually draws. Yet they also speak of **regeneration** in terms of a “work of God’s free grace” renewing the whole man after the image of God. The internal debate is largely semantic but has implications for preaching and assurance. The position defended here follows Turretin and Bavinck in distinguishing conceptually between the Spirit’s instantaneous act of **regeneration** as the impartation of spiritual life and the broader process of conversion and renewal, while recognizing that Scripture often uses “new birth” language more broadly.

Another internal debate concerns preparatory grace and means. Does Reformed theology allow for non-regenerating operations of the Spirit that prepare sinners for **effectual calling**? The older Reformed often spoke of “common operations” of the Spirit short of regeneration, including conviction of sin, fear of judgment, and even some moral reform. These are real but not saving. Examiners may press whether this blurs the line with Arminian prevenient grace. The answer is that in classic Reformed thought such operations do not remove moral inability or decisively incline the will to Christ; they heighten responsibility and often harden. Saving **regeneration**, by contrast, decisively renews the heart. On the use of means, Reformed theology insists that the Spirit ordinarily regenerates through the preaching of the Word. Yet the Spirit’s act itself is immediate: it does not result from the Word as a natural cause but is a distinct, sovereign action concomitant with the Word.

Turning to external debates, the first contrast is with Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views. Pelagianism denies original sin and thus any need for a supernatural **regeneration**; the will, though needing instruction, is intrinsically able to obey. Semi-Pelagianism concedes some weakness from the fall but holds that the first motion toward God must be from the human side, after which grace cooperates. Both positions are excluded by the Reformed doctrine of total depravity and spiritual death. If humans are “dead in trespasses and sins” in Ephesians 2, then the imagery teaches inability, not mere weakness. The Reformed notion of **effectual calling** as a unilateral divine summons that brings life out of death follows directly. A frequent Roman Catholic objection is that this makes sacraments and cooperation superfluous. Yet in fact, the Reformed affirm that once regenerated, the believer actively cooperates in **sanctification** and receives real spiritual benefit through Word and sacrament. What is denied is cooperative causality in the first moment of life.

Roman Catholic Trent-era theology teaches that initial justification involves the infusion of grace, enabling the sinner to cooperate with God, and that while prevenient grace is necessary, the human will can resist or consent. There is no notion of an infallibly efficacious calling granted only to the elect. Arminian and Wesleyan theology, developing partly from this, affirm total depravity but introduce a universal prevenient grace that restores libertarian freedom to all, making it possible, though not certain, that any person can believe. Grace is resistible; election is conditional on foreseen faith. Here the Reformed must insist on the asymmetry between God’s action and human response. Scriptural language of being “born again,” of God taking out the heart of stone, and of those who are “appointed to eternal life” believing, fits awkwardly with a scheme in which all decisive difference lies in a self-moved compliance. The Reformed doctrine of **effectual calling** locates the decisive difference in God’s gracious act, rendering faith itself a gift, not a self-originating contribution.

A contemporary external challenge arises from open theism and libertarian accounts of freedom. If God does not exhaustively know or determine future free acts, can he guarantee that his call will be efficacious? The Reformed answer is that such a view undermines the very possibility of **effectual calling** and of a sure salvation. The biblical depictions of God’s calling in Romans 8 and John 6 are of a God whose will cannot be thwarted in saving his people. Moreover, if God cannot ensure the success of his summons without violating libertarian freedom, then the concept of a sovereign new birth disappears, replaced by a fragile moral persuasion.

On the contemporary front, evangelicalism often misuses “born again” language as a thin label for a decision or experience. The Reformed doctrine must insist that **regeneration** is a deep ontological change, the inauguration of a new creation, not simply a resolved willpower or emotional high. Yet pastoral practice must not lead introspective souls to search endlessly for an identifiable crisis. Many covenant children grow into faith gradually under the means of grace, and the exact moment of **regeneration** may be obscure. Here the confessional emphasis on the promises of God and the objective work of Christ guards against a morbid preoccupation with the internal act. The examiner may ask whether this view undermines evangelistic urgency. On the contrary, because God has ordained to call and regenerate his elect through preaching, the doctrine of **effectual calling** energizes preaching with confidence: God will save through the foolishness of the message.

A further contemporary debate contrasts propositional or forensic models with relational or participatory models. Some argue that **regeneration** is best construed as entry into a new communal narrative rather than as an ontological change. While union with Christ and incorporation into the church are crucial, the Reformed must insist that without a real change in the heart, relations would remain external and forensic declarations would hang in the air. The new covenant promise of a heart of flesh, the Johannine emphasis on being born of God, and Pauline language of new creation all demand a robust **regeneration**. This in turn undergirds other loci: **justification** is received by faith, and **sanctification** flows from the new principle implanted in regeneration. Undercutting regeneration destabilizes the entire soteriological structure.

Finally, the doctrine has direct implications for assurance and pastoral care. If **effectual calling** is God’s work, grounded in his eternal election, then assurance rests not on the intensity of my experience but on the faithfulness of God. Yet the Reformed also insist that **regeneration** bears fruit in faith and obedience. A credible profession of faith, love for God and neighbor, and a growing hatred of sin are signs that one has been effectually called. Examiners may probe whether this yields a subjective assurance. The best Reformed answer follows Calvin and Bavinck: assurance has an objective ground in Christ’s work and God’s promises, a subjective reception in faith, and a confirmatory dimension in the Spirit’s testimony through the fruit of **sanctification**. The doctrine of **effectual calling** protects against both presumption and despair: presumption, by insisting that grace is transforming, not merely declarative; despair, by insisting that the transformation is God’s work, not mine.

The position therefore to be defended is a classically Reformed, Augustinian account: the triune God, in execution of the **covenant of redemption** and in union with Christ, sovereignly and infallibly calls his elect through the outward gospel and the inward work of the Spirit. In **effectual calling** the Spirit works **regeneration** as an instantaneous, monergistic re-creation of the heart, renewing mind and will so that the sinner, now spiritually alive, freely and inevitably repents and believes. This doctrine coheres with **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, because God’s act of calling in time is the temporal manifestation of his eternal decree, not a new intention in God. It preserves human responsibility, because the regenerate act from a renewed nature and are genuinely active in faith and obedience. It honors the ordained means, because God achieves his end through the preaching of the Word, sacraments, and prayer. It guards the church’s proclamation, because we can address the gospel freely to all, confident that through this weak means God will sovereignly summon the dead to life.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Effectual calling** is God’s sovereign, inward work by Word and Spirit, grounded in election, which infallibly summons the elect from spiritual death to life, and **regeneration** is the instantaneous, monergistic re-creation of the heart that produces repentance and faith.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: anti-Pelagian insistence on sovereign, efficacious grace that gives both ability and will to believe.
  - Calvin: integrates **effectual calling** with union with Christ, Word and Spirit, and insists on irresistible, sweet drawing of the elect.
  - Turretin: scholastic precision on internal versus external call, monergism, logical priority of regeneration to faith, and the sincerity of the free offer.
  - Edwards: analyzes **regeneration** as a new sense of God’s beauty, grounding irresistible grace in a robust account of moral inability and affections.
  - Bavinck: synthesizes Reformed teaching, distinguishing calling, regeneration, conversion, and faith while stressing personality and means of grace.
- Debates:
  - Internal: order of **regeneration**, faith, and conversion; broad or narrow use of regeneration; preparatory grace and common operations; Word and Spirit relation.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian synergism; Roman Catholic and Arminian prevenient grace and resistible calling; open theism’s denial of infallible efficacy.
  - Contemporary: experience-centered “born again” language; relational or narrative-only models; tensions with libertarian freedom; pastoral handling of assurance and nominalism.
- Defended position: A monergistic, Augustinian-Reformed view that God alone sovereignly regenerates and effectually calls through the Word and Spirit, so that the elect freely and inevitably believe, with regeneration logically prior to faith yet simultaneous in time.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is regeneration prior to faith? Conceptually and causally yes, as the new principle of life, though temporally simultaneous with the first act of faith.
  - How is the call “irresistible” yet non-coercive? Grace changes the heart’s disposition so the will chooses Christ freely, according to its renewed nature.
  - Is the external call sincere if not all are effectually called? Yes, because it expresses God’s revealed will and genuine compassion, though he secretly wills to save only the elect.
  - How does this relate to assurance? Assurance rests on God’s promise in Christ, received by faith, and confirmed by the Spirit’s sanctifying fruit in those effectually called.
  - Are means necessary for regeneration? Ordinarily the Spirit regenerates through the proclaimed Word, though God is free to work extraordinarily, especially in covenant children.
