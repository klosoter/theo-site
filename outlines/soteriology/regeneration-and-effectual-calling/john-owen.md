# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen’s doctrine of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** emphasizes the sovereign, monergistic work of the **Holy Spirit** in applying redemption to the elect. He insists that fallen humanity is utterly unable to respond to God apart from this supernatural renewal, and that **effectual calling** infallibly brings the elect to faith in Christ.

- "Regeneration doth not consist in a change of life, but in a change of the principle of life; it is not a new course of action, but a new spiritual nature, given unto us." ("The Holy Spirit," Works, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- "The Holy Spirit" (Works, Vol. 3)
- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed"
- "A Discourse of the Work of the Holy Spirit in Prayer"
- "The Death of Death in the Death of Christ"
- Sinclair Ferguson, John Owen on the Christian Life (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is a sovereign, monergistic act**
   - Regeneration is accomplished solely by the **Holy Spirit** without human cooperation.
   - Fallen humanity is spiritually dead and utterly unable to initiate or contribute to regeneration.
   - The Spirit imparts a new principle of spiritual life, not merely a reformation of behavior.
   - Regeneration precedes and enables faith, rather than resulting from it.
   "The work of regeneration is not a mere moral persuasion, but a real infusion of a new principle of life." ("The Holy Spirit," Works, Vol. 3)

2. **Effectual calling is inseparable from regeneration**
   - **Effectual calling** is the outward and inward summons by which God brings the elect to faith.
   - The external call (Word) is made effectual by the Spirit’s internal work in the heart.
   - All who are effectually called are also regenerated and united to **Christ**.
   - The efficacy of the call depends entirely on God’s purpose, not human response.
   "Whom God calls, he quickens; and whom he quickens, he calls." ("The Holy Spirit," Works, Vol. 3)

3. **Total depravity necessitates supernatural renewal**
   - Humanity’s will and affections are enslaved to sin and cannot turn to God unaided.
   - Regeneration is required to overcome the bondage of the will and spiritual blindness.
   - The Spirit’s work is both necessary and sufficient for spiritual renewal.
   - Moral exhortation or external means alone cannot effect true conversion.
   "Men are no more able of themselves to convert themselves than to raise the dead." ("The Holy Spirit," Works, Vol. 3)

4. **Union with Christ is established through regeneration**
   - Regeneration is the means by which believers are united to **Christ** and receive all saving benefits.
   - This union is spiritual, effected by the indwelling of the Spirit.
   - Faith is the immediate fruit of regeneration and the bond of union with Christ.
   - All aspects of salvation flow from this vital union, initiated by the Spirit’s work.
   "Our union with Christ is the cause of all other graces that we are made partakers of." ("Communion with God," Works, Vol. 2)

5. **Irresistible grace ensures the certainty of salvation**
   - The Spirit’s inward call cannot be finally resisted by the elect.
   - God’s grace in regeneration is effectual and unfailing in its purpose.
   - The elect are infallibly brought to faith and repentance by divine power.
   - This doctrine safeguards the certainty and security of salvation for God’s people.
   "The grace of God in calling is invincible, and cannot be frustrated by the power of man." ("The Holy Spirit," Works, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s robust articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** shaped the Reformed understanding of the ordo salutis, emphasizing the necessity and efficacy of the Spirit’s work in salvation. His insistence on **monergism** and the utter inability of fallen humanity influenced later Puritan and evangelical theology. Owen’s writings remain a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the Holy Spirit, faith, and the application of redemption, continuing to inform Reformed soteriology and pastoral practice.
