# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, offered a robust account of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** rooted in the sovereignty of God’s grace. He emphasized the **monergistic** work of the Holy Spirit in imparting new life and the inseparability of **union with Christ** from the application of redemption. Murray’s articulation of the **ordo salutis** clarified the distinct yet inseparable roles of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the broader framework of **soteriology**.

- "Effectual calling is the act of God the Father, in which by his Word and Spirit he calls men out of their state of sin and death to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- Calvin on the So-Called Five Points of Calvinism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign, Monergistic Act**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of the Holy Spirit, independent of human cooperation.
    - It is the impartation of spiritual life to those who are spiritually dead.
    - The initiative and efficacy belong entirely to God, not to the sinner.
    - Regeneration precedes all acts of faith and repentance in the sinner.
    - "Regeneration is the act of God alone, in which he imparts life to those who are dead in trespasses and sins." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Effectual Calling as Distinct from External Calling**
    - Effectual calling is inward, accomplished by the Holy Spirit, and always results in conversion.
    - External calling refers to the general proclamation of the gospel, which can be resisted.
    - Effectual calling is irresistible because it is grounded in God’s sovereign purpose.
    - The distinction safeguards the efficacy of grace in salvation.
    - "The call becomes effectual only when accompanied by the regenerating work of the Spirit." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Union with Christ as the Context for Application of Redemption**
    - All benefits of salvation, including regeneration and calling, flow from union with Christ.
    - Union with Christ is both the foundation and the context for the ordo salutis.
    - Regeneration and effectual calling are not isolated events but are integrally related to Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The believer’s new life is inseparable from participation in Christ.
    - "Union with Christ is really the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Ordo Salutis: Logical Distinction, Not Temporal Sequence**
    - Murray insists on a logical, not strictly temporal, order in the application of redemption.
    - Regeneration logically precedes faith, but both are inseparable in the experience of the believer.
    - The ordo salutis clarifies the distinct roles of each aspect of salvation without fragmenting them.
    - This approach preserves the unity and coherence of God’s saving work.
    - "The order of salvation is not a series of chronologically discrete acts, but a logical arrangement of the various aspects of the application of redemption." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Necessity and Efficacy of Grace**
    - Human inability necessitates the sovereign initiative of God in salvation.
    - Grace is not merely enabling but effectually brings about the new birth.
    - The efficacy of grace ensures that all whom God calls are brought to faith.
    - This commitment upholds the doctrines of total depravity and irresistible grace.
    - "Grace is invincible; it accomplishes what God intends in the hearts of those whom he calls." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, particularly in emphasizing the monergistic work of the Holy Spirit. His insistence on the logical coherence of the **ordo salutis** and the centrality of **union with Christ** continues to influence theological education and pastoral ministry. Murray’s writings remain a standard reference for those seeking clarity on the application of redemption within the Reformed tradition.
