# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **regeneration** and **effectual calling** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the encounter between God and the human person. He rejected both **Pelagianism** and deterministic **predestinarianism**, insisting that the **Word of God** confronts the sinner and awakens faith, yet always preserves genuine human response. For Brunner, **regeneration** is a divine act that creates new life, but it occurs in the context of personal encounter and decision.

- "Faith is not a human possibility, but a divine gift, the result of the creative Word of God." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Key Works

- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (1952)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Man in Revolt (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Divine Initiative**
   - Regeneration is the work of God alone, not a human achievement.
   - The Holy Spirit creates new life where there was only spiritual death.
   - Human will is incapable of initiating regeneration apart from God’s action.
   - The event of regeneration is mysterious and cannot be reduced to a process.
   - "Regeneration is the miracle of the new creation, wrought by God’s Word and Spirit." (Dogmatics II)

2. **Effectual Calling as Personal Encounter**
   - God’s call is not merely external but confronts the individual personally.
   - The call is effectual when it becomes an existential encounter with Christ.
   - The Word of God is the means by which the call is mediated.
   - This encounter demands a response, but the response is enabled by grace.
   - "The Word of God is not information, but address; it calls and creates response." (Truth as Encounter)

3. **Human Response and Divine Freedom**
   - Brunner affirms the necessity of human response without making it the cause of regeneration.
   - Divine grace enables, but does not coerce, the human will.
   - The relationship is dialogical: God addresses, and the human person answers.
   - There is a real possibility of resistance, but faith is always a gift.
   - "The Yes of faith is possible only because God’s Yes has already been spoken." (The Mediator)

4. **Rejection of Determinism and Synergism**
   - Brunner rejects both strict determinism and synergistic cooperation.
   - Salvation is neither automatic nor a cooperative venture between God and man.
   - The initiative is always with God, but the human person is not a passive object.
   - The mystery of faith lies in the paradox of divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
   - "Grace is not irresistible force, but personal address that seeks a personal answer." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Christocentric Mediation of Regeneration**
   - Christ is the center and mediator of all saving acts, including regeneration.
   - The encounter with Christ in the Word is the means of new birth.
   - The Holy Spirit unites the believer to Christ, effecting regeneration.
   - Regeneration is inseparable from union with Christ and participation in his life.
   - "The new birth is the work of Christ through the Spirit, making us new creatures in Him." (Dogmatics II)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** shaped the development of neo-orthodox thought, especially in its emphasis on the existential encounter between God and humanity. His dialectical approach influenced later discussions on the relationship between divine sovereignty and human response. While his views diverged from both classical Reformed and liberal Protestant positions, Brunner’s insistence on the primacy of the **Word of God** and the necessity of grace remains a significant contribution to twentieth-century theology. His work continues to provoke debate on the nature of faith, freedom, and the transformative power of divine address.
