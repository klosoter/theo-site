# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached **regeneration** and **effectual calling** through the lens of **eschatological revelation** and the self-disclosure of God in history. He emphasized the universal scope of **God’s call** and the dynamic, historical unfolding of **new creation** in Christ, rather than a strictly individualistic or instantaneous event. For Pannenberg, the Spirit’s work in regeneration is inseparable from the corporate and historical realization of **salvation**.

- "The Spirit is the power of the new life, which is imparted to men in their participation in the resurrection of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on the Spirit and salvation)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Revelation as History (with R. Rendtorff, U. Wilckens, T. Rendtorff)
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Participation in Christ’s Resurrection**
    - Regeneration is fundamentally participation in the **resurrected life of Christ**.
    - It is not merely an inward change but a sharing in the eschatological reality inaugurated by Jesus.
    - The Spirit mediates this participation, connecting believers to the risen Lord.
    - Regeneration is thus corporate and historical, not only individual.
    - "Regeneration is the imparting of new life through participation in the resurrection of Jesus." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Effectual Calling as Universal and Historical**
    - God’s call is extended universally, not limited to an elect few.
    - The effectiveness of the call is realized in history as people respond to God’s self-revelation.
    - The Spirit’s work is persuasive rather than irresistible, respecting human freedom.
    - The church is the community where this calling is embodied and proclaimed.
    - "The call of God is addressed to all, and its effectiveness depends on the openness of men to the Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Salvation**
    - Regeneration and calling are oriented toward the **final consummation** of all things.
    - The new life is a foretaste of the eschatological future, breaking into the present.
    - The Spirit’s work is provisional, anticipating the fullness of redemption.
    - Salvation is not complete until the resurrection and renewal of creation.
    - "The new life of the Spirit is the anticipation of the eschatological future." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Revelation as the Ground of Regeneration**
    - God’s self-revelation in history is the basis for regeneration and calling.
    - The resurrection of Jesus is the decisive event that grounds new life.
    - Faith arises in response to the historical revelation of God’s action.
    - Regeneration is inseparable from the knowledge of God revealed in Christ.
    - "The revelation of God in the history of Jesus is the foundation of the new life." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Pneumatology: The Spirit as Agent of New Creation**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who actualizes regeneration and calling.
    - The Spirit’s work is both personal and communal, forming the church as the new humanity.
    - The Spirit mediates the presence of the risen Christ to believers.
    - Regeneration is an ongoing process, not a once-for-all event.
    - "The Spirit is the power of the new creation, making present the life of the risen Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **regeneration** and **effectual calling** challenged traditional Reformed categories by emphasizing the **historical** and **universal** dimensions of salvation. His integration of **eschatology**, **pneumatology**, and revelation has influenced contemporary theology’s understanding of the Spirit’s role in new creation. Pannenberg’s work continues to provoke dialogue on the relationship between individual and corporate aspects of salvation, and the dynamic interplay between history and theology.
