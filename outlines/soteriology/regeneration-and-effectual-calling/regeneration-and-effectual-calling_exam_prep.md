- Core issue: Whether and how the Spirit’s **effectual calling** infallibly brings about **monergistic regeneration**, producing faith and repentance without violating creaturely agency or the integrity of the **means of grace**.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, Jacob Arminius, Francis Turretin, Jonathan Edwards, Herman Bavinck.
- Traditions: Augustinian anti-Pelagian soteriology; Reformed scholastic and Puritan developments; Dutch neo-Calvinism; Remonstrant-Arminian alternatives; Catholic sacramental intuitions as external contrast.
- Debates:
  - Internal: relation of **regeneration** to faith and **union with Christ**; immediate versus mediate regeneration; defining **ordo salutis** relative to historia salutis; Word and Spirit; infant regeneration.

### ESSAY
Regeneration and effectual calling belong to the core of Reformed **ordo salutis**, articulating how salvation accomplished by Christ is applied by the Spirit. By effectual calling I mean the operation of the Spirit by the Word whereby the elect are inwardly summoned out of darkness into fellowship with Christ, the call being invincible in its efficacy and yet sweet in its manner. By regeneration I mean the Spirit’s sovereign renewal of the heart, the bestowal of a new disposition or principle of life that immediately yields repentance and faith and begins a life of sanctification. The two are inseparable in execution, though distinguishable in notion: the call is the divine summons in power; regeneration is the internal renovation through which that summons is heard and embraced. The thesis to defend is the Reformed claim that **monergistic regeneration** through the **effectual calling** of the Spirit infallibly brings about faith, ordinarily through the **means of grace**, consistent with **union with Christ** and the integrity of creaturely agency, and so anchors assurance in divine purpose rather than human self-causation.

The conceptual center is Augustinian. Augustine of Hippo advanced the decisive anti-Pelagian turn that makes effectual calling intelligible. In his mature writings on predestination and grace, Augustine argued that fallen humanity is not merely weakened but bound in sinful loves. The will is free in the sense of choosing what it loves, but since its love is vitiated, it will not turn to God. Hence moral inability requires a prior divine act that liberates the will by granting a new delight. Augustine distinguishes a general call in preaching from the call in which God gives what he commands. Those predestined are called according to purpose, and God’s grace does not merely advise or assist but heals and inclines. He described the operation as God’s working in us to will and to do, which is not compulsion but the infusion of love such that we delight in the good. This is the seed of **effectual calling** and **monergistic regeneration**. He supplies the keystone: grace is not simply external help but an internal gift that changes the heart’s loves, so that the response of faith is real, voluntary, and yet wholly enabled by grace. An examiner will press whether Augustine conflated regeneration and sanctification. The answer is that Augustine spoke of gratia praeveniens and gratia cooperans as two modes of one healing grace, and his concern was not to fix a terminological ordo but to insist that the first positive motion to God is given by God. Later Reformed distinctions sharpen his insight without displacing the core.

John Calvin carries the Augustinian thesis into an exegetical and pastoral frame keyed to Word and Spirit. For Calvin, the external preaching of the gospel is the instrument by which the Spirit unites us to Christ. He distinguishes an outward call that falls on the ears of many and an inward call that the elect alone receive. The Spirit seals the Word, illuminating the mind, bending the will, and writing the law on the heart. Calvin often uses regeneration broadly for the entire process of mortification and vivification, yet he locates the decisive beginning of this life in the secret operation of the Spirit. His method is to coordinate union with Christ and a duplex gratia, justification and sanctification, with the Spirit as the bond. We are united to Christ by faith, but faith is itself the product of the Spirit’s secret work accompanying the Word. An examiner may ask whether this makes union logically posterior to faith or prior. Calvin’s consistent pattern is that the Spirit, through the Word, awakens faith by inward illumination, and that faith is the instrument of our union with Christ viewed from the human side, while the Spirit’s uniting action is the deeper divine cause. Calvin will not split the economy; he insists on the inseparability of Word and Spirit, guarding both **means of grace** and **monergistic regeneration**.

Jacob Arminius reframed the field by denying that this inward work is irresistibly effective. For Arminius, God bestows **prevenient grace** universally in the gospel age, restoring sufficient ability to all for a genuine response, and election is conditional on foreseen faith. Grace is necessary but resistible; the Spirit calls, enlightens, and persuades, but does not infallibly determine the will. Arminius also appealed to divine justice and the sincerity of the universal call, arguing that an effectual call limited to the elect vitiates the well-meant offer. The Remonstrants codified this stance, and the Synod of Dort responded by defining effectual calling as the Spirit’s powerful, sweet, and invincible work that does not treat humans as stocks and blocks but makes the dead alive so that they willingly believe. The issue here is not whether God treats persons as machines. The Reformed position distinguishes physical coercion from moral transformation. The Spirit changes the heart so that it freely embraces Christ. The Arminian construal, while honoring responsibility, reduces the decisive moment to the unrenewed will’s exercise of an abstract power of contrary choice. The Reformed critic notes that such an account collapses grace into equal opportunity and pushes salvation back onto the natural will at the critical juncture, a move Augustine had already exposed as inconsistent with the depth of sin. Scripture speaks of Lydia’s heart being opened to pay attention to Paul, of being born of the Spirit, of the Father drawing so that one comes. The Reformed insist that the language of new birth and divine drawing exceeds persuasion.

Francis Turretin clarifies the scholastic architecture of effectual calling within **federal theology**. Turretin addresses whether calling is general or special, resistible or irresistible, mediated or immediate, moral persuasion or physical operation, and where it falls in the **ordo salutis**. He argues that there is a general call through the gospel to all under the external ministry, and a special call limited to the elect wherein the Spirit works internally by an efficacious physical operation upon the heart. He is careful: physical here means it produces a real change in the subject’s disposition, not that God moves the will by force. The Spirit so disposes the will that the act is free. He defends the instrumentality of the Word, confuting the notion that immediate operations render preaching superfluous. Faith ordinarily comes by hearing. Yet he allows extraordinary cases where God regenerates infants or those mentally incapable without the ordinary means, placing these under the freedom of the Spirit. He locates regeneration as a habitus, a new principle of spiritual life, infused by God. Faith as act follows immediately as the first exercise of this new life, so that regeneration is logically prior to faith but temporally coincident in adults. Effectual calling, in Turretin’s structure, embraces both the external summons and the internal bestowal of the new heart, and it leads into justification by faith and adoption, all grounded in eternal election and the covenant headship of Christ. Turretin also stabilizes a compatibilist account of freedom. The will is determined by its strongest inclination, yet this is not external compulsion; God changes the inclination by renewing the heart. This is the scholastic elaboration of Augustine and Calvin, designed to withstand the Remonstrant charge that Reformed grace destroys liberty.

Jonathan Edwards deepens the psychology and metaphysics of regeneration and freedom in a way that remains decisive. In Freedom of the Will and Religious Affections, Edwards distinguishes natural from moral inability. Natural inability is the lack of a faculty or opportunity; moral inability is the lack of a right disposition. Fallen persons are morally unable to believe because they love darkness, not because they lack the natural powers of understanding and willing. Regeneration is the Spirit’s giving of a new sense of the heart, a change in the foundational preference structure, by which the excellency of Christ becomes sweet and therefore chosen. The will is not a self-determining faculty; it is an expression of the strongest motive as perceived and loved by the heart. Hence the Spirit’s efficacious grace changes the motives by changing the heart’s aesthetic and moral perception. Edwards insists this is not coercion but the only account that secures responsibility. One is responsible when he acts according to what he is; regeneration changes who he is. Thus effectual calling is the Spirit’s communication of a new principle, immediately producing a true faith and holy affections that endure. Edwards helps answer two examiners’ questions. First, does monergism reduce preaching to irrelevance. No. The Spirit uses the truth as instrument. The new sense sees the beauty of Christ only through the light of the gospel. Second, does monergism undermine assurance. No. Because the Spirit’s implantation of a new principle manifests in enduring fruit, the believer has rational grounds for assurance in the promises and experiential grounds in transformed affections, while resting not on introspection but on Christ apprehended by this God-given faith.

Herman Bavinck retrieves the Reformed synthesis for the modern age, integrating dogmatics with an organic view of revelation and the church. He insists that grace restores nature, not by replacing it but by re-creating it. Word and Spirit are inseparable. The Spirit never bypasses the Word as norm and instrument in the church, though he is free in extraordinary situations. Bavinck resists a narrowed individualism in the **ordo salutis** by embedding effectual calling and regeneration within **union with Christ** and the **covenant of grace**. He affirms that regeneration is a new principle of life and that faith is its first act. Yet he refuses to drive a wedge between the Spirit’s work and the institutional church. Preaching is the appointed instrumentality by which God calls, enlightens, and regenerates. Here Bavinck engages the internal Dutch debate sparked by Abraham Kuyper’s strong doctrine of immediate regeneration. Kuyper stressed the Spirit’s immediate act in implanting life, especially in covenant infants, and sometimes spoke as if the Word were addressed only to those already regenerate. Bavinck corrects this tendency by reaffirming that the gospel is the seed through which new birth occurs, that public means are honored instruments, and that the Spirit’s secret work cannot be abstracted from the concrete ministry of the church. For Bavinck the point is not to deny infant regeneration in extraordinary cases, but to safeguard the ordinary economy in which calling and regeneration are tethered to the preached Word. This is not a concession to synergism but a confession of the Holy Spirit’s own ordained order.

With these figures in place, we can map the internal Reformed debates. First, the relation of regeneration to faith and **union with Christ**. Westminster describes effectual calling as God’s work of convincing, enlightening, renewing, and drawing to Christ, whereby he freely offers Christ in the gospel and enables the elect to embrace him. Faith is thus the fruit of the call. Later Reformed theologians often place regeneration as logically prior to faith, with union by the Spirit as the deeper bond that faith instrumentally receives. A contemporary internal debate asks whether union with Christ is prior to faith or through faith. The better resolution is to say that the Spirit unites us to Christ by effectual calling, giving the capacity for faith, and that faith is the God-given instrument by which we consciously receive Christ and his benefits. There is no extrinsic union without faith, and no self-generated faith without union’s vivifying bond. Second, immediate versus mediate regeneration. The mainstream affirms the Word as the ordinary instrument by which the Spirit regenerates. To guard this, we should deny that regeneration is ordinarily independent of the Word. Yet we must allow that the Spirit is free to regenerate infants and those beyond ordinary means immediately. This preserves **means of grace** without absolutizing them. Third, the scope of effectual calling relative to the visible church. Effectual calling narrows to the elect, but the external call is sincere to all. We avoid hyper-Calvinist lapses by preaching Christ indiscriminately, confident that God has many in the city. Fourth, the relation of **ordo salutis** to historia salutis. The application of redemption must be coordinated with Christ’s once-for-all work and the **divine simplicity** of God’s saving will. There is one simple saving act of God unfolded to us as calling, regeneration, justification, and adoption, without temporal gaps in the adult convert even as we maintain logical order.

External debates sharpen the doctrine’s edges. Against Arminian **prevenient grace** and resistible calling, the Reformed appeal to the metaphysic of the will and the scriptural idiom of new birth, heart opening, and life from the dead. The external call is universal where the gospel is preached, but the inward call is particular and efficacious. The sincerity of the offer lies in the truthfulness of God’s promise and command, not in a fiction of equal ability. Against Roman Catholic baptismal regeneration, the Reformed insist that the sacrament is a real means of grace to believers and their children, yet it does not confer life ex opere operato. The Spirit is sovereign, and the sign is inseparable from the Word of promise and the faith that receives it. This does not deny that God sometimes regenerates early, even in infancy; it denies that the sacrament in itself regenerates. Lutheran theology is monergistic about regeneration but insists grace is resistible and given universally in Word and sacrament. Here we demur at the point of resistibility and perseverance, while affirming the shared commitment to the Spirit’s sovereign agency in new birth. Eastern synergistic models typically construe grace as cooperative healing that does not finally determine the will. The Reformed reply that ascriptions of cooperative causality in the inception of faith are inconsistent with the depth of sin’s bondage and the radical metaphors of Scripture. Only a regenerative act that gives a new heart can underwrite faith.

Contemporary challenges invite renewed precision. Revivalist decisionalism often reduces conversion to human choice under pressure, severing it from **monergistic regeneration** and **means of grace** beyond the altar call. The Reformed correct this by centering the weekly ministry of Word and sacrament as the arena of calling and by teaching that the Spirit’s efficacious work creates true repentance and faith without manipulation. Charismatic and Pentecostal currents sometimes treat the new birth as a felt power encounter or mark it off from later Spirit-baptism. The Reformed should affirm that regeneration may be experientially vivid, yet insist that its essence is the new heart evidenced in faith and love, and that the gift of the Spirit is coextensive with union with Christ. Neuroscientific accounts of freedom are invoked to claim that determinative causes undermine responsibility. The Reformed can grant that human choices arise from complex structures without conceding that responsibility demands indeterminism. Responsibility requires that agents act from their character and reasons, not that they act uncaused. Effectual calling renews the character from which action flows. Global mission contexts raise the question of those with minimal gospel access. The Reformed answer holds that God saves by uniting to Christ through faith in the gospel. He is not bound to ordinary means in the exceptional case, but we are bound to proclaim. This underscores the urgency of missions and prayer for the Spirit’s effectual call. Pastoral assurance is another live issue. If regeneration is hidden, how can one know? The tradition responds that assurance rests primarily on the promises of God and the sufficiency of Christ, and secondarily on the Spirit’s witness in us and the observable fruit of new life. Edwards is helpful here, as is the realistic counsel of the Puritans, who anchor assurance in Christ while cultivating the evidences of grace.

Objections deserve crisp replies. Does saying regeneration precedes faith render faith unnecessary. No. Prior in order does not mean temporally separate; it means that the Spirit gives a new principle that immediately acts in faith. The first breath of the newborn is not optional because breathing distinguishes life. Does effectual calling compromise the universal and sincere gospel offer. No. The offer is the truthful command and promise of God to all; the lack lies in sinners, not in the sincerity of God. God has ordained both the ends and the means, including free offers and earnest calls. Does affirming the Word as instrument undermine the sovereignty of the Spirit. No. Sovereignty includes ordaining means. The Spirit who brooded over the waters broods over the preached gospel. Does holding to extraordinary infant regeneration generate presumption. No. It calls for humble trust in the covenant God and faithful use of the means, while leaving the timing of regeneration to God’s wisdom. Does **divine simplicity** make a mess of the ordo by collapsing acts. No. Simplicity means God’s single act of love secures all benefits in Christ; we distinguish aspects of its application as they come to us in time without partitioning God.

This doctrine belongs within a broader systematic frame. Effectual calling is the applied edge of election in the pactum salutis, enacted in history through the **covenant of grace**. It is anchored in Christ’s mediatorial work, since the call is not an abstract power but the heralding of Christ himself. It is a pneumatological doctrine, since the Spirit is the efficient cause. It is ecclesiological, since the church is the public arena of the call through preaching and sacrament. It is anthropological, since it names the renovation of the will and affections. It is ethical, since it issues in new obedience, not as ground but as fruit. And it is eschatological, since regeneration is the down payment of the new creation. All these threads show why the Reformed insist that the Spirit’s inward, effectual call that regenerates is not an optional nuance but the hinge between the cross accomplished and salvation received.

Therefore I defend the classic Reformed position. The Spirit, according to the eternal purpose of the Father and for the sake of the Son, effectually calls the elect through the gospel. In that call he regenerates, granting a new heart and renewing the will, so that the person freely and infallibly comes to Christ. Faith and repentance are not preconditions but immediate fruits. The Word is the ordinary instrumentality, because the Spirit binds himself to Christ’s own voice in Scripture and preaching. This effectual call unites to Christ, in whom follow justification, adoption, and sanctification, all of which are applied in a way befitting **federal theology** and the unity of the **ordo salutis** with the historia salutis. This excludes synergism at the point of inception, honors the churchly means God has ordained, answers contemporary concerns about freedom and experience, and secures hope for preaching, prayer, and missions. We do not explain how God renews the heart in its metaphysical mechanics. We confess that he does so according to Scripture, and we guard the glory of divine grace while protecting the reality of human responsibility. The gospel call, therefore, is to be announced indiscriminately. The Spirit will make it effectual in the elect, and when he does, the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and live.
