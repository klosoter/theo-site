# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas grounds **regeneration** and **effectual calling** in the primacy of **divine grace**, teaching that the transformation of the soul is initiated and sustained by God alone. He insists that **justification** involves the **infusion of grace**, which precedes and enables any human cooperation, while also affirming the real, though grace-enabled, response of the human will.

- "God alone can move the will inwardly." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 10)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 109–114 (On Grace and Justification)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (On Salvation)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book II, Distinctions 26–28
- De Veritate, Question 22 (On Grace)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as the Infusion of Grace**
   - Regeneration is the supernatural transformation of the soul by **sanctifying grace**.
   - This infusion is necessary because fallen human nature cannot turn to God unaided.
   - The process involves both the remission of sins and the renewal of the will.
   - Regeneration marks the beginning of the new life in Christ, distinct from mere external reform.
   "The justification of the ungodly is effected by the infusion of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 3)

2. **Effectual Calling as Divine Initiative**
   - God’s call is **efficacious** because it includes the grace that enables a positive human response.
   - The external proclamation of the Gospel is joined with an internal movement by the Holy Spirit.
   - The effectual call is not merely an invitation but an act that brings about what it commands.
   - Human assent is real but is itself enabled and moved by God’s prior action.
   "God by moving the will inwardly, infallibly brings about the effect of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 112, a. 3)

3. **Necessity of Prevenient Grace**
   - No one can begin to will or do good without **prevenient grace**.
   - This grace precedes all human effort and prepares the soul for justification.
   - Prevenient grace heals the will and enlightens the intellect, making faith possible.
   - It is entirely unmerited and rooted in God’s mercy.
   "It is necessary that man be prevented by God with grace, that he may be healed." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 6)

4. **Synergism: Cooperation of Human Will**
   - While grace is primary, the human will is not passive but cooperates after being moved by God.
   - The will, once healed and enabled, freely assents to God’s call.
   - This cooperation is itself a fruit of grace, not autonomous human effort.
   - Aquinas rejects both Pelagianism (human autonomy) and strict monergism (human passivity).
   "God so moves the will that man does what God wills, yet man also acts." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 111, a. 2)

5. **Justification as a Process**
   - Justification includes both the initial act of regeneration and the ongoing growth in grace.
   - The process involves the forgiveness of sins, the infusion of virtues, and the increase of **sanctifying grace**.
   - Faith, hope, and charity are all infused at regeneration, enabling the believer to live righteously.
   - The process is completed in final perseverance, also a gift of grace.
   "Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the inner man." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **grace**, **regeneration**, and **effectual calling** profoundly shaped medieval and later Catholic theology, especially influencing the Council of Trent’s doctrine of justification. His nuanced account of the relationship between divine initiative and human cooperation became a reference point for debates with both Protestant and later Catholic theologians. While his synergistic model differs from later Reformed formulations, his insistence on the necessity and primacy of grace remains a foundational contribution to the doctrine of salvation.
