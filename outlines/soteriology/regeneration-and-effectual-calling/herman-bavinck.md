# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**. He emphasized the monergistic work of the **Holy Spirit** in imparting new life, distinguishing between the external call of the gospel and the internal, efficacious call that results in true conversion. For Bavinck, regeneration is the foundational act of God that enables faith and repentance.

- "Regeneration is the re-creation of the human being by the Holy Spirit, a work in which the human is strictly passive." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Act of God**
   - Regeneration is solely the work of **God’s grace**, not a cooperative process.
   - The human will is passive in regeneration; it is God who initiates new spiritual life.
   - This act is instantaneous and precedes any human response.
   - Regeneration is the root from which faith and conversion spring.
   - "Regeneration is not a gradual process but a creative act of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Distinction Between External and Internal Calling**
   - The **external call** is the universal proclamation of the gospel to all people.
   - The **internal call** is the efficacious work of the Spirit in the elect.
   - Only the internal call results in regeneration and saving faith.
   - The distinction preserves the sovereignty of God in salvation.
   - "The external call comes to many, but the internal call is given only to the elect." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

3. **Monergism in Salvation**
   - Salvation is entirely the work of God from beginning to end.
   - Human beings contribute nothing to their regeneration.
   - The Holy Spirit alone effectually applies redemption to the elect.
   - This excludes all forms of synergism or cooperation in the initial act of salvation.
   - "In regeneration, God works alone and man is the object, not the subject, of the action." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Regeneration Precedes Faith**
   - Faith is the result, not the cause, of regeneration.
   - The new birth enables the sinner to respond to the gospel in faith and repentance.
   - This order safeguards the priority of divine grace.
   - Bavinck rejects any view that makes faith a precondition for regeneration.
   - "Regeneration is the principle of the new life, and faith is its first activity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Organic and Covenantal Dimensions**
   - Regeneration is not isolated but occurs within the context of the **covenant community**.
   - The Spirit often works through the means of grace, especially the Word.
   - There is an organic connection between the individual and the church in the application of salvation.
   - Bavinck affirms both the personal and communal aspects of regeneration.
   - "The work of regeneration is organically connected to the covenant and the church." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed theology, emphasizing the primacy of divine initiative and the necessity of the Spirit’s work. His careful distinctions between external and internal calling continue to inform debates on the nature of **conversion** and the application of salvation. Bavinck’s legacy endures in both academic and ecclesial contexts, reinforcing the centrality of grace in the ordo salutis.
