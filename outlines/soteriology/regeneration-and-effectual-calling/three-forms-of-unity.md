# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**. They emphasize the sovereign initiative of **God’s grace** in the **new birth**, the necessity of the **Holy Spirit’s work**, and the certainty that those whom God calls are truly brought to faith and repentance.

- "Regeneration is a supernatural work, which God works in us without our aid." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 12)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 22–24
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 8, 20, 21, 65
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism*
- Cornelis P. Venema, *But for the Grace of God: An Exposition of the Canons of Dort*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as the Sovereign Work of God**
    - Regeneration is not a human achievement but the result of God’s **sovereign grace**.
    - The human will is **incapable** of turning to God apart from this divine work.
    - The Holy Spirit alone renews the heart, enabling faith and repentance.
    - This work is described as a **new creation** or being "born again."
    - "Regeneration is a supernatural work, which God works in us without our aid." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 12)

2. **Effectual Calling Distinguished from External Call**
    - The gospel call goes out to many, but only the elect receive it effectually.
    - The **external call** is the proclamation of the Word; the **internal call** is the Spirit’s application.
    - Effectual calling results in actual conversion and faith in Christ.
    - The distinction upholds both the **universality of the offer** and the particularity of grace.
    - "But that others who are called by the gospel obey the call and are converted is ascribed...to God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 10)

3. **Total Depravity and Inability**
    - Humanity is so corrupted by sin that it cannot initiate or contribute to regeneration.
    - The **will** is in bondage and must be liberated by God’s power.
    - Faith itself is a gift, not a product of human effort.
    - This underscores the necessity of **divine intervention** for salvation.
    - "Without the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit, they are neither able nor willing to return to God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 3)

4. **Means of Grace in Regeneration**
    - God ordinarily uses the **preaching of the Word** as the means for calling and regenerating.
    - The sacraments serve to confirm faith but do not regenerate apart from the Spirit’s work.
    - The Spirit works **in and through** these means, not independently of them.
    - This maintains the importance of the church’s ministry in God’s saving work.
    - "God...uses the preaching of the gospel to begin and accomplish his work of grace." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 17)

5. **Irresistibility and Efficacy of Grace**
    - Those whom God effectually calls cannot finally resist His grace.
    - Regeneration unfailingly produces faith and a new life.
    - The efficacy of grace is rooted in God’s eternal decree and Christ’s atonement.
    - Assurance flows from the certainty of God’s saving purpose.
    - "God...infuses new qualities into the will, making the dead will alive, the evil one good." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 11)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the doctrine of **regeneration and effectual calling** for Reformed churches worldwide, providing a confessional standard that emphasizes the necessity and efficacy of sovereign grace. Their careful distinctions between the external and internal call, and their insistence on the Spirit’s work through ordained means, have influenced subsequent Reformed theology and catechesis. These documents remain foundational for understanding the Reformed view of salvation and continue to serve as a bulwark against both Pelagianism and hyper-Calvinism.
