# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **regeneration** and **effectual calling** within a robustly Reformed framework, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of God in the application of **redemption**. He integrates these doctrines into his broader **tri-perspectival** method, highlighting the interplay of divine authority, personal experience, and situational context. Frame insists that **regeneration** is a monergistic act of the Holy Spirit, inseparable from the effective call that brings sinners to faith in Christ.

- "Regeneration is the work of God’s Spirit, giving new life to those who were dead in sin, and it is this new life that enables us to respond to God’s call in faith." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign, Monergistic Act**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of the **Holy Spirit** without human cooperation.
    - It precedes and enables faith, making spiritual life possible for the sinner.
    - The spiritually dead are made alive by God’s initiative, not by their own will.
    - This act is instantaneous and effectual, guaranteeing a changed heart.
    - "Regeneration is not a cooperative effort between God and man, but a sovereign act of God alone." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Effectual Calling as Inseparable from Regeneration**
    - Effectual calling is the outward and inward summons to faith, always successful in the elect.
    - The internal call is made effectual by the Spirit’s regenerative work.
    - Frame sees no temporal gap between effectual calling and regeneration; they are two aspects of the same divine action.
    - The Word and Spirit work together to bring about the new birth.
    - "Effectual calling and regeneration are two sides of the same coin: God calls, and in that call, he gives life." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Faith as the Immediate Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Saving faith is not possible apart from the new birth.
    - Regeneration produces the capacity and inclination to trust in Christ.
    - Faith is thus the first conscious act of the regenerate person.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that the elect will respond to the gospel.
    - "Faith is the first evidence of regeneration, not its cause." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Tri-Perspectival Integration of Doctrine**
    - Frame interprets regeneration and calling through his **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives.
    - The normative perspective grounds these doctrines in Scripture’s authority.
    - The situational perspective considers the context and effects in the believer’s life.
    - The existential perspective emphasizes personal transformation and assurance.
    - "We must understand regeneration as God’s authoritative act, its effects in our lives, and its reality in our experience." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Union with Christ as the Context for Application of Redemption**
    - All benefits of salvation, including regeneration and calling, flow from **union with Christ**.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of new life.
    - Regeneration is not an isolated event but part of the broader application of redemption.
    - Effectual calling brings the elect into this vital union.
    - "Union with Christ is the fountain from which all saving blessings, including regeneration, flow." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** has reinforced the Reformed emphasis on God’s sovereignty in salvation while integrating these doctrines into a broader, practical theological vision. His **tri-perspectivalism** has influenced contemporary discussions on the application of redemption, encouraging theologians and pastors to consider doctrinal, experiential, and contextual dimensions. Frame’s clarity and faithfulness to confessional Reformed theology have made his works standard resources in evangelical and Reformed circles.
