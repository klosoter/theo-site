# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **regeneration** and **effectual calling** through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the human encounter with the **"New Being"** in Christ rather than traditional Reformed categories. For Tillich, **salvation** is the experience of being grasped by **God's grace**, which overcomes estrangement and brings about a new state of existence, rather than a discrete event or inward change caused by an external call.

- "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness... Sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying: 'You are accepted.'" (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Participation in the New Being**
   - Regeneration is not a supernatural infusion but an existential transformation through encounter with Christ.
   - The "New Being" represents the breaking-in of divine reality, overcoming existential estrangement.
   - This transformation is ongoing, not a single moment of change.
   - The focus is on the restoration of true humanity rather than a forensic or mystical change.
   - "The New Being appears as the power of reunion, conquering the estrangement of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Effectual Calling as Existential Encounter**
   - Effectual calling is the existential experience of being addressed by the divine.
   - It is not limited to an external proclamation but is an inner event of ultimate concern.
   - The call is universal, but its effect depends on the individual's openness to the ground of being.
   - The divine call is mediated through symbols, preaching, and personal crisis.
   - "The call of God is the call to accept acceptance in spite of being unacceptable." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

3. **Sin as Estrangement, Not Guilt Alone**
   - Sin is primarily understood as estrangement from the ground of being, not merely legal guilt.
   - Regeneration is the overcoming of this estrangement through reunion with God.
   - The human predicament is existential separation, healed by participation in the New Being.
   - This view shifts the focus from legal categories to ontological healing.
   - "Sin is separation. Grace is reunion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Faith as Ultimate Concern**
   - Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned, not mere intellectual assent or emotional trust.
   - Regeneration and calling are realized in the act of faith, which is a total existential response.
   - Faith is both a gift and a task, rooted in the depth of the person.
   - The experience of being grasped by ultimate concern is itself the effectual call.
   - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of man's ultimate concern." (Dynamics of Faith)

5. **Grace as Acceptance and Power**
   - Grace is the power that accepts and transforms the unacceptable.
   - It is not a substance or a transaction but the divine act of acceptance.
   - Regeneration is the experience of being accepted by God, which empowers new existence.
   - Grace is always prior, overcoming human resistance and anxiety.
   - "You are accepted. You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you..." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **regeneration** and **effectual calling** challenged traditional Protestant and Reformed categories by emphasizing existential transformation over forensic or mystical change. His focus on **estrangement**, **acceptance**, and the **New Being** influenced later theological discussions on salvation, especially in dialogue with modern philosophy and psychology. While his approach was often criticized for lacking biblical specificity, Tillich remains a pivotal figure in 20th-century theology, shaping conversations about the nature of faith, grace, and human transformation.
