# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **regeneration** and **effectual calling** emphasizes the centrality of **union with Christ** and the application of **redemption** by the Holy Spirit. He insists that **regeneration** is inseparable from the broader context of **soteriology**, particularly as it relates to the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection life. Gaffin’s approach is marked by a strong biblical-theological method, integrating **Pauline theology** with classic Reformed categories.

- "The application of redemption in the New Testament is fundamentally a matter of union with the resurrected Christ by the Spirit." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Order of Salvation and the Theology of Paul" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is inseparable from union with Christ**
   - Regeneration is not an isolated event but occurs within the context of union with the resurrected Christ.
   - The believer’s new life is grounded in participation in Christ’s resurrection.
   - The Spirit’s work is to unite the believer to Christ, effecting both regeneration and all other benefits of redemption.
   - This union is both forensic and transformative, encompassing justification and sanctification.
   - "The controlling soteriological category in Paul is union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Effectual calling as the Spirit’s sovereign initiative**
   - Effectual calling is the Spirit’s efficacious summons that brings the elect into fellowship with Christ.
   - It is distinguished from the general call of the gospel, being inward, powerful, and unfailing.
   - The Spirit uses the external Word to accomplish this internal work.
   - Effectual calling results in the actual possession of salvation’s benefits, beginning with regeneration.
   - "Calling is not merely an invitation but a divine act that brings about what it commands." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Resurrection as the pattern and power of new life**
   - The believer’s regeneration is patterned after and empowered by Christ’s resurrection.
   - The eschatological reality of the resurrection is already operative in the present through the Spirit.
   - Regeneration is thus an eschatological event, inaugurating new creation in the believer.
   - This perspective reframes traditional ordo salutis discussions around Christ’s redemptive-historical work.
   - "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event for understanding the application of redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Biblical-theological integration of ordo salutis and historia salutis**
   - Gaffin insists that the application of salvation (ordo salutis) must be understood in light of the accomplishment of salvation (historia salutis).
   - Regeneration and effectual calling are not abstracted from Christ’s redemptive work but are its direct application.
   - The Spirit’s work in the believer is inseparable from the once-for-all work of Christ.
   - This approach guards against individualistic or purely existential interpretations of regeneration.
   - "The ordo salutis is subordinate to and determined by the historia salutis." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Reformed confessional fidelity with biblical-theological development**
   - Gaffin affirms the classic Reformed understanding of regeneration and effectual calling as articulated in the Westminster Standards.
   - He seeks to deepen this tradition by bringing it into conversation with contemporary biblical theology.
   - His work highlights the coherence between confessional categories and the unfolding of redemptive history.
   - He maintains the necessity of both doctrinal precision and exegetical rigor.
   - "The Westminster Standards are best understood in light of the redemptive-historical structure of Scripture." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of **union with Christ**, regeneration, and the application of redemption. His biblical-theological approach has encouraged a more integrated reading of **Pauline soteriology** and the Reformed tradition. By emphasizing the inseparability of **regeneration** from Christ’s resurrection and the Spirit’s work, he has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. Gaffin’s legacy endures in the ongoing renewal of Reformed soteriology and its engagement with Scripture.
