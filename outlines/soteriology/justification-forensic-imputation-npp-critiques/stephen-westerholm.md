# Stephen Westerholm (1949–)

Stephen Westerholm is a leading Pauline scholar who robustly defends the **forensic** understanding of **justification** and the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, engaging critically with the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**. He maintains that Paul’s doctrine of justification is best interpreted within the framework of **Reformation theology**, emphasizing a legal declaration of righteousness apart from works of the law.

- "Paul’s doctrine of justification is not about how people become good, but about how they are acquitted before God." ("Justification Reconsidered")

## Key Works

- "Perspectives Old and New on Paul: The 'Lutheran' Paul and His Critics"
- "Justification Reconsidered: Rethinking a Pauline Theme"
- "Israel’s Law and the Church’s Faith: Paul and His Recent Interpreters"
- "Understanding Paul: The Early Christian Worldview of the Letter to the Romans"
- "The New Perspective on Paul" (in various essays and edited volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is Forensic**
    - Justification in Paul refers to a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - The term is rooted in the law court metaphor, where God declares sinners righteous.
    - This declaration is distinct from sanctification or ethical renewal.
    - The Reformation reading rightly emphasizes the external, judicial character of justification.
    "For Paul, justification is a verdict, not a process." ("Justification Reconsidered")

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Righteousness is credited to believers on the basis of Christ’s obedience.
    - Paul’s language of “reckoning” or “counting” (logizomai) supports the concept of imputation.
    - The believer’s status before God is grounded in Christ’s work, not their own.
    - Imputation safeguards the gratuity of salvation and the sufficiency of Christ.
    "Paul’s doctrine of justification entails that the righteousness by which believers stand acquitted is not their own." ("Perspectives Old and New on Paul")

3. **Critique of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
    - The NPP, especially as articulated by Sanders, Dunn, and Wright, redefines justification as ecclesiological boundary-marking.
    - Westerholm contends that Paul’s polemic is not merely about Jewish exclusivism, but about the means of attaining righteousness before God.
    - He argues that the NPP underestimates the seriousness of sin and the need for divine grace.
    - The traditional reading better accounts for Paul’s emphasis on faith apart from works.
    "The new perspective has not shown that Paul’s doctrine of justification is about who belongs to the people of God rather than how sinners find favor with God." ("Justification Reconsidered")

4. **Faith Alone as the Instrument of Justification**
    - Faith is the sole means by which justification is received, excluding works of the law.
    - Paul’s contrast between faith and works is soteriological, not merely sociological.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, whose righteousness is then imputed.
    - This principle is central to Paul’s argument in Romans and Galatians.
    "Paul’s insistence on faith apart from works is not about ethnic markers, but about the way sinners are justified." ("Perspectives Old and New on Paul")

5. **Continuity with Reformation Exegesis**
    - Westerholm affirms the essential correctness of the Lutheran and Reformed readings of Paul.
    - He maintains that the Reformers rightly grasped the Pauline distinction between law and gospel.
    - The Reformation’s focus on justification by faith alone remains exegetically and theologically sound.
    - He sees the NPP as a corrective to some caricatures but not to the core Reformation insight.
    "The Reformation understanding of justification captures the heart of Paul’s gospel." ("Justification Reconsidered")

## Legacy and Impact

Stephen Westerholm’s scholarship has significantly shaped contemporary debates on **justification**, especially in response to the **New Perspective on Paul**. His careful exegesis and defense of the **forensic** and **imputational** aspects of justification have reinforced the legitimacy of the Reformation tradition in Pauline studies. Westerholm’s work continues to serve as a bridge between historical theology and modern biblical scholarship, ensuring that classic doctrinal formulations remain central in current discussions.
