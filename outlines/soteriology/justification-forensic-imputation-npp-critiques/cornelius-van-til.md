# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til upheld the **Reformed doctrine of justification** as a **forensic act** grounded in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, sharply distinguishing it from any infusion of righteousness or human merit. He critiqued modern reinterpretations, such as the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, for undermining the biblical and confessional understanding of **justification by faith alone**. Van Til insisted that the doctrine must be understood within the context of a consistently **presuppositional** and **covenantal** theology.

- "Justification is a judicial act of God whereby he declares sinners righteous on the basis of Christ’s righteousness imputed to them and received by faith alone." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic, not transformative**
   - Justification is a legal declaration by God, not a process of moral transformation.
   - The sinner is declared righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s work.
   - This declaration is distinct from sanctification, which involves inward renewal.
   - Forensic justification safeguards the objective ground of salvation.
   - "Justification is not a process but a once-for-all judicial act." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness is essential**
   - The righteousness of Christ is credited to the believer, not infused.
   - Imputation maintains the distinction between Christ’s merit and human works.
   - Faith is the sole instrument by which this righteousness is received.
   - Any denial of imputation undermines the gospel’s sufficiency.
   - "It is only by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness that the sinner can stand before God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Critique of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
   - The NPP redefines justification in terms of covenant membership rather than legal status.
   - Van Til saw this as a departure from the Reformation’s biblical insights.
   - He warned that NPP tendencies blur the line between justification and sanctification.
   - Such reinterpretations threaten the doctrine of **sola fide**.
   - "To confuse justification with covenantal faithfulness is to return to Rome’s error." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Presuppositional defense of Reformed soteriology**
   - All doctrines, including justification, must be defended from a Reformed presuppositional standpoint.
   - Human reason is fallen and cannot autonomously judge God’s revelation.
   - The antithesis between belief and unbelief extends to soteriological doctrines.
   - Apologetic method must uphold the uniqueness of **Reformed orthodoxy**.
   - "We must presuppose the truth of the Reformed faith in every area, including justification." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Covenantal context of justification**
   - Justification is situated within the broader framework of God’s covenant dealings.
   - The covenant of grace provides the context for understanding imputation and faith.
   - The unity of redemptive history underscores the continuity of justification by faith.
   - Any doctrine of justification must be integrated with covenant theology.
   - "The doctrine of justification cannot be separated from the covenantal structure of Scripture." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **forensic justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists. His presuppositional approach provided a distinctive framework for engaging modern challenges, including the NPP and other revisionist trends. By insisting on the covenantal and confessional boundaries of justification, Van Til reinforced the centrality of **sola fide** in Reformed theology. His influence endures in both academic and ecclesiastical contexts, especially among those committed to confessional orthodoxy.
