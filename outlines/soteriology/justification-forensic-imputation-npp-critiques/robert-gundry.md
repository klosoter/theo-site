# Robert Gundry (1932– )

Robert Gundry is a New Testament scholar whose work on **justification** challenges traditional **forensic** and **imputation** models, particularly as articulated in classic **Reformed theology**. He is known for engaging with and, in some respects, anticipating the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, questioning whether Paul's doctrine of justification is best understood as a legal declaration or as participation in Christ. Gundry’s exegesis often emphasizes the **union with Christ** motif and critiques the standard Reformed reading of **imputed righteousness**.

- "Imputation of Christ’s righteousness to the believer is not a Pauline doctrine." (Justification: The New Perspective on Paul, 1982)

## Key Works

- "The Old Is Better: New Testament Essays in Support of Traditional Interpretations" (1982)
- "Paul and the Law: A Contextual Approach" (Journal articles, various)
- "Justification: The New Perspective on Paul" (1982, Christianity Today)
- "Sōma in Biblical Theology" (1976)
- "A Survey of the New Testament" (multiple editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is not strictly forensic**
   - Argues that Paul's language of justification is not limited to a legal declaration.
   - Emphasizes relational and participatory aspects over courtroom imagery.
   - Sees justification as involving transformation, not just status change.
   - Challenges the dichotomy between **forensic** and **participatory** models.
   - "Paul’s doctrine of justification is not simply a matter of legal standing before God." (Justification: The New Perspective on Paul)

2. **Imputation of righteousness is not Pauline**
   - Rejects the classic Reformed idea that Christ’s righteousness is credited to believers.
   - Suggests that Paul speaks more of union with Christ than of imputation.
   - Argues that righteousness is not a transferable substance or legal fiction.
   - Sees justification as God’s declaration based on incorporation into Christ.
   - "Paul does not teach the imputation of Christ’s active obedience." (The Old Is Better)

3. **Union with Christ is central**
   - Stresses that believers are justified because they are united to Christ.
   - Union, not imputation, is the primary Pauline category for salvation.
   - Participation in Christ’s death and resurrection is the basis for justification.
   - This union is both mystical and ethical, affecting the believer’s life.
   - "Justification comes by being in Christ, not by having his righteousness transferred." (Justification: The New Perspective on Paul)

4. **Critique of traditional Reformed readings**
   - Questions the exegetical basis for forensic and imputed models.
   - Argues that Reformed theology reads later categories into Paul.
   - Suggests that justification in Paul is more dynamic and relational.
   - Engages critically with confessional Protestant traditions.
   - "The Reformation’s doctrine of imputation is not found in Paul’s letters." (The Old Is Better)

5. **Engagement with the New Perspective on Paul**
   - Affirms some NPP critiques of traditional Protestant readings.
   - Recognizes the importance of **covenantal nomism** in Second Temple Judaism.
   - Sees justification as boundary-marking and ecclesiological as well as soteriological.
   - Maintains some distinctions from NPP by emphasizing union over covenant.
   - "The New Perspective rightly challenges the individualistic and legalistic readings of Paul." (Justification: The New Perspective on Paul)

## Legacy and Impact

Gundry’s work has significantly influenced debates on **justification**, especially among evangelicals reconsidering the **forensic** and **imputation** categories. His critiques have contributed to the broader acceptance and discussion of the **New Perspective on Paul** within academic and church contexts. While controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, Gundry’s scholarship has encouraged a more nuanced reading of Paul and a renewed focus on **union with Christ** as central to Pauline soteriology. His legacy is evident in ongoing discussions about the nature of justification and the boundaries of evangelical theology.
