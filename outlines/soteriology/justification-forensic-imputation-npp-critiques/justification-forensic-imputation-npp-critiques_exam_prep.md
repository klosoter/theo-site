### TITLE
Forensic Righteousness under Covenant Judgment: Defending Imputation against New Perspective Revisions

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: whether justification is a **forensic** verdict grounded in **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness to the ungodly through **faith alone**, or a declaration of covenant membership apart from imputed righteousness.
- Decisive figures: Martin Luther, John Calvin, Robert Bellarmine, Francis Turretin, E. P. Sanders, N. T. Wright.
- Relevant traditions: Reformation Lutheran and Reformed, Tridentine Roman Catholic, Reformed scholastic **federal theology**, Second Temple Judaism scholarship within Pauline studies.
- Debates:
  - Internal: **union with Christ** and the order of salvation, the imputation of Christ’s **active obedience**, assurance and final judgment according to works.
  - External: Tridentine infused righteousness and faith formed by love, Socinian denial of imputation.
  - Contemporary: New Perspective on Paul and its emphasis on **covenantal nomism**, Federal Vision claims of final justification through covenantal faithfulness, ecumenical proposals.
- Position: Justification is a once-for-all **forensic** act in which God, by virtue of Christ’s **active and passive obedience**, imputes righteousness to the ungodly, received through **faith alone** as instrument, with good works as necessary fruit but never the ground of any present or future verdict; New Perspective reductions of justification to covenant identity misread Paul and weaken the gospel’s juridical center.

### ESSAY
Justification names God’s verdict in the courtroom of the last day brought forward into the present. It is **forensic**, not transformative in its essence. God declares the ungodly righteous on the basis of the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, received through **faith alone**, within the saving bond of **union with Christ** wrought by the Spirit. The verdict rests on Christ’s **active obedience** fulfilling the law’s positive demands and his **passive obedience** bearing the curse of the law. This doctrine is the nerve center of the Reformation and a perennial flashpoint because it touches divine justice, the meaning of grace, the role of the church, and the stakes of final judgment. Two modern pressures drive the present debate. On one side stands the Tridentine commitment to justification as inherent renewal and faith formed by love. On the other side stands the New Perspective’s recasting of justification as God’s declaration of covenant membership apart from the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness. The question before us is whether Paul’s gospel is a law-court verdict for sinners that answers the problem of guilt under God’s law, or a social-ecclesial announcement of who is in the people of God. The classic Reformed position defends the former without denying the ecclesial effects of justification, because only a verdict grounded in **double imputation** both vindicates God’s justice and secures the assurance and holiness of the church.

Martin Luther’s discovery of the iustitia Dei in his Romans lectures and his mature polemics against scholastic soteriology reframed the logic of grace for the West. He read the righteousness of God not as the intrinsic quality by which God punishes or as the infused habit by which he makes the sinner inherently just, but as the alien righteousness of Christ given and reckoned to faith. In Luther’s commentary on Galatians and in the Heidelberg Disputation, the law-gospel antithesis is not a metaphysical dualism but a hermeneutical judgment. The law exposes sin and silences boasting, the gospel announces Christ given for us. The sinner is simul iustus et peccator because the righteousness that justifies is extra nos, counted to the believer apart from inherent renewal. Luther’s method was exegetical and polemical, rooted in the text of Paul and the Augustinian anthropology of bound will and human inability. He anchored justification in God’s **forensic** speech act that creates the reality it declares because it is grounded in the objective achievement of Christ. Examiner challenge: does this make justification a legal fiction. Luther’s answer, and ours, is that God’s word never lies. The verdict is grounded in real union to a real federal head who has really fulfilled the law and borne its curse. What is reckoned is not a moral zero but Christ himself for me.

John Calvin conserved Luther’s gospel while tightening the bonds between Christ and his benefits. In Institutes 3.11, he insists that Christ cannot be torn to pieces. Justification and sanctification flow from the one Christ by the one Spirit. He also strengthened the Reformed account of **union with Christ** as the nexus in which Immanuel shares all his riches with the elect. Faith remains the sole instrument in justification, not because faith merits or is formed by charity, but because it is an empty hand that receives Christ. Calvin treated “righteousness of God” in Romans 1 to 3 as the righteousness provided by God and received by faith, against any view that collapses it into divine attribute without reference to gift. He allowed the pastoral depth of assurance to flow from justification’s decisiveness while maintaining the necessity of sanctification as the inescapable fruit of union. Examiner challenge: does union collapse the legal into the transformative so that justification is no longer irreducibly **forensic**. Calvin’s distinctions guard against this. Union is the fountain, the benefits are distinct. The juristic status does not wait upon the degree of inherent renewal, and yet the verdict never leaves the justified unchanged. The duplex gratia secures both.

Francis Turretin then codified the fine-grained dogmatic grammar of the Reformed view against Roman, Socinian, and Remonstrant alternatives. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology locus on justification, he defines **imputation** as an act of God as judge whereby the obedience and satisfaction of Christ are legally reckoned to the believer. Turretin insists that **active obedience** is not reducible to sinlessness but names Christ’s positive fulfillment of the precept of the law as the second Adam under the **federal headship** of a covenantal order. Without such obedience credited to us, we would be neutral but not righteous. The law demands both non-violation and fulfillment. He secures the instrumental nature of faith against Roman accounts of fides formata and against Arminian tendencies to make faith a work that conditions grace. He also highlights that justification is a once-for-all verdict, not a process, though the justified are judged according to works as evidences at the last day. Examiner challenge: where is **active obedience** in Scripture. Turretin directs us to Romans 5 on the obedience of the one man, to Philippians 2 on Christ’s obedience to the point of death, and to the Adam Christ typology in which the righteousness that constitutes many comes by a full covenantal obedience parallel to Adam’s full covenantal failure. Reformed scholastics read these lines within **federal theology** that spans covenant of works and covenant of grace, so that the juridical logic of justification fits the prelapsarian structure of life by law under Adam and the postlapsarian gift of righteousness under Christ.

Against this, Robert Bellarmine gave the Roman Catholic synthesis its most formidable articulation. Following the Council of Trent and drawing on Thomistic resources, he argued in De Iustificatione that justification is formally the inherent righteousness poured into the soul by the Spirit, that faith justifies only insofar as it is formed by love, and that God’s acceptance of the sinner rests on the internal transformation that charity accomplishes. He rejected the idea that the righteousness of another can be the formal cause of our justification and charged Protestants with a bare externalism that makes God declare what is not so. He affirmed the necessity of grace for every good work and the priority of divine initiative but held that the justified can increase in righteousness and merit further grace and eternal life. Examiner challenge: how do you answer the charge that formed faith honors the biblical insistence on love and thus improves upon bare imputation. The Reformed reply is that faith’s justifying role must be distinguished from its sanctifying fruit. The moment love is introduced into the instrument that receives Christ’s righteousness, the ground of peace shifts from Christ to the mutable condition of the believer. Romans 4 explicitly opposes faith and works as instruments of attaining righteousness, and it grounds the blessedness of the justified precisely in non-imputation of sin and imputation of righteousness. This is not “bare” but profoundly evangelical because it locates the ground of acceptance wholly in Christ. The love that fulfills the law is the necessary consequence of the verdict, not its cause.

The modern debate turns on a reassessment of Second Temple Judaism and a reframing of Paul. E. P. Sanders drove the first wedge by arguing that Judaism of the period was not a religion of merit and works righteousness but a pattern of religion he called **covenantal nomism**. One enters the covenant by grace and remains in it by obedience. The law is the means of staying in the covenant, not of getting in. Sanders then judged that Paul critiqued the law not as a means of self-salvation but as inadequate in the new salvation-history because Christ had come. Sanders’s method privileged sociological and historical reconstructions of Judaism in order to dislodge Lutheran introspective readings of Paul. His work forced Protestant exegetes to sharpen their claims about the nature of the Jewish opponent and the meaning of “works of the law.” Yet Sanders left the precise soteriological implications underdetermined, opening space for his colleague James Dunn and later N. T. Wright to argue that Paul’s key concern was not individual salvation from guilt but the multiethnic shape of the people of God and the dismantling of boundary markers like circumcision, food laws, and Sabbath.

N. T. Wright, the most influential architect of the New Perspective for our purposes, offers a full-scale reframing of justification as God’s declaration that someone is in the right as a member of the covenant family. He insists that “righteousness of God” in Romans names God’s covenant faithfulness to the Abrahamic promise and not a status granted to the sinner. Justification is law-court language, but the law-court in question declares who is in the covenant, not who has moral quality. Present justification happens through faith in Jesus the Messiah, which for Wright functions as allegiance that recognizes that God has fulfilled his promises in Israel’s representative. Final justification, he says, will be according to the totality of the Spirit-led life. “Works of the law” are Jewish badges of covenant membership, so Paul’s polemic targets ethnocentrism more than synergistic merit. Wright’s method is narratival and historical, insisting that Paul reads Scripture as the story of Israel’s God fulfilling his promises through the faithfulness of the Messiah and the outpoured Spirit.

This account brings to the surface a real biblical theme. God is faithful to his covenant. The gospel creates a new Jew-plus-Gentile people. The problem is that Wright narrows justification to this corporate boundary setting and thereby obscures Paul’s most urgent claim, that sinners stand under God’s wrath because of transgression of his law and need a gift of righteousness counted to them apart from works. Romans 3 to 4 dismantles both Jewish and Gentile boasting by reducing all humanity to the status of lawbreakers. The righteousness of God is revealed apart from the law, attested by the law and the prophets, and received by faith. Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness. David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works. The logic is not boundary markers but the opposition between doing and believing as ways to be right with God. Examiner challenge: could “works of the law” still be primarily boundary markers. Paul’s texts do foreground circumcision and days at points, but the argument extends beyond badges to the whole doing modality. In Galatians 3, the curse of the law falls on all who do not abide by all things written in the book of the law. That is not a boundary marker but a comprehensive demand. The blessing of Abraham comes to Gentiles in Christ because Christ redeemed us from the curse by becoming a curse for us. Behind the badge-issues lies the deeper indictment of Adamic humanity under the law’s curse. Only a **forensic** transfer of curse and righteousness can resolve that plight.

Wright resists **imputation**, claiming Paul never says the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers. Yet Paul does say faith is counted as righteousness, that righteousness is counted to the ungodly, and that in Christ who knew no sin God made him to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. The **double imputation** of our sin to Christ and Christ’s righteousness to us is the most natural juridical construal of 2 Corinthians 5. The alternative is to make “righteousness of God” in that verse refer to God’s own covenant faithfulness without reference to a status conferred. But then one must explain the parallelism of Christ being made sin and believers becoming righteousness in him. The Reformed construal secures the symmetry: our sins imputed to Christ, his righteousness imputed to us, all within **union with Christ** so that legal reckoning corresponds to covenantal solidarity.

Examiner challenge: what about the pistis Christou debate, whether it is faith in Christ or the faithfulness of Christ. Even if one grants a subjective genitive in some texts, the Reformed reading gains rather than loses, since Christ’s faithfulness is the basis of our righteousness, and our faith is the instrument of reception. The New Perspective cannot build its rejection of **imputation** on a genitive debate. It must still face the Abraham-David argument for reckoning righteousness apart from works.

Examiner challenge: does the Reformed position ignore the corporate dimension. It does not. Justification has immediate ecclesial implications. God’s one verdict creates one justified people without ethnic boasting. But the verdict is not reducible to boundary marking. The horizontal peace flows from the vertical acquittal. Rome and the New Perspective stand in different ways on the same mistake. Rome confuses the verdict with the inward renewal that follows, and the New Perspective constricts the verdict to ecclesial inclusion without a robust answer to guilt and the law’s curse. Only a robust **forensic** verdict tied to **imputation** produces both assurance for sinners and a reconciled multiethnic church.

Internal debates within the Reformed tradition sharpen this articulation. First, the question of **union with Christ** and order. Some make union logically and temporally prior to justification, such that in union the believer has Christ and therefore his righteousness. Others order justification and adoption as benefits that constitute union’s legal aspect. The safest path secures both. The Spirit unites us to Christ through faith, and within that union the distinct benefits are received. Justification’s legal status is not the same as sanctification’s transformative power, though both are inseparable. To collapse them is to slide toward a Roman or Federal Vision confusion. Second, the necessity of the **imputation** of Christ’s **active obedience**. A minority in the Reformed world has hesitated to affirm the whole obedience of Christ imputed, preferring to limit imputation to the removal of guilt. But the law demanded perfect obedience for life. Without positive righteousness credited, the justified would be pardoned but not righteous. Romans 5’s contrast between the one trespass leading to condemnation and the one act of righteousness leading to justification and life indicates a positive obedience aside from curse-bearing. Third, the relation of justification and the final judgment. Scripture speaks of judgment according to works. The Reformed insist this is evidentiary, not meritorious. Works are the fruit and evidence of living faith. They are the necessary path of the justified but never enter the ground of the verdict. Any suggestion of a second, future justification on the basis of Spirit-wrought obedience undercuts the once-for-allness of the gospel verdict and unsettles the conscience.

Contemporary pressures require pastoral clarity. The Federal Vision movement spoke of covenantal objectivity that confers a kind of initial justification in baptism and a final justification attenuated by covenant faithfulness. This collapses sacramental ecclesiology into the soteriological core and mixes the instrumentality of faith with the obedience that faith produces. It also blurs the distinction between the invisible church’s union with Christ and the visible church’s administration. Examiner challenge: if Paul speaks of a faith that works through love, why not make love part of the instrument of justification. Because Paul also explicitly contrasts justification by faith with justification by works, and James’s use of justification language refers to demonstrative vindication before men and God’s public vindication, not to the same moment Paul addresses. Faith working through love is the shape of the Christian life, not the condition of the verdict.

We can now integrate the exegetical heart of the matter. In Romans 2 Paul says the doers of the law will be justified. He is stating the principle of the law, not describing a path that any sinner will walk. He drives the argument in Romans 3 to universal guilt. In Romans 3 to 4 he reveals the righteousness of God apart from law, counted to believers apart from works, illustrated in Abraham and David. Abraham’s faith in Genesis 15 is counted as righteousness before circumcision, so that he is the father of uncircumcised believers. The boundary marker is not irrelevant, but the deeper logic is that God justifies the ungodly by counting righteousness to them apart from doing. Galatians 2 to 3 adds the curse dimension. Christ became a curse for us. That is penal, **forensic**, and vicarious. Philippians 3 makes Paul’s renunciation of his law-based righteousness explicit, and his desire is to be found in Christ not having a righteousness of his own that comes from law but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith. The genitives, the storyline, and the law-court metaphors converge. The narrative of Israel culminates in a legal reckoning by which sinners stand acquitted and righteous in Christ.

A philosophic challenge often arises. Is **imputation** metaphysically thin. Does God declare what is not true. The answer lies in **federal headship** and the covenantal ontology of Scripture. Adam’s sin is counted to his posterity not by biological infusion of moral quality but by a real juridical solidarity in a covenantal relation. Christ as the second Adam stands as the true representative. The law-court does not traffic in fictions but in representative realities. We are not pretending to be righteous; we are really righteous in the legal order that defines our relation to God, because Christ’s obedience really belongs to us in covenantal union. Divine justice is not violated but magnified, since the punishment for sin is borne and the righteousness required is fulfilled. Because of **divine simplicity**, God does not dispense a hollow word. His justifying speech is his saving action in Christ applied by the Spirit, consistent with his unwavering justice and mercy which are not compartments but the one simple God acting toward the world according to his decree and promise.

Returning to Bellarmine, we must grant that renewal is essential to salvation. The Reformed agree and have always confessed that sanctification is inseparable from justification. But the distinction is not arbitrary. It preserves the order of grace. The ground of acceptance is never mixed with the degree of transformation. This matters for assurance, for pastoral care of the weak, and for the church’s mission. It also matters for ecclesiology. The church’s unity does not depend on uniform maturity but on a shared verdict. Sacraments seal this promise. Baptism signifies union and washes with water the pledge that the gospel promises, not because the sign effects the verdict ex opere operato, but because the Spirit uses means to strengthen faith.

Finally, we must address the function of works at the last day and the charge of antinomianism. The New Testament is unequivocal that judgment will be according to works. The Reformed are equally unequivocal that this does not introduce a second instrument. Works are the Spirit’s fruits, necessary as evidence that faith is alive. The verdict according to works reveals the truth of the verdict by faith. There is no two-track justification. Examiner challenge: in Romans 2, could not Gentiles by nature do the law. Paul’s intent is to show that neither Jew nor Gentile meets the standard, that all are under sin, and that only in Christ does the requirement of the law get fulfilled in us who walk according to the Spirit. That clause points not to the ground of justification but to the effect of sanctification in the justified. It harmonizes Paul’s ethical seriousness with his **forensic** gospel.

With Luther and Calvin we therefore construe justification as the gratuitous verdict for sinners grounded in Christ alone. With Turretin we explicate its **imputation** and defend Christ’s **active obedience** as necessary to the positive righteousness credited. Against Bellarmine we keep the instrument of faith uncluttered by charity and the formal cause external to us. Against Sanders and Wright we affirm the corporate effects and narrative setting of justification while guarding its legal center. The New Perspective rightly rebukes Gentile arrogance and highlights the Abrahamic promise, but it blunts the sword of Paul’s indictment. It turns the courtroom into a membership desk. Paul keeps us in court and then transports us out by counting another’s righteousness as ours. That is the only path that maintains both God’s justice and the free justification of the ungodly, and thereby the only path that can generate a holy, assured, multinational church.

The adjacent loci harmonize with this account. The atonement supplies the penal ground for non-imputation of sin and the active obedience for the positive gift of righteousness. The covenant of works and grace supplies the **federal** frame that makes **imputation** intelligible. Adoption flows from justification’s verdict, bestowing a new name. Sanctification grows out of the same union in which justification is received, preventing antinomianism without inflating the instrument. Ecclesiology receives a unified people from one verdict rather than an ethnic coalition patched together by new badges. Assurance and perseverance follow from the finality of the verdict and the Spirit’s sealing.

If Westminster oral examiners press the hardest points, the answers are ready. The righteousness of God in Romans is both God’s saving faithfulness and the gift of a righteous status from God, but in justification it is the latter that operates as the instrument of peace. Works of the law are not only boundary markers, though such markers are included; Paul’s sweep aims at all doing under law as the basis of life with God. James does not contradict Paul because he combats a dead faith that cannot justify, and he uses justify in the sense of demonstrate and vindicate. Final judgment according to works is evidentiary, not meritorious. The imputation of **active obedience** is demanded by the law’s structure and the Adam Christ parallel. And the stigma of legal fiction dissolves once **union with Christ** and **federal headship** do their proper work. The result is a doctrine coherent across loci, resilient against rival frameworks, and pastorally life-giving.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Justification is a once-for-all **forensic** verdict in which God declares the ungodly righteous by the **imputation** of Christ’s **active and passive obedience**, received through **faith alone** within **union with Christ**, with works as necessary fruit but never as ground.
- Decisive figures:
  - Martin Luther: alien righteousness, simul iustus et peccator, law-gospel distinction, justification as divine verdict.
  - John Calvin: union with Christ, duplex gratia, faith as sole instrument, justification and sanctification distinct yet inseparable.
  - Robert Bellarmine: Tridentine infused righteousness, faith formed by love, merit and progressive justification.
  - Francis Turretin: precise account of **imputation**, defense of **active obedience**, once-for-all verdict, evidentiary role of works.
  - E. P. Sanders: **covenantal nomism**, reframing Judaism and Paul’s problem.
  - N. T. Wright: justification as covenant membership declaration, righteousness of God as covenant faithfulness, skepticism toward **imputation** and advocacy of future verdict according to whole life.
- Debates:
  - Internal: priority of **union with Christ** and ordo, necessity of **active obedience** imputation, assurance and judgment according to works.
  - External: Roman Catholic infused righteousness and fides caritate formata, Socinian denial of vicarious satisfaction and **imputation**.
  - Contemporary: New Perspective boundary-marker thesis and narrative reframing, Federal Vision and final justification claims, ecumenical convergence proposals.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed doctrine of **forensic** justification by **double imputation** through **faith alone**, grounded in Christ’s **active and passive obedience**, against Tridentine infusion and New Perspective reductions.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Romans 2 teach justification by doing the law? Principle of law exposed to show universal failure; not an attainable path for sinners.
  - Are “works of the law” only boundary markers? No; badges are included but Paul’s argument targets all doing under law.
  - Is imputation a legal fiction? No; **federal headship** and **union with Christ** ground a real juridical solidarity.
  - Where is active obedience in Scripture? Romans 5, Adam Christ parallel, the law’s positive demand for life fulfilled by Christ.
  - How do James and Paul cohere? Different uses of justify; James addresses demonstrative vindication of living faith.
  - What is the role of works at final judgment? Evidentiary fruit, never meritorious ground of any justification.
