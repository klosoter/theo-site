# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **justification** within his broader project of grounding theology in **religious experience** rather than in forensic or juridical categories. He rejected the traditional **forensic** understanding of justification as a legal declaration and instead emphasized the believer’s participation in the **life of Christ** and the transformation of the **God-consciousness**. Schleiermacher’s approach stands in contrast to both classical **imputation** and later **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** critiques, focusing instead on the inner renewal of the individual.

- "Justification is not a mere imputation, but the actual communication of the divine life." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Schleiermacher: Theology as a Way of Life (S. Gerrish, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Communication of Divine Life**
    - Justification is not a legal declaration but the impartation of **God-consciousness**.
    - The believer is justified through participation in Christ’s **redemptive life**.
    - Emphasizes transformation over external status before God.
    - Downplays the distinction between **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - "Justification is the state of being in Christ, not merely being declared righteous." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
    - Denies that Christ’s righteousness is imputed in a strictly legal sense.
    - Views imputation as a metaphor for the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Critiques the Reformation’s forensic categories as insufficiently spiritual.
    - Sees justification as a real change in the believer’s relationship to God.
    - "The forensic view cannot express the living union with Christ." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Grounds justification in the experience of **absolute dependence** on God.
    - The sense of forgiveness arises from the believer’s renewed consciousness.
    - Objective doctrines are secondary to the subjective reality of faith.
    - The work of Christ is appropriated through personal experience, not legal transaction.
    - "The essence of faith is the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Integration of Justification and Sanctification**
    - No sharp distinction between being declared righteous and being made righteous.
    - Both are aspects of the believer’s participation in Christ’s life.
    - Justification is the beginning of the new life, not a separate act.
    - Sanctification is the ongoing realization of justification.
    - "Justification and sanctification are inseparable moments of the same process." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Critique of Traditional Protestant Orthodoxy**
    - Argues that Protestant orthodoxy overemphasizes legal categories.
    - Seeks to recover the existential and communal dimensions of salvation.
    - Emphasizes the church as the context for the experience of justification.
    - Challenges the adequacy of **imputation** and forensic models for modern consciousness.
    - "The old dogmatic formulas must be reinterpreted in light of living faith." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **justification** profoundly influenced modern theology, shifting the focus from forensic categories to **religious experience** and the inner transformation of the believer. His approach paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies, and his critiques anticipated some concerns raised by the **New Perspective on Paul**. While his views were sharply criticized by confessional Reformed and Lutheran theologians, his emphasis on the unity of justification and sanctification remains a significant point of discussion in contemporary theology.
