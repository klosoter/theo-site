# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of justification**, emphasizing its **forensic** character and the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness to the believer. They firmly distinguish justification from **sanctification** and reject any notion of justification by inherent righteousness or works, standing in contrast to later **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** critiques that question traditional readings of **Pauline justification**.

- "Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth... by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them." (Westminster Confession of Faith 11.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (1647)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Directory for Public Worship (for confessional context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is Forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - It involves God’s act as judge, pronouncing sinners righteous in Christ.
    - The righteousness considered is external to the believer, not inherent.
    - This declaration is based solely on Christ’s work, not on any human merit.
    - "Justification is an act of God’s free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous in his sight." (Shorter Catechism Q.33)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is credited to believers.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which this righteousness is received.
    - The believer’s own works or faith itself are not the ground of justification.
    - Imputation is double: our sins to Christ, his righteousness to us.
    - "Not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ’s sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself... but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them." (Confession 11.1)

3. **Faith Alone as the Instrument**
    - Faith is the only means by which justification is received.
    - Faith itself is not the ground or basis of justification.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, the source of righteousness.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of faith, not its cause.
    - "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." (Confession 11.2)

4. **Distinction from Sanctification**
    - Justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct benefits.
    - Justification is once-for-all; sanctification is progressive.
    - Sanctification involves inward renewal, justification is a legal status.
    - Assurance of justification does not depend on sanctification, though the latter evidences the former.
    - "Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification, yet they differ... the one being an act of God’s free grace, the other a work of God’s Spirit." (Larger Catechism Q.77)

5. **Rejection of Works and Human Merit**
    - Human works, even those done by grace, cannot contribute to justification.
    - The covenant of works is fulfilled only in Christ, not in believers.
    - Any doctrine that mingles works with faith in justification is condemned.
    - The Standards explicitly reject the Roman Catholic and other synergistic views.
    - "God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified... yet they can never fall from the state of justification." (Confession 11.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of justification**, serving as a confessional benchmark for Presbyterian and many other Protestant churches. Their clear articulation of **forensic justification** and **imputation** has provided a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and modern revisionist critiques, including those of the **New Perspective on Paul**. The Standards’ influence endures in contemporary theological debates, ensuring that the classic Reformed understanding of justification remains central in confessional Reformed theology.
