# Douglas J. Moo (1950– )

Douglas J. Moo is a leading evangelical New Testament scholar whose work on **justification** emphasizes its **forensic** character and the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, while critically engaging with the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**. Moo maintains that justification is a declarative act of God, rooted in union with Christ, and not based on human works or covenantal membership. He affirms traditional Reformed categories while thoughtfully addressing contemporary challenges.

- "Justification is the act of God by which he declares sinners to be righteous on the basis of Christ’s work." ("The Epistle to the Romans")

## Key Works

- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT, 1996)
- Galatians (BECNT, 2013)
- Justification in Galatians (in "Understanding the Times," 1991)
- "Paul and the Law in the Last Ten Years" (Scottish Journal of Theology, 1996)
- "The New Perspective on Paul" (in "Justification and Variegated Nomism," 2004)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - God pronounces the sinner righteous based on Christ’s merit.
    - The verdict is grounded in Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - This declaration is distinct from sanctification.
    - "Justification is not a process but a verdict, a declaration of status." (Romans, NICNT)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - The righteousness of Christ is credited to believers by faith.
    - Imputation is central to Paul’s doctrine of justification.
    - Moo defends imputation against NPP critiques.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which righteousness is received.
    - "Paul teaches that God imputes righteousness to the believer, not on the basis of works, but through faith in Christ." (Romans, NICNT)

3. **Faith alone as the means of justification**
    - Justification is received by faith apart from works of the law.
    - Faith is trust in Christ, not mere intellectual assent.
    - Works are excluded as the basis for justification.
    - Moo affirms sola fide as essential to Paul’s teaching.
    - "Paul’s insistence on faith apart from works is the heart of his doctrine of justification." (Romans, NICNT)

4. **Critical engagement with the New Perspective on Paul**
    - Moo acknowledges the NPP’s insights on Second Temple Judaism.
    - He critiques the NPP for downplaying the forensic and individual aspects of justification.
    - Moo maintains that justification addresses both covenantal and legal realities.
    - He argues that Paul’s polemic is not only about boundary markers but about the basis of acceptance before God.
    - "While the New Perspective has shed light on Judaism, it underestimates Paul’s concern with the individual’s standing before God." (Justification and Variegated Nomism)

5. **Union with Christ as the context for justification**
    - Justification is inseparable from union with Christ.
    - Believers are justified because they are “in Christ.”
    - Union provides the basis for both imputation and the believer’s new status.
    - Moo integrates union with Christ into his understanding of justification.
    - "It is by virtue of being united with Christ that believers are justified." (Romans, NICNT)

## Legacy and Impact

Douglas J. Moo’s scholarship has significantly shaped evangelical understanding of **justification**, especially in response to the challenges posed by the New Perspective on Paul. His careful exegesis and defense of the **forensic** and **imputational** aspects of justification have reinforced traditional Reformed positions while engaging contemporary scholarship. Moo’s work remains a standard reference for pastors, students, and scholars seeking clarity on Paul’s doctrine of justification.
