# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reinterprets **justification** as an act of **liberative participation** in the life of the risen Christ, rather than a merely **forensic declaration**. He critiques traditional Protestant emphases on **imputation** and the legal aspects of justification, situating the doctrine within the broader context of **eschatological hope** and communal transformation.

- "Justification is not only the acquittal of the sinner, but the raising of the dead." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- "Justification and Justice" in The Future of Theology (1985, ed. Gunton)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Participation in Christ’s Resurrection**
   - Emphasizes union with the risen Christ over a merely legal status.
   - Views justification as transformative, involving new life and hope.
   - Connects justification to the eschatological renewal of all things.
   - Sees faith as participation in Christ’s victory over sin and death.
   - "Justification is the life-giving act of God who raises the dead and calls into being the things that are not." (The Coming of God)

2. **Critique of Forensic and Imputational Models**
   - Questions the adequacy of purely forensic categories for justification.
   - Argues that imputation can lead to a static, external view of salvation.
   - Sees justification as more than a change in legal status; it is a new creation.
   - Stresses the relational and communal dimensions over individual legal standing.
   - "The forensic doctrine of justification must be complemented by the creative act of God’s Spirit." (The Crucified God)

3. **Integration of Justification and Justice**
   - Links justification with God’s work of justice in the world.
   - Argues that justification should lead to social transformation.
   - Critiques any separation between personal salvation and societal renewal.
   - Emphasizes the church’s role as an agent of reconciliation and justice.
   - "Justification and justice belong together in the liberating righteousness of God." ("Justification and Justice")

4. **Eschatological Orientation of Justification**
   - Frames justification within the context of future hope and resurrection.
   - Sees justification as the anticipation of final redemption.
   - Argues that present justification points toward the coming kingdom of God.
   - Connects individual justification with cosmic renewal.
   - "Justification is the anticipation of the resurrection of the dead and the new creation." (The Coming of God)

5. **Engagement with the New Perspective on Paul**
   - Welcomes the New Perspective’s emphasis on covenant and community.
   - Critiques both traditional and NPP approaches for insufficient eschatological focus.
   - Sees Paul’s doctrine as fundamentally about participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
   - Argues for a broader, more holistic understanding of justification beyond legal or covenantal categories.
   - "Paul’s justification theology is not exhausted by the categories of law court or covenant, but opens up to the new creation in Christ." (Experiences in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **justification** has influenced contemporary theology by challenging the dominance of **forensic and imputation-based models**. His integration of **eschatology**, **participation**, and **justice** has encouraged theologians to reconsider the doctrine’s implications for both personal faith and public life. While his views have been critiqued for departing from classical Reformation categories, Moltmann has expanded the conversation around justification, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. His work continues to shape debates on the relationship between **soteriology** and **eschatological hope**.
