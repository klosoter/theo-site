# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a classic Reformed doctrine of **justification** as a **forensic act** grounded in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**. These confessions emphasize that believers are declared righteous before God solely by faith, apart from works, and explicitly reject any confusion of justification with sanctification or internal renewal. Recent critiques from the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** are at odds with the confessions’ insistence on the extrinsic, legal character of justification and the necessity of imputation.

- "How are you righteous before God? Only by true faith in Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 22–24
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Lord’s Day 23–24 (Q&A 59–64)
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Second and Third/Fourth Heads of Doctrine
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis (Lyle D. Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is a forensic declaration**
    - Justification is God’s legal act, not a process of moral transformation.
    - The believer is declared righteous in God’s sight, not made inherently righteous.
    - This declaration is based solely on Christ’s merits, not on any human work.
    - The confessions distinguish sharply between justification and sanctification.
    - "We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for Jesus Christ’s sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is implied." (Belgic Confession, Art. 23)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - Christ’s obedience and satisfaction are credited to believers by faith.
    - The confessions explicitly reject any notion of infused righteousness as the basis of acceptance.
    - Faith is the instrument by which Christ’s righteousness is received.
    - The believer’s own works or merits play no role in justification.
    - "His perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness are as my own, as if I had never sinned nor been a sinner." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

3. **Faith alone as the sole instrument**
    - Justification is received by faith alone, apart from works.
    - Faith itself is not the ground of justification, but the means of receiving Christ.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of faith, not the basis of justification.
    - Assurance of justification is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in personal performance.
    - "Therefore we justly say with Paul, that we are justified by faith alone, or by faith apart from works." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

4. **Rejection of synergism and Roman Catholic views**
    - The confessions explicitly oppose the Roman Catholic doctrine of justification by faith plus works.
    - Human cooperation or merit is excluded from the ground of justification.
    - The Canons of Dort reject Arminian synergism and uphold monergistic grace.
    - Justification is an act of God’s free grace, not a reward for human effort.
    - "If the only way to be saved were to add something of our own to Christ’s satisfaction, then we would always be in doubt." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 62)

5. **Critique of New Perspective on Paul (NPP) tendencies**
    - The confessions affirm justification as a matter of legal status before God, not merely covenant membership.
    - They maintain the centrality of imputation, which NPP often downplays or reinterprets.
    - The confessions insist that justification is not about boundary markers or ecclesial identity, but about standing before God.
    - Any view that blurs the distinction between justification and sanctification is rejected.
    - "For it must needs follow, either that Christ is not a complete Savior, or that they who by true faith receive this Savior, must find all things in him necessary to their salvation." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have provided the doctrinal backbone for **continental Reformed churches**, shaping their teaching on justification for centuries. Their clear articulation of **forensic justification** and **imputation** has served as a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and modern revisionist interpretations, including those of the New Perspective on Paul. These confessions continue to inform Reformed identity and provide a standard for evaluating contemporary theological trends regarding the doctrine of justification.
