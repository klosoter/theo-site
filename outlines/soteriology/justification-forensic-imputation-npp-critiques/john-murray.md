# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray was a leading Reformed theologian who articulated a robust doctrine of **justification** as a strictly **forensic act** grounded in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**. He vigorously defended the classic Protestant understanding against both Roman Catholic and modern challenges, including the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, emphasizing the centrality of **union with Christ** and the **imputation** of Christ’s active and passive obedience.

- "Justification is a declarative act whereby God pronounces the believer to be righteous on the basis of the righteousness of Jesus Christ." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959–1965)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Imputation of Adam’s Sin" (1959)
- "Calvin on the Imputation of Adam’s Sin" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1959)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is Forensic**
   - Justification is a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
   - It concerns the believer’s status before God, not internal renewal.
   - The ground is entirely external: the righteousness of Christ.
   - Distinguishes sharply between justification and sanctification.
   - "Justification is not the making of a person righteous but the declaring of a person to be righteous." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
   - Christ’s active and passive obedience are both imputed to the believer.
   - Imputation is the reckoning of Christ’s righteousness as the believer’s own.
   - Rejects any notion that faith itself is the ground of justification.
   - Upholds the necessity of a double imputation: our sin to Christ, his righteousness to us.
   - "The righteousness of Christ is imputed to the believer and constitutes the ground of his justification." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

3. **Union with Christ as the Context of Justification**
   - All benefits of salvation, including justification, flow from union with Christ.
   - Union is both legal and vital, but justification itself remains forensic.
   - Faith unites the believer to Christ, securing all redemptive benefits.
   - Union does not blur the distinction between justification and sanctification.
   - "It is in Christ, in union with him, that the believer is justified." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Critique of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
   - Rejects NPP’s redefinition of justification as merely covenant membership.
   - Affirms the traditional Reformed view of justification as addressing the problem of guilt before God.
   - Stresses the necessity of imputed righteousness, not just covenant inclusion.
   - Sees NPP as undermining the Reformation’s soteriological distinctives.
   - "Justification is not simply a matter of covenant status but of a righteous standing before God." (cf. "Romans" Commentary)

5. **Faith as the Sole Instrument of Justification**
   - Faith is the means by which Christ’s righteousness is received, not its basis.
   - Faith itself is not meritorious or a substitute for righteousness.
   - Emphasizes sola fide: justification by faith alone.
   - Faith is always directed outward, to Christ and his finished work.
   - "Faith is not the ground of justification; it is the instrument by which we receive Christ and his righteousness." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s rigorous defense of **forensic justification** and **imputation** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in response to modern challenges like the **New Perspective on Paul**. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity continue to serve as a benchmark for evangelical scholarship. Murray’s work remains foundational for those upholding the classic Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone.
