# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **justification** centers on the transformative work of **grace** within the believer, emphasizing the **infusion of righteousness** rather than a purely **forensic declaration**. While he affirms the necessity of divine initiative and the inability of humans to merit salvation, Augustine’s view differs from later **Reformation** emphases on **imputation** and is often contrasted with both **medieval** and **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** readings.

- "God bids us, by the law, to do what we cannot, that we may know what we ought to seek from Him." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- On Nature and Grace
- Sermons on Selected Lessons of the New Testament
- Augustine and the Doctrine of Justification (Alister McGrath, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Transformative, Not Merely Forensic**
    - Justification involves the actual transformation of the sinner’s nature by **infused grace**.
    - Righteousness is not only declared but also made real within the believer.
    - The process includes both **forgiveness of sins** and the renewal of the will.
    - Augustine does not frame justification as a legal imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - "To be justified... is to be made righteous." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

2. **Primacy of Grace in Salvation**
    - Human beings are utterly dependent on **divine grace** for any movement toward God.
    - The will is bound by sin and cannot initiate faith or obedience.
    - Grace is both prevenient (going before) and operative in justification.
    - Any good in the believer is ultimately attributed to God’s action, not human merit.
    - "What have you that you did not receive?" (Enchiridion)

3. **Faith Working Through Love**
    - Augustine sees **faith** as foundational but always accompanied by **love** (caritas).
    - Justification is not by faith alone but by faith formed and animated by love.
    - The believer’s cooperation with grace is necessary, though enabled by God.
    - This view anticipates the medieval synthesis rather than Reformation sola fide.
    - "Faith without love is nothing." (On Faith and Works)

4. **Imputation Not Central**
    - Augustine does not articulate a doctrine of **imputed righteousness** as later Reformers do.
    - Righteousness is imparted, not merely reckoned or accounted.
    - The legal/forensic metaphor is present but subordinate to the theme of renewal.
    - His language of “covering” sin refers to transformation, not external accounting.
    - "He justifies the ungodly, not by imputing, but by making righteous." (paraphrase from On the Spirit and the Letter)

5. **Original Sin and the Necessity of Grace**
    - All humanity is implicated in **Adam’s sin** and in need of redemption.
    - Justification addresses both guilt and the corruption of nature.
    - Baptism is the ordinary means by which justification is conferred.
    - The ongoing need for grace is emphasized throughout the Christian life.
    - "In Adam all die, in Christ all shall be made alive." (Enchiridion)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **justification** profoundly shaped Western Christianity, especially in its emphasis on **grace** and the transformation of the human will. His views provided the foundation for later medieval developments and were a critical point of departure for **Reformation** debates over forensic justification and imputation. While not aligned with the **New Perspective on Paul**, Augustine’s focus on the internal renewal of the believer continues to inform contemporary discussions about the nature of righteousness and salvation. His legacy endures in both Catholic and Protestant traditions, though often interpreted in divergent ways.
