# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a doctrine of **justification** that is fundamentally transformative rather than purely **forensic**. For Aquinas, justification involves the infusion of **grace** and **charity** into the soul, effecting an internal renewal rather than merely an external declaration of righteousness. He does not teach **imputation** in the Reformation sense, and his framework stands in contrast to both later Protestant emphases and contemporary **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** critiques.

- "Justification taken passively implies a movement to justice, as from injustice, and this movement takes place by a certain transmutation of the soul." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 106–114
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as a Transformative Process**
   - Justification is not merely a legal declaration but a real change in the soul.
   - The process involves the infusion of **sanctifying grace**.
   - The movement from sin to righteousness is both moral and ontological.
   - The subject is made inherently righteous, not merely regarded as such.
   - "Justification denotes a transmutation to the state of justice." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.1)

2. **Infusion of Grace and Charity**
   - Grace is infused by God, enabling the soul to love God above all.
   - Charity is the form of all virtues and essential to justification.
   - The human will is moved by God to consent to grace.
   - The result is a new disposition toward God and neighbor.
   - "The infusion of grace is required for the remission of guilt." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.3)

3. **Faith Formed by Love**
   - Faith is necessary but not sufficient for justification.
   - Justifying faith must be "formed" by charity (fides caritate formata).
   - Mere intellectual assent (fides informis) does not justify.
   - The unity of faith and love is essential for righteousness before God.
   - "Faith without works is dead, and does not suffice for justification." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.114, a.4)

4. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
   - Aquinas does not teach the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as an external legal status.
   - Righteousness is inherent, not merely accounted.
   - The merits of Christ are the cause of grace, not a legal transfer.
   - God’s declaration of righteousness corresponds to an actual transformation.
   - "God does not justify us without ourselves, for by our own will we receive grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.113, a.3)

5. **Merit and Cooperation with Grace**
   - Human cooperation with grace is necessary after initial justification.
   - Good works, empowered by grace, contribute to growth in righteousness.
   - Merit is possible only because of God’s prior gift of grace.
   - Final justification includes both God’s initiative and human response.
   - "No one can merit the first grace, but after justification man can merit eternal life." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.114, a.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **justification** shaped the medieval and Roman Catholic understanding of salvation, emphasizing the internal renewal of the believer through **infused grace**. His rejection of **forensic imputation** became a central point of divergence with the Reformation, influencing subsequent Catholic-Protestant debates. While not directly addressed by the **New Perspective on Paul**, Aquinas’s views remain a touchstone for discussions about the nature of righteousness and the relationship between faith, works, and grace in Christian theology.
