# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **justification** as a relational and existential reality rather than a purely **forensic** or legal declaration. He critiqued the traditional **imputation** model, emphasizing the transformative encounter with Christ over juridical categories, and engaged critically with both classical Reformed views and emerging perspectives like the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**. Brunner sought to recover the personal and dynamic character of justification, focusing on faith as trust in the living God.

- "Justification is not a legal fiction, but the real making right of man before God." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Man in Revolt

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Personal Encounter**
   - Stresses justification as a living relationship with God, not merely a legal status.
   - Faith is understood as personal trust, not assent to propositions.
   - The event of justification is existential, involving the whole person.
   - Rejects a purely external or transactional view of salvation.
   - "Faith is not assent to a doctrine, but trust in the living God." (The Mediator)

2. **Critique of Forensic Imputation**
   - Challenges the notion of a purely forensic or external imputation of righteousness.
   - Argues that justification involves a real transformation, not just a change in status.
   - Sees the legal metaphor as insufficient to capture the depth of reconciliation.
   - Emphasizes the ethical and relational dimensions of being made right with God.
   - "The legalistic conception of justification is inadequate for expressing the reality of salvation." (Dogmatics II)

3. **Christocentric Ground of Justification**
   - Centers justification in the person and work of Christ as the Mediator.
   - The righteousness of Christ is not transferred mechanically but shared through union with Him.
   - The cross is the decisive act of reconciliation, not merely a legal transaction.
   - Participation in Christ is essential for understanding justification.
   - "It is in Christ alone that man is justified before God." (The Mediator)

4. **Faith as the Means, Not the Cause**
   - Faith is the means by which justification is received, not its cause or ground.
   - Rejects any notion of faith as a meritorious work.
   - Faith is itself a gift of grace, arising from the encounter with God’s Word.
   - The act of faith is inseparable from the presence of Christ.
   - "Faith is the hand that receives, not the work that earns." (Dogmatics II)

5. **Engagement with Contemporary Critiques (including NPP)**
   - Recognizes the historical and relational context of Paul’s doctrine of justification.
   - Open to re-examining traditional categories in light of biblical scholarship.
   - Affirms the need to move beyond individualistic and purely legal readings.
   - Welcomes dialogue with perspectives that stress the covenantal and communal aspects of justification.
   - "The doctrine of justification must be continually re-examined in the light of Scripture and the living reality of faith." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **justification** influenced 20th-century theology by challenging the dominance of purely forensic and imputation-based models. His existential and relational emphasis anticipated later discussions, including some concerns raised by the **New Perspective on Paul**. While his views were controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, Brunner’s work contributed to a broader understanding of justification as both a divine act and a transformative relationship. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of salvation and the meaning of faith.
