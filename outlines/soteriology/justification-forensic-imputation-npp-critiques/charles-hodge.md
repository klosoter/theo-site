# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a staunch defender of the **forensic nature of justification**, emphasizing the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** to the believer as the sole ground of acceptance before God. He rejected any notion that justification involves an infusion of righteousness or is based on works, and he critiqued emerging challenges to the classic **Reformed doctrine**, anticipating later debates such as those raised by the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**.

- "Justification is a judicial act of God, by which he pardons all the sins of those who believe in Christ, and accounts, accepts, and treats them as righteous in the eye of the law." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially chapters on justification)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on justification and imputation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is Forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not a moral transformation.
    - God acts as judge, declaring the sinner righteous based on Christ’s work.
    - The believer’s status changes before God, but not their internal nature.
    - This act is distinct from sanctification, which involves internal renewal.
    - "The word justify never means to make good in a moral sense, but always to declare just." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is credited to the believer.
    - Imputation is the only ground for acceptance before God.
    - The righteousness imputed is external, not inherent in the believer.
    - This preserves the integrity of **sola fide** (faith alone).
    - "The righteousness of Christ is the ground of our justification, and is imputed to us as our own." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Faith as the Sole Instrument**
    - Faith alone receives the gift of justification.
    - Faith is not meritorious; it is simply the means of union with Christ.
    - Works play no role in the ground or instrumentality of justification.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s work, not in subjective experience.
    - "Faith is not the ground of justification, but the instrument by which we receive Christ and his righteousness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Rejection of Infused Righteousness**
    - Justification does not involve the infusion of moral virtue.
    - Roman Catholic teaching on infused righteousness is fundamentally flawed.
    - The distinction between justification and sanctification must be maintained.
    - Any confusion of the two undermines the gospel of grace.
    - "The Romanists confound justification with sanctification, and make it a subjective change." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Critique of Revisionist Views (Anticipating NPP)**
    - Any reinterpretation that diminishes the forensic and imputed aspects is rejected.
    - Justification is not about covenant membership or social status, but about legal standing before God.
    - The historic Protestant understanding is rooted in the exegesis of Paul’s epistles.
    - Hodge’s polemics anticipate later critiques of the **New Perspective on Paul**.
    - "The doctrine of justification by faith is the great barrier against all forms of legalism." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of **forensic justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** became a standard for American Reformed theology and a bulwark against both Roman Catholic and later revisionist critiques. His careful distinction between justification and sanctification shaped generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. Hodge’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of justification, especially in response to the **New Perspective on Paul** and other contemporary challenges to the Reformation consensus.
