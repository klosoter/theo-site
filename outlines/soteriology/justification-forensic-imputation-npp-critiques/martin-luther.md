# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **justification** stands at the heart of his theology, emphasizing the **forensic declaration** of righteousness by God on the basis of **Christ’s imputed righteousness** received through **faith alone**. He sharply distinguished between **law and gospel**, rejecting any notion of human merit in justification and laying the groundwork for later Protestant critiques of the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, though the latter arose centuries after his time.

- "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." (Commentary on Romans)

## Key Works

- Commentary on Romans
- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Ninety-Five Theses (1517)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- On Christian Liberty (1520)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is Forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration by God, not a process of moral transformation.
    - The sinner is declared righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s merits.
    - There is a clear distinction between being made righteous (sanctification) and being declared righteous (justification).
    - The believer remains simul iustus et peccator—simultaneously righteous and a sinner.
    - "For God does not want to save us by our own, but by an extraneous righteousness, one that does not originate in ourselves." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Christ’s righteousness is credited (imputed) to the believer by faith.
    - Human works or inherent righteousness play no role in justification.
    - This imputation is total and complete, not partial or progressive.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which imputation is received.
    - "Faith takes hold of Christ and has Him present, enclosing Him as the ring encloses the gem." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Faith Alone (Sola Fide)**
    - Faith is the only means by which justification is received.
    - Faith itself is not a work but trust in God’s promise in Christ.
    - Works are the fruit of faith, not the ground of justification.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in faith in Christ, not in human achievement.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Commentary on Romans)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The law reveals sin and drives sinners to despair of self-righteousness.
    - The gospel proclaims the free promise of forgiveness in Christ.
    - Confusing law and gospel undermines the doctrine of justification.
    - The distinction safeguards the believer’s assurance and the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Critique of Works-Righteousness and Later NPP Concerns**
    - Luther opposed any view that made justification contingent on human obedience or covenantal faithfulness.
    - He insisted that justification is not about inclusion in the covenant community but about God’s verdict on the sinner.
    - Later NPP emphases on first-century Judaism and covenantal nomism stand in tension with Luther’s reading of Paul.
    - For Luther, justification is fundamentally about the individual’s standing before God, not merely about ecclesial identity.
    - "For by faith alone you are made righteous, not by works, not by the law, not by anything else." (On Christian Liberty)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust articulation of **forensic justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** became foundational for the Reformation and subsequent Protestant theology. His sharp law-gospel distinction and insistence on **sola fide** continue to shape debates over Paul, especially in response to the **New Perspective on Paul**. While later scholarship has nuanced or challenged aspects of his exegesis, Luther’s central insights remain pivotal in discussions of justification within both academic and ecclesial contexts.
