# Guy Prentiss Waters (1971– )

Guy Prentiss Waters is a leading Reformed scholar who has critically engaged the doctrine of **justification** in light of contemporary debates, especially the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**. He strongly defends the **forensic** and **imputational** character of justification as articulated in the **Reformed confessions**, arguing that the NPP undermines the biblical and confessional understanding of the doctrine.

- "The New Perspective on Paul, in its various forms, represents a significant departure from the classic Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone." ("Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul")

## Key Works

- Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul: A Review and Response (2004)
- The End of Deuteronomy in the Epistles of Paul (2006)
- "The Doctrine of Justification in Paul and in the Confessions" (in Justified in Christ, ed. K. Scott Oliphint, 2007)
- How Jesus Runs the Church (2011) [for ecclesiological context]
- "Justification" entry in Reformation Study Bible (2015)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic, not transformative**
    - Justification is a legal declaration by God, not an infusion of righteousness.
    - The believer is declared righteous on the basis of Christ’s work, not made inherently righteous.
    - This distinction preserves the integrity of **sola fide**.
    - The NPP blurs the line between justification and sanctification.
    - "Paul’s doctrine of justification is fundamentally forensic, not transformative." (Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness is essential**
    - The righteousness of Christ is credited to the believer by faith.
    - Imputation is central to the Reformed understanding of justification.
    - Waters sees the denial of imputation in the NPP as a serious doctrinal error.
    - He upholds the confessional standards of the Westminster Confession.
    - "Imputation is not an optional extra, but the very heart of the biblical doctrine of justification." (Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul)

3. **Faith alone is the sole instrument of justification**
    - Faith is the exclusive means by which justification is received.
    - Works play no role in the ground or instrumentality of justification.
    - The NPP’s emphasis on covenantal nomism is seen as a threat to **sola fide**.
    - Waters insists on the Reformation’s distinction between faith and works.
    - "Paul’s teaching is clear: justification is by faith alone, apart from works of the law." (Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul)

4. **Critical of the New Perspective on Paul**
    - Waters argues that the NPP misreads Second Temple Judaism and Paul.
    - He contends that the NPP minimizes the seriousness of sin and the need for grace.
    - The NPP’s redefinition of justification as ‘covenant membership’ is inadequate.
    - He maintains that the classic Reformed view better fits the biblical data.
    - "The New Perspective’s redefinition of justification cannot be reconciled with Paul’s teaching or the Reformed confessions." (Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul)

5. **Confessional fidelity to Reformed standards**
    - Waters grounds his theology in the Westminster Standards.
    - He sees confessional boundaries as safeguards for doctrinal integrity.
    - The historic Reformed confessions articulate the biblical doctrine of justification.
    - He warns against revisionist readings that depart from these standards.
    - "The Westminster Confession’s teaching on justification remains the most faithful summary of Paul’s doctrine." (Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul)

## Legacy and Impact

Guy Prentiss Waters has become a prominent defender of the **Reformed doctrine of justification** in the face of contemporary challenges, particularly from the New Perspective on Paul. His work has shaped evangelical and Reformed responses to the NPP, reinforcing the importance of **forensic justification** and **imputation**. Waters’s scholarship is widely cited in debates over Pauline theology and confessional fidelity, making him a key voice in current discussions on justification within the Reformed tradition.
