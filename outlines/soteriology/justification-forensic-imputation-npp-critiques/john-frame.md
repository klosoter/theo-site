# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **forensic** nature of **justification** as a legal declaration of righteousness based on the **imputed righteousness of Christ**. He critically engages with the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, defending the traditional Reformed understanding while acknowledging the need for careful exegesis and theological clarity.

- "Justification is a judicial act of God, declaring sinners righteous on the basis of Christ’s righteousness imputed to them." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "N. T. Wright and the New Perspective on Paul" (online essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - God declares sinners righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s work.
    - The verdict is external to the believer, rooted in God’s judicial action.
    - This aligns with classic Reformed confessions and counters Roman Catholic views.
    - "Justification is not a change in our moral character, but a change in our legal status before God." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is credited to believers.
    - Imputation is essential for maintaining the gospel’s gracious character.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which believers receive this righteousness.
    - Frame rejects any notion that our works contribute to our justification.
    - "God imputes Christ’s righteousness to us, so that we are accepted as righteous in his sight." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Critical engagement with the New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
    - Frame recognizes some exegetical insights from NPP but maintains Reformed distinctives.
    - He critiques NPP for downplaying individual sin and the need for imputed righteousness.
    - The NPP’s focus on covenant membership cannot replace the forensic aspect of justification.
    - Frame warns against redefining justification in sociological or ecclesial terms.
    - "The New Perspective tends to obscure the heart of the gospel: justification by faith alone." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Faith alone as the instrument of justification**
    - Faith is not meritorious but receives Christ and his benefits.
    - Justification is by faith apart from works of the law.
    - Frame emphasizes the necessity of distinguishing justification from sanctification.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in personal performance.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, not because faith is a work, but because it unites us to Christ." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

5. **Trinitarian and covenantal context**
    - Justification is the work of the Triune God: Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The covenant of grace provides the framework for understanding justification.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s righteousness to believers within the covenant community.
    - Frame integrates justification into his broader triperspectival theology.
    - "Justification is a covenantal blessing, accomplished by Christ and applied by the Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s defense of **forensic justification** and **imputation** has reinforced the classic Reformed position in contemporary evangelical theology. His careful engagement with the **New Perspective on Paul** has provided clarity for students and pastors navigating recent debates. Frame’s triperspectival approach and emphasis on the covenantal context have enriched discussions on justification, ensuring its centrality in systematic theology and the life of the church.
