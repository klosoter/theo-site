# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading voice in contemporary Reformed theology, particularly known for his robust defense of **forensic justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**. Gaffin has critically engaged the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, arguing that it undermines the classic Reformed understanding of justification as a judicial act grounded in union with Christ and received by faith alone.

- "Justification is a once-for-all declarative act, not a process, and is grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards: Reaffirming Old Paths"
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (article)
- Contributions to "Justification and Variegated Nomism" (as respondent)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is forensic**
    - Justification is a legal declaration by God, not a transformative process.
    - It is distinct from **sanctification** and based solely on Christ’s work.
    - The believer’s status is changed before God’s law court.
    - This declaration is definitive and unrepeatable.
    - "Justification is not a process but a once-for-all verdict." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is credited to believers.
    - Imputation is essential for maintaining the gospel’s integrity.
    - The righteousness believers possess is alien, not inherent.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which this righteousness is received.
    - "The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is the heart of justification." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Union with Christ as the context for justification**
    - All benefits of salvation, including justification, flow from union with Christ.
    - Union is both juridical and transformative, but justification remains forensic.
    - Justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct in union with Christ.
    - The ordo salutis must be understood in light of union, not as a sequence of separate acts.
    - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality in Paul." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

4. **Critique of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
    - NPP redefines justification as ecclesiological boundary-marking, not a forensic act.
    - Gaffin argues NPP minimizes the problem of sin and the need for imputed righteousness.
    - He maintains that Paul’s doctrine is fundamentally about God’s verdict on the sinner.
    - NPP’s reading of Second Temple Judaism is historically and exegetically flawed.
    - "The New Perspective fails to do justice to Paul’s teaching on justification as a judicial act." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Faith alone as the instrument of justification**
    - Faith is not meritorious but receives Christ and his righteousness.
    - Works play no role in the ground or instrumentality of justification.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in the believer’s performance.
    - Any addition to faith undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "Faith justifies because it unites us to Christ, not because of anything in faith itself." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **justification**, especially in response to the challenges posed by the New Perspective on Paul. His emphasis on **union with Christ** as the framework for understanding justification has influenced both academic and pastoral theology. Gaffin’s careful exegesis and defense of the classic Reformed doctrine continue to serve as a bulwark against doctrinal revisionism, ensuring that the forensic and imputed character of justification remains central in Reformed soteriology.
