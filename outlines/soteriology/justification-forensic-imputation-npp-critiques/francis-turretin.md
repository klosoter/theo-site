# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading Reformed scholastic who articulated a robust doctrine of **justification** as a strictly **forensic act**, emphasizing the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** to the believer. He rigorously defended the Protestant position against both Roman Catholic and Socinian objections, and his framework stands in sharp contrast to later developments such as the **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**, which he would have regarded as undermining the external, declarative nature of justification.

- "Justification is not a physical change from unrighteousness to righteousness, but a judicial and forensic act by which the sinner is absolved from guilt and declared righteous." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially vol. 2, topics 16–17
- The Doctrine of Justification (sections within Institutes)
- Selected Questions on the Doctrine of Justification (various disputations)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification is a forensic declaration**
    - Justification is a legal act of God as judge, not an infusion of righteousness.
    - The believer is declared righteous on the basis of Christ’s merits, not made inherently righteous.
    - The distinction between justification and sanctification is essential and must not be confused.
    - The act is completed at once and is not a process.
    - "It is not a quality infused into us, but a relation declared concerning us." (Institutes)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s righteousness**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience are both imputed to the believer.
    - Imputation is the reckoning of Christ’s righteousness as belonging to the justified.
    - The righteousness imputed is alien (extra nos), not inherent in the believer.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which this imputation is received.
    - "The righteousness by which we are justified is not in us, but in Christ." (Institutes)

3. **Faith alone as the instrument of justification**
    - Faith is not the ground or cause, but the means by which justification is received.
    - Works are excluded from the ground of justification, though they are evidences of true faith.
    - Faith itself is not counted as righteousness, but receives Christ’s righteousness.
    - Assurance flows from the objective promise, not from introspection or works.
    - "Faith justifies not by its own worth, but as it apprehends Christ." (Institutes)

4. **Rejection of Roman Catholic and Socinian views**
    - Roman Catholic doctrine confuses justification with sanctification and makes it partly inherent.
    - Socinianism denies the necessity of satisfaction and imputation.
    - Turretin insists on the necessity of Christ’s satisfaction for divine justice.
    - He critiques any view that makes justification a process or dependent on human merit.
    - "We are justified neither by our own works nor by faith as a work, but by Christ alone." (Institutes)

5. **Critique of covenantal or participatory revisions (anticipating NPP)**
    - Justification is not primarily about covenant membership or ecclesial status.
    - The Pauline doctrine centers on the sinner’s standing before God, not merely community inclusion.
    - Any view that reduces justification to ‘being in the covenant’ or ‘faithfulness’ undermines the forensic nature.
    - Turretin’s exegesis of Paul stresses the antithesis between faith and works for justification.
    - "Paul opposes justification by faith to justification by works, not as two species of the same genus, but as things wholly diverse." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of **forensic justification** and the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy and confessional standards. His distinctions and arguments remain central in contemporary debates over justification, especially as responses to the **New Perspective on Paul** and other revisionist trends. Turretin’s clarity on the difference between justification and sanctification continues to shape Reformed systematic theology and pastoral practice.
