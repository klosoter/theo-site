# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann reinterpreted the doctrine of **justification** through the lens of existential theology, challenging traditional **forensic** and **imputation** categories. He argued that **justification** is not a legal declaration but an existential event in which the individual encounters the **kerygma** and is called to authentic faith, distancing himself from both classical Protestant formulations and later **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** critiques.

- "The righteousness of God is not a substance which is imparted to man, but the act of God which sets man in the right relationship to Himself." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Existential Encounter**
   - Justification is not a forensic transaction but an existential event.
   - The individual is confronted by the **kerygma** and called to authentic decision.
   - Faith is a response to God's act, not a possession or status.
   - The transformation is inward, not a legal change in status before God.
   - "Justification is the eschatological event in which man is called out of himself into authentic existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Imputation**
   - Bultmann denies the traditional Reformation view of imputed righteousness.
   - He sees **imputation** as a mythological concept incompatible with existential understanding.
   - Righteousness is not transferred but realized in the believer's new existence.
   - The focus is on relational transformation, not legal standing.
   - "The idea of imputed righteousness is foreign to Paul’s real intention." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Demythologization of Pauline Doctrine**
   - Bultmann seeks to demythologize New Testament language, including justification.
   - He interprets Pauline categories existentially, not metaphysically.
   - The language of justification is a mythological expression of the existential encounter.
   - The true meaning is found in the call to faith, not in legal metaphors.
   - "The Pauline doctrine of justification must be understood in existential terms." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Traditional Protestant Orthodoxy**
   - Bultmann critiques both Catholic and Protestant forensic models as outdated.
   - He argues that these models rely on obsolete metaphysical frameworks.
   - The existential approach transcends the legalistic debates of the Reformation.
   - Authentic faith is not assent to doctrine but existential trust in God’s act.
   - "The Reformation doctrine of justification by faith is itself in need of demythologization." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Engagement with NPP Critiques**
   - Bultmann anticipated some concerns of the **New Perspective on Paul** by rejecting individualistic legalism.
   - He emphasized the communal and existential dimensions of Pauline thought.
   - However, he did not share the NPP’s focus on covenantal nomism or Second Temple Judaism.
   - His existential interpretation stands apart from both traditional and NPP readings.
   - "Paul’s concern is not with legal status but with the new existence in Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **justification** profoundly influenced twentieth-century theology, shifting the discussion from forensic categories to existential encounter. His work paved the way for later debates about the meaning of **imputation** and the relevance of traditional doctrinal formulations. While often criticized by both confessional Protestants and proponents of the **New Perspective on Paul**, Bultmann’s demythologizing project remains a pivotal reference point in modern discussions of Pauline theology. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the existential and relational dimensions of justification.
