# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich reinterpreted **justification** within his existential and ontological framework, moving away from a strictly **forensic** or legal understanding. He emphasized **justification by grace** as the acceptance of the **estranged** by the **ground of being**, critiquing traditional **imputation** and engaging with the existential dimensions that later resonated with some **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** concerns.

- "Justification is the acceptance of the unacceptable." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2
- The Protestant Era
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- Dynamics of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification as Existential Acceptance**
    - Views justification as the divine acceptance of the estranged, not a legal declaration.
    - Emphasizes the existential transformation of the person before God.
    - Sees justification as the answer to the anxiety of guilt and meaninglessness.
    - Links justification to the experience of being accepted despite unacceptability.
    - "Justification is the acceptance of the unacceptable."

2. **Critique of Forensic Categories**
    - Argues that legalistic, forensic models are inadequate for modern existential concerns.
    - Sees the forensic model as a historical construct, not essential to the gospel.
    - Prefers ontological and relational categories over juridical ones.
    - Suggests that the legal metaphor can obscure the depth of human estrangement.
    - "The legalistic distortion of justification must be overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Imputation as External**
    - Criticizes the doctrine of **imputed righteousness** as external and alienating.
    - Emphasizes participation in the **New Being** rather than a transfer of merit.
    - Sees imputation as a symbol for the transformative power of grace, not a forensic transaction.
    - Argues that justification involves an ontological change, not merely a change in status.
    - "Imputation is a symbol for the participation in the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Justification and Sanctification United**
    - Rejects a sharp distinction between justification and sanctification.
    - Argues that both are aspects of the same existential event.
    - Sees transformation and acceptance as inseparable in the experience of grace.
    - Critiques Protestant orthodoxy for dividing what should be united.
    - "Justification and sanctification are two sides of the same event." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Engagement with Pauline Scholarship and NPP Themes**
    - Anticipates some concerns of the **New Perspective on Paul** by emphasizing relational and participatory elements.
    - Focuses on the existential meaning of Paul's doctrine rather than its historical context.
    - Critiques traditional readings that prioritize individual guilt over communal estrangement.
    - Sees Paul's message as fundamentally about reconciliation and new being, not legal status.
    - "Paul’s doctrine of justification is the message of the New Being in Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **justification** challenged traditional **Reformed** and **Lutheran** categories, influencing later theological and philosophical discussions about the meaning of grace and acceptance. His critique of **forensic** and **imputation** models anticipated some of the relational emphases found in the **New Perspective on Paul**. While his approach was often seen as a departure from classical orthodoxy, Tillich’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of existentialism and Christian doctrine. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relevance of traditional categories in contemporary theology.
