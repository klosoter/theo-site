# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson emphasizes **union with Christ** as the central reality of the believer’s salvation, integrating it with the whole of **Reformed soteriology**. He teaches that all the benefits of redemption—including **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**—flow from this vital, Spirit-wrought union, making it foundational for understanding the Christian life.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Fountainhead of Salvation**
    - All aspects of salvation are rooted in the believer’s union with Christ.
    - This union is established by the **Holy Spirit** and is both legal and vital.
    - Justification, sanctification, and adoption are distinct yet inseparable benefits flowing from union.
    - The believer’s identity and assurance are grounded in this union.
    - "All that Christ has done for us is of no value to us so long as we remain outside of Christ." ("The Christian Life")

2. **Spirit-Wrought and Trinitarian Nature**
    - Union with Christ is effected by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
    - The work of the Father, Son, and Spirit is coordinated in uniting believers to Christ.
    - The Spirit applies the finished work of Christ to the elect.
    - This union is both mystical and covenantal, not merely moral or imitative.
    - "The Spirit unites us to Christ and makes us partakers of all his benefits." ("The Christian Life")

3. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions**
    - Union with Christ is an objective reality accomplished by God.
    - It is also experienced subjectively as believers grow in faith and obedience.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are fruits of this union.
    - The believer’s experience is rooted in the unchanging work of Christ.
    - "Our experience of Christ is grounded in the reality of our union with him." ("The Christian Life")

4. **Union as the Context for Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is not a separate gift but flows directly from union with Christ.
    - The believer’s holiness is the result of participation in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.
    - Growth in grace is inseparable from the ongoing reality of union.
    - The mortification of sin and vivification are enabled by this union.
    - "Sanctification is the outworking of what it means to be united to Christ." ("The Christian Life")

5. **Pastoral and Practical Significance**
    - Union with Christ is essential for assurance and spiritual vitality.
    - It shapes the believer’s self-understanding and motivation for obedience.
    - Pastoral ministry must continually point believers to their identity in Christ.
    - The doctrine guards against both legalism and antinomianism.
    - "The key to Christian living is knowing who you are in Christ." ("In Christ Alone")
