# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of **union with Christ** is foundational for Western theology, emphasizing the believer’s participation in Christ through the **incarnation**, **grace**, and the **sacraments**. He frames union as both mystical and ethical, rooted in the **body of Christ** and realized through the work of the **Holy Spirit** in the context of the **church**.

- "No one is a member of Christ except it be by being in Christ." (Sermon 267)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Sermons (especially Sermons 227, 272, 267)
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union is grounded in the Incarnation**
    - Christ’s assumption of human nature enables true union between God and humanity.
    - The **incarnation** is the ontological basis for believers’ participation in Christ.
    - Through Christ’s humanity, believers are joined to his divinity.
    - The church as Christ’s body is possible only because of the incarnate Christ.
    - "He became what we are, that we might become what he is." (Sermon 192)

2. **Union is effected by grace**
    - Human beings are incapable of union with Christ apart from **divine grace**.
    - Grace is both prevenient and sustaining in the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Faith itself is a gift that unites the believer to Christ.
    - Grace transforms the will, enabling participation in Christ’s life.
    - "For what have you that you did not receive?" (1 Corinthians 4:7, cited in On the Spirit and the Letter)

3. **The Holy Spirit as the bond of union**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the personal bond uniting believers to Christ.
    - The Spirit indwells believers, making them members of Christ’s body.
    - Spiritual gifts and virtues flow from this union.
    - The Spirit’s work is both individual and corporate within the church.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the soul of the body of Christ." (Sermon 267)

4. **Sacramental mediation of union**
    - **Baptism** initiates union with Christ by incorporating believers into his body.
    - The **Eucharist** nourishes and deepens this union through participation in Christ’s body and blood.
    - Sacraments are visible signs effecting invisible grace.
    - Participation in the sacraments is essential for abiding in Christ.
    - "If you receive worthily, you are what you have received." (Sermon 272)

5. **Ethical and ecclesial dimensions**
    - Union with Christ entails transformation into Christlikeness.
    - The church is the visible community of those united to Christ.
    - Love (caritas) is the chief evidence of union with Christ.
    - Unity among believers reflects and strengthens their union with Christ.
    - "Let us rejoice and give thanks: we have become not only Christians, but Christ himself." (Sermon 272)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology of **union with Christ** profoundly shaped Western understandings of salvation, the church, and the sacraments. His integration of **incarnation**, **grace**, and the **Holy Spirit** as the means of union influenced medieval, Reformation, and modern theology. Later theologians, especially in the Augustinian and Reformed traditions, drew on his insights to articulate doctrines of participation, sanctification, and ecclesiology. Augustine’s vision of the church as the body of Christ remains a central reference point in ecumenical and systematic theology.
