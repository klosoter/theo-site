# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approaches **union with Christ** primarily through the framework of **participation in Christ’s humanity and divinity**, mediated by the **sacraments** and grounded in the **grace** that unites believers to God. For Aquinas, this union is both **ontological** and **mystical**, rooted in the believer’s incorporation into Christ as the head of the **Mystical Body** and realized especially through the **Eucharist**.

- "Now the head and members are as one mystical person; and therefore Christ's satisfaction belongs to all the faithful as being His members." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 48, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, qq. 1–59 (on Christ), qq. 60–90 (on the sacraments)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (on salvation and union with God)
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV
- "On the Perfection of the Spiritual Life"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as Participation in Divine Life**
    - Believers are united to Christ by **grace**, which is a participation in the divine nature.
    - This union is not merely moral or legal but **ontological**, affecting the very being of the believer.
    - The union is initiated by God and perfected in the beatific vision.
    - Christ, as the mediator, makes this participation possible through his incarnation.
    - "By the gift of grace man is made a partaker of the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 112, a. 1)

2. **The Mystical Body of Christ**
    - The Church is the **Mystical Body**, with Christ as its head and believers as members.
    - Union with Christ is realized corporately as well as individually.
    - The unity of the body is maintained by the Holy Spirit.
    - The merits and satisfaction of Christ are communicated to all members.
    - "Christ is the Head of the Church... and from Him the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined together, receives increase." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 1)

3. **Sacramental Mediation of Union**
    - The **sacraments**, especially **Baptism** and the **Eucharist**, are the primary means of union with Christ.
    - Baptism incorporates believers into Christ’s body.
    - The Eucharist effects a real, though spiritual, union with Christ’s humanity and divinity.
    - Sacramental grace is the instrument by which Christ unites himself to the faithful.
    - "The effect of the sacrament of the Eucharist is the union of the recipient with Christ." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 79, a. 1)

4. **Grace as the Principle of Union**
    - **Sanctifying grace** is the created participation in the divine life that unites the soul to Christ.
    - Actual grace enables the believer to act in union with Christ.
    - Grace is both a healing and elevating principle, restoring and perfecting nature.
    - The indwelling of the Trinity is the highest form of union, made possible by grace.
    - "Grace is nothing else than a certain participation of the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 110, a. 1)

5. **Christ’s Humanity as the Instrument of Union**
    - The humanity of Christ is the instrument by which divine life is communicated to believers.
    - The hypostatic union makes Christ the unique mediator of union with God.
    - Through Christ’s passion and resurrection, believers are mystically united to his saving work.
    - The union is both present (by grace) and future (in glory).
    - "The humanity of Christ is as the instrument of His divinity, by which grace is conferred on us." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **union with Christ** has profoundly shaped both Catholic and broader Christian understandings of **participation**, sacramental theology, and the mystical life. His synthesis of **grace**, **sacramental mediation**, and the **Mystical Body** remains foundational for later scholastic and modern theological reflection. Aquinas’s careful distinction between ontological and moral union continues to inform ecumenical dialogues and contemporary discussions of salvation and sanctification.
