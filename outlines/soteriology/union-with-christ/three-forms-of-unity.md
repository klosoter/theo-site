# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—present **union with Christ** as the foundation of salvation, teaching that all the benefits of redemption are received through this vital connection. This union, established by the **Holy Spirit** and received by **faith**, is central to the believer’s experience of **justification**, **sanctification**, and **perseverance**. The confessions consistently teach that outside of Christ, there is no salvation or participation in spiritual blessings.

- "What benefit do you receive from the holy conception and birth of Christ? That He is our Mediator, and with His innocence and perfect holiness covers, in the sight of God, my sin, wherein I was conceived." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 36)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 20, 30, 56, 76, 79
- The Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 22, 23, 24, 35
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads II and III/IV
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism*
- Cornelis P. Venema, *Accepted and Renewed in Christ: The "Twofold Grace of God" and the Interpretation of Calvin’s Theology*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Source of Salvation**
    - All benefits of redemption flow from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - This union is established by the **Holy Spirit** and received by **faith**.
    - **Justification**, **sanctification**, and adoption are inseparable from union with Christ.
    - The confessions stress that outside of Christ, there is no salvation.
    "We believe that, to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery, the Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces Jesus Christ, with all His merits, makes Him our own, and does not seek anything besides Him." (Belgic Confession, Article 22)

2. **Faith as the Instrument of Union**
    - Faith is the means by which believers are united to Christ.
    - This faith is itself a gift of God, not a human achievement.
    - Faith unites believers to Christ’s person and work, not merely to His benefits.
    - Assurance and comfort are grounded in this living union.
    "True faith is not only a certain knowledge... but also a hearty trust, which the Holy Ghost works in me by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 21)

3. **Participation in Christ’s Benefits**
    - Through union, believers share in Christ’s righteousness, holiness, and life.
    - The sacraments, especially the Lord’s Supper, signify and seal this participation.
    - The confessions emphasize the double grace: **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - Believers are made partakers of Christ’s anointing and offices.
    "He is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption." (Belgic Confession, Article 22)

4. **Sacramental Communion and Union**
    - The sacraments are means by which union with Christ is confirmed and nourished.
    - The Lord’s Supper is a true communion with Christ’s body and blood, spiritually received by faith.
    - Baptism signifies incorporation into Christ and His covenant community.
    - Sacramental efficacy depends on the Spirit’s work, not on the elements themselves.
    "As certainly as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me... so certainly is His body offered and broken for me and His blood shed for me." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 75)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance in Union**
    - Union with Christ guarantees the perseverance of the saints.
    - Assurance is rooted in Christ’s finished work and the Spirit’s testimony.
    - The confessions reject any notion that union can be lost by the elect.
    - Comfort in life and death is grounded in belonging to Christ.
    "Because Christ, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time... unto salvation." (Canons of Dort, V.9)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the Reformed understanding of **union with Christ** as central to the ordo salutis. Their teaching has influenced Reformed confessional identity, liturgy, and pastoral practice, especially in the Dutch Reformed tradition. By grounding assurance, sacramental theology, and perseverance in union with Christ, these confessions continue to provide a rich theological framework for Reformed churches worldwide. Their emphasis on the inseparability of justification and sanctification in union with Christ remains a hallmark of confessional Reformed theology.
