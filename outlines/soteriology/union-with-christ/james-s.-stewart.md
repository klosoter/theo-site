# James S. Stewart (1896–1990)

James S. Stewart emphasized **union with Christ** as the central reality of the Christian life, shaping both **justification** and **sanctification**. He viewed this union as a dynamic, participatory relationship, grounded in the believer’s incorporation into the **death and resurrection of Christ**. Stewart’s approach is deeply pastoral, highlighting the transformative power of Christ’s presence in the believer.

    - This participation means sharing in both Christ’s sufferings and victory.
    - The resurrection power is operative in the believer’s daily life.
