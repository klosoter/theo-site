# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **union with Christ** through the lens of **existential interpretation** and **demythologization**, emphasizing the believer’s encounter with the **kerygma** rather than mystical or ontological participation. For Bultmann, union with Christ is realized existentially in faith, as the individual is confronted by the **Word of God** and called into authentic existence through **justification** and **new life**.

- "To be in Christ does not mean to be incorporated into a quasi-physical organism, but to be set in a new situation by the event of Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Union with Christ**
    - Interprets traditional language of union as mythological, requiring existential reinterpretation.
    - Rejects ontological or mystical understandings in favor of existential significance.
    - Sees "in Christ" as a metaphor for a new mode of existence.
    - Focuses on the proclamation (kerygma) as the means by which union is effected.
    - "The mythological conception of union with Christ must be translated into existential terms." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter through the Kerygma**
    - Union with Christ occurs as the individual hears and responds to the kerygma.
    - Emphasizes personal decision and authentic existence over sacramental or institutional mediation.
    - Faith is the existential act that unites the believer to Christ.
    - The event of Christ is actualized in the present encounter with the Word.
    - "Faith is the act in which man gives up every security and basis for life other than the Word of God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Justification as Existential Transformation**
    - Justification is not a legal or forensic change but an existential reorientation.
    - The believer is set free from self-reliance and opened to authentic existence.
    - Union with Christ means living in the freedom of forgiveness and new life.
    - The old self is put to death and the new self is raised in faith.
    - "Justification is the eschatological event in which man is set free for authentic existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Mystical or Sacramental Union**
    - Denies any mystical fusion or ontological participation in Christ.
    - Sacraments are interpreted as symbolic acts that point to existential realities.
    - The reality of union is not mediated through ritual but through proclamation and faith.
    - The church is the community of those who respond in faith, not a mystical body.
    - "The sacraments have meaning only as expressions of faith, not as vehicles of mystical union." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Union**
    - Union with Christ is oriented toward the eschatological future.
    - The believer participates in the new age inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.
    - The present experience of union is provisional, marked by tension between old and new.
    - Full realization of union awaits the consummation of history.
    - "The believer lives in the tension between the already and the not yet of salvation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential interpretation of **union with Christ** profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, especially in its move away from ontological and mystical categories. His emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential encounter with the kerygma challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran understandings, sparking ongoing debate about the meaning of participation in Christ. While controversial, his approach forced theologians to grapple with the existential dimensions of faith and the significance of biblical language in the modern world.
