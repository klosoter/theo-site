# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos placed **union with Christ** at the center of **Reformed soteriology**, viewing it as the foundation for all other benefits of salvation within the unfolding of **redemptive history**. For Vos, union with Christ is both the source and context for **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**, and is realized through the work of the **Holy Spirit** in applying redemption to believers.

- "The application of redemption in all its stages is rooted in union with Christ." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Soteriology")

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Soteriology"
- "The Pauline Eschatology"
- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church"
- "The Eschatology of the Old Testament" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Center of Soteriology**
    - Union with Christ is the organizing principle for all soteriological benefits.
    - All aspects of salvation—**justification**, **sanctification**, and **glorification**—flow from this union.
    - This union is both legal (forensic) and vital (transformative).
    - Believers participate in Christ’s redemptive work through this union.
    "The center of Paul’s teaching is not justification by faith, but union with Christ." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

2. **Redemptive-Historical Realization of Union**
    - Union with Christ is grounded in the objective accomplishment of redemption in history.
    - Believers’ union is a participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Vos emphasizes the eschatological dimension: union anticipates final consummation.
    - The application of redemption is inseparable from its historical accomplishment.
    "The mystical union is not an abstract relation, but is rooted in the historical Christ-event." ("Biblical Theology")

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Union**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who unites believers to Christ.
    - This union is effected through the Spirit’s indwelling and regenerative work.
    - The Spirit mediates all the benefits of Christ to the believer.
    - **Pneumatology** is inseparable from the doctrine of union in Vos’s theology.
    "The Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and His people." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4")

4. **Covenantal Structure of Union**
    - Union with Christ is covenantal, rooted in the **covenant of grace**.
    - The covenant provides the legal and relational framework for union.
    - Vos connects union with the corporate nature of the people of God.
    - The covenantal context ensures both individual and communal dimensions of union.
    "The covenant is the sphere in which union with Christ is realized." ("Biblical Theology")

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Union**
    - Union with Christ is oriented toward eschatological fulfillment.
    - Present union is a foretaste of the believer’s future glorification.
    - Vos links union with participation in the new creation.
    - The already/not yet tension is central to his understanding of union.
    "Union with Christ is the root from which eschatological life springs." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust doctrine of **union with Christ** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, emphasizing the organic unity of salvation in Christ. His **redemptive-historical** approach provided a framework for later theologians to integrate soteriology and eschatology. Vos’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on the application of redemption and the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s life. His work remains foundational for understanding the centrality of union with Christ in Reformed theology.
