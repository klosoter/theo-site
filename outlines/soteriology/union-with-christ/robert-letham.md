# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham emphasizes **union with Christ** as the central reality of the Christian life, integrating it with the doctrines of **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**. He situates union with Christ within the broader context of **Trinitarian theology** and the **covenant of grace**, arguing that all benefits of salvation flow from this vital, Spirit-wrought union.

- "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Union with Christ, p. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its retrieval of classic covenantal and Trinitarian categories. His work has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions, encouraging a more integrated approach to **soteriology** and the Christian life. By rooting union with Christ in the **Trinity** and the **covenant of grace**, Letham has provided a framework that bridges biblical, historical, and systematic theology.
