# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **union with Christ** through the lens of **religious experience** and **God-consciousness**, rather than traditional Reformed categories. For Schleiermacher, union with Christ is fundamentally the participation in Christ’s unique and perfect **God-consciousness**, which is communicated to the community of believers through the life of the church.

- "The Redeemer is, for us, the Mediator of the new relationship to God, because He has communicated to us His own God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union as Participation in Christ’s God-Consciousness**
    - Union with Christ is not a metaphysical or forensic union but a sharing in Christ’s unique God-consciousness.
    - Christ’s God-consciousness is the archetype and source for all Christian piety.
    - Believers participate in this consciousness through the influence of Christ upon the community.
    - The church mediates this union as the sphere where Christ’s God-consciousness is realized.
    - "The Redeemer is, for us, the Mediator of the new relationship to God, because He has communicated to us His own God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - The essence of faith is the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Union with Christ is experienced inwardly rather than defined by external rites or doctrines.
    - This experience is foundational for all Christian doctrine and life.
    - The subjective appropriation of Christ’s God-consciousness is central to salvation.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ as the Archetype of Humanity**
    - Christ is the perfect realization of God-consciousness in human form.
    - Union with Christ means being conformed to this archetype within the community.
    - The historical person of Jesus is essential as the original bearer of this consciousness.
    - Believers are united to Christ by being drawn into his mode of existence.
    - "In Him the divine has become personal and historical." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Mediation through the Church**
    - The church is the living context where union with Christ is actualized.
    - The community is the bearer and transmitter of Christ’s God-consciousness.
    - Sacraments and preaching are means by which this union is fostered.
    - The church is not merely an institution but the ongoing presence of Christ in history.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence is mediated to us only through the fellowship of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Dynamic and Ethical Implications**
    - Union with Christ leads to ethical transformation and new life.
    - The believer’s moral renewal is grounded in participation in Christ’s God-consciousness.
    - Ethical living is the fruit and evidence of true union.
    - The Spirit works within the community to actualize this union in daily life.
    - "The Spirit of Christ is the principle of the new life in the Church and in the individual." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **union with Christ** shifted the discussion from metaphysical and forensic categories to the realm of **religious experience** and **God-consciousness**. His approach profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in the development of liberal and experiential strands. While his views diverged from classical Reformed emphases, they opened new avenues for understanding the communal and existential dimensions of union with Christ. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions on the nature of faith, the church, and the person of Christ.
