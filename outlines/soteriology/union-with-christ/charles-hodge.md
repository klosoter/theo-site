# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge emphasized **union with Christ** as a central reality of the Christian life, grounding it in the believer’s participation in Christ through **regeneration**, **justification**, and **sanctification**. He viewed this union as both **legal** and **vital**, rooted in the work of the Holy Spirit and mediated by faith, while maintaining a clear distinction between the person of Christ and the believer.

- "The Scriptures teach that we are in Christ by faith, and that this union is the source of all our spiritual life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Spiritual and Mystical**
   - The union is effected by the **Holy Spirit**, not by any physical or essential merging.
   - It is described as a **mystical union**, transcending mere moral or legal association.
   - This union is real but does not obliterate the distinction between Christ and the believer.
   - It is the foundation for all other benefits of redemption.
   - "It is a union of the closest kind, but it is not a fusion of essence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Faith as the Instrument of Union**
   - Faith is the means by which believers are united to Christ.
   - This faith is itself a gift of the Spirit, not a human achievement.
   - Through faith, believers receive all the benefits of Christ’s work.
   - Faith unites the believer to Christ in both his death and resurrection.
   - "Faith is the bond of union between the soul and Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Legal and Vital Aspects of Union**
   - The union has both a **legal** (forensic) and a **vital** (transforming) dimension.
   - Legally, believers are counted righteous in Christ (**justification**).
   - Vitally, believers are made alive and sanctified through Christ’s life.
   - Both aspects are inseparable in the believer’s experience.
   - "Our union with Christ is the ground both of our justification and sanctification." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Union as the Source of All Redemptive Benefits**
   - All saving benefits—**regeneration**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **glorification**—flow from union with Christ.
   - This union is the organizing principle of the ordo salutis.
   - Without union, none of the blessings of salvation are applied to the believer.
   - The believer’s identity and destiny are bound up in this union.
   - "All the benefits of redemption flow from our union with Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions**
   - The union is objectively accomplished by Christ’s work and subjectively realized by the Spirit.
   - It is both a fact established by God and an experience entered into by faith.
   - Assurance and growth in holiness are rooted in this twofold reality.
   - The union is maintained and deepened through the means of grace.
   - "The union is both objective, as it is established by God, and subjective, as it is experienced by the believer." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **union with Christ** shaped the Reformed understanding of the believer’s relationship to Christ, especially within American Presbyterianism. His emphasis on both the legal and vital aspects provided a balanced framework for later theologians. While sometimes critiqued for a perceived scholasticism, his work remains foundational for discussions of **justification**, **sanctification**, and the ordo salutis in the Reformed tradition.
