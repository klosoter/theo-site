# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached **union with Christ** primarily through the lens of **federal theology** and **justification by faith**, emphasizing the believer’s incorporation into Christ as the foundation for all spiritual blessings. He maintained that **imputation**, **regeneration**, and **sanctification** are inseparable benefits flowing from this union, which is established by the Holy Spirit and grounded in Christ’s redemptive work. Warfield’s treatment is marked by a strong commitment to the **objective work of Christ** and the forensic character of salvation.

- "It is in Christ, by being united to Him, that we obtain all that we have or hope for." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Federal and Forensic**
   - Union is rooted in Christ’s role as the **federal head** of the elect.
   - The benefits of salvation are mediated through legal solidarity with Christ.
   - **Justification** is inseparable from union, emphasizing the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
   - The forensic aspect safeguards the objective ground of salvation.
   - "All that Christ has done for us is made ours by the fact that we are in Him." (Biblical Doctrines)

2. **Union is Established by the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit is the agent who unites believers to Christ.
   - This union is effected through **regeneration** and faith.
   - The Spirit’s work ensures the reality and efficacy of the union.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the believer.
   - "It is by the Spirit that we are made one with Christ and so partakers of all that is in Him." (Faith and Life)

3. **Union Grounds All Aspects of Salvation**
   - All saving benefits—**justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**—flow from union.
   - The believer’s new identity and privileges are rooted in this relationship.
   - Union is both the source and the summary of the ordo salutis.
   - The application of redemption is inseparable from union with Christ.
   - "Every element of salvation is bound up with our being in Christ." (The Plan of Salvation)

4. **Faith as the Instrument of Union**
   - Faith is the means by which the believer is united to Christ.
   - This faith is itself a gift of God, wrought by the Spirit.
   - Faith unites the believer to Christ’s person and work, not merely His benefits.
   - The priority of faith maintains the Reformed emphasis on grace.
   - "It is by faith that we are united to Christ and so receive all that is in Him." (Faith and Life)

5. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions of Union**
   - Union with Christ is both a legal (objective) and a vital (subjective) reality.
   - The objective aspect is grounded in Christ’s finished work.
   - The subjective aspect is experienced through the believer’s spiritual life.
   - Both dimensions are necessary for a full account of salvation.
   - "Our union with Christ is at once a fact of grace and a fact of experience." (Biblical Doctrines)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **union with Christ** reinforced the centrality of Christ’s objective work and the forensic character of salvation within the Reformed tradition. His emphasis on the Spirit’s role and the inseparability of the benefits of redemption shaped later discussions of the ordo salutis. Warfield’s careful balance of objective and subjective aspects of union continues to influence systematic theology, particularly in debates over the relationship between justification and sanctification. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the centrality of Christ and the unity of the benefits of salvation.
