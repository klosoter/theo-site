# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **union with Christ** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing its centrality for understanding the believer’s relationship to the **triune God**. He integrated this doctrine with his hallmark emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **covenantal structure** of all reality, arguing that union with Christ grounds both epistemology and redemption. For Van Til, union with Christ is not merely mystical but is the foundation for all **soteriological benefits** and the possibility of true knowledge.

- "All the benefits of redemption are ours only in Christ and through union with him." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as Covenant Reality**
    - Union with Christ is fundamentally covenantal, rooted in God’s sovereign initiative.
    - The covenant relationship structures all of reality, including redemption and knowledge.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification).
    - The believer’s identity is inseparable from participation in Christ’s covenant headship.
    - "The covenant is the relationship of union and communion with God in Christ." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained**
    - Union with Christ does not erase the ontological distinction between God and humanity.
    - Participation in Christ is always analogical, never univocal.
    - The believer’s union is by grace, not by nature.
    - This distinction safeguards against pantheism and preserves the transcendence of God.
    - "We must maintain the absolute distinction between the Creator and the creature even in our highest union with Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Epistemological Implications of Union**
    - True knowledge is possible only through union with Christ, the Logos.
    - Regeneration and union restore the noetic effects of sin.
    - The antithesis between believer and unbeliever is grounded in their respective unions (with Christ or Adam).
    - All reasoning is covenantal and presupposes one’s relationship to Christ.
    - "Only in Christ do we have the restoration of true knowledge of God and the world." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Centrality**
    - Union with Christ is the organizing principle of all redemptive history.
    - Every stage of redemption (from election to glorification) is mediated through union with Christ.
    - The Old Testament types and shadows point forward to this union.
    - The church’s existence and mission are grounded in its union with the risen Lord.
    - "Redemption is accomplished and applied only in union with Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Ethical and Ecclesial Dimensions**
    - Union with Christ entails a new ethical identity and calling.
    - The church is the corporate expression of this union.
    - Sanctification flows from participation in Christ’s life and death.
    - Christian education and apologetics presuppose union with Christ as their foundation.
    - "Our ethical life is possible only as we are united to Christ by faith." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **union with Christ** has profoundly shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, especially in emphasizing the covenantal and epistemological dimensions of salvation. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** within union with Christ has influenced generations of theologians concerned with safeguarding both divine transcendence and immanence. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of covenant theology and in the robust defense of a Christ-centered worldview.
