# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **union with Christ** has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of this doctrine within the Westminster tradition. He emphasizes that all aspects of **salvation**, including **justification** and **sanctification**, are inseparably grounded in the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ, making it the central soteriological reality. Gaffin’s exegesis of **Pauline theology** highlights the eschatological and pneumatological dimensions of union with Christ.

- "By virtue of union with Christ, believers share in all that he has accomplished and now is." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Union with Christ: Some Biblical and Theological Reflections" (in Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Center of Soteriology**
    - Union with Christ is the foundational reality from which all other benefits of redemption flow.
    - Justification, adoption, and sanctification are not separate blessings but are received in union with Christ.
    - The ordo salutis (order of salvation) must be understood in light of this union.
    - This union is both forensic and transformative, encompassing the whole of salvation.
    "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Eschatological Structure of Union**
    - Union with Christ is rooted in Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s participation in his eschatological life.
    - The already/not yet tension shapes the believer’s experience of salvation.
    - Believers are united to the resurrected Christ by the Spirit, sharing in new creation realities.
    - Eschatology is not merely future but is inaugurated in the present through union with Christ.
    "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event for the believer’s new life." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Pneumatological Mediation**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who unites believers to Christ.
    - Union with Christ is effected and sustained by the indwelling Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the benefits of redemption.
    - Pneumatology and Christology are integrally related in the application of salvation.
    "The Spirit is the bond of our union with Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Justification and Sanctification in Union**
    - Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of union with Christ.
    - Both are received simultaneously through faith-union with Christ.
    - There is no temporal or logical priority of justification over sanctification in the believer’s experience.
    - The Reformed ordo salutis must be re-examined in light of this integrated union.
    "Justification and sanctification are both received in union with Christ and cannot be separated." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Gaffin employs a redemptive-historical approach to understanding union with Christ.
    - He grounds systematic theology in careful exegesis of **Pauline texts**.
    - The unity of biblical revelation is essential for articulating the doctrine of union.
    - Theological reflection must be shaped by the unfolding drama of redemption.
    "Paul’s theology is fundamentally a theology of union with Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has been pivotal in recovering **union with Christ** as the organizing principle of Reformed soteriology, influencing both academic theology and pastoral ministry. His integration of **biblical theology** and systematic reflection has shaped generations of Westminster Theological Seminary students and scholars. By emphasizing the eschatological and pneumatological dimensions of union, Gaffin has contributed to a richer and more holistic understanding of salvation in the Reformed tradition. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between justification, sanctification, and the believer’s participation in Christ.
