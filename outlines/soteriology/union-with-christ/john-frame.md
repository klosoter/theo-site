# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **union with Christ** as a central reality of the Christian life, integrating it within his broader **tri-perspectival** framework. He emphasizes that union with Christ encompasses all aspects of **salvation**, including **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**, and insists that this union is both **covenantal** and existential, grounding the believer’s relationship with God in Christ’s person and work.

- "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Foundation of Salvation**
    - Frames all aspects of **soteriology** within the believer’s union with Christ.
    - Argues that **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption** are benefits flowing from this union.
    - Sees union as both a legal and a vital, spiritual reality.
    - Emphasizes that apart from union with Christ, there is no participation in any saving benefit.
    - "All the blessings of salvation flow from our union with Christ." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Tri-Perspectival Integration**
    - Applies his **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives to the doctrine of union.
    - Stresses that union with Christ is grounded in God’s authoritative Word (normative), experienced by the believer (existential), and worked out in life (situational).
    - Uses this framework to show the multidimensionality of union with Christ.
    - Argues that neglecting any perspective leads to a reductionistic view of union.
    - "Union with Christ is a doctrine that must be understood from every perspective God gives us." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Structure of Union**
    - Frames union with Christ within the context of **covenant theology**.
    - Sees Christ as the covenant head, representing and securing the believer’s relationship with God.
    - Emphasizes the objective, legal aspect of union as rooted in the covenant.
    - Connects the believer’s union with Christ to the broader biblical covenants.
    - "Our union with Christ is covenantal, rooted in God’s promises and Christ’s fulfillment." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Existential and Relational Dimensions**
    - Highlights the personal, relational aspect of union with Christ.
    - Stresses the believer’s ongoing communion and fellowship with Christ.
    - Argues that union is not merely a legal status but a living relationship.
    - Connects union with Christ to the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s life.
    - "Union with Christ is not only forensic but also personal and transformative." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Union with Christ and the Means of Grace**
    - Teaches that union with Christ is nourished and expressed through the **means of grace**.
    - Emphasizes the role of **Word**, **sacrament**, and **prayer** in maintaining and deepening union.
    - Argues that the church’s ministry is the context in which believers experience their union with Christ.
    - Connects the sacraments, especially the Lord’s Supper, to the believer’s participation in Christ.
    - "The means of grace are the ways God communicates and sustains our union with Christ." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **union with Christ** has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the doctrine’s centrality in Reformed theology. His tri-perspectival approach has encouraged theologians and pastors to consider the multifaceted nature of union, integrating biblical, theological, and experiential dimensions. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on **soteriology** and the practical outworking of the believer’s relationship with Christ within the church.
