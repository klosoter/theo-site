# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards present **union with Christ** as the vital bond by which believers receive all the benefits of **redemption**. This union is established by the **Holy Spirit** through **faith**, and serves as the foundation for justification, sanctification, and perseverance in the Christian life. The Standards consistently teach that all saving graces are communicated through this spiritual and mystical union.

- "The principal acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace." (Westminster Shorter Catechism Q.86)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 11, 12, 13, 14)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 65–69, 70–73)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 29–32, 86)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Spiritual and Mystical**
   - The union is accomplished by the **Holy Spirit** and is not merely external or legal.
   - It is described as a "mystical union," real but not physical.
   - This union undergirds all other benefits of **salvation**.
   - It is inseparable from the application of **redemption**.
   "They who are effectually called and regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them." (WCF 13.1)

2. **Faith as the Instrumental Means**
   - **Faith** is the means by which believers are united to Christ.
   - Faith itself is a gift of God, wrought by the Spirit.
   - Through faith, believers receive and rest upon Christ alone.
   - This faith unites the believer to Christ in all His offices.
   "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." (WCF 11.2)

3. **Union as the Source of All Saving Benefits**
   - All benefits of **justification**, **adoption**, and **sanctification** flow from union with Christ.
   - The believer’s perseverance and assurance are grounded in this union.
   - The Standards connect every aspect of **salvation** to this vital bond.
   - Union with Christ is the context for understanding the **ordo salutis**.
   "All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption." (WCF 12.1)

4. **Covenantal Context of Union**
   - Union with Christ is realized within the **covenant of grace**.
   - The covenant provides the legal and relational framework for this union.
   - Christ is the Mediator and Head of the covenant people.
   - The promises and obligations of the covenant are fulfilled in union with Him.
   "The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word." (WCF 14.1)

5. **Sanctification and Perseverance Flow from Union**
   - **Sanctification** is the fruit of union with Christ, not its cause.
   - The indwelling of the Spirit ensures growth in holiness.
   - Perseverance is secured by Christ’s continual intercession and presence.
   - Good works are the necessary evidence of this living union.
   "They, whom God hath accepted in His Beloved, effectually called and sanctified by His Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace." (WCF 17.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped the **Reformed doctrine of union with Christ**, making it central to the understanding of salvation’s application. Their careful articulation of the relationship between union, faith, and the benefits of redemption has influenced generations of theologians and confessional documents. The Standards’ emphasis on the covenantal and spiritual nature of this union continues to inform Reformed soteriology and pastoral practice.
