# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray placed **union with Christ** at the very center of his soteriology, insisting that all aspects of **salvation**—including **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**—are grounded in this vital, Spirit-wrought union. He argued that the believer’s participation in Christ is both the source and organizing principle of all redemptive benefits, emphasizing the inseparability of Christ’s person and work from the believer’s experience of salvation.

- "Union with Christ is really the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- "The Nature of Union with Christ" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Organizing Principle of Soteriology**
    - All aspects of **salvation** are rooted in the believer’s union with Christ.
    - **Justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **glorification** are applied through this union.
    - The union is both legal (forensic) and vital (transformative).
    - This union is established by the **Holy Spirit** and is unbreakable.
    "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Union is Spiritual and Mystical, Not Merely Legal**
    - The union is effected by the **Holy Spirit**, not by human effort.
    - It is a real, existential participation in Christ, not a mere metaphor.
    - The mystical aspect does not negate the objective, historical work of Christ.
    - This union is the foundation for all **spiritual blessings**.
    "It is not a union that is merely external or legal; it is a union that is spiritual and mystical." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Union Precedes and Grounds All Redemptive Benefits**
    - The application of redemption presupposes **union with Christ**.
    - **Justification** and **sanctification** are distinct but inseparable benefits flowing from union.
    - **Adoption** and perseverance are also grounded in this union.
    - The **ordo salutis** (order of salvation) is best understood through the lens of union.
    "All the blessings of salvation have their source in union with Christ." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Union is Initiated by God’s Sovereign Grace**
    - The believer’s union with Christ is a result of **divine initiative**, not human merit.
    - **Effectual calling** brings the believer into this union.
    - Faith is the means by which union is subjectively realized, but not its cause.
    - The union is permanent and cannot be dissolved.
    "It is by God’s sovereign grace that we are united to Christ." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Union with Christ is Both Corporate and Individual**
    - Believers are united to Christ as individuals and as members of his body, the **church**.
    - The corporate dimension is essential for understanding the church’s identity.
    - The **sacraments** (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) signify and seal this union.
    - The eschatological hope of the church is grounded in union with the risen Christ.
    "The union of believers with Christ is both individual and corporate." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, providing a corrective to overly forensic or individualistic accounts of salvation. His integration of the full scope of redemptive benefits within the believer’s vital connection to Christ remains influential in contemporary discussions of the **ordo salutis** and the doctrine of the church. Murray’s work continues to inform and enrich systematic theology in the Reformed tradition.
