# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** as the foundation for all benefits of **salvation**. He distinguished the **objective, mystical, and spiritual aspects** of union, emphasizing its grounding in the **eternal decree** and its realization through **faith** by the work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Turretin, union with Christ is inseparable from **justification, sanctification, and adoption**, serving as the vital link between the believer and all redemptive blessings.

- "Our union with Christ is the foundation of all the communication of his benefits to us." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially vol. 2, topics on justification and sanctification)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on soteriology
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)
- Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary, for analysis of Turretin’s doctrine of union)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is threefold**
    - Distinguishes between **objective (legal), mystical (spiritual), and moral (ethical)** union.
    - Objective union is established in the **eternal decree** and covenant of redemption.
    - Mystical union is effected by the **Holy Spirit** through faith.
    - Moral union is expressed in the believer’s conformity to Christ.
    - "There is a threefold union: the first is natural, the second mystical, the third moral." (Institutes)

2. **Faith as the instrumental means**
    - Faith is the **sole instrument** by which believers are united to Christ.
    - Rejects any notion that works or sacraments are co-instruments of union.
    - Faith itself is a gift of the **Holy Spirit**, not a human achievement.
    - Union precedes the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, but faith is necessary for its application.
    - "Faith is the bond by which we are united to Christ and receive his benefits." (Institutes)

3. **Union grounds all benefits of salvation**
    - All **justification, sanctification, adoption, and glorification** flow from union with Christ.
    - Union is logically prior to the application of these benefits.
    - The believer’s status and transformation are rooted in this union.
    - No benefit is received apart from union with the Mediator.
    - "All the benefits of Christ flow from our union with him as from a living fountain." (Institutes)

4. **Union is effected by the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the efficient cause of mystical union.
    - The Spirit applies Christ and his benefits to the elect.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the sign and means of union.
    - This union is spiritual, not physical or essential.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and the believer." (Institutes)

5. **Union is inseparable and indissoluble**
    - Once established, union with Christ cannot be broken.
    - The perseverance of the saints is grounded in this unbreakable union.
    - Union is not dependent on the believer’s merit or constancy.
    - Assurance flows from the certainty of this union.
    - "This union is perpetual and indissoluble, because it is founded on the immutable decree of God." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced doctrine of **union with Christ** became a cornerstone for later Reformed theology, shaping the tradition’s understanding of the relationship between the believer and the benefits of redemption. His careful distinctions influenced both confessional standards and subsequent theologians, especially in the areas of **justification** and **sanctification**. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the ordo salutis and the centrality of union in the application of salvation. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the believer’s vital connection to Christ as the source of all spiritual blessings.
