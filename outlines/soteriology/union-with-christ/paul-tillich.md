# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **union with Christ** not as a literal mystical or forensic union, but as a symbol for the existential participation of the believer in the **New Being** revealed in Jesus as the **Christ**. For Tillich, this union is grounded in the **ontological** relationship between humanity and the divine, mediated through **faith** and the acceptance of **justification** as the overcoming of existential estrangement.

- "The New Being is the union of the divine and the human, and participation in it is the meaning of salvation." (The New Being)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The New Being
- Dynamics of Faith
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- Christology and Symbolism (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union as Participation in the New Being**
   - Union with Christ is understood as existential participation in the **New Being** manifested in Jesus.
   - This participation is not ontic but symbolic and existential, emphasizing transformation over metaphysical change.
   - The believer is united to Christ by being grasped by the **power of the New Being**.
   - Union is realized in the acceptance of **justification** and the overcoming of estrangement.
   - "To be united with Christ means to participate in the New Being which has appeared in him." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Symbolic Mediation of Union**
   - Christ is the ultimate symbol mediating the union between God and humanity.
   - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, making union with Christ a real, though non-literal, participation.
   - The language of union is thus symbolic, expressing existential realities rather than metaphysical ones.
   - Faith appropriates the symbol, making union effective in the believer’s life.
   - "The symbol participates in the reality which it symbolizes." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Existential Estrangement and Reconciliation**
   - Humanity’s primary problem is **existential estrangement** from the ground of being (God).
   - Union with Christ is the reconciliation of this estrangement through the acceptance of the Christ event.
   - The union is not a static state but a dynamic process of being grasped by the **Spirit**.
   - Reconciliation is both an individual and universal reality.
   - "The Christ is the New Being in whom the gap between God and man is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Faith as the Mode of Union**
   - Faith is the existential act by which the individual participates in the union with Christ.
   - It is not assent to propositions but an act of ultimate concern directed toward the Christ.
   - Through faith, the believer is incorporated into the **Spiritual Community** (the Church).
   - Faith is itself a gift, the means by which the New Being becomes effective.
   - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned." (Dynamics of Faith)

5. **Universal Scope of Union**
   - The union with Christ has a universal dimension, pointing toward the reconciliation of all reality.
   - The **New Being** is not limited to the Church but is the principle of renewal for all existence.
   - The Christ event is the center of history, making union possible for all humanity.
   - The eschatological hope is the consummation of this union in the **Kingdom of God**.
   - "The New Being is the answer to the question implied in our existence." (The New Being)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic approach to **union with Christ** has profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and philosophy. His emphasis on **participation in the New Being** reframed traditional doctrines of union in terms of existential transformation rather than forensic or mystical categories. While his views have been critiqued for their lack of ontological specificity, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between Christ, faith, and human existence. His legacy endures in both academic theology and broader conversations about the meaning of salvation and human destiny.
