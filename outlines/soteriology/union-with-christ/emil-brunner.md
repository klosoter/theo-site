# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **union with Christ** through the lens of **personal encounter** and **relational revelation**, emphasizing the existential reality of Christ’s presence rather than a metaphysical or ontological union. For Brunner, union with Christ is fundamentally a **relationship of faith** initiated by God’s self-disclosure, where the believer is addressed and transformed by the living Word. This union is not absorption into Christ’s being, but a dynamic fellowship grounded in **divine-human encounter**.

- "Faith is the personal meeting with Christ, in which man is addressed by God and responds." ("The Christian Doctrine of God")

## Key Works

- "The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith"
- "Dogmatics: Volume II—The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption"
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge"
- "Truth as Encounter"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union as Personal Encounter**
    - Union with Christ is realized in the existential meeting between God and the individual.
    - The relationship is dialogical, involving both divine address and human response.
    - Christ is present as the living Word, not as an abstract principle.
    - The union preserves the distinction between Creator and creature.
    - "Union with Christ is not a mystical absorption, but a personal encounter in faith." ("The Mediator")

2. **Faith as the Mode of Union**
    - Faith is the means by which the believer participates in Christ.
    - This faith is itself a gift, arising from God’s initiative.
    - Union is not achieved by human effort or mystical technique.
    - The believer’s trust and obedience are responses to God’s prior action.
    - "Faith is the bond which unites us to Christ, and it is itself the work of God." ("Dogmatics II")

3. **Christ as the Mediator**
    - Christ alone bridges the gap between God and humanity.
    - Union with Christ is possible only through His mediatorial work.
    - The incarnation and atonement are central to this union.
    - The believer’s relationship with God is always mediated by Christ’s person and work.
    - "Christ is the Mediator, and only in Him do we have fellowship with God." ("The Mediator")

4. **Revelation as Event**
    - Union with Christ is grounded in the event of revelation, not in static doctrine.
    - God’s self-disclosure is dynamic and personal, not merely propositional.
    - The encounter with Christ is an event that transforms the believer’s existence.
    - The Word of God is both the message and the means of union.
    - "Revelation is always an event, the act of God meeting man in Christ." ("Truth as Encounter")

5. **Preservation of Personal Distinction**
    - Brunner rejects any notion of ontological fusion between Christ and the believer.
    - The union respects the integrity and freedom of the human person.
    - The relationship is covenantal, not metaphysical.
    - The believer remains a distinct subject in fellowship with Christ.
    - "The union with Christ is a union of persons, not of substances." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s understanding of **union with Christ** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of salvation. His focus on **personal encounter** and the dialogical nature of faith offered a corrective to both rationalistic and mystical tendencies. While his approach was sometimes critiqued for lacking ontological depth, Brunner’s work remains significant for its insistence on the living reality of Christ’s presence and the centrality of faith as relational trust. His legacy endures in discussions of **revelation**, **Christology**, and the nature of Christian experience.
