# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for his pioneering distinction between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation), emphasizing the unfolding of **redemptive history** in contrast to the application of redemption to individuals. Vos argued that the **covenant of grace** is progressively revealed through historical acts culminating in Christ, and that systematic theology must account for both the objective accomplishment and subjective appropriation of salvation. His approach laid the groundwork for modern **biblical theology** within the Reformed tradition.

- "The center of gravity in the New Testament lies not in the ordo salutis, but in the historia salutis." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

## Key Works

- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Pauline Eschatology"
- "Reformed Dogmatics"
- "The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church"
- Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Redemptive History**
    - Emphasizes that **salvation** is first accomplished in historical events, not merely in individual experience.
    - Views the **covenant of grace** as unfolding through epochs, climaxing in Christ’s work.
    - Argues that biblical revelation is organically connected to these historical acts.
    - Maintains that understanding **redemptive history** is essential for interpreting Scripture.
    - "The facts of redemption are organically connected and constitute a living process." ("Biblical Theology")

2. **Distinction but Unity of Historia Salutis and Ordo Salutis**
    - Clearly differentiates the once-for-all accomplishment of salvation (historia salutis) from its application (ordo salutis).
    - Insists that both aspects are necessary for a full doctrine of salvation.
    - Warns against collapsing the historical into the existential or vice versa.
    - Sees the **Holy Spirit** as the link between Christ’s work and its application to believers.
    - "The ordo salutis is rooted in the historia salutis and cannot be understood apart from it." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

3. **Centrality of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are the pivotal events in **redemptive history**.
    - The benefits of salvation flow from these historical acts.
    - Christ’s accomplishment is the objective ground for all subjective experience of salvation.
    - The **ordo salutis** derives its efficacy from the finished work of Christ.
    - "All the blessings of salvation are historically grounded in the work of Christ." ("Biblical Theology")

4. **Biblical Theology as a Distinct Discipline**
    - Advocates for **biblical theology** as tracing the progressive revelation of redemption.
    - Distinguishes it from **systematic theology**, which organizes doctrine logically.
    - Argues that biblical theology clarifies the unfolding of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Sees biblical theology as essential for understanding the unity and diversity of Scripture.
    - "Biblical theology deals with revelation as a divine activity historically unfolded." ("Biblical Theology")

5. **Eschatology Informs Both Historia and Ordo Salutis**
    - Eschatology is not merely a future concern but shapes the entire structure of salvation.
    - The **already/not yet** tension is rooted in Christ’s historical work and its application.
    - The believer’s experience (ordo salutis) participates in the inaugurated eschatological age.
    - The consummation of salvation is both a historical event and a personal reality.
    - "The eschatological is not something superadded, but is woven into the very fabric of redemption." ("The Pauline Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the development of modern **biblical theology**. His insights have influenced generations of scholars, including those at Westminster Theological Seminary, and have provided a framework for understanding the relationship between Christ’s redemptive work and its application to believers. Vos’s emphasis on the organic unity of Scripture and the centrality of redemptive history continues to inform contemporary theological method and exegesis.
