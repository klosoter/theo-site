# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin rigorously distinguished between the **historia salutis** (history of salvation) and the **ordo salutis** (order of salvation), insisting that the objective accomplishment of redemption in history must be kept distinct from its subjective application to individuals. He rooted both in a robust **federal theology**, emphasizing that the **work of Christ** is the foundation for the **application of salvation** by the Holy Spirit.

- "The application of redemption presupposes its acquisition; for nothing can be applied to anyone unless it has been previously acquired." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 15.14.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on the covenant of grace
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "The Federal Theology of Francis Turretin"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between historia salutis and ordo salutis**
   - Clearly separates the historical accomplishment of redemption from its personal application.
   - Argues that the **work of Christ** (historia salutis) is the necessary ground for all benefits received in the ordo salutis.
   - Insists that confusion of these categories leads to theological error, particularly regarding assurance and the nature of faith.
   - Uses this distinction to defend the sufficiency and finality of Christ’s work.
   "The acquisition and application of salvation must not be confounded, lest the foundation be destroyed." (Institutes, 15.14.2)

2. **Federal (Covenant) Theology as the Framework**
   - Structures both historia salutis and ordo salutis within the **covenants of works and grace**.
   - Emphasizes the historical progression of the covenant of grace culminating in Christ.
   - Sees the ordo salutis as the Spirit’s application of covenant benefits to the elect.
   - Argues that the unity of the covenant of grace undergirds both the historical and applicatory aspects of salvation.
   "The covenant of grace is the channel through which all the benefits of Christ flow to us." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

3. **Christ’s Work as Objective Foundation**
   - Asserts that all saving benefits are merited by Christ’s historical obedience and sacrifice.
   - Maintains that the **historia salutis** is complete and unrepeatable.
   - Denies that human faith or obedience contributes to the accomplishment of redemption.
   - Stresses that the ordo salutis depends entirely on the finished work of Christ.
   "Nothing can be added to the satisfaction and merit of Christ, which is the sole foundation of our salvation." (Institutes, 15.14.4)

4. **Application of Salvation by the Holy Spirit**
   - Teaches that the Spirit applies Christ’s benefits to the elect in time.
   - Outlines the ordo salutis as a logical sequence: **effectual calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification**.
   - Emphasizes that this application is distinct from, but grounded in, the historia salutis.
   - Affirms the necessity of personal union with Christ for participation in salvation.
   "The Spirit unites us to Christ and makes us partakers of all his benefits." (Institutes, 15.14.8)

5. **Assurance and the Immutability of Salvation**
   - Grounds assurance in the objective work of Christ, not in subjective experience alone.
   - Argues that the distinction between historia and ordo salutis protects the believer from legalism and despair.
   - Teaches that the immutability of Christ’s accomplishment guarantees the certainty of salvation’s application.
   - Warns against collapsing the two orders, which would undermine assurance and the gospel’s sufficiency.
   "Our assurance rests not in ourselves, but in the unchangeable work of Christ for us." (Institutes, 15.14.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping how theologians articulated the relationship between Christ’s finished work and its application to believers. His **federal theology** provided a systematic framework for understanding the unity and diversity of God’s saving acts. Turretin’s influence persists in confessional Reformed theology, especially in discussions of assurance, the nature of faith, and the application of redemption. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking clarity on the structure of salvation in the Reformed tradition.
