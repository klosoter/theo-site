# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not explicitly distinguish between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) as later Reformed theology would, but his theology provides foundational categories for both. Aquinas emphasized the unfolding of **divine providence** and **redemptive history** in the economy of salvation, while also analyzing the **application of grace** to individuals through the **sacraments** and **virtues**. His synthesis of **nature and grace** shaped later discussions on how salvation is both accomplished in history and applied to the believer.

- "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.8)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially III, qq.1–59 on Christ’s work and III, qq.60–90 on the sacraments)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Veritate
- Selected secondary: Fergus Kerr, "Thomas Aquinas: A Very Short Introduction"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Divine Providence in Salvation History**
    - God’s providence governs the entire **economy of salvation** from creation to consummation.
    - The incarnation and redemptive acts of Christ are central events in the **historia salutis**.
    - All historical events are ordered toward the ultimate end: union with God.
    - Human history is meaningful because it is directed by God’s eternal plan.
    - "All things are ordered by divine providence to their end." (Summa Theologiae I, q.22, a.2)

2. **Christ’s Work as the Objective Ground of Salvation**
    - The passion, death, and resurrection of Christ are the foundation for all salvation.
    - Christ’s merits are applied to individuals through the sacraments.
    - The historical acts of Christ are necessary for the possibility of salvation.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are distributed across time through the Church.
    - "By His passion, Christ merited salvation not only for Himself but for all His members." (Summa Theologiae III, q.48, a.1)

3. **Application of Grace through the Sacraments**
    - Sacraments are the means by which the grace of Christ’s work is applied to individuals.
    - Each sacrament corresponds to a stage in the **ordo salutis** (e.g., baptism, confirmation, Eucharist).
    - The sacraments operate ex opere operato, conveying grace by virtue of the act performed.
    - The Church is the steward of the sacramental means of grace.
    - "The sacraments of the New Law are necessary for salvation." (Summa Theologiae III, q.61, a.1)

4. **Habitual Grace and the Infusion of Virtues**
    - Salvation involves the infusion of **sanctifying grace** and theological virtues (faith, hope, love).
    - The process of justification includes both the remission of sins and the renewal of the inner person.
    - The **ordo salutis** is conceptualized as a transformation of the soul by grace.
    - Human cooperation with grace is necessary but always initiated by God.
    - "Grace is nothing else than a certain participation in the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.110, a.1)

5. **Unity of Salvation’s Objective and Subjective Dimensions**
    - Aquinas sees no sharp divide between the accomplishment and application of salvation.
    - The historical acts of Christ and the individual’s reception of grace are inseparably linked.
    - The Church mediates both the historical and personal aspects of salvation.
    - The ultimate goal is the beatific vision, realized through both history and personal transformation.
    - "The effect of Christ’s passion is communicated to all the faithful through the sacraments." (Summa Theologiae III, q.62, a.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s integration of **redemptive history** and the **application of grace** provided a framework that influenced both Catholic and Protestant discussions of salvation. While he did not use the later Reformed categories of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, his careful distinctions between the work of Christ and its application shaped subsequent theological reflection. His thought remains foundational for understanding the relationship between the objective accomplishment of salvation and its subjective appropriation in the life of the believer.
