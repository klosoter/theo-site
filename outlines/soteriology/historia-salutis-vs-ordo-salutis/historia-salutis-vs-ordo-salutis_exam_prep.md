### TITLE
The One Christ in Two Frames: Integrating historia salutis and ordo salutis by Union with Christ

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how the objective, once-for-all events of redemption in history (**historia salutis**) norm and generate the Spirit’s personal application of salvation (**ordo salutis**) without collapsing one into the other.
- Decisive figures: Geerhardus Vos, John Murray, Herman Bavinck, Francis Turretin, Karl Barth.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed federal theology and scholasticism, neo-Calvinist and Princeton biblical theology, modern dialectical theology as external critique, with Roman Catholic and Arminian soteriologies as contrast-cases.
- Debates:
  - Internal: priority and structure of **union with Christ** in the **ordo salutis**, justification and sanctification relation, logical versus temporal order, the status of definitive sanctification, placement of adoption, the scope of **federal theology**.
  - External: Roman Catholic infused righteousness versus **forensic justification**, Arminian conditionalism and resistible grace, Barth’s rejection of an **ordo salutis**, New Perspective on Paul and covenantal nomism.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision confusions, assurance and sanctification tensions, Spirit baptism subsequence claims, redemptive-historical preaching and pastoral care.
- Position defended: **historia salutis** is architectonic and determinative; the **ordo salutis** is the Spirit’s ordered application in and through **union with Christ**, where justification is forensic and foundational, sanctification is definitive and progressive, and the benefits are distinct yet inseparable within the one Christ.

### ESSAY
The distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** was forged to preserve two dimensions of the gospel that Scripture binds together but never confuses. By **historia salutis** we mean the once-for-all acts of God in Christ for us in redemptive history, culminating in the incarnation, cross, resurrection, ascension, and Pentecost. By **ordo salutis** we mean the ordered application of those benefits by the Spirit to sinners here and now, incorporating them into Christ and distributing his benefits in a coherent, non-competitive way. The tension arises because theologians fear two opposite errors. On one side, the **ordo salutis** can become an abstract chain of psychological states untethered from the concrete, covenantal acts of God in history. On the other, the **historia salutis** can be treated as a brute objectivity that flattens the genuine order of calling, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification. The task is to recover the unity of the two frames in the one living Christ by framing the ordo within the historia and interpreting the historia as ordered toward the ordo by **federal theology** and the Spirit’s mission.

No figure did more to re-center the discussion on **historia salutis** than Geerhardus Vos. Working at Princeton in the early twentieth century, Vos pioneered biblical theology as the discipline that traces the progressive unfolding of revelation and redemption. His Biblical Theology and The Pauline Eschatology insist that the turning of the ages is an event in Christ that structures all soteriology. The categories of already and not yet, formed by the resurrection and Pentecost, supply the framework within which any talk of application must proceed. For Vos, the believer’s union is participation in the age-to-come life of the risen Christ. The objectivity of redemption is dogmatically basic. The Messiah as last Adam, in **federal theology**, achieves the epochal victory that then becomes the source of every benefit. This insistence represses the creeping subjectivism that had marked much post-Reformation orthodoxy and pietism, where ordo terms could be rearranged as a drama of the soul. Vos repositions the ordo as the Spirit’s eschatological appropriation of the age-to-come to believers. His eschatology disciplines every soteriological distinction. For example, justification is a verdict secured by the resurrection of Christ as the public judgment of God, and sanctification is the Spirit’s new-creational power unleashed by that same resurrection. The critical point is that the benefits are not independent packets; they are reapportioned modes of sharing in the once-for-all achievement of the last Adam.

The most supple integrator of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** in the modern Reformed tradition is John Murray. Teaching at Westminster in the mid-twentieth century, Murray’s Redemption Accomplished and Applied is a polemical title and a program. The two halves belong together, and the latter is not a human sequel but the Spirit’s application of the former. Murray warns against treating the ordo as an impersonal causal chain. He prefers to speak of the several distinct but inseparable acts of God that constitute application. Murray elevates **union with Christ** as the master category. He argues that union has a threefold aspect: formed in the decree, established in history through Christ’s representation, and actualized by the Spirit through faith. That structure refuses to detach **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**. It also protects the priority of the federal headship of Christ in whom the whole redeemed order is summed. Murray’s careful ordering places effectual calling at the head of the application, because it is the summons that creates the life in which faith is given. Regeneration thus functions not as an independent step to be temporally located, but as the inward renovation concurrent with effectual calling that produces faith. Faith is the Spirit-wrought instrument of union and of **forensic justification**. Justification is not causally prior to union, nor is sanctification a mere sequel unrelated to that same union. Rather, justification and sanctification are distinct graces that flow from union and cannot be ranked temporally any more than one can temporally rank the rays of a light that has just been turned on. Murray’s striking contribution is his account of definitive sanctification. The believer’s breach with the dominion of sin is an accomplished fact at conversion by virtue of participation in the death and resurrection of Christ. Progressive sanctification then unfolds that definitive reality. This is Vosian **inaugurated eschatology** made pastoral. Murray’s program withstands the common examiner challenge: if union is foundational, does that threaten the priority of justification in securing assurance. His answer is that union is the fountain, justification the legal stream within it, and assurance rests not on sanctification’s quality but on the sure verdict of God given in Christ and received through faith. The order preserves both objectivity and application without confusion.

To situate Vos and Murray historically requires recovering the earlier Reformed articulation of the **ordo salutis**, nowhere more precise than in Francis Turretin. Writing in the high scholastic era of the seventeenth century at Geneva, Turretin’s Institutes of Elenctic Theology codified the elenctic method that defined terms, distinguished causes, and answered objections. Turretin frames soteriology in **federal theology**, locating Christ’s obedience as the ground for imputation and distinguishing the covenant of works and the covenant of grace under the eternal **pactum salutis**. He treats the benefits under distinct heads because Scripture describes them distinctly. Faith is the sole instrument of justification, which is a forensic act on the basis of the imputed righteousness of Christ. Sanctification is a distinct grace, the infusion of inherent holiness by the Spirit. Adoption is not reducible to justification but a positive benefit of filial status. Turretin insists that the order must be logical, not temporal, and he refuses any circularity in which sanctification could become antecedent ground for the justifying verdict. Against Rome he denies an infused formal cause of justification. Against the Socinians he defends the necessity of satisfaction. And against Remonstrant conditionalism he grounds effectual calling and regeneration in sovereign grace that infallibly produces faith. Where later debates have asked whether union with Christ is prior to or posterior to justification, Turretin’s materials are more basic. For him, union in its mystical sense is concomitant with faith and so with justification, but union federally and representationally in **historia salutis** is prior. The scholastic precision therefore already contains the seeds of later integration with Vosian biblical theology. Turretin supplies the grammar of distinct benefits and their causal ordering that prevents later attempts to collapse them into undifferentiated participation.

Herman Bavinck presses the same distinctions within a different idiom. In Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck’s hallmark is organicity. All of the benefits of salvation are bound up in Christ himself, and grace restores and perfects nature rather than destroying it. Bavinck insists on a rich sense of **union with Christ** which is covenantal, ethical, and mystical, and which structures both **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**. He refuses to pit the forensic against the renovative. Justification is forensic and once-for-all, received by faith alone and grounded entirely in the obedience of the Mediator. Sanctification is inherent renovation. He places adoption in close proximity to justification, treating it as a distinct benefit that manifests the overflowing fullness of God’s grace. Bavinck resists fragmenting the ordo into isolated states and argues that the benefits are facets of one diamond. This organic language prevents a mechanistic ordo salutis without dissolving it. Moreover, Bavinck’s insistence on the Trinity’s undivided operations protects soteriology’s coherence. The Father sends the Son to accomplish redemption in history, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit applies, and all in concurrence with **divine simplicity**, so that the acts are distinct but inseparable operations of the one God. The structure of accomplished and applied belongs to the missions and their order without suggesting any temporal change in God. For examiners pressing whether the ordo introduces processes in God, Bavinck’s trinitarian clarity defuses the objection and reasserts that the order lies in the economy among creatures under the Word and Spirit.

Karl Barth represents the most serious modern critique of the **ordo salutis** and so must be heard as the external pressure testing Reformed coherence. Barth’s Church Dogmatics relocates soteriology in the doctrine of election and in the once-for-all Christ event. He charges that the ordo salutis functioned as a ladder of religious experience, implicitly making grace dependent on human stages or churchly mediation. He reconfigures justification as fundamentally the resurrection event, true for humanity in Christ as the electing God and elected man. Application becomes witness rather than causal distribution of distinct benefits. Faith is recognition of a reality already given. The attraction of Barth’s approach lies in its Christocentric objectivity and its demolition of subjective soteriology. But the cost is high. The justifying verdict becomes abstracted from its biblical conditioning by repentance and faith as instruments. The creaturely seriousness of the Spirit’s work is diminished, as is the thick covenantal structure of Scripture where promises and their reception matter. Barth faults the **ordo salutis** for individualism, yet Scripture will not relinquish the real order by which the Spirit unites those who were not a people to Christ through the **means of grace**. The Reformed response is to accept Barth’s warning against psychologized ladders, while insisting that a biblically mandated distinctness of benefits and a Spirit-wrought order preserve precisely the personal, covenantal realism that Barth also desired.

With these figures in view, the internal debates can be reckoned with directly. The first concerns the place and nature of **union with Christ** in the **ordo salutis**. Some argue for the logical priority of justification within the ordo because it secures assurance and is the only ground on which sanctification can proceed. Others, following Murray and Bavinck, insist that union is logically prior in such a way that justification and sanctification flow from it together, without ranking their moments temporally. The resolution depends on clarifying that there are several senses of union. There is a decretal union in election according to the **pactum salutis**, there is federal union in Christ’s **historia salutis** where he is head for his people, and there is Spirit-wrought union in time through the instrument of faith. Justification is an act of God toward the believer who is united to Christ by faith. In that sense, justification cannot be prior to union. But the foundation of justification in Christ’s righteousness presupposes his representative headship for us that is prior in the historia frame. Here the frames resolve the debate. The logical order in the ordo respects union by faith as the locus of receiving both the verdict and the renovation, while the historical order respects Christ’s work as deliberatively prior. This dual ordering does not jeopardize assurance, for faith receives Christ himself with all his benefits, and the forensic word is unmixed gift.

A second debate concerns definitive sanctification. Murray’s formulation that union with Christ entails an already-accomplished breach with sin’s dominion sometimes worries examiners who fear that this collapses sanctification into justification or invites antinomianism. The rejoinder is that definitive sanctification is not a verdict but a deliverance; Romans 6 depicts a once-for-all death to sin in which the old man was crucified with Christ, and yet also calls believers to present their members to God. The distinction remains intact: justification concerns status, sanctification concerns transformation, and both arise from union. A definitive moment guards the redemptive-historical reality that the new creation has broken in, countering moralistic gradualism.

A third debate concerns the placement of adoption. Turretin and Bavinck treat it as distinct and near justification. Murray makes it a benefit inseparable from the verdict that completes our transfer from Adamic condemnation to filial acceptance. Because Scripture speaks of adoption both as new status and as hope of bodily redemption, the ordo must hold it as both present and future, a bridge to glorification. Again the historia frame presses the reality that we await the redemption of our bodies, so that adoption is already and not yet.

Turning outward, the Roman Catholic denial of **forensic justification** must be answered at the ordo level and at the historia level. At the ordo level, the Council of Trent weds justification and sanctification under the formal cause of infused righteousness. The Reformed reply clarifies that justification is a judicial act of God grounded in the alien righteousness of Christ, imputed through faith as instrument, and that sanctification, while inseparable, is not this judicial act. Turretin’s careful distinctions remain indispensable. At the historia level, the righteousness that justifies is Christ’s obedience as the last Adam in fulfillment of **federal theology**, and the resurrection’s verdict is the Father’s amen to that obedience. To deny the forensic is to blunten the federal framework that Paul foregrounds. Arminian soteriology’s insistence on resistible grace and conditional perseverance strains the ordo at the calling and regeneration stages, threatening to make faith a self-generated condition rather than a Spirit-wrought instrument. Murray’s insistence on effectual calling as the head of application guards both divine sovereignty and the personal nature of faith. Against claims of Spirit baptism as a subsequence that confers a second blessing, the integrated ordo insists that the Spirit given at union is the Spirit of the exalted Christ and that fullness is pursued in progressive sanctification within the church, not in a two-tiered ordo.

Modern debates about Paul’s doctrine of justification, especially the New Perspective and its thesis of covenantal nomism, have pressed whether justification is ecclesiological badge rather than soteriological verdict. Ridderbos and those influenced by Vos answer by returning to **historia salutis**. Justification is indeed ecclesiological because it declares who belongs to the eschatological people. Yet it is soteriological because it is God’s verdict transferring sinners from wrath to grace. The law-court metaphor cannot be collapsed into a social boundary. The ordo stands, then, as the set of Spirit-wrought acts by which individuals are incorporated into the corporate eschatological body and declared righteous in Christ.

What then is the constructive position that integrates the two frames with clarity and pastoral power. First, the **historia salutis** is architectonic. The Father, according to the **pactum salutis**, purposed from eternity that the Son would become the last Adam, execute **federal theology** in history, and, through his incarnation, obedience, death, and resurrection, secure the whole treasury of redemption. Pentecost, as the enthronement-gift, is the redemptive-historical distribution of the age-to-come Spirit to the church. This historia is not a mere backdrop but the source and shape of salvation. Second, the **ordo salutis** is the Spirit’s application of this treasury to sinners by uniting them to the exalted Christ. The order is logical, not temporal, and personal, not mechanical. Under the gospel ministry, the Spirit effectually calls, producing the new heart that believes. Faith as the sole instrument unites to Christ. In that union, God justifies the ungodly by imputing Christ’s righteousness. Adoption is conferred as filial status and inheritance. Sanctification is definitive in break with sin and progressive in growth. Perseverance is the Spirit’s preserving grace through means. Glorification is the final participation in the resurrection life already tasted. In every step, the benefits are distinct yet inseparable because they are modes of sharing in Christ himself. Justification cannot be sanctification, but neither is it isolated from the sanctifying power that invariably accompanies union.

This integration disciplines preaching and pastoral care. Redemptive-historical preaching is not an alibi for skipping the **ordo salutis**. The indicative of historia creates imperatives and invitations in ordo terms. Preachers must announce the once-for-all accomplishment and press the ordered summons: repent and believe, receive the verdict, walk in newness of life. Pastors must guard consciences by grounding assurance in **forensic justification** while refusing the false assurance that bypasses sanctification. They must minister the **means of grace** because the Spirit ordinarily applies Christ through Word and sacrament in the church. The ordo is ecclesial and mediated, not private. For covenant children, the ordo is not always experienced as crisis. The order remains, but its timing varies as faith matures within the covenant community. Examiners will ask whether this concedes baptismal regeneration. The answer is no. Baptism is a sign and seal of union and its benefits, to be received by faith; it does not confer the grace it signifies ex opere operato.

Anticipated objections should be faced squarely. Does centering on **union with Christ** jeopardize the material principle of the Reformation by making justification a mere aspect of a larger participatory category. The answer is that union is the personal-relational frame that refuses to turn justification into an isolated legal transaction, but the legal verdict remains absolutely basic in that it addresses guilt and wrath which are not exhausted by participation language. Indeed, without the verdict, union would be a communion with a judge still against us. Conversely, does the insistence on the distinctness of justification and sanctification divide Christ. No. The one Christ is the righteous and the holy one, and the Spirit unites us to him so that the gifts are distinguishable effects of one personal union.

One final connection must be made with adjacent loci. The doctrine of God ensures that the historia and the ordo are ordered by the missions of the Son and the Spirit in the economy. **Divine simplicity** secures that God’s external works are indivisible even as they are appropriated according to the persons, which guards against projecting the ordo into God. Christology secures that the Mediator’s obedience is the ground of every benefit. The atonement, particularly the unity of active and passive obedience, underwrites both the forensic and the renovative benefits. Ecclesiology and sacramentology supply the environment of application. Eschatology supplies the two-age structure that Vos and Murray made explicit, so that we can say with Paul that by the Spirit we have tasted the powers of the age to come while groaning for full adoption.

In sum, the two frames are not in competition. The **historia salutis** is the sovereign dramaturgy of the triune God in Christ. The **ordo salutis** is the Spirit’s choreography by which sinners are brought onto that stage and into that drama in a real, ordered, and personal way. If the ordo is abstracted from historia, it degenerates into a museum of religious states. If historia is abstracted from ordo, it evaporates into a flat objectivity without appropriation. The Reformed tradition at its best, from Turretin’s distinctions through Bavinck’s organicity to Vos’s redemptive history and Murray’s integrative order, holds both with rigor and grace. Examiners press at precisely the points where the integration frays. The answers are ready to hand if we keep Christ as the center, **union with Christ** as the hinge, **forensic justification** as non-negotiable, and the Spirit’s ordered application as the living pathway by which the church walks from calling to glory.
