# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema distinguished between the **historia salutis** (the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in history) and the **ordo salutis** (the application of redemption to individuals), emphasizing their inseparability within the Reformed tradition. He argued that a proper understanding of **union with Christ** integrates both perspectives, ensuring that the benefits of Christ’s work are not abstracted from the historical events of salvation.

- "The application of salvation must never be separated from its once-for-all accomplishment in Christ." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Works

- "Saved by Grace" (1989)
- "The Bible and the Future" (1979)
- "Created in God's Image" (1986)
- "The Four Major Cults" (1963) [for context on soteriological deviations]
- "Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free" (referenced for Pauline soteriology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as Central**
    - All benefits of salvation flow from **union with Christ**.
    - This union bridges the **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**.
    - The believer’s participation in Christ’s work is both historical and existential.
    - The application of redemption is rooted in Christ’s finished work.
    - "All the blessings of salvation are found in Christ and become ours only through union with him." ("Saved by Grace")

2. **Distinction Without Separation**
    - Hoekema maintains a clear distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**.
    - He warns against reducing salvation to a mere sequence of subjective experiences.
    - The historical acts of Christ are the foundation for the application of salvation.
    - The two aspects must be held together to avoid theological imbalance.
    - "We must not separate what God has joined together: the accomplishment and application of redemption." ("Saved by Grace")

3. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions of Salvation**
    - **Histora salutis** refers to the objective, once-for-all work of Christ.
    - **Ordo salutis** concerns the subjective appropriation of salvation by the believer.
    - Both dimensions are necessary for a full doctrine of salvation.
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals.
    - "The work of Christ is objective, but it must be subjectively appropriated by faith." ("Saved by Grace")

4. **Critique of Individualism in Ordo Salutis**
    - Hoekema critiques a purely individualistic focus on the **ordo salutis**.
    - He argues that salvation must be understood corporately, in Christ.
    - Overemphasis on the order of salvation can obscure the centrality of Christ’s historical work.
    - The church’s life is grounded in the once-for-all events of redemption.
    - "The ordo salutis must not be viewed as a series of isolated experiences, but as participation in Christ’s redemptive work." ("Saved by Grace")

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The **historia salutis** culminates in Christ’s return and the consummation of redemption.
    - The application of salvation is oriented toward the final resurrection and glorification.
    - Believers live between the accomplishment and the consummation of salvation.
    - Assurance and hope are grounded in the completed work of Christ and its future fulfillment.
    - "Our salvation is both already accomplished and not yet consummated." ("The Bible and the Future")

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s integration of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially through his emphasis on **union with Christ**. His work provided a corrective to overly individualistic or purely existential readings of salvation, rooting the believer’s experience firmly in the redemptive acts of Christ. Hoekema’s balanced approach continues to influence systematic theology, ensuring that the application of salvation is never divorced from its historical foundation.
