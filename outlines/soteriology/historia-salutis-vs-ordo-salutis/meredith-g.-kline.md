# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a Reformed biblical theologian who emphasized the distinction between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) in his covenantal framework. Kline argued that the **covenant structure** of redemptive history shapes the way salvation is accomplished and applied, insisting that the unfolding of **redemptive acts** in history (historia salutis) must be kept distinct from the individual's appropriation of salvation (ordo salutis). His work highlights the centrality of **covenant theology** and the significance of **typology** in understanding the relationship between these two categories.

- "The accomplishment of redemption in history must be distinguished from its application to the individual, lest the unique, once-for-all character of Christ’s work be obscured." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- "Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview"
- "By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism"
- "The Structure of Biblical Authority"
- "God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos"
- "Images of the Spirit"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Historia Salutis and Ordo Salutis**
    - Maintains that **historia salutis** refers to the once-for-all, objective accomplishment of redemption in history.
    - **Ordo salutis** concerns the subjective application of redemption to individuals by the Holy Spirit.
    - Warns against conflating the two, which can undermine the uniqueness of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Emphasizes that biblical covenants provide the framework for understanding this distinction.
    - "The redemptive events are unique, unrepeatable acts of God in history, not to be confused with the ongoing process of salvation in the believer." ("Kingdom Prologue")

2. **Covenant as the Framework for Redemptive History**
    - Argues that **covenant theology** is essential for interpreting both the accomplishment and application of salvation.
    - Sees the covenants as structuring the progression of **redemptive history**.
    - Insists that the new covenant in Christ is the climax of the **historia salutis**.
    - Uses covenant signs (e.g., circumcision, baptism) to illustrate the transition from historical accomplishment to personal application.
    - "The covenant is the backbone of the history of redemption." ("By Oath Consigned")

3. **Typology and the Unfolding of Redemptive Acts**
    - Views Old Testament types as historical events that prefigure the climactic work of Christ.
    - Stresses that typology belongs to the **historia salutis**, not the ordo salutis.
    - Argues that misunderstanding typology leads to confusion between the corporate and individual aspects of salvation.
    - Maintains that Christ fulfills all typological patterns in redemptive history.
    - "Typology is rooted in the historical progression of God’s redemptive acts." ("Kingdom Prologue")

4. **Christ’s Once-for-All Work as the Center of Historia Salutis**
    - Asserts that the death and resurrection of Christ are the definitive events of **historia salutis**.
    - Emphasizes the unrepeatable nature of Christ’s accomplishment for the elect.
    - Warns against any view that would make the application of salvation (ordo salutis) a repetition of Christ’s work.
    - Connects the efficacy of the ordo salutis directly to the finished work of Christ in history.
    - "The cross is the once-for-all event that grounds all subsequent application of redemption." ("Kingdom Prologue")

5. **Pneumatology and the Application of Salvation**
    - Teaches that the Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals in the **ordo salutis**.
    - Distinguishes the Spirit’s role in the historical accomplishment from His role in personal application.
    - Argues that the Spirit’s work in the ordo salutis is dependent on the completed work of Christ in history.
    - Highlights the newness of the Spirit’s ministry in the new covenant era.
    - "The Spirit’s application of redemption is grounded in the finished work of Christ, not a continuation of it." ("Images of the Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s rigorous distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed biblical theology, especially in covenantal and redemptive-historical studies. His emphasis on the **covenant structure** of Scripture and the centrality of Christ’s once-for-all work has influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Kline’s insights continue to inform debates on typology, sacramental theology, and the relationship between biblical theology and systematic theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing recovery of a robust, redemptive-historical approach within the Reformed tradition.
