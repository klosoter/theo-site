# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) with a critical eye toward traditional Reformed formulations. He emphasized the importance of grounding the application of salvation in the once-for-all redemptive acts of Christ, cautioning against abstracting the **ordo salutis** from the concrete realities of **redemptive history**. Berkouwer sought to maintain the unity of **Christology** and **soteriology**, insisting that the benefits applied to believers are inseparable from the historical accomplishment of salvation.

- "The ordo salutis must not become an independent scheme, detached from the fullness of salvation history." (Faith and Justification)

## Key Works

- Faith and Justification (1954)
- Faith and Sanctification (1952)
- The Work of Christ (1965)
- Studies in Dogmatics series (various volumes)
- Holy Scripture (1966)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Redemptive History**
    - Stresses that **historia salutis** is foundational for understanding salvation.
    - Warns against treating the **ordo salutis** as a timeless, abstract sequence.
    - Argues that the application of salvation must be rooted in Christ’s historical work.
    - Sees the acts of God in history as the basis for all soteriological benefits.
    - "The application of salvation cannot be separated from its historical accomplishment in Christ." (Faith and Justification)

2. **Critique of Ordo Salutis Abstraction**
    - Criticizes the tendency to systematize the **ordo salutis** apart from biblical narrative.
    - Emphasizes the danger of psychological or existential reductionism.
    - Advocates for a dynamic, rather than static, understanding of salvation’s application.
    - Sees the **ordo salutis** as a theological reflection, not a fixed order.
    - "We must beware of an ordo salutis that becomes a self-contained scheme." (Faith and Sanctification)

3. **Unity of Christology and Soteriology**
    - Insists that the benefits of salvation are inseparable from the person and work of Christ.
    - Argues that all aspects of the **ordo salutis** flow from union with Christ.
    - Rejects any application of salvation that is not grounded in Christ’s redemptive acts.
    - Maintains that **union with Christ** is the central soteriological reality.
    - "All the riches of salvation are found in Christ and cannot be abstracted from Him." (The Work of Christ)

4. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
    - Highlights the role of the **Holy Spirit** in applying salvation.
    - Sees the Spirit as the link between the historical work of Christ and the believer’s experience.
    - Argues that the Spirit actualizes the benefits of **historia salutis** in the life of the believer.
    - Rejects any view of the **ordo salutis** that minimizes the Spirit’s agency.
    - "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ unites us to Himself and His benefits." (Faith and Sanctification)

5. **Pastoral and Existential Sensitivity**
    - Seeks to relate doctrinal formulations to the lived experience of faith.
    - Warns against speculative or overly technical distinctions in soteriology.
    - Emphasizes assurance and comfort found in Christ’s finished work.
    - Encourages a faith that looks to Christ’s historical accomplishment, not to subjective experience alone.
    - "The certainty of salvation rests not in our experience, but in the finished work of Christ." (Faith and Justification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology by urging theologians to avoid abstracting the application of salvation from its historical foundation in Christ. His emphasis on the unity of **Christology** and **soteriology** has encouraged a more biblically integrated and pastorally sensitive account of salvation. Berkouwer’s work remains influential in discussions about the relationship between redemptive history and the believer’s experience, fostering ongoing reflection on the proper ordering of Reformed soteriology.
