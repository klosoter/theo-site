# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann explores the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) by emphasizing the **eschatological** and **trinitarian** dimensions of redemption. He prioritizes the communal and cosmic unfolding of salvation in history, critiquing individualistic or purely existential interpretations. For Moltmann, the **resurrection of Christ** inaugurates a new reality in which the Spirit draws all creation into the hope of the **eschaton**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is not an event in the history of the soul, but an event in the history of the world." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Spirit of Life (1991)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Eschatological History**
   - Emphasizes **historia salutis** as the unfolding of God's promises in history.
   - Sees the resurrection as the decisive event shaping all subsequent salvation.
   - Argues that individual salvation is meaningful only within the context of cosmic renewal.
   - Critiques static or timeless understandings of salvation.
   - "Christian faith lives from the raising of the crucified Christ and strains after the future of the resurrection of the dead and the coming of the kingdom of God." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Communal and Cosmic Scope of Salvation**
   - Salvation is not limited to individual souls but encompasses all creation.
   - The **ordo salutis** is reinterpreted in light of the communal people of God.
   - The Spirit unites believers into the eschatological community.
   - The ultimate goal is the renewal of the world, not just personal redemption.
   - "The goal of the Christian hope is not the salvation of the soul, but the resurrection of the body and the renewal of all things." (The Coming of God)

3. **Critique of Individualistic Ordo Salutis**
   - Challenges traditional Protestant emphasis on personal application of salvation.
   - Warns against reducing salvation to subjective experience or moral improvement.
   - Argues that **ordo salutis** must be re-grounded in the objective work of Christ.
   - Stresses the importance of participation in the historical community of faith.
   - "The ordo salutis must be understood as participation in the history of Christ, not as a private spiritual itinerary." (The Spirit of Life)

4. **Trinitarian Structure of Salvation**
   - Frames both **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** within the work of the Triune God.
   - The Father sends the Son and the Spirit to accomplish and apply redemption.
   - The Spirit actualizes the historical work of Christ in the life of the church.
   - Salvation is a dynamic process involving all three persons of the Trinity.
   - "The trinitarian history of God with the world is the basis for the history of salvation and its appropriation." (Experiences in Theology)

5. **Hope as the Driving Force of Salvation**
   - The future-oriented promise of God shapes both history and personal experience.
   - Christian life is lived in anticipation of the **eschaton**.
   - Hope transforms the present by orienting believers toward God's coming kingdom.
   - The church is called to embody this hope in the world.
   - "Where hope is, there is openness to the future and readiness for the new." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s emphasis on **eschatology** and the communal dimensions of salvation has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. By reframing the relationship between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, he has challenged individualistic paradigms and inspired renewed attention to the cosmic scope of redemption. His work continues to provoke discussion on the integration of historical and existential aspects of salvation within the broader narrative of God's redemptive action.
