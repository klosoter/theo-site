# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson emphasizes the vital distinction and relationship between the **historia salutis** (the history of salvation accomplished in redemptive events) and the **ordo salutis** (the application of salvation to the individual). He maintains that a robust **Reformed soteriology** must hold these together, seeing the work of Christ in history as the foundation for the Spirit’s application of redemption to believers. Ferguson warns against separating these categories, insisting that the benefits of **union with Christ** flow from the once-for-all accomplishment of salvation in history.

- "The application of redemption is rooted in the accomplishment of redemption; the ordo salutis is grounded in the historia salutis." (The Holy Spirit, p. 102)

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (1996)
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction (1981)
- “Ordo Salutis or Historia Salutis? Reformed Perspectives on the Structure of Paul’s Theology” in Pauline Theology, Vol. 2 (ed. D.A. Carson, 1991)
- Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister Is Called to Be (2017)
- “Union with Christ: The Reformed Perspective” in Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Union with Christ**
   - Union with Christ is the central reality uniting both historia salutis and ordo salutis.
   - All benefits of salvation are communicated through this union.
   - The application of redemption is inseparable from Christ’s redemptive work in history.
   - This union is both legal (justification) and transformative (sanctification).
   - "All that is ours in the ordo salutis flows from our union with Christ in the historia salutis." (The Holy Spirit, p. 113)

2. **Accomplishment and Application Distinction**
   - The work of Christ (accomplishment) and the Spirit’s application must be distinguished but not separated.
   - The historia salutis provides the objective ground for the ordo salutis.
   - The ordo salutis is the subjective realization of the benefits accomplished in history.
   - Confusing the two leads to theological errors in understanding salvation.
   - "The accomplishment of redemption is once-for-all; its application is ongoing in the life of the church." (The Holy Spirit, p. 102)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals.
   - The Spirit’s work is rooted in the finished work of Christ.
   - There is no application of salvation apart from the historical events of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.
   - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making the ordo salutis possible.
   - "The Spirit never works independently of Christ’s finished work in history." (The Holy Spirit, p. 104)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
   - Both historia salutis and ordo salutis are framed within the covenant of grace.
   - The unfolding of redemptive history is covenantal, culminating in Christ.
   - The application of redemption follows the pattern established in the covenant.
   - The believer’s experience is a participation in the covenantal blessings accomplished by Christ.
   - "Redemption is both accomplished and applied within the framework of God’s covenant purposes." (The Christian Life, p. 37)

5. **Pastoral Implications**
   - A proper grasp of historia salutis and ordo salutis shapes assurance and Christian living.
   - Assurance is grounded in the objective work of Christ, not subjective experience alone.
   - Preaching should proclaim both the finished work of Christ and its application by the Spirit.
   - The believer’s growth is rooted in what Christ has accomplished and what the Spirit applies.
   - "Pastoral ministry must keep accomplishment and application together for the health of the church." (Some Pastors and Teachers, p. 221)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s careful articulation of the relationship between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has helped clarify Reformed soteriology for pastors, students, and scholars. His emphasis on **union with Christ** as the integrating center has influenced contemporary discussions on salvation and the Christian life. Ferguson’s work continues to shape how Reformed theology is taught and preached, ensuring that the accomplishment and application of redemption are held together in both doctrine and practice.
