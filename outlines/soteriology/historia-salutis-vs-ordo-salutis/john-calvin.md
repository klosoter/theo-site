# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology is foundational for later distinctions between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation), though he himself did not explicitly use these categories. Calvin emphasized the centrality of **union with Christ** and the accomplishment of redemption in history, while also addressing the application of salvation to individuals through the work of the **Holy Spirit**. His writings laid the groundwork for later Reformed reflection on the relationship between the once-for-all work of Christ and its personal appropriation.

- "As long as Christ remains outside of us, and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us." (Institutes 3.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Books II and III)
- Commentaries on Romans and Ephesians
- Sermons on Ephesians
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin’s Calvinism (Baker edition)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Union with Christ**
    - Salvation’s benefits flow from believers’ union with the risen Christ.
    - Both the accomplishment (historia salutis) and application (ordo salutis) of redemption are rooted in this union.
    - Justification and sanctification are inseparable because both are received in Christ.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making his work effective for them.
    - "We do not, therefore, contemplate him [Christ] outside ourselves from afar in order that his righteousness may be imputed to us, but because we put on Christ and are engrafted into his body—in short, because he deigns to make us one with him." (Institutes 3.11.10)

2. **Objective Work of Christ in Redemptive History**
    - Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection are historical events that accomplish salvation.
    - The focus is on the sufficiency and finality of Christ’s work (historia salutis).
    - The benefits of redemption are grounded in these once-for-all acts.
    - The historical accomplishment is distinct from, but necessary for, its application.
    - "For, as has been said, so long as we are without Christ and separated from him, nothing which he suffered and did for the salvation of the human race is of the least benefit to us." (Institutes 3.1.1)

3. **Application of Redemption by the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals (ordo salutis).
    - Regeneration, faith, justification, and sanctification are all works of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the historical work of Christ.
    - The Spirit brings believers into vital participation in Christ’s saving acts.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself." (Institutes 3.1.1)

4. **Faith as the Instrument of Reception**
    - Faith is the means by which individuals receive Christ and his benefits.
    - Faith itself is a gift of God, produced by the Spirit.
    - Through faith, believers are justified and sanctified in union with Christ.
    - Faith looks away from self to the finished work of Christ in history.
    - "Faith is the principal work of the Holy Spirit; by faith we receive Christ and all his benefits." (Institutes 3.1.4)

5. **Order of Salvation Rooted in Christ’s Work**
    - The sequence of salvation’s application (ordo salutis) is grounded in Christ’s historical accomplishment.
    - Calvin discusses calling, justification, sanctification, and glorification as distinct yet inseparable.
    - The ordo salutis is not an abstract sequence but flows from participation in Christ.
    - The benefits are distributed to believers according to God’s sovereign grace and timing.
    - "Christ, therefore, is the beginning and end of all the blessings we receive." (Institutes 3.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust focus on **union with Christ** and the distinction between the accomplishment and application of redemption profoundly shaped later Reformed theology’s development of the **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** categories. His insights provided the theological foundation for subsequent debates on the relationship between Christ’s work in history and its appropriation by believers. Calvin’s influence endures in discussions of soteriology, particularly in emphasizing the inseparability of Christ’s person and work from the believer’s experience of salvation.
