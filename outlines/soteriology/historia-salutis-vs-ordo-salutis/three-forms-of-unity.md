# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **Reformed soteriology** that implicitly distinguishes between the **historia salutis** (the accomplishment of redemption in history) and the **ordo salutis** (the application of redemption to individuals). These confessions emphasize the once-for-all work of **Christ’s atonement** and the Spirit’s application of salvation, providing a doctrinal framework that upholds both the objective accomplishment and subjective appropriation of salvation. The documents maintain a careful balance between the historical acts of God in **redemptive history** and the personal experience of **union with Christ**.

- "What do you confess when you say: He suffered? During all the time he lived on earth, but especially at the end, Christ bore in body and soul the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 37)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 1, 29, 37, 60, 65, 86
- The Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 20–23, 24, 34
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine II and III/IV

- Cornelis P. Venema, *The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ* (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Work as Once-for-All (Historia Salutis)**
    - Emphasizes the historical, objective accomplishment of redemption by Christ.
    - Affirms that Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are sufficient and complete.
    - Grounds the believer’s assurance in the finished work of Christ.
    - Connects the benefits of salvation to the historical events of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.
    - "We believe that Jesus Christ... has presented himself in our name before his Father, to appease his wrath with full satisfaction by offering himself on the tree of the cross and pouring out his precious blood for the cleansing of our sins." (Belgic Confession, Art. 21)

2. **Application of Salvation by the Holy Spirit (Ordo Salutis)**
    - Teaches that the Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals.
    - Outlines the necessity of personal faith, regeneration, and sanctification.
    - Stresses the Spirit’s role in uniting believers to Christ.
    - Presents the ordo salutis as the experiential realization of what Christ accomplished.
    - "The Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts a true faith, that embraces Jesus Christ with all his merits, makes him our own, and no longer looks for anything apart from him." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

3. **Union with Christ as the Link Between Historia and Ordo Salutis**
    - Asserts that all benefits of salvation flow from union with Christ.
    - Union is both a redemptive-historical reality and an existential experience.
    - Faith is the means by which believers are united to Christ and receive his benefits.
    - This union bridges the objective and subjective dimensions of salvation.
    - "We are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by faith only." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 61)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
    - Frames both the accomplishment and application of salvation within the covenant of grace.
    - The covenant is established in history and realized in the lives of believers.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper signify and seal both the historical work and its personal application.
    - The confessions stress continuity between Old and New Testament administrations of the covenant.
    - "God has promised us, who believe in him, forgiveness of sins and eternal life through the blood of Christ, as he promised us in the Old and New Testaments." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 66)

5. **Assurance Rooted in Christ’s Work and Spirit’s Witness**
    - Assurance is based on the sufficiency of Christ’s historical work.
    - The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit confirms the believer’s participation in salvation.
    - Good works are evidence of faith, not the ground of assurance.
    - The confessions reject any separation between Christ’s work for us and the Spirit’s work in us.
    - "Our assurance does not rest upon our own worthiness, but upon the merits of Christ and the promises of God." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 12)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** understanding of the relationship between the accomplishment and application of salvation. Their careful articulation of both **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has provided a confessional anchor for subsequent doctrinal development, especially regarding the work of Christ and the role of the Holy Spirit. These documents continue to serve as foundational standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring that the unity of redemptive history and personal salvation remains central to Reformed identity and proclamation.
