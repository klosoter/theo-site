# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation). Gaffin emphasizes the primacy of the once-for-all, redemptive-historical accomplishment of salvation in Christ, arguing that the application of salvation to individuals is inseparable from the historical work of Christ, particularly his **resurrection** and **union with Christ**.

- "The application of salvation to the individual is inseparable from the once-for-all accomplishment of salvation in the history of Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Order of Salvation and the Theology of Paul" (in The Practical Calvinist: An Introduction to the Presbyterian & Reformed Heritage)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Historia Salutis**
    - The redemptive events in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are the foundation for all soteriological benefits.
    - The **accomplishment of salvation** (historia salutis) is logically and theologically prior to its application (ordo salutis).
    - The work of Christ is unique and unrepeatable, grounding all aspects of the believer’s salvation.
    - The historical acts of Christ are not merely illustrative but constitutive for the believer’s experience.
    - "The history of Christ is the indispensable and exclusive basis for the application of salvation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Union with Christ as Central**
    - All benefits of salvation flow from **union with Christ**, which bridges historia salutis and ordo salutis.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are inseparable from union with the resurrected Christ.
    - Union with Christ is both a redemptive-historical reality and an existential reality for the believer.
    - This union is effected by the Holy Spirit, who applies Christ’s work to the elect.
    - "There is no participation in Christ that is not participation in his benefits." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Resurrection as Soteriological Center**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in both the accomplishment and application of salvation.
    - Paul’s soteriology is structured around the resurrection as the inauguration of the new creation.
    - The believer’s justification and new life are grounded in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The resurrection marks the transition from the old age to the new, realized in the believer by the Spirit.
    - "The resurrection is the climactic saving event in the history of Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Critique of Ordo Salutis Abstraction**
    - Gaffin warns against treating the **ordo salutis** as a timeless, individualistic sequence detached from Christ’s work.
    - The ordo salutis must be understood as the personal appropriation of the once-for-all work of Christ.
    - Traditional formulations risk obscuring the corporate and historical dimensions of salvation.
    - The application of salvation is always grounded in and shaped by the historical accomplishment in Christ.
    - "The ordo salutis is not an abstract sequence but the application of Christ’s once-for-all work." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Pneumatological Application**
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who unites believers to Christ and applies the benefits of redemption.
    - Pentecost is a redemptive-historical event that marks the beginning of the Spirit’s eschatological work.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the historical accomplishment of Christ.
    - The Spirit mediates both the objective and subjective aspects of salvation.
    - "The Spirit’s application of salvation is grounded in the finished work of Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly influenced Reformed theology’s approach to the relationship between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, especially in Pauline studies and systematic theology. His emphasis on **union with Christ** and the centrality of the resurrection has shaped contemporary discussions on soteriology and the work of the Holy Spirit. Gaffin’s insights continue to inform debates on the structure of salvation and the integration of biblical and systematic theology, making his contributions essential for understanding the dynamics of redemption in Reformed thought.
