# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s theology laid foundational groundwork for later distinctions between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation), though he did not use these precise terms. He emphasized the unfolding of **redemptive history** in Christ and the application of **grace** to individuals, articulating a strong doctrine of **predestination** and the necessity of **regeneration** through the work of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (Enchiridion 103)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- On the Spirit and the Letter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Divine Grace in Salvation**
    - Salvation is initiated and completed by **God’s sovereign grace**.
    - Human will is incapable of turning to God without **divine intervention**.
    - Grace is both **prevenient** and **effectual** in the salvation of the elect.
    - The application of grace is rooted in God’s eternal plan, connecting the historical work of Christ to individual salvation.
    - "For it is not by their own merits that the children of God are made such, but by the grace of God." (Enchiridion 18)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - The events of **salvation history** culminate in the person and work of Christ.
    - Old Testament and New Testament are unified in the unfolding of **God’s redemptive plan**.
    - The historical acts of God are the basis for the application of salvation to individuals.
    - Augustine sees the church as the ongoing locus of this historical redemption.
    - "The New Testament lies hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

3. **Order of Salvation Rooted in Predestination**
    - The **ordo salutis** (calling, regeneration, justification, glorification) is grounded in God’s eternal decree.
    - Predestination ensures the infallible application of salvation to the elect.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s historical work to individuals in time.
    - Assurance of salvation is found in God’s unchangeable purpose, not human effort.
    - "Those whom God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son." (De Dono Perseverantiae 17)

4. **Necessity of Regeneration and Renewal**
    - Fallen humanity requires a new birth by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Regeneration is the inward transformation that applies Christ’s historical redemption.
    - The sacraments serve as means by which grace is communicated within the church.
    - Renewal is ongoing, culminating in final glorification.
    - "No one is set free from the dominion of the devil except by the grace of the Redeemer." (Enchiridion 33)

5. **Ecclesial Mediation of Salvation**
    - The church is the visible community where salvation is administered.
    - Baptism and the Eucharist are central means of grace, linking the historical work of Christ to believers.
    - The church’s ministry proclaims and applies the benefits of redemption.
    - The communion of saints participates in the ongoing story of salvation.
    - "Outside the church there is no salvation." (Sermon 214)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s synthesis of **redemptive history** and the application of salvation shaped both medieval and Reformation theology. His articulation of **grace**, **predestination**, and the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** provided the categories for later distinctions between historia salutis and ordo salutis. Reformed theologians, in particular, drew heavily on Augustine’s insights to clarify the relationship between Christ’s historical work and its application to the elect. His influence remains central in discussions of the structure and sequence of salvation in Western theology.
