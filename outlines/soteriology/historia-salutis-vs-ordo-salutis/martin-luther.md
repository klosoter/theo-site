# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s theology emphasized the centrality of **Christ’s redemptive work in history** (**historia salutis**) as the foundation for the believer’s **justification by faith**. While Luther did not develop a systematic **ordo salutis**, his writings stress the priority of **God’s saving acts in Christ** over any sequence of subjective experiences in salvation. For Luther, the believer’s union with Christ and reception of salvation are grounded in the once-for-all accomplishment of **the gospel**.

- "For the sake of Christ, through faith, God does not count our sins against us." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Romans (1515–1516)
- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Christ’s Historical Work**
    - Salvation is rooted in the objective, historical events of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection.
    - The believer’s assurance rests on what Christ has accomplished, not on inner transformation.
    - The proclamation of the gospel centers on Christ’s finished work for sinners.
    - The historical acts of Christ are the basis for all benefits received by faith.
    - "He who believes in Christ possesses all things, and is blessed and justified, not by works but by faith alone." (Freedom of a Christian)

2. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is a declarative act grounded in Christ’s righteousness imputed to the believer.
    - Faith receives what Christ has accomplished, rather than initiating a process of inward renewal.
    - The ordo salutis is subordinated to the priority of justification as a present reality.
    - Assurance is found in the external promise of the gospel, not in introspection.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

3. **Union with Christ**
    - Believers are united to Christ through faith, sharing in his benefits.
    - This union is effected by the Holy Spirit through the means of grace.
    - The believer’s status before God is inseparable from Christ’s person and work.
    - The focus remains on Christ’s objective accomplishment, not on the believer’s subjective experience.
    - "Through faith in Christ, therefore, Christ’s righteousness becomes our righteousness and all that he has becomes ours." (Two Kinds of Righteousness)

4. **Means of Grace as Historical Proclamation**
    - The Word and sacraments communicate the benefits of Christ’s historical work.
    - The sacraments are visible words, grounding faith in Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice.
    - The church’s ministry centers on delivering the gospel accomplished in history.
    - The efficacy of the means of grace depends on God’s promise, not human merit.
    - "The gospel is nothing else than the preaching about Christ, the Son of God and David, who died and was raised and is established as Lord." (Lectures on Romans)

5. **Critique of Speculative Ordo Salutis**
    - Luther resists constructing a detailed sequence of salvation steps apart from Christ’s work.
    - He warns against introspective attempts to trace one’s own progress in salvation.
    - The focus is on receiving God’s promise, not analyzing the stages of conversion.
    - Any ordo salutis must be subordinate to the historia salutis of Christ.
    - "We must look away from ourselves and fasten our eyes and hearts on Christ alone." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s emphasis on the **historia salutis**—the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in Christ—shaped the Protestant focus on **justification by faith** and the externality of the gospel promise. His suspicion of speculative **ordo salutis** frameworks influenced later Lutheran and Reformed theology, prioritizing the proclamation of Christ’s finished work over subjective experience. Luther’s approach continues to inform debates on the relationship between the objective work of Christ and the application of salvation to believers.
