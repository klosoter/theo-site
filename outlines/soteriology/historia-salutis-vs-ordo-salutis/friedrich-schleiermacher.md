# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reoriented the discussion of **salvation** by emphasizing the communal and historical unfolding of **redemption** over the traditional focus on the individual's **ordo salutis**. He prioritized the **historical revelation of Christ** and the corporate experience of the **church** as the locus of salvation, thereby subordinating the sequence of individual application to the broader **historia salutis**. Schleiermacher’s approach marked a significant shift from classical Reformed emphases on the logical order of salvation’s benefits.

- "The Redeemer is not the founder of a new religion, but the perfecter of religion in general, and the Redeemer of the human race." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Historical Christ Event**
    - Salvation is rooted in the unique historical appearance of Christ.
    - The work of Christ is understood as the central event in **historia salutis**.
    - The historical revelation of God in Christ is the foundation for all subsequent experience of salvation.
    - The church’s existence and faith are grounded in this singular historical act.
    - "The Redeemer is the absolutely potent God-consciousness appearing in the form of temporal existence." (The Christian Faith, §94)

2. **Corporate Nature of Redemption**
    - The church is the primary recipient and bearer of salvation.
    - Individual salvation is always mediated through participation in the Christian community.
    - The benefits of redemption are realized in the context of the church’s ongoing life.
    - The communal experience of faith supersedes individualistic sequences.
    - "The individual is only a member of the community, and his blessedness is only a participation in the blessedness of the community." (The Christian Faith, §121)

3. **Subordination of Ordo Salutis**
    - The traditional sequence of individual salvation (ordo salutis) is not central.
    - Schleiermacher critiques the fragmentation of salvation into discrete steps.
    - The focus shifts from individual application to the historical accomplishment of redemption.
    - The ordo salutis is seen as derivative from the church’s historical experience.
    - "The order of salvation is not a series of separate acts, but the development of the God-consciousness in the individual through the influence of the Redeemer." (The Christian Faith, §112)

4. **Redemption as God-Consciousness**
    - Salvation is defined as the awakening of **God-consciousness** in the believer.
    - This consciousness is imparted through the historical Christ and mediated by the church.
    - The experience of salvation is existential and relational, not merely juridical.
    - The process is dynamic and ongoing, rather than a fixed sequence.
    - "Redemption consists in the communication of the Redeemer’s God-consciousness to the community." (The Christian Faith, §98)

5. **Dynamic View of Salvation History**
    - Salvation unfolds progressively in history, not as a static set of benefits.
    - The **historia salutis** is an ongoing divine action in the world.
    - The church participates in and extends the historical work of Christ.
    - The application of salvation is inseparable from its historical realization.
    - "The historical process of redemption is the continuous presence of Christ’s influence in the world." (The Christian Faith, §100)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s emphasis on the **historia salutis** over the **ordo salutis** profoundly influenced modern theology, shifting the focus from individualistic and forensic models to communal and historical understandings of salvation. His approach laid groundwork for later developments in **biblical theology** and ecumenical thought, challenging the traditional Reformed loci. While his views were controversial among confessional theologians, his legacy endures in contemporary discussions of the relationship between Christ’s historical work and its application to the church.
