# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann radically reinterpreted the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) by emphasizing the existential encounter with the **kerygma** over any objective sequence of salvific events. For Bultmann, salvation is not a process rooted in historical acts but an existential transformation that occurs as individuals respond in faith to the proclamation of Christ. This approach led him to **demythologize** the New Testament, focusing on the **existential decision** rather than a traditional ordo salutis.

- "What matters is not the objective historicity of the events but their significance as proclaimed in the kerygma." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologizing the New Testament**
    - The biblical narrative must be interpreted existentially, not as a literal record of historical events.
    - Mythological elements are reinterpreted to uncover their existential meaning for the modern person.
    - The focus shifts from salvation history to the individual's confrontation with the message.
    - The kerygma is the locus of meaning, not the sequence of redemptive events.
    - "To demythologize is to interpret the mythological elements in the New Testament existentially." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the decisive event for salvation, not the historical acts themselves.
    - Faith arises from hearing the kerygma, not from tracing a historical ordo salutis.
    - The kerygma calls for a personal, existential response in the present.
    - The meaning of salvation is realized in the act of faith, not in a historical process.
    - "The real meaning of the Christ event is disclosed only in the kerygma." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Salvation**
    - Salvation is an existential event, not a metaphysical or historical process.
    - The individual's decision in faith is central, rather than a sequence of salvific steps.
    - The ordo salutis is replaced by the existential encounter with God in the present.
    - The transformation of the self is the true content of salvation.
    - "Faith is the existential decision by which man opens himself to the future." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Objective Salvation History**
    - Bultmann rejects the notion that salvation is tied to a linear history of redemptive acts.
    - The historical Jesus is less important than the proclaimed Christ of faith.
    - Salvation history is a mythological framework that must be transcended.
    - The focus is on the existential significance of the Christ event, not its historical occurrence.
    - "We cannot use the events of salvation history as objective facts for faith." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Eschatology as Existential Reality**
    - Eschatology is not about future historical events but about the existential now.
    - The decisive moment is always present in the individual's encounter with the kerygma.
    - The end-time is realized whenever faith is awakened in the hearer.
    - The ordo salutis is dissolved into the existential decision of faith.
    - "Eschatology is not a doctrine of future events but a call to decision in the present." (History and Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology by challenging the necessity of a historical sequence for understanding salvation. His emphasis on **existential interpretation** and the centrality of the kerygma influenced both existentialist and post-liberal theological movements. While his radical demythologizing was controversial, it forced theologians to grapple with the relationship between history, faith, and proclamation in new ways. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in debates over the nature of salvation and the interpretation of Scripture.
