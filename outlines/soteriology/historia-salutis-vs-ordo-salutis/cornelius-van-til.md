# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til emphasized the inseparability of **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) within a thoroughly **redemptive-historical** and **covenantal** framework. He insisted that the application of redemption to individuals (**ordo salutis**) must never be abstracted from the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in history (**historia salutis**) by Christ, as both are grounded in the self-revelation of the **triune God** and the unity of **revelation**.

- "The work of Christ in history and the application of that work to the individual are organically related and must not be separated." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- Reformed Dogmatics (lecture notes)
- Essays on Biblical Theology (in The New Testament Student and Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Historia and Ordo Salutis**
    - Stressed that **redemption accomplished** and **redemption applied** are inseparable aspects of one divine work.
    - Warned against separating the historical work of Christ from its existential application.
    - Saw both as rooted in the **covenantal structure** of revelation.
    - Emphasized that the Spirit unites believers to Christ, bridging history and personal experience.
    - "The ordo salutis has meaning only in the context of the historia salutis." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal and Trinitarian Foundation**
    - Located both historia and ordo salutis within the **covenant of grace**.
    - Asserted that all soteriological realities flow from the **triune God’s self-revelation**.
    - Rejected any individualistic or purely existential approach to salvation.
    - Maintained that the church as covenant community is the locus of both history and application.
    - "All of God’s works in history are covenantal and Trinitarian in character." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Advocated for a **redemptive-historical** reading of Scripture.
    - Critiqued approaches that isolated the ordo salutis from the unfolding biblical narrative.
    - Saw Christ as the center of both the accomplishment and application of redemption.
    - Insisted that biblical theology and systematic theology must be integrated.
    - "We must interpret the ordo salutis in light of the historia salutis, not the other way around." (Essays on Biblical Theology)

4. **Epistemological Antithesis**
    - Taught that only the **regenerate mind** can rightly understand the relation between historia and ordo salutis.
    - Emphasized the antithesis between **covenant keepers** and **covenant breakers** in all theological method.
    - Warned against rationalistic or autonomous approaches to soteriology.
    - Held that true knowledge of salvation is possible only by **revelation** and faith.
    - "There is no neutral ground between the believer’s and the unbeliever’s understanding of salvation." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Apologetic Implications**
    - Integrated the historia/ordo distinction into his **presuppositional apologetics**.
    - Argued that the coherence of salvation’s history and application is a uniquely Christian claim.
    - Used the unity of historia and ordo salutis to defend the necessity of **revelation**.
    - Asserted that only the Christian worldview accounts for the meaning of both history and personal experience.
    - "Only on the basis of Christian theism can the facts of redemption and their application be intelligible." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s synthesis of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of biblical theology, covenant theology, and apologetics. His insistence on the organic unity of redemption accomplished and applied has influenced generations of theologians, notably at Westminster Theological Seminary. By rooting both aspects in the **covenantal self-revelation** of the triune God, Van Til provided a robust framework for understanding salvation that resists both individualism and abstraction. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of **redemptive-historical hermeneutics** and presuppositional apologetics.
