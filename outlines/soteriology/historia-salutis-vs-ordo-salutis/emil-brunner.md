# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, approached the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) with a strong emphasis on the existential encounter between God and the individual. He critiqued traditional **Reformed ordo salutis** schemes for their tendency to abstract salvation from the living, historical act of God in Christ, insisting instead on the primacy of the **Christ-event** as the locus of both salvation’s history and its appropriation. For Brunner, salvation is not a sequence of steps but a dynamic, personal encounter rooted in the historical revelation of God.

- "The event of salvation is not a process which can be analyzed into separate stages, but the one act of God in Christ meeting man in his need." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- Man in Revolt: A Christian Anthropology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Christ-Event**
    - Salvation is grounded in the unique, unrepeatable act of God in Jesus Christ.
    - The historical revelation of God in Christ is the center of both **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**.
    - The Christ-event is not merely the beginning of a process but the totality of salvation.
    - All personal appropriation of salvation derives its meaning from this historical act.
    - "The decisive thing is not a process in man, but the act of God in Christ." (The Mediator)

2. **Critique of Ordo Salutis Schematization**
    - Brunner rejects the notion that salvation can be reduced to a logical or temporal sequence of stages.
    - He sees the traditional **ordo salutis** as an abstraction that distorts the biblical witness.
    - The existential encounter with God cannot be systematized into a fixed order.
    - Emphasizes the danger of turning living faith into a mechanical process.
    - "The ordo salutis is not a ladder by which man climbs to God, but the way in which God comes to man." (Dogmatics II)

3. **Existential Encounter and Personal Decision**
    - Salvation is realized in the existential meeting between God and the individual.
    - The human response is not a step in a process but a personal decision enabled by grace.
    - Faith is an event, not a state or stage.
    - The order of salvation is always subordinate to the living encounter with Christ.
    - "Faith is not a stage in a process, but the response to the living Word." (The Mediator)

4. **Revelation as Event, Not Process**
    - Revelation is the act of God breaking into history, not a gradual unfolding.
    - The **historia salutis** is the once-for-all event of Christ’s coming.
    - The appropriation of salvation is always a fresh event, not a repetition of stages.
    - The church’s proclamation is the means by which this event confronts individuals.
    - "Revelation is event, not doctrine or process." (Revelation and Reason)

5. **Unity of Objective and Subjective Salvation**
    - Brunner resists separating the objective work of Christ from its subjective appropriation.
    - The historical act and personal faith are inseparable aspects of one reality.
    - The **ordo salutis** is meaningful only as it expresses the reality of the **historia salutis**.
    - The Spirit unites the believer to Christ’s historical work in a living relationship.
    - "The objective and subjective are one in the act of reconciliation." (Dogmatics II)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s emphasis on the **Christ-event** and existential encounter challenged traditional Reformed formulations of the **ordo salutis**, influencing later discussions in both Protestant and ecumenical theology. His critique of schematized salvation orders contributed to a renewed focus on the centrality of Christ’s historical work and the immediacy of faith. Brunner’s thought remains significant for those seeking to integrate the biblical narrative of redemption with the lived experience of salvation, and his work continues to provoke debate about the relationship between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** in systematic theology.
