### TITLE
Locating the Believer in the History of Redemption: Distinguishing and Integrating Historia salutis and Ordo salutis

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how the once‑for‑all, objective accomplishment of redemption in **historia salutis** relates to its ordered, personal application in **ordo salutis** without collapsing one into the other or tearing them apart.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, Herman Bavinck, Louis Berkhof, G C Berkouwer.
- Traditions: Reformed orthodox and federal theology, classic Protestant soteriology, modern Reformed biblical theology; in contrast with Lutheran and Barthian trajectories where relevant.
- Debates:
  - Internal: ordering and grounding of the **ordo salutis**, priority of union with Christ, tension between systematic and biblical‑theological formulations.
  - External: Lutheran ordo vs Reformed federal emphasis, Barth’s rejection of a traditional ordo in favor of an exclusively Christological **historia salutis**, existentialist and liberal dissolutions of both.
  - Contemporary: ordo as “mechanical,” pastoral use of the ordo, the relation to the already/not‑yet of eschatology, challenges from the “new perspective” and union‑with‑Christ movements.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed account in which a robust, covenantal **historia salutis** in Christ is the ontological and eschatological ground of a carefully distinguished but flexibly conceived **ordo salutis**, structured by **union with Christ** and the forensic‑transformative duplex of **justification** and **sanctification**.

### ESSAY
The distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** arose within Reformed theology to answer a simple but far‑reaching question: how does the once‑for‑all, objective work of God in redemptive history relate to the manifold, ordered experiences of salvation in the individual believer? Unless that question is handled with conceptual precision, either the work of Christ in history risks becoming a distant “background condition” for salvation, or the rich, ordered texture of the believer’s participation in Christ gets flattened into a shapeless appeal to the cross and resurrection. The Reformed tradition, at its best, has insisted that both poles are indispensable: a concrete, covenantal **history of salvation** in which Christ, as second Adam, accomplishes redemption in time, and a divinely ordered **application of salvation** by the Spirit in which the elect are effectually called, united to Christ, justified, adopted, sanctified, and finally glorified. The challenge is to show how these relate without confusion or separation.

John Calvin is not yet using the technical vocabulary of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, but his theology supplies the deep structures that later Reformed thought will formalize. Working in the upheaval of the sixteenth‑century Reformation, Calvin labors to secure the sufficiency and finality of Christ’s work against both Roman notions of infused righteousness and Anabaptist spiritualism. He insists that Christ’s obedience, death, resurrection, and ascension are objective, once‑for‑all acts in history, in which the Son, as mediator, fulfills the law, bears the curse, conquers death, and pours out the Spirit. That is the **historia salutis** in substance. Yet Calvin is just as concerned to trace how this saving work reaches particular sinners. His famous duplex gratia formulation encapsulates this: from union with Christ arise the twin benefits of **justification** and **sanctification**, inseparable but distinct, forensic and renovative, gift and transformation. Underneath this duplex gratia stands a clear, if not fully schematized, **ordo salutis**: the Spirit brings us to faith through the preaching of the gospel, unites us to Christ, in that union we receive justification and renewal, and are preserved unto glory. Calvin will not allow the believer’s experience to collapse into timeless mystical union; it is tethered to the historical Christ, crucified and risen “once for all” in the fullness of time.

A Westminster examiner is likely to press: does Calvin teach that union with Christ temporally precedes justification, or are they simply different aspects of the same relation? The answer requires acknowledging an ordo in the sense of a logical and causal ordering without always demanding a rigid temporal sequence. For Calvin, the Spirit’s uniting act is the fountain; justification and sanctification are the two streams. Rheme changes in emphasis through his works do not eliminate this basic structure. What matters for our locus is that Calvin already holds together an objective, historical accomplishment and its ordered subjective bestowal. Later Reformed orthodox theologians will name these poles **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** and develop them with greater formal clarity.

The explicit historia–ordo distinction emerges most fully in the context of **federal theology** and the rise of Reformed orthodoxy. Herman Bavinck stands here as a crucial bridge between the seventeenth‑century federalists and twentieth‑century Reformed dogmatics. Operating in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, deeply shaped by Kuyperian neo‑Calvinism yet immersed in the older scholastic material, Bavinck insists that revelation unfolds in history, that the trinitarian God executes an eternal decree in time through covenants culminating in Christ as the last Adam. This is the redemptive **historia salutis**, from the protoevangelium to the incarnation, atoning death, resurrection, ascension, and Pentecost. Yet Bavinck is equally insistent that God saves not abstractions but concrete persons, and that Scripture itself speaks of regeneration, effectual calling, faith, repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification in relations of dependence and order. He calls this the **ordo salutis**, an ordered complex of saving benefits given in Christ by the Spirit.

Bavinck’s decisive contribution is to refuse a false dilemma: either a historical, covenantal emphasis that sidelines personal application, or a psychological sequence of experiences abstracted from Christ’s once‑for‑all work. By placing both under the covenant of grace and rooting both in **union with Christ**, he argues that the **historia salutis** in Christ is the archetype and ground of the **ordo salutis** in believers. Christ himself passes through the great saving “states” of humiliation and exaltation, bearing sin, dying, rising, and entering glory; believers, united to him, participate analogically in this pattern through justification, sanctification, and glorification. Here the history‑order relation is not merely causal but typological and eschatological. Everything that happens to the believer happens “in Christ” and therefore derives from what has already happened in Christ in history.

This sets the stage for the most programmatic articulation of the distinction in Geerhardus Vos. Vos, a founding figure of Reformed biblical theology at Princeton, deliberately coined and sharpened the technical vocabulary of **historia salutis** in conversation with **ordo salutis**. For Vos, fighting on two fronts against liberal historicism and against a purely dogmatic ordo divorced from biblical exegesis, the distinction was a critical tool. Liberals reduced salvation to religious consciousness and moral influence; some conservative theologians, in reaction, drew their entire doctrine of salvation from the introspective analysis of the believer’s experience. Vos argues that Scripture itself is first and foremost a record of redemptive history, a chronicle of God’s mighty deeds, climaxing in Christ’s work. This is **historia salutis** in the strict sense: the drama of creation, fall, covenant, and Christ’s twofold state, concluded and sealed in the once‑for‑all events of cross and resurrection.

But Vos does not abandon **ordo salutis**. Instead, he re locates it: ordo is the application of the benefits of that finished history by the exalted Christ through the Spirit. Where Bavinck integrates the two in covenantal dogmatics, Vos reframes them in biblical‑theological terms. The key relation is eschatological. Christ, in his resurrection, inaugurates the age to come; in him the new creation is already a reality. The **ordo salutis** is thus the Spirit’s way of bringing individual sinners into that eschatological reality here and now. Effectual calling is the historical Christ calling through the preached word; regeneration is the life of the risen Christ imparted; justification is God’s verdict on the believer that echoes his verdict on Christ raised; sanctification is participation in Christ’s resurrection power; glorification is sharing finally in Christ’s exalted state. Vos’s formulation protects **historia salutis** from being reduced to background information and prevents **ordo salutis** from being an autonomous scheme of “stages” independent of Christ’s person and work.

An examiner might object that Vos’s emphasis on redemptive history relativizes a stable order of application. If all that matters is incorporation into history, is the classic ordo still necessary? Vos’s own practice shows that he does not discard the ordo but rather insists it must be exegetically grounded and Christologically derived. He will still speak of calling, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification in a coherent pattern. What he denies is that this pattern is an abstract ladder of experience that can be preached or analyzed apart from the **Christ event**. The ordo is a map for locating the believer within the historia.

The influence of Bavinck and Vos is mediated to much of contemporary Reformed theology through figures like Louis Berkhof and G C Berkouwer, whose treatments of the distinction reveal both its strengths and its fault lines. Berkhof, writing his Systematic Theology in the early twentieth century, codifies the classic Reformed **ordo salutis** as the standard dogmatic sequence: effectual calling, regeneration, conversion encompassing faith and repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and glorification. He carefully distinguishes the logical and causal relations, notes certain simultaneous or co‑incident acts, and tends to regard the order as more than merely pedagogical. The **historia salutis** appears in his works primarily in the loci of Christology and covenant, rather than as an explicit, unified category. Nevertheless, the logical architecture of his ordo presupposes a fixed, once‑for‑all accomplishment by Christ that is then distributed by the Spirit. The criticism often leveled against Berkhof is that his systematization risks turning the ordo into a quasi mechanical procession of discrete “steps,” capable of being taught and experienced almost independently of close contact with the Gospels’ presentation of Christ’s work.

Berkouwer represents a self‑conscious internal critique at this point. Writing mid twentieth century in the dogmatics series “Studies in Dogmatics,” he explicitly engages with Barth, neo orthodoxy, and existentialist theologies while remaining confessionally Reformed. Berkouwer worries that the ordo, as used in certain scholastic and pietist traditions, can foster “objectivation” of salvation: a catalogue of states and acts which the believer must identify in himself, bordering on introspective legalism. He does not reject **ordo salutis** as such, but calls for its **christological relativization**. That is, he wants to insist with Barth that Christ himself is the electing God and elected man, that in him salvation is accomplished once for all, and that all application must be understood as sharing in this once for allness. Yet unlike Barth, Berkouwer does not dissolve the application into pure **historia salutis**. He retains talk of calling, faith, justification, sanctification, and perseverance, but insists that these be treated as facets of the one benefit “salvation in Christ” and that a rigid temporalizing order must not be imposed where Scripture does not support it.

Here the external debate with Barth clarifies the stakes. Barth, reacting against liberalism and against certain Protestant orthodox schemas, levels a powerful critique of the traditional **ordo salutis**. To his mind, any talk of a sequence of benefits applied to the individual threatens to place the believer’s story alongside Christ’s story, and hence to reintroduce synergism or a quasi autonomous religious subject. For Barth, all salvation is contained in the event of Jesus Christ, in whom God elected humanity and reconciled the world. The only “order” is the internal, triune ordering of this one gracious decision and act. Human “participation” is a matter of recognizing what is already objectively true in Christ. The examiner might summarize the Barthian worry as: does your ordo imply that there are multiple salvations, a Christ event plus a series of spiritual events in me?

The Reformed response, from Bavinck through Vos and Berkouwer, is to insist that this is a false alternative. There is one salvation, accomplished once for all in the **historia salutis** of Christ and applied in the **ordo salutis** by the Spirit. The ordo is not a second, parallel history but the personal, Spirit wrought sharing in Christ’s once for all history. The relation is sacramental, not additive. Because Christ died once for sins, I may now be justified; because he rose, I may now be made alive; because he is seated in heavenly glory, I shall one day be glorified. Denying or flattening the ordo risks collapsing the distinction between redemption accomplished and redemption applied, which Scripture itself maintains. Paul’s letters speak in both tenses: “you have been justified,” “you are being sanctified,” “you will be glorified.” Hebrews treats Christ’s once for all offering in the past as the ground of a present heavenly priesthood and a future consummation. Without **ordo salutis**, that grammar of already and not yet, of accomplished and applied, is obscured.

Internally within the Reformed tradition, the most significant debates cluster around three issues: the priority and nature of **union with Christ**, the ordering of faith and justification, and the place of regeneration in relation to effectual calling and conversion. Union with Christ, especially in the wake of Calvin and highlighted by Bavinck and Vos, has increasingly been seen as the overarching category under which the ordo’s particular benefits are to be coordinated. Does this mean that union itself is a discrete step in the order, temporally prior to justification and sanctification? Or is union the comprehensive reality of which justification and sanctification are distinct aspects? The best answer, in line with Calvin and Bavinck, is to distinguish a decretal union in election, a judicial union in the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, and a vital union in the communication of Christ’s life. The **ordo salutis** concerns the historical inception of that vital and judicial union through faith. Union then is both the fountainhead of the benefits and, considered under its existential inception, one element within the ordered application.

Similarly, Reformed theologians insist that faith is logically prior to justification as the instrument by which Christ is received, but causally dependent on effectual calling and regeneration. When examiners press whether regeneration temporally precedes faith, a distinction must be made between an initial, illuminating and vivifying work of the Spirit and the full reality of definitive sanctification which flows from union with the risen Christ. The ordo’s task is precisely to maintain such distinctions while anchoring each step firmly in the **historia salutis** and in **union with Christ**.

Contemporary debates often reframe these issues in eschatological and ecclesiological terms. The renewed emphasis on inaugurated eschatology and the already/not yet has underlined that the **historia salutis** does not terminate at the cross but includes resurrection, ascension, Pentecost, and Christ’s present reign. The Spirit we receive in the ordo is the eschatological Spirit poured out by the exalted Christ. The church’s sacramental life, in word and sacrament, is itself an arena where historia and ordo intersect: baptism and the Supper are signs and seals of benefits accomplished by Christ in history and distributed by him to believers in ordered fashion. Ecclesiologically impoverished presentations of the ordo can sound like a purely individualistic itinerary of experiences; a robust account locates the believer’s ordered salvation within the corporate, covenantal **history of salvation**.

At the same time, movements emphasizing “union with Christ” and critiquing a so called “legalistic” ordo have raised valuable cautions but sometimes at the expense of clarity. When justification, adoption, and sanctification are collapsed into a single, undifferentiated “union,” forensic and renovative aspects of salvation blur, leading to confusion in assurance and pastoral application. Precisely here the classic Reformed **ordo salutis**, read through Bavinck and Vos rather than a mechanistic Berkhof caricature, shows its value. It insists that all benefits are given in union with Christ, yet also that within that union there is a definite structure: justification is a once for all legal declaration grounded in Christ’s righteousness; sanctification is a progressive work of renewal flowing from union; adoption secures our filial status. Preaching and pastoral care need this architecture to speak law and gospel, assurance and exhortation, with integrity.

My own defended position, therefore, is as follows. The distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** is a necessary and fruitful dogmatic tool within Reformed theology, provided it is handled within a framework of **federal theology**, **union with Christ**, and inaugurated eschatology. The **historia salutis** is the once for all, covenantally structured accomplishment of salvation in the person and work of Christ as second Adam. The **ordo salutis** is the Spirit’s ordered application of those benefits to the elect in union with Christ, an order that is logical and causal rather than always strictly temporal, and that resists both mechanical schematization and Christological flattening. Against Barth, one must maintain a real order of application if the distinction between redemption accomplished and redemption applied is to be preserved. Against certain scholastic tendencies, one must resist turning the ordo into an independent grid imposed on Scripture’s own redemptive‑historical narrative. The ordo must be exegetically shaped, Christologically grounded, ecclesiologically located, and pastorally employed.

In oral examination, this position should be defended by moving adroitly between loci. From Christology and covenant one draws a rich **historia salutis** in which Christ, as federal head, fulfills all righteousness, bears the curse, rises, and is exalted. From soteriology one shows how each benefit in the **ordo salutis** is a distinct mode of participation in that history by the Spirit through faith. From eschatology one underlines that the Spirit brings the powers of the age to come into the present, and that the ordo is the way individual believers are situated between the already of Christ’s resurrection and the not yet of consummated glory. If examiners press whether the ordo is merely pedagogical, one should answer that while the precise subordering of some elements is indeed pedagogical, the broad structure is ontological and covenantal, rooted in the triune God’s way of saving sinners in Christ and by the Spirit. The distinction, rightly managed, does not divide Christ from his benefits but clarifies how the crucified and risen Lord, once for all given in **history**, gives himself in an ordered way to his people.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **historia salutis** is the once for all, covenantal **history of salvation** accomplished by Christ as second Adam; **ordo salutis** is the Spirit’s ordered **application of salvation** to the elect in **union with Christ**, as they are effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and glorified.
- Decisive figures:
  - Calvin: duplex gratia and union with Christ as fountain of an implicit **ordo salutis**, already linking objective work and personal application.
  - Bavinck: integrates **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** within **federal theology**, rooting both in covenant and union with Christ.
  - Vos: sharpens the distinction, framing ordo as eschatological participation in redemptive history, insisting on biblical‑theological grounding.
  - Berkhof: codifies a classic ordered sequence of saving benefits, risking mechanization when abstracted from **historia salutis**.
  - Berkouwer: critiques objectified ordo, calls for Christological relativization while retaining a real order of application.
- Debates:
  - Internal: priority and nature of **union with Christ** in the ordo, faith and justification sequencing, regeneration versus calling and conversion, the balance between systematic order and redemptive‑historical focus.
  - External: Lutheran versus Reformed emphases, Barth’s collapse of ordo into **historia salutis**, liberal and existential dissolution of both into religious experience.
  - Contemporary: charges that the ordo is “mechanical,” union‑with‑Christ movements that risk flattening forensic and renovative distinctions, eschatological and ecclesiological reframings of application.
- Defended position: Maintain a robust, covenantal **historia salutis** in Christ as ontological ground and pattern for a carefully distinguished, Christocentric **ordo salutis**, structured by **union with Christ** and the duplex of **justification** and **sanctification**, with the order logical and causal rather than rigidly temporal.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - How do you distinguish but relate redemption accomplished and applied? By affirming a once for all **historia salutis** in Christ, applied in an ordered, Spirit wrought **ordo salutis** grounded in union with Christ.
  - Is the ordo salutis merely pedagogical? Some subordering is pedagogical, but broadly the ordo reflects real causal and logical relations in God’s saving work.
  - Where does union with Christ fit in the ordo? Union is the overarching reality in which all benefits are given and, as vitally and judicially realized through faith, is the fountain of justification and sanctification.
  - How do you respond to Barth’s critique of the ordo? By insisting that the ordo does not add to Christ’s work but is the personal participation in that one work by the Spirit, preserving the biblical distinction between accomplished and applied redemption.
  - Does emphasizing an order risk pastoral legalism? Not if Christ and his **historia salutis** remain central, and the ordo is used to direct believers away from self analysis toward the ordered fullness of benefits in Christ.
