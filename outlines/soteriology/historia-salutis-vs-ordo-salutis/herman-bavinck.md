# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck distinguished carefully between the **historia salutis** (the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in history) and the **ordo salutis** (the application of salvation to individuals). He emphasized that the **objective work of Christ** in redemptive history grounds and makes possible the **subjective appropriation** of salvation by believers, while warning against separating these aspects or reducing salvation to mere individual experience.

- "The application of salvation is rooted in its accomplishment; the ordo salutis is grounded in the historia salutis." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- "Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "Saved by Grace: The Holy Spirit’s Work in Calling and Regeneration"
- John Bolt, "Bavinck on the Order of Salvation: An Essay on Reformed Soteriology" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Historia Salutis**
   - The historical acts of **God in Christ** are the foundation for all salvation.
   - The **incarnation, atonement, resurrection, and Pentecost** are unique, unrepeatable events.
   - The **ordo salutis** derives its meaning and efficacy from these redemptive-historical events.
   - Bavinck resists any view that abstracts salvation from its historical accomplishment.
   - "The facts of redemption precede and ground the application of redemption." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.114)

2. **Organic Relationship Between Historia and Ordo Salutis**
   - The two are not opposed but are organically connected in the outworking of **God’s covenant**.
   - The **Holy Spirit** applies what Christ accomplished, uniting believers to Him.
   - The **ordo salutis** is not a mechanical sequence but a living participation in Christ’s benefits.
   - Bavinck stresses the unity of the **objective** and **subjective** aspects of salvation.
   - "The application of salvation is the continuation and fulfillment of its accomplishment." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.115)

3. **Rejection of Individualistic Reductionism**
   - Bavinck warns against reducing salvation to a series of **subjective experiences**.
   - The **ordo salutis** must be understood within the broader context of **redemptive history**.
   - He critiques pietistic and rationalistic tendencies that isolate the individual from the work of Christ.
   - The church and means of grace are essential in the application of salvation.
   - "The ordo salutis is not an individualistic process but is rooted in the communion of saints." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.117)

4. **Emphasis on Union with Christ**
   - **Union with Christ** is the central reality connecting historia and ordo salutis.
   - All benefits of salvation flow from this union, both historically accomplished and personally applied.
   - The Spirit’s work is to unite believers to the risen Christ, not merely to impart blessings.
   - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification, glorification).
   - "All the benefits of salvation are found in union with Christ." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.256)

5. **Covenantal and Trinitarian Framework**
   - The **covenant of grace** provides the structure for understanding both historia and ordo salutis.
   - The **Trinitarian** work of Father, Son, and Spirit is evident in both accomplishment and application.
   - The church as covenant community is the context for the Spirit’s application of redemption.
   - Bavinck integrates **election, atonement, and regeneration** within this unified framework.
   - "The whole of salvation is the work of the triune God in covenant with His people." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 4.114)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced distinction and integration of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** have shaped modern Reformed theology’s approach to soteriology. His emphasis on the organic unity of Christ’s work and its application has influenced theologians seeking to avoid both **individualistic reductionism** and abstract historicism. Bavinck’s covenantal and Trinitarian synthesis remains a touchstone for contemporary discussions on the relationship between redemptive history and personal salvation.
