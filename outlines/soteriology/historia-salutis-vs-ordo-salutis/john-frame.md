# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the distinction between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) through his broader commitment to **multiperspectivalism** and the centrality of **redemptive history** in Reformed theology. He affirms the importance of both the objective, once-for-all accomplishment of salvation in history and the subjective application of salvation to individuals, emphasizing that these perspectives are mutually interpreting and inseparable within the covenantal framework.

- "The historia salutis and the ordo salutis are not two different gospels, but two perspectives on the one gospel of Jesus Christ." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- "Redemption: Accomplished and Applied" (in Contemporary Evangelical Thought, ed. Frame)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectival Approach to Salvation**
    - Frame insists that **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** are complementary perspectives, not competing doctrines.
    - He applies his triperspectival method, relating the historical, existential, and normative aspects of salvation.
    - Both the objective work of Christ and its subjective application are necessary for a full understanding of redemption.
    - This approach guards against reductionism in soteriology.
    - "We must not separate the accomplishment of redemption from its application, for both are essential to the gospel." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

2. **Centrality of Redemptive History**
    - Frame highlights the foundational role of **redemptive history** in understanding the gospel.
    - He affirms that the events of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are the basis for all salvation.
    - The historical acts of God are the context in which the benefits of salvation are applied.
    - The **covenant of grace** unfolds in history, shaping both historia and ordo salutis.
    - "The work of Christ in history is the ground of every blessing we receive in him." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Application of Salvation in Covenant Context**
    - Frame situates the **ordo salutis** within the broader covenantal relationship between God and his people.
    - The application of salvation is not merely individualistic but is tied to the corporate people of God.
    - The Spirit’s work in applying redemption is inseparable from the historical accomplishment.
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) connect the individual to the historical work of Christ.
    - "The ordo salutis is the outworking of God’s covenant promises in the lives of his people." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Integration of Doctrine and Life**
    - Frame insists that doctrinal distinctions must serve the life and mission of the church.
    - The historia/ordo distinction is valuable only as it leads to worship and obedience.
    - Theology must be practical, connecting the work of Christ to the believer’s daily experience.
    - The unity of doctrine and life reflects the unity of Christ’s work and its application.
    - "Theology is for living, and the doctrines of salvation must shape our lives." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Guarding Against False Dichotomies**
    - Frame warns against separating **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** as if they were unrelated.
    - He critiques tendencies to emphasize one at the expense of the other in contemporary theology.
    - Both perspectives are needed to preserve the fullness of the Reformed gospel.
    - The unity of Christ’s work and its application is essential for sound doctrine and assurance.
    - "To divide historia and ordo is to risk distorting the gospel itself." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s integration of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** within a multiperspectival and covenantal framework has influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of redemptive history and the application of salvation. His approach has encouraged theologians and pastors to avoid false dichotomies and to see the unity of Christ’s work and its benefits. Frame’s emphasis on the practical outworking of doctrine continues to shape Reformed soteriology and the life of the church.
