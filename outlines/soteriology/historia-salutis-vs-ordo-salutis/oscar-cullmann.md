# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann was a pivotal figure in 20th-century biblical theology, renowned for his emphasis on the distinction between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation). He argued that the New Testament is fundamentally oriented toward the unfolding of **redemptive history** in Christ, rather than abstracting salvation into a sequence of individual experiences. Cullmann’s approach foregrounded the centrality of **salvation history** as the framework for understanding Christian doctrine and eschatology.

- "The New Testament is not interested in the individual’s experience of salvation as such, but in the once-for-all event of salvation in Christ." (Christ and Time)

## Key Works

- Christ and Time: The Primitive Christian Conception of Time and History
- Salvation in History
- The Christology of the New Testament
- Early Christian Worship
- The State in the New Testament

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Salvation History (historia salutis)**
    - Emphasizes the unique, unrepeatable acts of God in history, culminating in Christ.
    - Views biblical revelation as unfolding through a linear, historical process.
    - Argues that the New Testament centers on the objective events of redemption.
    - Sees the resurrection and parousia as pivotal moments in **redemptive history**.
    - "The decisive point in salvation history is the Christ-event." (Christ and Time)

2. **Critique of Ordo Salutis Abstraction**
    - Warns against detaching salvation from its historical context.
    - Criticizes theological systems that prioritize individual experience over historical events.
    - Maintains that the **ordo salutis** is secondary to the biblical narrative.
    - Sees existential or psychological approaches as insufficient for biblical theology.
    - "The New Testament does not describe a process of salvation in the soul, but a process in history." (Christ and Time)

3. **Centrality of Christ’s Once-for-All Work**
    - Affirms the uniqueness and finality of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection.
    - Argues that all aspects of salvation flow from the historical Christ-event.
    - Rejects any repetition or extension of Christ’s salvific work in individual experience.
    - Stresses the objective reality of salvation accomplished in history.
    - "The Christ-event is the center of all history and the basis for all salvation." (Salvation in History)

4. **Eschatological Orientation of Salvation**
    - Frames salvation within the tension of the "already" and "not yet."
    - Sees the resurrection as inaugurating the new age, with consummation still future.
    - Emphasizes the forward-looking hope of the **parousia**.
    - Interprets Christian existence as living between decisive historical events.
    - "The Christian lives between D-Day and V-Day in the history of salvation." (Christ and Time)

5. **Biblical Theology as Historical Theology**
    - Advocates for a method that prioritizes the historical sequence of revelation.
    - Insists that theology must be grounded in the unfolding narrative of Scripture.
    - Rejects systematic abstraction in favor of a chronological, event-based approach.
    - Sees the unity of Scripture in its historical progression toward Christ.
    - "Biblical theology is essentially a theology of history." (Salvation in History)

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** profoundly shaped modern biblical theology, challenging both existentialist and purely systematic approaches. His insistence on the centrality of **redemptive history** influenced generations of scholars and contributed to renewed interest in the narrative structure of Scripture. While some criticized his sharp dichotomy, his work remains foundational for understanding the relationship between the historical acts of God and individual appropriation of salvation. Cullmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of biblical theology and the interpretation of salvation in the New Testament.
