# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the relationship between **historia salutis** (the history of salvation) and **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation) through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the dynamic encounter between the divine and human history. Rather than focusing on a sequential application of salvation to individuals, Tillich stressed the significance of the **Christ-event** as the central moment in the history of salvation, which grounds all personal experience of salvation. For Tillich, the existential appropriation of salvation is inseparable from the historical manifestation of the **New Being** in Christ.

- "The event of Christ is the central event in history, and it is the basis for the possibility of salvation for all men." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Christ-Event in Salvation History**
    - The **Christ-event** is the decisive moment in **historia salutis**.
    - All individual experiences of salvation derive their meaning from this historical event.
    - The **New Being** revealed in Christ transforms the existential situation of humanity.
    - Salvation is not merely a sequence but a participation in the reality inaugurated by Christ.
    - "The appearance of the New Being in Jesus as the Christ is the central event of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Ordo Salutis**
    - The traditional **ordo salutis** is reinterpreted through existential categories.
    - Stages like **justification** and **sanctification** are understood as existential responses to the Christ-event.
    - The focus shifts from a fixed sequence to the individual's encounter with the ground of being.
    - Salvation is realized in the existential acceptance of **grace**.
    - "The ordo salutis is not a temporal sequence but a structure of existential relations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of Objective and Subjective Salvation**
    - Tillich rejects a strict separation between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**.
    - The objective act of God in history and the subjective appropriation are dialectically related.
    - The historical revelation in Christ is actualized in personal experience.
    - The **Spirit** mediates the historical event to the individual.
    - "The work of the Spirit is to make the event of Christ present in the personal life of each believer." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Symbolic and Ontological Approach to Salvation**
    - Salvation history and its application are understood symbolically, not literally.
    - The **symbols** of Christian faith point to ultimate reality and existential transformation.
    - The historical and existential dimensions of salvation are united in the symbol of the **New Being**.
    - Ontological estrangement is overcome through participation in the Christ-event.
    - "Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, and the symbol of the Christ-event is the foundation of salvation." (Dynamics of Faith)

5. **Critique of Mechanistic Ordo Salutis**
    - Tillich critiques the traditional, mechanistic sequence of salvation steps.
    - He argues that such an approach abstracts salvation from its existential and historical roots.
    - The dynamic encounter with the divine cannot be reduced to a formulaic order.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing, existential nature of salvation rather than a completed process.
    - "The ordo salutis becomes a distortion if it is understood as a mechanical sequence of acts." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s integration of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** through existential and ontological categories has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the interpretation of salvation. His emphasis on the **Christ-event** as both a historical and existential reality challenged traditional Reformed distinctions and inspired new approaches to soteriology. Tillich’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between history, personal experience, and the meaning of salvation in contemporary theology.
