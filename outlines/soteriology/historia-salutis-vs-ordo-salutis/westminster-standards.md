# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust distinction between the **historia salutis** (the history of salvation accomplished in redemptive events) and the **ordo salutis** (the order of salvation applied to individuals). While the Standards emphasize the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in **Christ’s work**, they also systematically outline the application of that redemption through the **effectual calling**, **justification**, **adoption**, and **sanctification** of believers. This dual focus ensures a comprehensive understanding of both the objective and subjective aspects of salvation.

- "They whom God hath predestinated unto life, he is pleased in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by his Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ." (Westminster Confession of Faith 10.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive Accomplishment in Christ (Historia Salutis)**
    - Christ’s work is the once-for-all foundation for salvation.
    - The Standards root all benefits for the elect in the historical events of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection.
    - The covenant of grace is administered through historical epochs culminating in Christ.
    - The historical accomplishment is distinct from its application to individuals.
    - "The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself... hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father." (WCF 8.5)

2. **Application of Redemption (Ordo Salutis)**
    - Salvation is applied to individuals through a divinely ordered sequence.
    - The ordo salutis includes effectual calling, justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification.
    - Each stage is grounded in union with Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The application is personal and experiential, distinct from the historical accomplishment.
    - "All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, he is pleased... to call, justify, adopt, sanctify, and glorify." (WCF 3.6)

3. **Union with Christ as the Nexus**
    - Union with Christ is the vital link between historia salutis and ordo salutis.
    - All saving benefits flow from this union, both historically accomplished and personally applied.
    - The Standards emphasize that believers are united to Christ by faith through the Spirit.
    - This union ensures the inseparability of Christ’s work and its application.
    - "They that are effectually called... are by his Spirit united to Christ." (WLC Q.66)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
    - The covenant of grace provides the framework for both the history and order of salvation.
    - The Standards trace the administration of the covenant through redemptive history.
    - The benefits of the covenant are applied to the elect in an ordered manner.
    - This structure safeguards both the objective and subjective dimensions of salvation.
    - "Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.3)

5. **Assurance and Perseverance**
    - The ordo salutis includes the assurance of salvation and perseverance of the saints.
    - Assurance is grounded in the finished work of Christ (historia salutis) and the Spirit’s testimony (ordo salutis).
    - Perseverance is both a historical promise and an experiential reality for believers.
    - The Standards teach that true believers will certainly persevere to the end.
    - "They whom God hath accepted in his Beloved... can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace." (WCF 17.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** understanding of the relationship between the accomplishment and application of salvation. Their careful distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** has influenced generations of theologians and provided a framework for systematic theology and pastoral ministry. The Standards’ covenantal and Christocentric approach continues to guide confessional Reformed churches in articulating the fullness of the gospel.
