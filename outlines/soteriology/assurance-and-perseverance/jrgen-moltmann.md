# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann situates **assurance** and **perseverance** within the framework of **eschatological hope** and the **faithfulness of God**. He emphasizes that assurance is grounded in the **objective promise of the resurrection** and the communal work of the **Spirit** as the church anticipates the **coming Kingdom**.

- "Faith, wherever it develops into hope, causes not rest but unrest, not patience but impatience." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Spirit of Life (1991)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance rooted in eschatological promise**
    - Assurance is grounded in the **future fulfillment** of God's promises, not merely present experience.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the **objective basis** for Christian hope and confidence.
    - The believer's assurance is communal, tied to the destiny of the **people of God**.
    - Assurance is dynamic, oriented toward the **coming Kingdom** rather than static possession.
    - "The resurrection is not only the foundation of faith, but also the foundation of hope." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Perseverance as participation in the Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** sustains believers in the journey toward the eschaton.
    - Perseverance is not self-generated but a gift of the Spirit's ongoing presence.
    - The Spirit empowers the church to live in anticipation of God's future.
    - Perseverance is communal, involving mutual encouragement within the body of Christ.
    - "The Spirit is the power of the resurrection and the anticipation of the new creation." (The Spirit of Life)

3. **Assurance and perseverance shaped by the cross and resurrection**
    - The **Crucified God** reveals that assurance is found in solidarity with Christ's suffering and victory.
    - The resurrection guarantees that suffering and doubt do not have the final word.
    - Perseverance is possible because Christ has gone before and opened the way.
    - Assurance is not triumphalistic but marked by hope amid suffering.
    - "God weeps with us so that we may someday laugh with him." (The Crucified God)

4. **Communal and historical dimensions of assurance**
    - Assurance is not merely individual but involves the **community of faith**.
    - The church is called to embody hope in history, persevering together.
    - The story of God's people is one of ongoing struggle and expectation.
    - Assurance is sustained through participation in the church's worship and mission.
    - "The church is the community of hope, living from the future of Christ." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Assurance and perseverance as protest and anticipation**
    - Christian hope protests against the status quo and refuses resignation.
    - Assurance leads to active engagement in the world, not passive waiting.
    - Perseverance involves resisting despair and working for justice.
    - The believer lives in anticipation, embodying the values of the coming Kingdom.
    - "Hope finds in Christ not only a consolation in suffering, but also the protest of the divine promise against suffering." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **assurance** and **perseverance** has reoriented theological discussions toward an **eschatological** and communal horizon, challenging individualistic and static models. His emphasis on the **Spirit** and the **future of God** has influenced contemporary theology’s understanding of Christian hope, perseverance, and the church’s mission. Moltmann’s integration of suffering, protest, and anticipation continues to shape ecumenical and liberationist perspectives on the Christian life.
