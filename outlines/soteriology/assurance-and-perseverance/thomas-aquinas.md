# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **assurance** and **perseverance** within the framework of **grace**, **free will**, and the **virtue of hope**. He taught that while **final perseverance** is a special gift of God and cannot be absolutely assured in this life, believers can possess a **conjectural certainty** rooted in faith and the operation of the Holy Spirit. Aquinas distinguished between the certainty of faith in God’s promises and the uncertainty regarding one’s own ultimate perseverance.

- "Since no one can be certain of his own predestination, all the more he cannot be certain that he will persevere in grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 10, ad 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Perseverance as a Gift of Grace**
    - Final perseverance is not merely a human achievement but a special gift granted by God.
    - It is distinct from habitual grace and is necessary for salvation.
    - No one can merit the gift of perseverance by their own works or efforts.
    - God alone determines who receives this grace, according to His providence.
    - "Perseverance is not in our power, but is given by God alone." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 10)

2. **Conjectural Assurance, Not Absolute Certainty**
    - Humans cannot have absolute certainty of their own perseverance or salvation in this life.
    - Assurance is possible only in a conjectural or moral sense, based on present faith and works.
    - The virtue of hope allows believers to trust in God’s promises without presumption.
    - Doubt and fear serve to foster humility and dependence on God.
    - "No one can know with the certainty of faith that he is in the state of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 112, a. 5)

3. **Role of Free Will and Cooperation**
    - Human free will is not destroyed by grace but enabled to cooperate with it.
    - Perseverance involves the ongoing cooperation of the will with divine grace.
    - The will can resist grace, but God’s gift of perseverance ensures final fidelity.
    - The mystery of predestination does not negate the reality of human responsibility.
    - "God so moves the will that man is able to resist if he so wills." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 10, a. 4)

4. **Virtue of Hope and Spiritual Progress**
    - The theological virtue of hope sustains believers in their journey toward salvation.
    - Hope is oriented toward eternal life and relies on God’s omnipotence and mercy.
    - Despair and presumption are both vices opposed to true hope.
    - Spiritual progress is marked by growth in hope, faith, and charity.
    - "By hope we trust in God for obtaining eternal life and the means necessary for attaining it." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 17, a. 1)

5. **Predestination and Divine Providence**
    - Predestination is rooted in God’s eternal will and foreknowledge.
    - God’s providence orders all things, including the perseverance of the elect.
    - The mystery of predestination is ultimately inscrutable to human reason.
    - Assurance of salvation is not grounded in self-knowledge but in trust in God’s mercy.
    - "Predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 23, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s nuanced treatment of **assurance** and **perseverance** shaped later Catholic doctrine, emphasizing the necessity of grace and the limits of human certainty regarding salvation. His distinction between **conjectural assurance** and absolute certainty influenced both medieval and post-Reformation debates. Aquinas’s synthesis of **grace**, **free will**, and **predestination** remains foundational for Catholic theology and continues to inform ecumenical discussions on the perseverance of the saints.
