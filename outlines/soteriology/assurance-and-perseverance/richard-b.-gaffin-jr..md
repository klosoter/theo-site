# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. grounds the doctrines of **assurance** and **perseverance** in the believer’s **union with Christ**, emphasizing that assurance is not an add-on but integral to salvation as applied by the Holy Spirit. He maintains that perseverance is a result of the Spirit’s work, not human effort, thus upholding the classic Reformed doctrine of the **perseverance of the saints**.

- "Assurance is not a separate blessing in addition to salvation but is integral to the salvation believers have in union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit"
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment"
- Contributions to "The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century" (especially on perseverance and assurance)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is grounded in union with Christ**
    - Assurance flows from the believer’s participation in Christ’s finished work.
    - The objective reality of salvation in Christ is the foundation for subjective assurance.
    - Assurance is not primarily introspective but Christocentric.
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s benefits, giving assurance through faith.
    "Assurance is inseparable from faith itself, as both are rooted in union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Perseverance is Spirit-wrought, not self-generated**
    - The perseverance of the saints is a work of the Holy Spirit, not human effort.
    - True believers are preserved by God’s power through faith.
    - Perseverance is the necessary outcome of genuine union with Christ.
    - The Spirit’s ongoing ministry ensures believers will not finally fall away.
    "Perseverance is not a human achievement but a divine gift realized in the Spirit." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Assurance is dynamic and can fluctuate**
    - Assurance is not always constant in the believer’s experience.
    - Fluctuations in assurance are normal and addressed pastorally in Scripture.
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) are vital for strengthening assurance.
    - Doubt does not necessarily indicate the absence of saving faith.
    "Assurance may ebb and flow, but its foundation in Christ remains unshaken." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Faith and assurance are distinct but inseparable**
    - Saving faith contains the seed of assurance, though not always its full fruit.
    - Assurance is not of the essence of faith but is its proper effect.
    - The Reformed tradition distinguishes between faith and assurance without separating them.
    - Growth in assurance is tied to growth in understanding and embracing the gospel.
    "Faith and assurance are distinct, yet assurance is the natural outgrowth of true faith." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **The role of the means of grace in assurance and perseverance**
    - The Word and sacraments are primary instruments for cultivating assurance.
    - Prayer and participation in the church community sustain perseverance.
    - The Spirit uses these means to confirm believers in Christ.
    - Neglect of the means of grace leads to weakened assurance and spiritual instability.
    "The means of grace are indispensable for the Spirit’s work in assuring and preserving believers." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** as the foundation for assurance and perseverance has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology. His work has clarified the relationship between the objective and subjective aspects of salvation, influencing both academic theology and pastoral practice. By emphasizing the Spirit’s role and the means of grace, Gaffin has provided a deeply biblical and practical framework for understanding the believer’s security in Christ. His contributions continue to inform discussions on assurance and perseverance within the broader **Reformed tradition**.
