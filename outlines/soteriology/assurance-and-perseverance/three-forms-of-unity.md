# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust doctrine of **assurance** and **perseverance** grounded in the sovereignty of **divine grace**. These confessions affirm that true believers can possess genuine assurance of **salvation** and that the elect will certainly persevere, not by their own strength but by the unfailing work of the **Holy Spirit** and the promises of **God’s covenant**.

- "This assurance does not derive from some private revelation beyond or outside the Word, but from faith in the promises of God, which He has most abundantly revealed in His Word for our comfort." (Canons of Dort, V.10)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 22–24
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 1, 21, 53, 54, 60, 86
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads of Doctrine I, V
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Saving the Reformation: The Pastoral Theology of the Canons of Dort (W. Robert Godfrey)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is grounded in God’s promises**
    - Assurance arises from faith in the objective promises of the **gospel**.
    - The confessions reject the necessity of special revelation for assurance.
    - Assurance is linked to the work of **Christ** and the testimony of **Scripture**.
    - The believer’s confidence rests in God’s unchanging character.
    - "The Holy Spirit assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 1)

2. **Perseverance is the work of God’s grace**
    - The elect are preserved by the power of God, not by their own merit.
    - Perseverance is inseparable from **effectual calling** and **regeneration**.
    - The Canons of Dort explicitly reject the possibility of total or final apostasy for the elect.
    - God’s faithfulness guarantees the endurance of true believers.
    - "God, who is rich in mercy, according to His unchangeable purpose of election, does not take His Holy Spirit from His own completely, even when they fall grievously." (Canons of Dort, V.6)

3. **Assurance is compatible with struggle and weakness**
    - Believers may experience doubts and spiritual struggles.
    - Assurance can be weak or strong, but even a small faith is saving.
    - The confessions encourage believers to seek assurance through the means of grace.
    - The Spirit’s inward testimony is joined to the Word and sacraments.
    - "In this life, even the holiest have only a small beginning of this obedience." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 114)

4. **Means of grace nurture assurance and perseverance**
    - The preaching of the Word, sacraments, and prayer are ordained for strengthening faith.
    - Assurance grows as believers make diligent use of these means.
    - The confessions warn against neglecting the means of grace as presumption.
    - The church community plays a vital role in sustaining believers.
    - "God preserves in those saints the imperishable seed from which they have been born again." (Canons of Dort, V.7)

5. **Assurance and perseverance foster gratitude and holiness**
    - Assurance is not a license for sin but leads to thankful obedience.
    - Perseverance is evidenced by a life of repentance and renewal.
    - The confessions stress the inseparability of faith and good works.
    - Assurance motivates believers to live for God’s glory.
    - "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 64)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the Reformed understanding of **assurance** and **perseverance**, emphasizing the believer’s security in Christ while upholding the necessity of sanctification. Their careful balance between divine sovereignty and human responsibility has influenced Reformed confessionalism globally. These documents continue to serve as foundational standards for Reformed churches, providing pastoral guidance and doctrinal clarity on the assurance of salvation and the certainty of perseverance for the elect.
