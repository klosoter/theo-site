# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther grounded **assurance** and **perseverance** in the believer’s trust in the **promises of the gospel** and the **objective work of Christ**. He rejected the medieval emphasis on human merit or introspective self-examination, insisting that **faith alone** unites the believer to Christ and gives certainty of salvation, while perseverance is sustained by God’s grace rather than human effort.

- "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

## Key Works

- Preface to the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans (1522)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Commentary on Psalm 51 (1532)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance grounded in Christ’s promises**
   - Assurance rests on the **objective promises** of God in Christ, not on subjective feelings or works.
   - The believer looks outside themselves (extra nos) to Christ’s finished work.
   - Doubt is common, but the certainty of salvation is found in God’s Word, not human achievement.
   - The sacraments serve as external confirmations of God’s promise to the believer.
   - "For our assurance does not depend upon our own feelings but upon the promise of God." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Justification by faith alone**
   - **Justification** is received by faith apart from works, providing the foundation for assurance.
   - Faith itself is a gift, created by the Holy Spirit through the gospel.
   - The believer is simultaneously **simul iustus et peccator**—righteous in Christ, yet still a sinner.
   - Good works follow justification but do not contribute to assurance.
   - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Romans Commentary)

3. **Perseverance as God’s work**
   - The perseverance of the believer is rooted in God’s faithfulness, not human strength.
   - The Holy Spirit preserves faith through Word and sacrament.
   - Believers may experience severe trials and temptations but are kept by God’s power.
   - Final perseverance is a result of God’s unchanging grace, not human effort.
   - "It is God who begins, continues, and completes our salvation." (Large Catechism)

4. **Role of Anfechtung (spiritual trial)**
   - Luther emphasized the reality of **Anfechtung**—spiritual struggle and doubt.
   - These trials drive the believer to cling more firmly to Christ and his promises.
   - Assurance is often deepened through suffering and temptation.
   - The gospel comforts the troubled conscience amid Anfechtung.
   - "For by means of such trials God purifies our faith and drives us to Christ." (Commentary on Psalm 51)

5. **Means of grace as assurance**
   - The **Word** and **sacraments** are the means by which God assures and sustains believers.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are visible signs confirming God’s promise to the individual.
   - Regular participation in these means strengthens faith and perseverance.
   - The external Word is the anchor for assurance, not inner experience.
   - "The sacraments are sure signs and seals of God’s promise to us." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **assurance** and **perseverance** transformed the pastoral care of believers, shifting the focus from self-examination and works to the sufficiency of Christ and the reliability of God’s promises. His emphasis on **justification by faith alone** became foundational for Protestant soteriology. Luther’s pastoral realism about spiritual struggle (Anfechtung) continues to shape Reformation and evangelical approaches to assurance, providing comfort to troubled consciences and grounding perseverance in God’s grace.
