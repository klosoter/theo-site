# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **assurance** and **perseverance** grounded in the immutability of **God’s covenant** and the efficacy of **grace**. He distinguished between the objective ground of assurance in **Christ’s work** and the subjective experience of assurance in the believer, emphasizing that true saints will persevere by virtue of divine preservation rather than human merit.

- "The perseverance of the saints is not so much a quality as an effect flowing from the continuous operation of God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics 15–17)
- The Doctrine of Assurance (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)
- The Covenant of Grace (sections within Institutes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is possible and normative for believers**
    - Assurance is grounded in the **promises of God** and the testimony of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - It is not of the essence of faith, but a fruit of mature faith.
    - Doubts may arise, but assurance can be attained through the means of grace.
    - Assurance is distinguished from presumption and is compatible with humility.
    - "Assurance is not of the essence of faith, but flows from it as an effect from its cause." (Institutes)

2. **Perseverance is rooted in God’s unchangeable decree**
    - The elect are preserved by the **immutability of God’s purpose**.
    - Perseverance is not based on human strength but on divine grace.
    - The saints may fall into grievous sins, but not totally or finally.
    - The covenant of grace ensures the final salvation of the elect.
    - "The perseverance of the saints depends upon the unchangeable decree of election." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction between true and false assurance**
    - True assurance arises from the Spirit’s witness and the fruits of faith.
    - False assurance is possible and must be tested by Scripture.
    - Self-examination is necessary to discern genuine assurance.
    - The marks of grace are discernible but not infallible in themselves.
    - "There is a false assurance, which is presumption, and a true assurance, which is the fruit of the Spirit." (Institutes)

4. **Means of attaining and maintaining assurance**
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are primary means.
    - Assurance grows through the exercise of faith and obedience.
    - The Spirit applies the promises of the gospel to the heart.
    - Trials and temptations may obscure assurance but cannot destroy it.
    - "Assurance is increased and confirmed by the diligent use of the means of grace." (Institutes)

5. **Perseverance does not eliminate the need for exhortation**
    - Warnings and admonitions are real and necessary for believers.
    - God preserves his people through means, including exhortations.
    - The doctrine of perseverance does not lead to licentiousness.
    - Assurance and perseverance foster gratitude and holiness.
    - "The certainty of perseverance does not render exhortations useless, but rather makes them effectual." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions regarding **assurance** and **perseverance** shaped later **Reformed orthodoxy**, providing a nuanced alternative to both Roman Catholic and Arminian positions. His articulation of the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility influenced confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession. Turretin’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions of assurance, especially in the context of covenant theology and the perseverance of the saints.
