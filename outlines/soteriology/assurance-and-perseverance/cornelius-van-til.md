# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **assurance** and **perseverance** within the context of his broader **Reformed apologetic** and **doctrine of revelation**. He emphasized that the believer’s assurance is grounded in the **sovereignty of God**, the **objective work of Christ**, and the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture**, while perseverance is the outworking of God’s covenantal faithfulness. Van Til’s perspective integrates these doctrines with his commitment to the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief and the necessity of a consistently **biblical epistemology**.

- "The certainty of salvation rests not in man’s own ability to persevere, but in the faithfulness of the triune God who has revealed Himself in Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is grounded in God’s objective revelation**
    - Assurance flows from the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.
    - The believer’s confidence is rooted in the **finished work of Christ**.
    - Subjective feelings must be subordinated to the **objective promises of God**.
    - The Holy Spirit applies the truth of the gospel to the heart, producing assurance.
    - "The Christian’s assurance is not based on his own reasoning, but on the revelation of God as interpreted by the Holy Spirit." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Perseverance is the fruit of God’s covenant faithfulness**
    - God’s **sovereignty** ensures the perseverance of the saints.
    - The covenant relationship is initiated and maintained by God alone.
    - Human perseverance is a response to God’s prior and sustaining grace.
    - Apostasy reveals a lack of true covenant participation, not a loss of salvation.
    - "Perseverance is not a human achievement but a divine gift, grounded in the unbreakable covenant of grace." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **The antithesis shapes assurance and perseverance**
    - There is a fundamental **antithesis** between the regenerate and unregenerate.
    - True assurance and perseverance are marks of those in Christ, not the world.
    - The believer’s certainty is distinct from the false confidence of the unbeliever.
    - Assurance is undermined when the antithesis is blurred or denied.
    - "The antithesis between belief and unbelief is basic to the Christian’s assurance and perseverance." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Epistemology and assurance are inseparable**
    - Assurance is possible only on the basis of a **biblical epistemology**.
    - Human autonomy leads to skepticism and uncertainty.
    - The **presuppositional** approach insists on starting with God’s revelation.
    - Faith seeks understanding, but assurance is not contingent on exhaustive knowledge.
    - "Only when we presuppose the truth of God’s revelation can we have true assurance." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **The Holy Spirit’s role is central**
    - The Spirit testifies to the believer’s adoption and security in Christ.
    - Assurance is a work of the Spirit applying the gospel to the heart.
    - The Spirit enables perseverance by uniting the believer to Christ.
    - The inward witness of the Spirit is never separated from the Word.
    - "The Holy Spirit alone can give the assurance that we are children of God and will persevere to the end." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **assurance** and **perseverance** with his presuppositional apologetic has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to these doctrines, especially in emphasizing the necessity of grounding assurance in the **objective revelation of God**. His insistence on the antithesis and the Spirit’s role has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a robustly **covenantal** and epistemologically self-conscious understanding of salvation and Christian certainty.
