# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, emphasized the inseparable connection between **assurance of salvation** and the doctrine of the **perseverance of the saints**. He argued that true assurance is grounded in the objective work of **Christ**, the inward testimony of the **Holy Spirit**, and the evidence of **sanctification** in the believer’s life, all within the context of God’s sovereign grace. Hoekema maintained that while believers may struggle with doubt, the **security of salvation** rests on God’s unchanging promises rather than human effort.

- "The basis for assurance is not our own faithfulness, but the faithfulness of God to his promises." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is grounded in God’s promises**
    - Assurance rests fundamentally on the **objective work of Christ** and the reliability of God’s Word.
    - The promises of the **gospel** are the primary foundation for a believer’s confidence.
    - Human feelings or experiences are secondary to the certainty provided by Scripture.
    - Assurance is possible because God is faithful and unchanging.
    - "Our assurance depends not on our own worthiness, but on the trustworthiness of God’s promises." (Saved by Grace)

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit in assurance**
    - The **Holy Spirit** testifies inwardly to believers that they are children of God.
    - This testimony is distinct from mere human emotion or self-persuasion.
    - The Spirit’s witness works in tandem with the Word to confirm salvation.
    - Assurance grows as the Spirit applies the truths of Scripture to the heart.
    - "The Holy Spirit gives us the inward assurance that we belong to Christ." (Saved by Grace)

3. **Perseverance of the saints is guaranteed by God’s power**
    - True believers are kept by the **power of God** through faith.
    - Perseverance is not a human achievement but a result of divine preservation.
    - God’s grace ensures that none of the elect will finally fall away.
    - Perseverance is closely linked to the unbreakable union with Christ.
    - "Those who are truly regenerated will be kept by God’s power and will persevere to the end." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Assurance is compatible with self-examination**
    - Believers are called to examine themselves for evidence of **sanctification**.
    - Assurance is strengthened by observing the fruit of the Spirit and growth in holiness.
    - Self-examination is not meant to foster doubt, but to encourage spiritual vigilance.
    - Assurance and perseverance are both nurtured by ongoing repentance and faith.
    - "Self-examination is not opposed to assurance, but is one of the means by which assurance is strengthened." (Saved by Grace)

5. **Assurance may fluctuate but salvation does not**
    - Believers may experience periods of doubt or diminished assurance.
    - These fluctuations do not affect the reality of salvation for the elect.
    - God’s faithfulness remains constant even when believers struggle.
    - Assurance can be restored through renewed trust in God’s promises and means of grace.
    - "Even when our assurance falters, God’s saving purpose remains unchanged." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of **assurance** and **perseverance** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in pastoral contexts where assurance is a practical concern. His emphasis on the objective basis of salvation and the Spirit’s role in assurance has provided clarity and comfort to many. Hoekema’s works continue to be widely used in seminaries and churches, reinforcing the centrality of God’s grace and faithfulness in the believer’s security. His balanced approach remains influential in discussions on the relationship between faith, assurance, and perseverance.
