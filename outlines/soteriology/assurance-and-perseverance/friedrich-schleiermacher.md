# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **assurance** and **perseverance** within his distinctive framework of **religious experience** and **God-consciousness**. Rather than grounding assurance in objective doctrinal promises, he located it in the believer’s ongoing sense of **absolute dependence** on God, making perseverance a function of the vitality of this consciousness rather than of immutable divine decree.

- "The feeling of absolute dependence is the constant element in all the self-consciousness of the religious man." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- "The Christian Faith" (Der christliche Glaube)
- "On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers"
- "Brief Outline of the Study of Theology"
- Wilhelm Gräb, "Schleiermacher on Religion and the Assurance of Faith" (secondary)
- Gerrit C. Berkouwer, "Faith and Perseverance" (secondary, discussion of Schleiermacher)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance rooted in God-consciousness**
    - Assurance is not a deduction from doctrinal propositions but arises from the immediate **feeling of absolute dependence**.
    - The believer’s confidence is experiential, grounded in the ongoing presence of God in consciousness.
    - Doubt and struggle are natural, but assurance persists as long as God-consciousness is vital.
    - This approach shifts focus from external evidences to inward experience.
    - "Assurance is nothing other than the certainty of the God-consciousness itself." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Perseverance as dynamic, not static**
    - Perseverance is not guaranteed by an unchangeable decree but is the result of the continual renewal of God-consciousness.
    - The Christian life is a process, marked by growth and fluctuation in religious feeling.
    - Perseverance depends on the vitality of the relationship with God, not on forensic status.
    - The church community supports perseverance by nurturing religious experience.
    - "The constancy of faith is the constancy of the God-consciousness." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Rejection of forensic assurance**
    - Schleiermacher rejects the Reformed notion that assurance is grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ.
    - He sees assurance as existential, not juridical or external.
    - The believer’s sense of acceptance is not tied to a legal status before God.
    - This leads to a more subjective and psychological understanding of assurance.
    - "The doctrine of justification is not the ground of assurance, but its expression." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in assurance**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the means by which God-consciousness is awakened and sustained.
    - Assurance is thus a work of the Spirit within the believer’s experience.
    - The Spirit’s activity is perceived in the deepening of religious feeling, not in external signs.
    - The Spirit’s presence is discerned through the transformation of the inner life.
    - "The Spirit is the principle of the new life and the certainty of salvation." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Community as the context for perseverance**
    - The church is essential for nurturing and sustaining God-consciousness.
    - Perseverance is not an individual achievement but a communal process.
    - Worship and fellowship reinforce assurance by fostering shared religious experience.
    - The community mediates the presence of Christ and the Spirit to its members.
    - "The communion of saints is the sphere in which the God-consciousness is preserved and strengthened." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **assurance** and **perseverance** profoundly shaped modern Protestant theology by shifting the focus from objective doctrinal grounds to the **subjective experience** of faith. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the centrality of religious feeling influenced later liberal and existential theologians, including Ritschl and Tillich. While his views diverged sharply from Reformed orthodoxy, they opened new avenues for understanding the dynamics of faith and the role of the church in sustaining belief. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of assurance and the interplay between doctrine and experience.
