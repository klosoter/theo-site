# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **assurance** and **perseverance** through the lens of existential interpretation, emphasizing the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** rather than objective doctrinal certainty. For Bultmann, **faith** is an existential act of trust in the proclaimed word, not a possession or guarantee, and **perseverance** is found in the continual decision to live authentically in response to God's call. He rejected traditional notions of **eternal security** and instead focused on the ongoing, dynamic relationship between the believer and the **Word of God**.

- "Faith is not a possession; it is a decision that has to be made ever anew." (Faith and Understanding)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Existential Understanding of Faith**
    - Faith is not intellectual assent but a personal, existential response to the kerygma.
    - Assurance is not grounded in objective facts but in the individual's ongoing decision of trust.
    - The believer's relationship to God is characterized by openness and risk, not certainty.
    - Faith is always threatened by unbelief and must be continually renewed.
    - "Faith is decision, not possession." (Faith and Understanding)

2. **Demythologization of Assurance**
    - Traditional doctrines of assurance are seen as mythological and objectifying.
    - The New Testament's language about assurance must be interpreted existentially.
    - Assurance is not a static state but a dynamic, lived reality.
    - The focus is on authentic existence rather than doctrinal guarantees.
    - "The word of God encounters man as a demand for decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

3. **Perseverance as Ongoing Decision**
    - Perseverance is not a guaranteed outcome but a continual existential act.
    - The believer must respond anew to God's call in every moment.
    - There is no once-for-all security; faith can be lost or abandoned.
    - The Christian life is marked by tension and the possibility of falling away.
    - "The believer is always in danger of falling back into the world." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Objective Certainty**
    - Assurance and perseverance cannot be grounded in objective, external criteria.
    - The quest for certainty is a form of self-justification and inauthentic existence.
    - True assurance comes from existential encounter, not doctrinal systems.
    - The believer must live by faith, not by sight or certainty.
    - "Certainty is not given to man; only faith is possible." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the means by which assurance and perseverance are called forth.
    - The Word of God confronts the individual and demands a response.
    - Assurance is found in the act of hearing and responding to the kerygma, not in sacraments or church authority.
    - The ongoing encounter with the kerygma sustains faith and perseverance.
    - "The kerygma is not information but address." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential approach to **assurance** and **perseverance** profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the realms of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. His emphasis on the individual's ongoing decision challenged traditional Protestant doctrines of **eternal security** and objective assurance. While controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann's thought continues to influence discussions on faith, authenticity, and the nature of Christian existence. His legacy endures in both New Testament scholarship and existential theology.
