# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust doctrine of **assurance** and **perseverance** grounded in the sovereign grace of God and the efficacy of the **covenant of grace**. He maintained that true believers are preserved by God’s power and that assurance, though possible and desirable, is not of the essence of faith but is intimately connected to the believer’s union with Christ and the witness of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The perseverance of the saints reminds us very forcefully that only those who persevere to the end are truly saints." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Perseverance Rooted in Union with Christ**
    - Perseverance is inseparable from the believer’s vital union with Christ.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s redemptive work ensures the final salvation of all the elect.
    - Perseverance is not a human achievement but a divine gift.
    - Apostasy is evidence of a lack of true union, not the loss of salvation.
    - "It is utterly wrong to say that perseverance is a human achievement; it is of God." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Assurance Not of the Essence of Faith**
    - Assurance is possible and desirable but not necessary for saving faith.
    - Believers may experience doubt without forfeiting salvation.
    - Assurance is grounded in the promises of God and the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit.
    - The distinction between faith and assurance safeguards against presumption.
    - "Faith is not assurance, and assurance is not faith." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Assurance**
    - The Holy Spirit bears witness with the believer’s spirit to their adoption.
    - Assurance is a fruit of the Spirit’s work, not merely self-examination.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is objective, rooted in Christ’s finished work.
    - The believer’s subjective experience of assurance is grounded in the Spirit’s ministry.
    - "The witness of the Spirit is not to be identified with our own spirit’s testimony." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Necessity of Means for Perseverance**
    - God ordains both the end (perseverance) and the means (Word, sacraments, prayer).
    - Believers are exhorted to diligence in the use of means.
    - Perseverance is not automatic or mechanical but involves active obedience.
    - The warnings of Scripture are real and function as means to secure perseverance.
    - "The perseverance of the saints does not supersede the necessity of watchfulness and prayer." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Pastoral Sensitivity to Assurance and Doubt**
    - Murray recognized the pastoral challenges surrounding assurance.
    - He emphasized the need for careful, biblical encouragement of doubting believers.
    - Assurance should not be confused with presumption or complacency.
    - The church must nurture assurance through sound teaching and discipline.
    - "It is the duty of the church to foster assurance in the hearts of God’s people." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **perseverance** and **assurance** has shaped Reformed soteriology, especially in its emphasis on the objective grounds of salvation in Christ and the subjective work of the Holy Spirit. His careful distinctions have influenced pastoral practice and theological education, particularly within confessional Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Murray’s legacy endures in his insistence on the necessity of means and the pastoral care of believers wrestling with assurance.
