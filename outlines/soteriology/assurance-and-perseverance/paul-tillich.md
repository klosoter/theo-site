# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **assurance** and **perseverance** not through traditional Reformed categories, but as existential realities rooted in the individual's relationship to the **Ground of Being**. For Tillich, **faith** is an act of ultimate concern that involves both courage and doubt, and **assurance** is found in the acceptance of being accepted by God, even amidst existential anxiety. **Perseverance** is thus less about the certainty of salvation and more about the ongoing, dynamic participation in the **New Being** revealed in Christ.

- "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of man's ultimate concern." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Key Works

- The Courage to Be
- Systematic Theology (Vols. 1–3)
- Dynamics of Faith
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- The Protestant Era

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance as Acceptance by the Ground of Being**
    - Assurance is not a subjective feeling but the existential realization of being accepted by God.
    - The **Ground of Being** transcends all finite conditions, providing the basis for ultimate assurance.
    - Doubt and anxiety are integral to faith, not obstacles to assurance.
    - Assurance is experienced in the "courage to accept acceptance."
    - "The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt." (The Courage to Be)

2. **Faith as Ultimate Concern**
    - Faith is directed toward the ultimate, not toward finite certainties.
    - Assurance is found in the object of faith, not in the strength of one's own belief.
    - The existential act of faith involves risk and uncertainty.
    - Perseverance is the continual act of turning toward the ultimate concern.
    - "Faith includes both an element of certainty and an element of uncertainty." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Perseverance as Participation in the New Being**
    - Perseverance is not guaranteed by human effort but by participation in the **New Being** in Christ.
    - The New Being overcomes estrangement and enables ongoing transformation.
    - Perseverance is a process, not a static state.
    - The community of faith supports the individual's perseverance.
    - "The New Being is the power of being which conquers the situation of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Existential Anxiety and the Reality of Doubt**
    - Doubt is an unavoidable aspect of the human condition.
    - Assurance and perseverance are lived out amidst existential anxiety.
    - The presence of doubt does not negate faith but is part of authentic faith.
    - The courage to persist in faith is itself a form of perseverance.
    - "Doubt is not the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith." (Dynamics of Faith)

5. **Justification and Acceptance Despite Estrangement**
    - Justification is understood as the acceptance of the estranged by the Ground of Being.
    - Assurance comes from the message of acceptance, not from introspection.
    - Perseverance is grounded in the ongoing reality of divine acceptance.
    - The experience of grace enables both assurance and perseverance.
    - "You are accepted. Simply accept that you are accepted!" (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich's existential reinterpretation of **assurance** and **perseverance** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in conversations about faith, doubt, and the human condition. His emphasis on the **Ground of Being** and the existential dimensions of faith challenged traditional Protestant formulations and opened new avenues for dialogue between theology and philosophy. While his approach departs from classic Reformed categories, Tillich remains a pivotal figure in 20th-century theology for those wrestling with assurance in an age of anxiety.
