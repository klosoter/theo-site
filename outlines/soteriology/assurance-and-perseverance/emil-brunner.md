# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **assurance** and **perseverance** from the standpoint of a **dialectical theology** that emphasized the dynamic relationship between God’s **grace** and human **faith**. He rejected both legalistic certainty and existential doubt, insisting that assurance is grounded in the **personal encounter with Christ** rather than in objective doctrinal formulations or subjective feelings. For Brunner, perseverance is not a static possession but a continual response to God’s ongoing call.

- "Faith is certainty, not because of itself, but because of Him in whom it trusts." (The Christian Doctrine of Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Faith (Dogmatics, Vol. III)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- Revelation and Reason
- The Divine-Human Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance rooted in encounter with Christ**
    - Assurance arises from the **personal relationship** with the living Christ, not from introspection or doctrinal systems.
    - Faith is a response to God's self-revelation, not a human achievement.
    - The certainty of salvation is relational, not rational or emotional.
    - Assurance is maintained through continual trust in Christ’s promise.
    - "Assurance is not a possession, but a relationship." (The Christian Doctrine of Faith)

2. **Perseverance as dynamic response**
    - Perseverance is not guaranteed by a one-time act but by ongoing faithfulness.
    - The believer’s security is found in God’s faithfulness, not in human constancy.
    - Human freedom and responsibility are upheld within the context of divine grace.
    - Perseverance is a process of continual renewal in the encounter with God.
    - "The Christian life is a constant beginning anew." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Rejection of mechanical certainty**
    - Brunner opposes both Reformed “once saved, always saved” and Catholic sacramentalism as forms of false security.
    - Assurance is not a logical deduction from doctrine but a gift of the Spirit.
    - Faith is always threatened by doubt and must be renewed in encounter.
    - The believer lives in tension between promise and fulfillment.
    - "Certainty is not a logical conclusion, but a gift of grace." (The Christian Doctrine of Faith)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit mediates the assurance of salvation through the Word.
    - Assurance is experienced as the Spirit testifies to the believer’s adoption.
    - The Spirit enables perseverance by continually drawing the believer to Christ.
    - The Spirit’s witness is existential, not merely doctrinal.
    - "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God." (The Christian Doctrine of Faith)

5. **Faith and obedience inseparable**
    - True assurance is evidenced by a life of obedience and discipleship.
    - Perseverance is not passive but involves active participation in God’s call.
    - Faith and obedience are two sides of the same coin in the Christian life.
    - Assurance grows as faith expresses itself in love and service.
    - "Faith without obedience is not faith at all." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **assurance** and **perseverance** challenged both Protestant and Catholic certainties by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of faith. His theology influenced later discussions on the nature of **faith**, assurance, and the role of the **Holy Spirit** in Christian experience. While sometimes criticized for lack of systematic clarity, Brunner’s focus on encounter and dynamic perseverance remains significant in contemporary theology, especially in discussions of assurance as a lived reality rather than a doctrinal formula.
