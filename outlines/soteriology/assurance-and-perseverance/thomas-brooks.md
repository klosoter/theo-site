# Thomas Brooks (1608–1680)

Thomas Brooks, a prominent English Puritan, offered a robust and pastorally sensitive account of **assurance** and **perseverance**. He taught that true believers can attain a well-grounded assurance of salvation through the inward witness of the **Holy Spirit**, the evidences of **regeneration**, and the promises of **Scripture**, while also emphasizing that the saints will persevere by God's sustaining grace despite seasons of doubt or spiritual darkness.

- "Assurance is the beauty and apex of a Christian’s happiness in this life." ("Heaven on Earth")

## Key Works

- "Heaven on Earth: A Treatise on Christian Assurance"
- "Precious Remedies Against Satan’s Devices"
- "The Unsearchable Riches of Christ"
- "A Cabinet of Choice Jewels"
- "The Crown and Glory of Christianity"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Assurance is attainable in this life**
    - Believers are encouraged to seek assurance as a present privilege, not merely a future hope.
    - Assurance is grounded in the promises of **Scripture** and the finished work of **Christ**.
    - Brooks distinguishes between the essence of faith and the assurance of faith.
    - Assurance is not of the essence of saving faith but is a fruit that may be enjoyed.
    - "Assurance is not of the essence of a Christian, though it is the beauty of a Christian." ("Heaven on Earth")

2. **The Holy Spirit’s witness is central**
    - The **Holy Spirit** testifies with the believer’s spirit regarding adoption and salvation.
    - This inward testimony is distinct from mere self-examination or rational deduction.
    - The Spirit’s witness brings peace, joy, and boldness in the Christian life.
    - Brooks warns against confusing emotional experiences with the Spirit’s true testimony.
    - "The Spirit only can make a soul know its adoption." ("Heaven on Earth")

3. **Scriptural promises are the foundation**
    - Assurance rests ultimately on the objective promises of **God’s Word**.
    - Brooks urges believers to look outside themselves to Christ and the gospel promises.
    - Doubts are to be answered by clinging to the unchanging truth of Scripture.
    - The promises are applied by faith, not by introspection or works.
    - "Faith deals with the promise, and assurance with the Promiser." ("Heaven on Earth")

4. **Self-examination and evidences of grace**
    - Brooks encourages careful self-examination for signs of **regeneration** and spiritual fruit.
    - Marks include love for Christ, hatred of sin, and longing for holiness.
    - He warns against morbid introspection that leads to despair.
    - Assurance is strengthened by observing the Spirit’s work in one’s life.
    - "Look for the prints and footsteps of the Spirit in your soul." ("Heaven on Earth")

5. **Perseverance is secured by God’s grace**
    - True believers will persevere to the end because of God’s preserving power.
    - Perseverance is not based on human strength but on Christ’s intercession and the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - Brooks acknowledges the reality of spiritual struggles and temporary lapses.
    - He assures believers that God will not forsake His own, even in seasons of darkness.
    - "Though saints may fall foully, yet they shall not fall finally." ("Precious Remedies Against Satan’s Devices")
