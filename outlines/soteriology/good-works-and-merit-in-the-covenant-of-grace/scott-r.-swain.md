# Scott Swain (1974– )

Scott Swain articulates a Reformed understanding of **good works** within the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing their role as the fruit of **union with Christ** rather than as a means of **merit** before God. He maintains that while good works are necessary as evidence of **saving faith** and for the fulfillment of the believer’s vocation, they do not constitute the ground of **justification** or establish a claim upon God’s favor.

- "Good works are the necessary fruit of faith and union with Christ, but they are not the basis of our acceptance before God." ("The God of the Gospel," 2013)

## Key Works

- "The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson’s Trinitarian Theology" (2013)
- "The Trinity: An Introduction" (2020)
- "Retrieving the Reformed Confession" (with Michael Allen, 2008)
- "Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation" (with Michael Allen, 2015)
- “Covenant, Merit, and the Reformed Tradition” (chapter in various edited volumes and journal articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good works as fruit, not ground, of justification**
    - Good works flow from **union with Christ** and are the evidence of a living faith.
    - They do not serve as the basis or ground for **justification** before God.
    - The **covenant of grace** excludes any notion of human merit as the cause of salvation.
    - Justification is grounded solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.
    - "Our good works are the necessary fruit of faith, not the root of our acceptance with God." (Reformed Catholicity)

2. **Necessity of good works in the Christian life**
    - Good works are required as the proper response to God’s grace.
    - They are the means by which believers fulfill their **covenantal vocation**.
    - The Spirit enables and empowers good works in the life of the believer.
    - Good works serve as a testimony to the reality of **regeneration**.
    - "The necessity of good works is not for justification, but for sanctification and witness." (Retrieving the Reformed Confession)

3. **Rejection of merit in the covenant of grace**
    - The concept of merit is reserved for Christ’s obedience, not the believer’s.
    - Human works, even when Spirit-wrought, do not obligate God.
    - The **covenant of grace** is fundamentally a covenant of gift, not exchange.
    - Any reward for good works is gracious, not meritorious.
    - "In the covenant of grace, all is of grace; even our rewards are gifts." (Reformed Catholicity)

4. **Role of the law in the life of the believer**
    - The law continues to guide believers in the path of gratitude and obedience.
    - Good works are defined by conformity to God’s revealed will.
    - The law exposes sin and drives believers to Christ, but also instructs in holiness.
    - The law’s demands are fulfilled in believers through the work of the Spirit.
    - "The law remains as a rule of life, but not as a means of justification." (The Trinity: An Introduction)

5. **Christ’s merit as the foundation of salvation**
    - Christ alone fulfills the conditions of the covenant through his perfect obedience.
    - His merit is imputed to believers by faith alone.
    - All blessings of the covenant of grace flow from Christ’s finished work.
    - The believer’s good works are accepted only in Christ and for his sake.
    - "Christ’s merit is the only ground of our salvation; our works are accepted only in him." (The God of the Gospel)

## Legacy and Impact

Scott Swain has contributed significantly to contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** and the relationship between **grace**, **faith**, and **works** in the Christian life. His retrieval of classic Reformed categories has helped clarify the distinction between the role of good works as evidence of salvation and the rejection of merit in the covenant of grace. Swain’s work continues to shape evangelical and Reformed approaches to systematic theology, particularly in the areas of soteriology and covenantal ethics.
