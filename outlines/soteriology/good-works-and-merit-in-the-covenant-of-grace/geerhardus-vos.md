# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos drew a sharp distinction between **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace**, insisting that believers’ obedience is the fruit of **regeneration** and union with Christ, not a means of earning **salvation**. He grounded all acceptance before God in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, rejecting any notion that human works could possess true **merit** in the order of redemption.

- "The works of believers are not meritorious, but are the necessary fruits of the new life imparted in the covenant of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of works** was based on Adam’s obedience, with true merit possible only in that context.
    - The **covenant of grace** is grounded in God’s initiative and Christ’s obedience, not human achievement.
    - Good works in the covenant of grace are responses to grace, not conditions for acceptance.
    - The merit of Christ is unique and cannot be replicated or supplemented by believers.
    "The principle of merit is excluded from the covenant of grace, because the ground of acceptance is not our obedience but Christ’s." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Good Works as Evidence, Not Ground, of Salvation**
    - Good works are the necessary fruit of **regeneration** and faith.
    - They serve as evidence of union with Christ, not as a basis for justification.
    - The Spirit’s work in sanctification produces good works as a sign of new life.
    - Assurance is strengthened by good works, but their role is evidential, not meritorious.
    "Good works are indispensable as the evidence of faith, but never as its ground." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

3. **Rejection of Human Merit in Salvation**
    - Vos denies that fallen humans can achieve **condign merit** before God.
    - Even in the state of grace, believers’ works are tainted by sin and require forgiveness.
    - All reward is of grace, not strict justice, in the covenant of grace.
    - Christ alone fulfills the conditions of merit on behalf of his people.
    "There is no room for human merit in the covenant of grace; all is of grace from beginning to end." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Role of Christ’s Active and Passive Obedience**
    - The **imputed righteousness of Christ** is the sole ground of justification.
    - Christ’s obedience fulfills the demands of the law for his people.
    - Believers’ good works flow from union with Christ, not from autonomous effort.
    - The merit of Christ is both active (obedience) and passive (suffering), securing all covenant blessings.
    "Our good works are acceptable only as they are wrought in us by Christ and presented in him." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Gracious Reward in the Covenant of Grace**
    - God graciously rewards good works, but the reward is not earned in a strict sense.
    - The reward is a manifestation of God’s fatherly pleasure, not a debt owed to the believer.
    - The concept of **pactum merit** is redefined as a gracious arrangement, not strict justice.
    - The believer’s works, though imperfect, are accepted for Christ’s sake.
    "The reward of good works is a matter of grace, not of merit, in the covenant of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s careful distinction between **merit** and **good works** in the covenant of grace has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology, reinforcing the centrality of **union with Christ** and the sufficiency of his righteousness. His biblical-theological approach clarified the gracious character of the covenant and safeguarded the doctrine of justification by faith alone. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of covenant theology, especially in debates over the role of obedience and assurance in the Christian life.
