# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther rejected the notion that **good works** could merit salvation in the **covenant of grace**, insisting that justification is by **faith alone**. He taught that while good works necessarily flow from genuine faith, they are the fruit and evidence of **justification**, not its basis or cause.

- "Good works do not make a good man, but a good man does good works." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 6)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is received solely by **faith** apart from works.
    - Good works are excluded as a ground for acceptance before God.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ, whose righteousness is imputed.
    - The believer’s standing before God is secure in Christ, not in personal merit.
    - "Faith alone justifies, but faith is never alone." (Preface to Romans)

2. **Good Works as Necessary Fruit, Not Cause**
    - Good works are the inevitable result of true faith.
    - They serve as evidence of regeneration, not as a means of earning favor.
    - The believer, set free from the law’s condemnation, freely serves the neighbor.
    - Works are performed out of gratitude, not compulsion or for merit.
    - "We do not become righteous by doing righteous deeds, but, having been made righteous, we do righteous deeds." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 25)

3. **Rejection of Human Merit in Salvation**
    - Human efforts, even the best works, cannot merit grace or salvation.
    - The concept of **merit** is incompatible with the radical grace of the gospel.
    - All boasting is excluded; salvation is entirely God’s gift.
    - The law reveals sin and drives one to Christ, not to self-reliance.
    - "For if justification were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Role of the Law in the Covenant of Grace**
    - The law exposes sin and reveals the need for grace.
    - In the covenant of grace, the law’s demands are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The believer is no longer under the law as a covenant of works.
    - The law guides Christian living but does not justify.
    - "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. Grace says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

5. **Sanctification as the Work of the Spirit**
    - Sanctification follows justification and is empowered by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Good works are the Spirit’s fruit, not the believer’s achievement.
    - The Christian life is marked by ongoing repentance and renewal.
    - Assurance rests in Christ’s finished work, not in the quantity of works.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who sanctifies, not our works." (The Freedom of a Christian)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s doctrine of **justification by faith alone** decisively shaped Protestant views on good works and merit in the covenant of grace. His sharp distinction between faith and works undermined medieval systems of merit and influenced all subsequent Reformation theology. By rooting assurance and acceptance in Christ rather than human achievement, Luther provided a foundation for later Reformed and Lutheran confessions. His teaching continues to inform debates on the relationship between faith, works, and salvation.
