# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **good works** and **merit** in the **covenant of grace** through the lens of his triperspectival theology, emphasizing the priority of **God’s sovereignty** and the believer’s union with Christ. He rejects any notion of human merit before God, insisting that all good works are the fruit of **regeneration** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** within the context of the covenant relationship established by grace alone.

- "Our good works are the result of God’s grace, not a means of earning his favor." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good Works as Evidence, Not Ground, of Salvation**
    - Good works flow from faith and are evidence of genuine **regeneration**.
    - They are not the basis for acceptance with God but demonstrate the reality of **justification**.
    - The believer’s obedience is always imperfect and dependent on Christ’s righteousness.
    - Good works are necessary as the fruit of salvation, not as its cause.
    - "Good works are not the ground of our salvation, but they are its necessary evidence." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Human Merit Before God**
    - Frame denies that fallen humans can merit anything from God, even under the covenant of grace.
    - All human obedience is tainted by sin and cannot meet God’s perfect standard.
    - The concept of merit is reserved for Christ’s obedience alone.
    - Any reward for good works is itself a gift of grace, not a wage earned.
    - "We do not earn anything from God; even our rewards are gracious." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Christ’s Merit as the Foundation of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The only true merit in salvation is Christ’s perfect obedience and sacrificial death.
    - Believers are united to Christ and share in the benefits of his merit.
    - The covenant of grace is established and maintained by Christ’s work, not ours.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not on the believer’s performance.
    - "Our hope is not in our own merit, but in the merit of Christ alone." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Producing Good Works**
    - Good works are the result of the Holy Spirit’s transformative work in the believer.
    - The Spirit enables obedience and sanctification within the covenant relationship.
    - Sanctification is a cooperative process, but always initiated and empowered by God.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that good works are pleasing to God, despite their imperfection.
    - "The Holy Spirit empowers us to do good works, which God has prepared in advance for us to do." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal Context of Obedience**
    - Obedience is always situated within the context of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The law functions as a guide for grateful living, not as a means of earning favor.
    - The covenant relationship motivates and shapes the believer’s ethical life.
    - Good works are acts of covenantal faithfulness, not legalistic attempts at merit.
    - "Obedience is our grateful response to God’s covenant love, not a way to earn it." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **good works** and **merit** within the covenant of grace has reinforced the Reformed emphasis on salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. His triperspectival approach has provided clarity on the relationship between faith, obedience, and assurance, shaping contemporary Reformed discussions. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking to understand the practical implications of the covenant of grace for Christian living.
