# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, rejected any notion of **merit** in the context of the **covenant of grace**. He insisted that **good works** are the fruit of faith and the result of **divine initiative**, not a means of earning favor or salvation. For Brunner, the relationship between God and humanity is grounded in **grace alone**, rendering all human achievement insufficient for justification.

- "Faith is the hand which receives, not the means by which we merit, the gift of God." ("The Mediator")

## Key Works

- "The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith"
- "Dogmatics: Volume II—The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption"
- "The Divine Imperative"
- "Man in Revolt"
- "Truth as Encounter"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Human Merit in Salvation**
    - Asserts that **salvation** is solely the work of God’s **grace**, not human effort.
    - Denies that **good works** can contribute to justification before God.
    - Emphasizes the radical incapacity of fallen humanity to achieve merit.
    - Argues that the **covenant of grace** excludes all forms of human boasting.
    - "Grace excludes all merit; it is the free gift of God." ("The Mediator")

2. **Good Works as Response, Not Condition**
    - Good works are the result of faith, not its precondition.
    - They flow from the believer’s encounter with Christ, not from legal obligation.
    - The ethical life is a grateful response to God’s prior action.
    - Good works have no salvific value apart from faith.
    - "The Christian life is not a means to salvation, but its consequence." ("The Divine Imperative")

3. **Primacy of Divine Initiative**
    - God’s action in Christ precedes and enables all human response.
    - The **covenant of grace** is established by God’s sovereign will.
    - Human participation is always secondary and derivative.
    - The initiative of grace rules out any synergistic cooperation.
    - "All that man can do is to accept the gift which God offers." ("The Mediator")

4. **Faith Alone as the Means of Justification**
    - Justification is by faith alone, not by works.
    - Faith is trust in God’s promise, not intellectual assent or moral achievement.
    - The Reformational principle of **sola fide** is central to Brunner’s soteriology.
    - Good works are the evidence, not the ground, of justification.
    - "Faith alone justifies, but the faith which justifies is never alone." ("Dogmatics II")

5. **Ethics Rooted in Divine Command**
    - Christian ethics arise from the encounter with God’s command, not from abstract principles.
    - The **divine imperative** shapes the believer’s moral life in response to grace.
    - Good works are acts of obedience to God’s revealed will.
    - The ethical life is inseparable from the reality of the covenant relationship.
    - "The will of God is the norm of all true human action." ("The Divine Imperative")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s rejection of **merit** in the **covenant of grace** reinforced the centrality of grace in Protestant theology and shaped 20th-century discussions on the relationship between faith and works. His dialectical approach influenced later Reformed and ecumenical thought, particularly in emphasizing the priority of divine action over human achievement. Brunner’s work remains a significant reference point for debates on **justification**, **sanctification**, and the ethical implications of grace.
