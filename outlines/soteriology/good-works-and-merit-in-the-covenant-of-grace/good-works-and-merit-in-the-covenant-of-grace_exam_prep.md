Reward without merit: safeguarding sola fide while affirming the necessity of good works in the **covenant of grace**

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How to affirm the necessity and reward of good works in the **covenant of grace** without conceding any human **merit** in justification or title to life.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Robert Bellarmine, Francis Turretin, Herman Witsius.
- Traditions: Augustinian patristic theology, medieval scholasticism, Tridentine Roman Catholicism, Reformed Reformation and **federal theology**.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: antinomian vs neonomian tensions, Baxter on “new law,” conditions in the covenant, faith and works at the last judgment, Adamic and Christic **merit** vs believers’ works.
  - External: Trent and Bellarmine on condign **merit** and increase of justification; New Perspective emphases on works and covenant membership.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision claims about covenantal faithfulness and final justification, present discussions of “final salvation” and “judgment according to works.”
- Position defended: In the **covenant of grace**, good works are necessary as Spirit-wrought fruit and as a divinely appointed means unto perseverance, assurance, and eschatological vindication and reward, yet they are in no sense meritorious for justification or right to life; only Christ’s obedience possesses true **merit**, and God’s rewards to believers are rewards of grace.

### ESSAY
The topic of good works and merit in the **covenant of grace** sits at the intersection of soteriology and **federal theology**, where biblical promises of reward appear to pull against Reformation denials of human **merit**. The examiner’s question presses here: how can the Reformed affirm a robust necessity of **evangelical obedience** and even a final judgment “according to works” while preserving the integrity of justification sola fide and the gratuitousness of eternal life? The answer requires careful conceptual work on the nature of **merit**, the architecture of the covenants, and the relation of justification and sanctification in **union with Christ**. The tradition shows that when error intrudes it typically arises from either collapsing reward into **merit** or evaporating the covenantal seriousness of obedience in fear of legalism. The path between these ditches is old and defensible.

Augustine frames the field by redefining the grammar of merit under grace. Against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian claims, he insists that grace precedes and enables all good willing. In works such as On the Spirit and the Letter and On Grace and Free Will, Augustine argues that God commands what he gives, giving the Spirit to fulfill what he commands. His famous line that God crowns not our merits but his gifts recasts “merit” as a way of speaking about God’s fidelity to his own gracious work. Though he does not deploy later scholastic distinctions, Augustine supplies the core axiom the Reformed later made their own: whatever reward attends the regenerate is grounded in prior grace, and the relation between grace, obedience, and reward is asymmetrical. There is no commutative justice between God and the creature in which the latter can oblige the former; the asymmetry is radical because the source and measure of good in the believer remain divine donation. This in turn anticipates later denials of human **merit** in our right to life, while leaving intact biblical promises that God will recompense faithfulness in the way a father delights to honor his children’s Spirit-enabled obedience. Augustine’s accent thus directs us away from the calculus of strict desert and toward the logic of **covenant** and adoption, where God’s rewards are gifts layered upon gifts.

Thomas Aquinas systematizes the language of **merit** with formidable precision, and because the Tridentine synthesis leans on him, he demands extended treatment. In the Summa Theologiae, especially Prima Secundae 113–114, Thomas articulates justification as the infusion of grace and charity whereby the ungodly is made righteous. He then distinguishes de condigno and de congruo merit. Condign merit is proportionate merit grounded in God’s promise and the friendship charity establishes between God and the justified; because the Spirit’s grace elevates the person, God can, in a certain justice, apportion eternal life to acts proceeding from infused charity. Congruent merit is fitting, not proportionate, reward, given out of liberality. Aquinas denies human condign merit antecedent to grace, but affirms condign merit for the justified because their acts flow from infused charity under grace. He is not naive about God’s primacy; he insists God is the first cause of merit. Yet he absorbs reward into a juridical register of justice, now conceived as friendship-justice inside grace. Faith informed by charity becomes the form of good works that, by God’s own ordination, condignly merit eternal life. This is not Pelagian, but it relocates the central gravity of justification into the believer’s qualitative transformation. The strength of Thomas’s vision lies in its teleology; charity unites to the end, so God, as just, crowns what he has enabled. Yet at precisely this point Reformed worries emerge. The effect of placing condign **merit** within the economy of grace is to import a proportionality between human acts and the end of glory, even if divinely ordained, which Scripture does not require and which obscures the uniqueness of Christ’s **merit** for our right to life. It is no accident that when Trent codifies Aquinas’s instincts, the line between reward and **merit** hardens.

John Calvin reverses the order by placing forensic righteousness and **imputation** at the foundation, with sanctification and all good works flowing from **union with Christ** as the inseparable benefit. In the Institutes book 3, he defends justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ, rejecting any mingling of faith and love as the ground of acceptance. Calvin is no antinomian. He gives a robust account of the third use of the law, argues that faith alone justifies but the faith that justifies is never alone, and speaks plainly of promises of “reward.” Yet he refuses to call believers’ works meritorious in any sense that suggests a proportionate right. Reward language is fatherly and gracious, not remunerative in commutative justice. God crowns his own gifts. Calvin’s precision shows in his handling of texts like Romans 2 and 1 Corinthians 3. God renders to each according to works, but these works are the evidences and fruits of faith and union. On 1 Corinthians 3, diverse rewards do not contradict free acceptance; they are distributive acknowledgments of Spirit-enabled labor. The conceptual anchors here are **instrumental cause** and **duplex gratia**. Faith is the sole instrument of justification. Sanctification, necessarily consequent, yields **evangelical obedience** that God is pleased to reward because he is pleased with his children in Christ. Calvin’s advance over Aquinas is the re-centering of rights language wholly in Christ. Title to life is alien, not inherent; reward is familial, not meritorious.

Trent and Robert Bellarmine crystallize the Roman Catholic alternative that the Reformed opposed. The Decree on Justification of Trent, session 6, teaches that the justified truly merit increase of grace and eternal life when they work well with grace. Bellarmine’s De justificatione defends this as the Catholic sense, appealing to the non-opposition between grace and **merit** when **merit** is itself grace-enabled. He argues that the final judgment according to works, the scriptural promises to obedience, and the righteousness infused in the heart collectively warrant speaking of condign **merit**. Protestants, he claims, reduce reward to bare benevolence and thereby make God unjust to his own promises. For Bellarmine, justification is not only forensic; it is inherently a process wherein one’s righteousness grows and, as charity increases, so does the ability condignly to merit. He acknowledges God’s primacy but frames the covenant as a moral economy where grace does not destroy desert but produces it. This vision proves resilient and continues to shape Catholic teaching. It also sharpens the Reformed reply, because it clarifies that the disagreement is not simply about the priority of grace but about whether the right to life can ever be predicated on human acts, even grace-enabled acts, rather than exclusively on Christ’s **merit**.

Francis Turretin, representing Reformed scholastic precision, consolidates the Protestant doctrine with decisive distinctions. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he defines **merit** strictly as a work that obliges the rewarder by justice to remunerate, its intrinsic worth standing in proportion to the reward. By that definition, fallen humans cannot merit either condignly or congruently, because their works are imperfect, debt-laden, and performed in a regime of grace where God is never a debtor. To avoid equivocation, Turretin rejects the language of congruent **merit** for believers’ works, reserving all **merit** language for Christ as mediator and, with respect to prelapsarian Adam, allowing a hypothetical and subordinate category of **merit ex pacto**. For Adam, had he fulfilled the probation, the promise of life would have been owed by the faithfulness of God to his own covenant, not by intrinsic proportion in the act. This **covenant of works** category matters because it underscores the non-identical nature of prelapsarian and postlapsarian obedience. The former might have been the stipulated way to life by **covenant** arrangement; the latter, in the **covenant of grace**, cannot be that way, because Christ has fulfilled the condition for right to life in our stead. Turretin is equally careful on the necessity of good works. They are necessary not as causes of justification, nor as co-instruments with faith, but as necessary effects of union with Christ and as means ordained by God to the end of salvation in the order of life. He distinguishes the necessity of means from the necessity of cause, and of consequence from simple absolute necessity. The believer’s obedience is a necessary path but not a meritorious cause. On the last judgment according to works, Turretin insists it is a vindicatory judgment, declarative of the reality of faith and **union with Christ**, not a co-ground of a second justificatory event. He deploys the category of **vindication** to interpret James 2 and Matthew 25, arguing that Abraham’s justification in James is demonstrative and evidential in the history of redemption.

Herman Witsius, in The Economy of the Covenants, extends this **federal theology** into a pastoral key. He resists both antinomian claims that the covenant of grace is without demand and neonomian constructions that insert obedience as a new law conditioning justification. Witsius distinguishes between the principal condition of the covenant, fulfilled by Christ, and subordinate conditions relative to the administration of life in the covenant, namely faith as the sole **instrumental cause** receiving Christ and repentance and obedience as inseparable fruits. Faith is the condition in a purely receptive sense, not a meritorious work. Works are not conditions of entrance or title to life but conditions of covenantal communion and the ordained way to the inheritance, sustained by the Spirit. Witsius attends carefully to reward texts. He frames them as rewards of grace to filial obedience, God’s faithfulness to his own promises to delight in what his Spirit produces. Thus, while he grants extensive divine promises attached to **evangelical obedience**, he sustains the denial of all human **merit**. The context of post-Reformation controversy matters here: Witsius navigates between the rigor of Rutherford and the neonomian drift associated with Baxter. His formula honors the absolute sufficiency of Christ’s **merit** and the reality that sanctification is integral to salvation’s possession.

With these figures in view, the internal, external, and contemporary debates can be integrated. Internally, the Reformed resisted neonomian tendencies that treat the gospel as a milder law whose conditions we can meet by grace. Baxter, in particular, spoke of sincere obedience as the condition of the new covenant in a way that threatened to make obedience co-instrumental with faith for acceptance. The Reformed scholastics rejected this, maintaining faith as the alone instrument of justification and obedience as its inseparable fruit. On the other flank, antinomian voices denied that good works are necessary, or blurred the third use of the law. Here the confessional tradition insisted on the necessity of good works as the way of life appointed by God, while denying that works are any part of the ground or instrument of justification. The debates about the republication of the **covenant of works** at Sinai also surface: if Adam could not strictly merit life by intrinsic proportion, does the language of **merit ex pacto** confuse the issue? The better line is Turretin’s: the meritorious register is proper to Christ alone among sinners, while in Adam the whole discussion is covenantal, not intrinsic. Within more recent Reformed circles, discussions of “final salvation” according to works must hew to this grammar of evidential judgment and reward of grace.

Externally, Trent’s doctrine that the justified truly and condignly merit eternal life remains the fixed opposite. The Reformed response is not to deny grace’s primacy but to deny that grace-transformed acts can ever share the same title-granting status as Christ’s **merit**. Scripture’s logic is that of imputation and adoption. The right to life is Christ’s, imputed to us. Reward attaches to our works, but those rewards are internal to filial life and do not constitute the title by which we inherit. The New Perspective adds a different pressure by reframing works as boundary markers of covenant membership rather than meritorious deeds. Yet even here the Reformed insist that Paul’s antithesis between works and faith concerns any works, boundary marking or otherwise, when deployed as a basis for right standing. The covenant membership framework must not be allowed to naturalize a final justification by Spirit-wrought works, which would functionally replicate the Tridentine move under new terms.

Contemporary debates repackage old errors. Federal Vision advocates often speak of initial justification by faith and final justification according to covenantal faithfulness, appealing to James 2 and Matthew 25. The Reformed rejoinder is crisp. There is one justification in the strict forensic sense, grounded in the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, and it occurs through faith alone. The final judgment according to works is an assessment of life that vindicates God’s transforming grace, not a second forensic justification that supplements Christ’s obedience. Appeals to covenantal union cannot obscure this, because **federal theology** itself insists on the unilateral foundation laid in Christ as the last Adam. Some contemporary evangelical discourse exacerbates confusion by speaking of “final salvation by works” without sharply distinguishing ground, instrument, and evidence. To preserve clarity, the Reformed must constantly reassert the architecture: justification by **imputation**, sanctification by **union with Christ**, glorification as the gift promised to those united to Christ, with good works necessary as fruit and as ordained means, rewarded by God in grace.

From Scripture, the classic presentation is straightforward. Romans 3–4 excludes works from the ground and instrument of justification. Ephesians 2 declares that salvation is by grace through faith, not a result of works, and then immediately adds that we are created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared that we should walk in them. This juxtaposition supplies the key pattern: works are the consequence and pathway of the saved, not the cause or condition of their title to life. Titus 3 denies works of righteousness as the basis of salvation, yet the letter brims with exhortations to good works as necessary adornment. James 2 is not a contradiction but a complement: justification there is either vindication before men or an evidential demonstration before God. Abraham’s faith is shown to be alive by his obedience, and Scripture says that faith was completed by his works, not that works became co-instrumental in the forensic act. Matthew 25 and Revelation 20 speak unapologetically of judgment according to works, and 2 Corinthians 5 speaks of recompense. Yet none of these texts shift the ground of acceptance; they reveal the life of those accepted in Christ. 1 Corinthians 3 addresses degrees of reward in ministerial labor, again within a wholly gracious economy.

We can now articulate the defended position. In the **covenant of grace**, the right to eternal life is grounded solely in the **merit** of Christ’s obedience unto death, imputed to believers through faith alone. Believers’ good works, wrought by the Spirit through **union with Christ**, are necessary as fruits and as God-appointed means for perseverance, growth in holiness, assurance, and the eschatological vindication of God’s justifying grace. God truly rewards these works, keeping his promises, but the rewards are rewards of grace, not of **merit**. There is no condign or congruent **merit** in believers’ works with respect to justification or title to life. If the term **merit ex pacto** is used at all, it should be restricted to prelapsarian and Christic contexts, not to the **covenant of grace** administration of believers’ obedience. This doctrine secures sola fide, honors the integrity of sanctification, and accounts for biblical reward without capitulating to Tridentine synergy.

Anticipating examiner objections helps sharpen the contours. If works play any role at the final judgment, how is that not a second justification by works? It is because roles differ: justification has a ground and instrument, which are Christ and faith; the last judgment has a criterion of evidence that displays the reality of union with Christ. The legal standing is not augmented; it is vindicated. Does saying works are necessary make them conditions of salvation? Necessity is multiform. They are necessary of consequence and as means in the order of life, not as causes conferring right. God has appointed holiness as the path without which no one will see the Lord, but he has also appointed Christ as the sole basis for seeing him. Do reward texts not imply deservedness? They imply divine faithfulness to promise and paternal delight in his own grace. The asymmetry remains: God crowns his own gifts. If Adam could be said to have merited ex pacto, why not believers? Because believers’ works are both imperfect and performed under a covenant where the condition of right to life is already fulfilled in Christ. The structure of covenantal obligation is not symmetrical between Eden and Zion. Finally, what stops this from collapsing into quietism? The Spirit’s indwelling and the new covenant’s promises drive obedience. The third use of the law, union with Christ’s resurrection life, and the church’s discipline all bind the believer to a life of **evangelical obedience** that is real, costly, and Spirit-wrought.

This doctrine coheres across loci. It preserves the doctrine of Christ’s active and passive obedience by refusing to dilute his unique **merit**. It stabilizes assurance by rooting title to life outside us while also explaining why assurance is ordinarily strengthened through **evangelical obedience**. It clarifies sacramental theology by preventing any sacramental work from becoming an instrument of justification, while allowing that sacraments nourish faith unto holiness. It sustains the third use of the law within **federal theology**, showing law as rule of life for the justified without reintroducing a legal covenant. And it answers the perennial pastoral puzzle about rewards: God promises to reward because he is a Father who loves to crown his grace, not because he is a creditor tallying debts.

The decisive figures converge on a defensible center when properly ordered. Augustine’s insistence that God crowns his gifts sets the foundation. Aquinas’s distinctions sharpen the questions but, when extended into condign **merit** for the justified, compromise the uniqueness of Christ’s title-granting work. Calvin re-centers the economy on **imputation**, **union with Christ**, and reward as paternal generosity. Bellarmine articulates the Tridentine alternative that Protestantism must continue to reject. Turretin provides the categorical clarity necessary to keep necessity, reward, and non-merit straight, and Witsius shows how to administer the doctrine in a living **covenant** without legalism. The upshot is simple and sturdy enough for examination and ministry: good works are necessary and will be rewarded; they are not meritorious. Christ alone is worthy. God crowns his grace.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: In the **covenant of grace**, believers’ good works are Spirit-wrought fruits and ordained means for perseverance, assurance, and eschatological vindication and reward; they possess no **merit** for justification or title to life, which rests solely on Christ’s imputed righteousness.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: grace precedes all; God crowns his own gifts; reward is gratuitous, not **merit** in commutative justice.
  - Thomas Aquinas: justification as infusion; condign vs congruent **merit**; in grace, works can condignly merit life by divine ordination.
  - John Calvin: sola fide grounded in **imputation** and **union with Christ**; works necessary as fruit; reward is fatherly and gracious, not meritorious.
  - Robert Bellarmine: Tridentine defense of true **merit** of good works for increase of justification and eternal life.
  - Francis Turretin: denies all human **merit** postlapsum; allows **merit ex pacto** only for Adam and uniquely for Christ; affirms necessity of works as means and evidences; final judgment as **vindication**.
  - Herman Witsius: **federal theology** pastoralized; principal condition fulfilled by Christ; subordinate “conditions” as fruits; rewards as promises of grace.
- Debates:
  - Internal: antinomian vs neonomian; Baxter’s “new law”; conditions vs fruits; faith alone as the sole instrument; last judgment as evidential not justificatory.
  - External: Trent and Bellarmine on condign **merit**; New Perspective pressures about works and covenant membership.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision on final justification; talk of “final salvation by works”; republication and **merit ex pacto** nuance.
- Defended position: Good works are necessary and truly rewarded by God within the **covenant of grace**, yet they are non-meritorious; only Christ’s obedience has **merit** for our right to life; final judgment is according to works but not on account of works.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Are good works necessary for salvation? Yes, as necessary fruits and means, not as causes or instruments of justification.
  - Do believers’ works merit anything? No; rewards are rewards of grace; God crowns his own gifts.
  - How read James 2 with Romans 3–4? James teaches evidential vindication of living faith; Paul excludes works from the ground and instrument of justification.
  - What of final judgment according to works? It is declarative and distributive within adoption, not a second justificatory ground.
  - Why allow **merit ex pacto** for Adam but not believers? Adam’s arrangement was prelapsarian and stipulated; believers’ works are imperfect and the title is already secured by Christ.
