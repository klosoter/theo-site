# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **union with Christ**, **justification**, and **sanctification** has shaped contemporary discussions of **good works** and **merit** in the **covenant of grace**. Gaffin insists that good works are the necessary fruit of saving faith, inseparably linked to union with Christ, but categorically denies that they function as **meritorious grounds** for justification or final salvation. He upholds the classic Reformed distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing the Christ-centered, non-meritorious character of the believer’s obedience.

- "Good works are not the ground or instrument of justification, but they are its necessary and inevitable fruit." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in *The Westminster Theological Journal*)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (in *Theonomy: A Reformed Critique*)
- "Justification and Eschatology" (in *Justification: What’s at Stake in the Current Debates?*)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Source of Good Works**
    - Good works flow from the believer’s vital union with the resurrected Christ.
    - This union is the foundation for both justification and sanctification.
    - Good works are inseparable from faith but are not the basis of acceptance before God.
    - The Spirit’s work in uniting believers to Christ ensures the production of good works.
    - "Union with Christ by faith is the central soteriological reality from which all else flows." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Rejection of Merit in the Covenant of Grace**
    - The concept of merit is reserved for Christ’s obedience, not the believer’s.
    - Believers’ good works, though necessary, do not earn or merit any aspect of salvation.
    - The covenant of grace is fundamentally opposed to any notion of human merit.
    - All benefits in the covenant of grace are received by faith alone, not by works.
    - "The notion of merit is out of place in the covenant of grace, except as it applies to Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Necessity of Good Works for Salvation’s Consummation**
    - Good works are necessary as evidence of genuine faith and union with Christ.
    - They are the means by which believers persevere to final salvation, not the ground of it.
    - The New Testament’s warnings and exhortations assume the necessity of obedience.
    - Final judgment according to works is consistent with justification by faith alone.
    - "Good works are necessary for salvation—not as its basis, but as its path and evidence." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Distinction between Justification and Sanctification**
    - Justification is a once-for-all declarative act based on Christ’s righteousness alone.
    - Sanctification is the ongoing work of the Spirit producing good works in the believer.
    - The two are inseparable but must not be confused or conflated.
    - Good works belong to sanctification, not to the ground of justification.
    - "Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable benefits of union with Christ." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Good Works**
    - Good works are oriented toward the eschatological consummation of salvation.
    - The resurrection of Christ inaugurates the new creation, empowering believers’ obedience.
    - Final judgment will publicly vindicate the reality of faith through works.
    - The believer’s obedience is a participation in the age-to-come, not a means of earning it.
    - "The eschatological verdict is anticipated in justification, but its public manifestation awaits the final judgment according to works." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** and his careful distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** have profoundly influenced Reformed soteriology, especially regarding the role of good works in the **covenant of grace**. His work has provided clarity in debates over the relationship between faith, works, and assurance, countering both antinomian and neonomian tendencies. Gaffin’s legacy endures in his students and in the ongoing retrieval of classic Reformed categories for contemporary theological reflection.
