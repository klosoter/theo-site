# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline offered a distinctive interpretation of **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing the fundamental distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**. He rejected the notion that human obedience in the covenant of grace could ever constitute true **merit** before God, insisting that all blessings in this covenant are grounded in **Christ’s federal headship** and **imputed righteousness** rather than in any intrinsic worth of believers’ works.

- "The inheritance secured by Christ is bestowed upon his people as a matter of grace, not as a reward for their own merit." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of works** is based on the principle of **merit** and strict justice.
    - The **covenant of grace** is grounded in **divine promise** and **Christ’s obedience**.
    - Good works in the covenant of grace are evidential, not meritorious.
    - The two covenants operate on fundamentally different principles.
    - "The principle of works is not to be confused with the principle of grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Christ’s Merit as the Sole Ground of Inheritance**
    - Only Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the covenant of works meritoriously.
    - Believers receive the inheritance by virtue of union with Christ.
    - Human good works are never the basis for receiving eschatological blessing.
    - The merit of Christ is imputed, not infused or earned by believers.
    - "It is Christ’s obedience alone that secures the inheritance for the saints." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Good Works as Evidence, Not Ground, of Salvation**
    - Good works function as the fruit and evidence of saving faith.
    - They are necessary as the marks of a true covenant member.
    - These works do not establish a claim on God’s reward.
    - Assurance is rooted in Christ’s work, not in the believer’s performance.
    - "The good works of the saints are the evidence, not the cause, of their inheritance." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Typological Function of Obedience in Redemptive History**
    - Old covenant figures (e.g., Israel) serve as types pointing to Christ’s obedience.
    - Israel’s land tenure under the Mosaic covenant is a typological republication of the works principle.
    - The typological function does not reintroduce merit for believers under grace.
    - The ultimate fulfillment is found in Christ’s perfect obedience.
    - "The typological kingdom under the old covenant pointed forward to the antitypical inheritance secured by Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Rejection of Intrinsic Human Merit in the Covenant of Grace**
    - Fallen humanity cannot achieve merit before God.
    - Even Spirit-wrought obedience is tainted by sin and cannot earn reward.
    - All blessings in the covenant of grace are gifts, not wages.
    - The concept of “evangelical merit” is theologically incoherent.
    - "There is no place for human merit in the administration of the covenant of grace." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s rigorous distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed covenant theology, especially debates over the role of **good works** in salvation. His insistence on Christ’s exclusive merit has influenced discussions on justification and assurance. While some have critiqued his views on republication and typology, Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking clarity on the relationship between law, gospel, and the believer’s obedience.
