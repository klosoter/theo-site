# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann addresses **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace** by emphasizing the transformative and eschatological character of **God’s grace**. He firmly rejects any notion of human merit as a basis for salvation, insisting that good works are the fruit of participation in the coming **Kingdom of God** and the life of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "Good works are not the precondition of salvation, but its fruit and sign in the world." ("Theology of Hope")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Ethics of Hope (2010)
- The Coming of God (1995)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Merit-Based Salvation**
   - Salvation is grounded solely in **God’s grace**, not in human achievement.
   - Good works are a response to, not a cause of, divine acceptance.
   - The concept of merit is incompatible with the eschatological nature of the covenant.
   - Human action is always preceded and enabled by God’s initiative.
   - "Grace does not reward merit, but creates the new life in which good works become possible." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Good Works**
   - Good works anticipate and participate in the promised **Kingdom of God**.
   - The future of God’s reign shapes ethical action in the present.
   - Believers act in hope, not to earn favor, but to witness to God’s coming justice.
   - The church’s mission is to embody signs of the new creation.
   - "Christian action is hope in motion, not a means of securing merit." (Ethics of Hope)

3. **Participation in the Life of God**
   - Through the **Holy Spirit**, believers are drawn into God’s redemptive work.
   - Good works are expressions of participation, not transactions for merit.
   - The **covenant of grace** is relational and communal, not contractual.
   - The Spirit empowers believers to reflect Christ’s love and justice.
   - "The Spirit of God liberates us for the works of love, not for the accumulation of merit." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

4. **Solidarity with the Oppressed**
   - Good works are oriented toward liberation and justice for the marginalized.
   - The covenant community is called to reflect God’s preferential option for the poor.
   - Acts of justice are signs of the inbreaking **Kingdom**, not grounds for boasting.
   - The church’s vocation is to be a community of hope and transformation.
   - "Where the church stands with the oppressed, it becomes a sign of God’s future." (The Crucified God)

5. **Critique of Legalism and Individualism**
   - Legalistic understandings of merit distort the gospel of **grace**.
   - Good works are communal and eschatological, not individual achievements.
   - The **covenant of grace** calls for mutual responsibility and shared hope.
   - Faith and action are inseparable in the life of the redeemed community.
   - "Faith without works is dead, but works without hope are empty." (Ethics of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **grace**, **eschatology**, and Christian ethics. By reframing good works as participation in God’s future rather than as merit, he has challenged both legalistic and individualistic tendencies in modern theology. His emphasis on the **Kingdom of God** and solidarity with the oppressed continues to influence liberation theology and global Christian thought. Moltmann’s vision of hope remains a vital resource for understanding the relationship between faith, action, and the covenant of grace.
