# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace** through the lens of his distinctive **transcendental theology** and **supernatural existential**. He emphasized that human cooperation with **divine grace** is always enabled by God's prior self-communication, making all genuine merit ultimately a response to grace rather than autonomous achievement. Rahner rejected any notion of **Pelagianism**, insisting that even the possibility of meritorious action is grounded in the ongoing presence of **God’s grace**.

- "Even the possibility of merit is itself a grace, for it presupposes the supernatural existential which is the radical capacity for God." ("Foundations of Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Supernatural Existential as the Basis for Merit**
    - Every human is endowed with a **supernatural existential**, a permanent orientation toward God’s self-communication.
    - This existential is not earned but is a gratuitous gift, making all good works possible.
    - Human freedom is always already graced, so merit is never purely human achievement.
    - The capacity for merit is rooted in God’s prior initiative, not in autonomous human effort.
    - "The supernatural existential is the radical presupposition for any possibility of merit." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Grace as Enabling and Preceding All Good Works**
    - **Grace** is always prevenient, enabling any genuinely good work.
    - Good works are a response to God’s self-gift, not a means to manipulate or obligate God.
    - Human cooperation with grace is real but always secondary to divine initiative.
    - The distinction between nature and grace is maintained, but grace is seen as the fulfillment of nature.
    - "Grace is not something added from outside, but the fulfillment of the person’s deepest capacity." (Nature and Grace)

3. **Rejection of Pelagianism**
    - Rahner firmly rejects any suggestion that humans can merit salvation apart from grace.
    - All merit is derivative, grounded in God’s prior action and presence.
    - Human works, even when meritorious, are never independent of God’s enabling grace.
    - The doctrine of merit is safeguarded from any form of self-sufficiency or legalism.
    - "There is no merit without grace; all is grace from the beginning." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

4. **Dynamic Understanding of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is not a static contract but a living relationship initiated and sustained by God.
    - Good works are the fruit of this relationship, not its condition or cause.
    - The covenant is universal in scope, rooted in God’s will to save all.
    - Rahner’s theology emphasizes the ongoing, dialogical nature of the covenant.
    - "The covenant is the history of God’s self-communication and our graced response." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Merit as Participation in Christ’s Merit**
    - Human merit is always a participation in the merit of **Christ**, not something separate or parallel.
    - The believer’s good works are united to Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - The Church, as the Body of Christ, is the context in which merit is realized and recognized.
    - Merit is thus ecclesial and Christocentric, not individualistic.
    - "Our merit is only possible because it is a participation in the merit of Christ." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology of **good works** and **merit** within the covenant of grace has profoundly shaped post-Vatican II Catholic thought, especially in its emphasis on the primacy of **grace** and the rejection of any form of Pelagianism. His concept of the **supernatural existential** provided a new framework for understanding human cooperation with God, influencing both ecumenical dialogue and contemporary soteriology. Rahner’s work continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between nature and grace, and his Christocentric approach to merit remains influential in both academic and pastoral contexts.
