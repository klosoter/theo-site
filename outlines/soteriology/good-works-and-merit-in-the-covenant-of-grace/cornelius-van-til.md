# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the question of **good works** and **merit** in the **covenant of grace** through the lens of **Reformed federal theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized that all human obedience, even within the covenant, is grounded in **union with Christ** and is never meritorious in itself, but always dependent on God's sovereign grace. Van Til was insistent that any notion of merit in the covenant of grace must be understood in a way that preserves the Creator-creature distinction and the primacy of Christ's **active and passive obedience**.

- "There is no merit in the works of man, for all that he does is by the grace of God and in Christ Jesus." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace is Unilateral and Gracious**
    - The covenant of grace is initiated and maintained solely by God's sovereign will.
    - Human participation in the covenant is always a response to divine grace, not a ground for merit.
    - The structure of the covenant highlights the Creator-creature distinction.
    - Any obedience within the covenant is enabled by the Holy Spirit.
    - "The covenant of grace is not a contract between equals but a relationship established by God’s sovereign grace." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Good Works Flow from Union with Christ**
    - Good works are the fruit of regeneration and union with Christ, not the basis for acceptance.
    - Believers' obedience is always derivative, never autonomous or self-sufficient.
    - The efficacy of good works is rooted in Christ’s finished work.
    - Sanctification is inseparable from justification but distinct in its role.
    - "All that the believer does is done in Christ and by the power of the Spirit." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Rejection of Human Merit in Salvation**
    - Van Til denies that human works can ever establish merit before God.
    - The concept of merit is reserved for Christ’s obedience alone.
    - Any talk of merit in the covenant of grace must be analogical, not univocal.
    - Human obedience is always a matter of gratitude, not earning.
    - "There is no place for human merit in the covenant of grace; all is of Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Christ’s Obedience as the Only True Merit**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience is the exclusive ground of justification.
    - The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is central to the believer’s standing.
    - Human good works are accepted only as they are sanctified by Christ’s merit.
    - The work of Christ fulfills the demands of the law on behalf of the elect.
    - "Only the obedience of Christ can be said to have merit before God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Defense of Reformed Soteriology**
    - Van Til’s apologetic method insists that all theological reasoning begins with the presupposition of God’s revelation.
    - The doctrines of grace, including the nature of good works, must be defended on the basis of Scripture alone.
    - Attempts to ground merit in human action reflect an autonomous epistemology.
    - The antithesis between covenantal thinking and all forms of synergism is foundational.
    - "The Reformed faith alone maintains the absolute dependence of man upon God in all things, including salvation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **covenant of grace** and his rejection of human merit have profoundly shaped Reformed theology and apologetics, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the Creator-creature distinction and the centrality of Christ’s merit has influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Van Til’s presuppositional approach continues to inform debates on the relationship between faith, works, and assurance in the Christian life. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of a robustly grace-centered understanding of salvation.
