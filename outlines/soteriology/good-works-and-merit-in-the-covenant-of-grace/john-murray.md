# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading Reformed theologian, articulated a robust doctrine of **good works** within the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing their necessity as the fruit of **justification** and evidence of **union with Christ**, while firmly rejecting any notion of **merit** before God. For Murray, good works are the inevitable result of **regeneration** and **sanctification**, yet they never form the ground of acceptance with God, which rests solely on the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.

- "Good works are never the ground of our acceptance, but they are always the necessary evidence of our faith and union with Christ." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good works as evidence, not ground, of justification**
    - Good works flow from true faith and are inseparable from it.
    - They serve as the necessary evidence of a believer’s union with Christ.
    - Justification is grounded solely in Christ’s righteousness, not in human works.
    - Assurance of salvation is strengthened by the presence of good works.
    - "The faith that justifies is never alone; it is always accompanied by all other saving graces, and is no dead faith." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Rejection of merit in the covenant of grace**
    - No human obedience can merit favor or reward from God in the covenant of grace.
    - All blessings are received by grace alone, through faith.
    - The concept of merit is reserved for Christ’s obedience, not the believer’s.
    - Any notion of condign or congruent merit is incompatible with Reformed soteriology.
    - "There is no merit in our obedience; all is of grace from first to last." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Necessity of good works in sanctification**
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of sanctification.
    - Sanctification is a work of God’s grace, producing real transformation.
    - Believers are called to active obedience as a response to God’s saving work.
    - The law remains a rule of life for those in Christ.
    - "Sanctification is a process in which the believer is called to active and diligent pursuit of holiness." (Principles of Conduct)

4. **Covenant of grace as the context for obedience**
    - The covenant of grace establishes the relationship in which good works are possible and meaningful.
    - Obedience is covenantal, not contractual; it arises from gratitude, not legal obligation.
    - The promises and commands of the covenant are inseparable.
    - The Spirit enables covenant faithfulness in the believer.
    - "The obedience of the believer is covenantal, springing from the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit." (The Covenant of Grace)

5. **Union with Christ as the source of good works**
    - All spiritual blessings, including the ability to do good works, flow from union with Christ.
    - Good works are the outworking of the believer’s participation in Christ’s life.
    - Union with Christ ensures both justification and sanctification.
    - The believer’s obedience is Christ-centered and Spirit-empowered.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful distinction between **good works** and **merit** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of the **covenant of grace**, reinforcing the absolute priority of grace in salvation. His writings continue to influence debates on the relationship between justification, sanctification, and obedience, especially in contexts wary of legalism or antinomianism. Murray’s legacy endures in his insistence that good works are necessary as evidence of faith, but never as the basis for acceptance with God.
