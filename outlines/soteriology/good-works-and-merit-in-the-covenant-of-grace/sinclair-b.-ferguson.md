# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948–)

Sinclair B. Ferguson articulates a classic **Reformed understanding** of **good works** within the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing their necessity as the fruit of **union with Christ** but rejecting any notion of **merit** before God. He insists that while believers are called to obedience, all true good works flow from **justification by faith alone** and are accepted solely on the basis of **Christ’s merit**.

- "Good works are the evidence, not the ground, of our justification, and they are the fruit of our union with Christ." ("The Whole Christ")

## Key Works

- The Whole Christ (2016)
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction (1981)
- Children of the Living God (1989)
- Devoted to God: Blueprints for Sanctification (2016)
- Some Pastors and Teachers (2017)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good works as fruit, not ground, of justification**
    - Good works are the necessary evidence of saving faith.
    - They do not contribute to the believer’s acceptance before God.
    - Justification is by faith alone, apart from works.
    - Good works flow from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - "Our works are never the ground of our acceptance, but always its fruit." (The Whole Christ)

2. **Rejection of merit in the covenant of grace**
    - Believers cannot earn or merit favor with God by their works.
    - All merit belongs to Christ alone, imputed to believers by faith.
    - The concept of merit is incompatible with grace.
    - Good works are accepted only because of Christ’s mediation.
    - "There is no place for human merit in the covenant of grace; all is of Christ." (The Christian Life)

3. **Necessity of good works for sanctification**
    - Good works are essential for growth in holiness.
    - Sanctification is the work of the Spirit, producing obedience.
    - Good works are the means by which believers glorify God.
    - They are necessary for assurance, not for justification.
    - "Sanctification is always accompanied by the fruit of good works." (Devoted to God)

4. **Role of the law in the life of the believer**
    - The law guides believers in grateful obedience.
    - It exposes sin and drives believers to Christ.
    - The law is not a means of earning salvation.
    - Obedience to the law is empowered by the Spirit.
    - "The law is a rule of life for those who are already justified." (The Christian Life)

5. **Union with Christ as the foundation for good works**
    - All spiritual blessings, including good works, flow from union with Christ.
    - This union is the basis for both justification and sanctification.
    - Good works are the outworking of life in Christ.
    - The believer’s identity in Christ motivates true obedience.
    - "Union with Christ is the fountain from which all good works spring." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s teaching has reinforced the **Reformed distinction** between justification and sanctification, clarifying the place of good works in the Christian life. His emphasis on **union with Christ** and the utter exclusion of human merit has shaped contemporary Reformed pastoral theology and preaching. Through his writing and teaching, Ferguson has helped guard the church against both legalism and antinomianism, ensuring that the doctrine of the **covenant of grace** remains Christ-centered and grace-driven.
