# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer addressed the question of **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace** by emphasizing the utter gratuity of salvation and the non-meritorious character of human obedience. He rejected any notion that **good works** could serve as a basis for **justification** or establish a claim upon God, insisting instead that they are the fruit of **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Berkouwer, the **covenant of grace** excludes all boasting, grounding the believer’s life in gratitude rather than merit.

- "In the covenant of grace, all merit is excluded, and the good works of the believer are the fruit of faith, not its ground." ("Faith and Justification")

## Key Works

- Faith and Justification
- Faith and Sanctification
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Perseverance
- Studies in Dogmatics: Divine Election

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Human Merit in Salvation**
    - Argues that **merit** has no place in the **covenant of grace**.
    - Emphasizes that all human works are tainted by sin and cannot obligate God.
    - Maintains that justification is by **faith alone**, apart from works.
    - Sees any appeal to merit as undermining the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "The concept of merit is foreign to the gospel of grace." (Faith and Justification)

2. **Good Works as the Fruit of Faith**
    - Good works flow from genuine faith and are evidence of regeneration.
    - They are the result of the believer’s union with Christ and the indwelling Spirit.
    - Good works are not the basis for acceptance with God but the response to grace.
    - The believer’s obedience is marked by gratitude, not calculation of reward.
    - "Good works are not the ground of our salvation, but its grateful expression." (Faith and Sanctification)

3. **Covenant of Grace as Exclusion of Boasting**
    - The **covenant of grace** is structured to eliminate all human boasting.
    - All aspects of salvation, including sanctification, are gifts of God’s grace.
    - The believer’s standing before God is always rooted in Christ’s merit, not personal achievement.
    - The dynamic of the covenant is doxological, not transactional.
    - "Grace excludes all boasting, for it is God who works in us both to will and to do." (Faith and Perseverance)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Good Works**
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables and empowers believers to perform good works.
    - Sanctification is a work of God’s Spirit, not human self-improvement.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures that good works are truly pleasing to God.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the guarantee of fruitfulness in the Christian life.
    - "Without the Spirit, our works would remain dead and unacceptable." (Faith and Sanctification)

5. **Christ’s Merit as the Sole Ground of Acceptance**
    - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are the only true merit in the covenant.
    - Believers are accepted solely on the basis of Christ’s finished work.
    - Any notion of human merit detracts from the sufficiency of Christ.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s merit, not on the believer’s performance.
    - "Our hope is anchored in Christ’s merit, not in our own imperfect works." (The Work of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s careful articulation of the relationship between **good works**, **merit**, and the **covenant of grace** has shaped Reformed theology’s ongoing rejection of synergism and legalism. His insistence on the primacy of grace and the non-meritorious character of Christian obedience has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions of sanctification. Berkouwer’s work continues to serve as a corrective against any drift toward works-righteousness, reinforcing the centrality of **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer.
