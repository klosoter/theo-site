# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace** by emphasizing the primacy of **religious consciousness** and the believer’s participation in Christ’s **redemptive life**. He rejected traditional notions of **merit** as external reward, instead viewing good works as the natural expression of the **regenerate self** in communion with God, rooted in the transformative power of **grace** rather than legal obligation.

- "All truly Christian action is the result of the new creation, not a means to attain it." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics (lectures, posthumously published)
- Friedrich Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (Richard Crouter, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good Works as Expression of the Regenerate Life**
    - Good works flow from the believer’s renewed consciousness, not from obligation to law.
    - The ethical life is the manifestation of the inner transformation wrought by grace.
    - Good works are inseparable from faith, as both arise from the same spiritual source.
    - The value of good works lies in their authenticity as expressions of the new life in Christ.
    - "The Christian is not called to perform good works in order to become righteous, but because he is already made righteous." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Merit as Legal Transaction**
    - Merit is not a quantifiable achievement before God.
    - The concept of merit is incompatible with the relational and personal nature of faith.
    - Salvation is not earned but received through participation in Christ’s redemptive act.
    - Good works do not accrue merit but witness to the reality of grace.
    - "The notion of merit is foreign to the consciousness of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Covenant of Grace as Transformative Relationship**
    - The covenant is not a contract but a living relationship grounded in divine initiative.
    - Grace is the ongoing presence of God’s Spirit, effecting moral and spiritual renewal.
    - The believer’s participation in the covenant is marked by continual growth in holiness.
    - Good works are the fruit of this transformative relationship, not its condition.
    - "The covenant of grace is the fellowship of those who are made new in Christ." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
    - True religion is rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Ethical action arises from the inner movement of the Spirit, not external compulsion.
    - The subjective experience of grace shapes the believer’s moral life.
    - Good works are authentic only when they arise from genuine religious consciousness.
    - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing, but a distinct feeling." (On Religion)

5. **Christ as the Archetype and Mediator**
    - Christ embodies the perfect union of God-consciousness and ethical life.
    - Believers participate in Christ’s life through the Spirit, enabling good works.
    - The merit of Christ is unique and non-transferable; believers are united to him by faith.
    - Good works are possible only through the mediating presence of Christ.
    - "Christ is the Redeemer because in Him the God-consciousness was absolutely powerful." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **good works** and **merit** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, shifting the focus from legalistic frameworks to the inner life of faith and the transformative power of **grace**. His emphasis on **religious consciousness** and the relational nature of the **covenant of grace** paved the way for later liberal and existential approaches to Christian ethics. While his views diverged from classical Reformed categories, they remain foundational for understanding the development of modern theology’s approach to soteriology and Christian life.
