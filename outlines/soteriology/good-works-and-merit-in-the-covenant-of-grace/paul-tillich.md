# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **good works** and **merit** within the **covenant of grace** through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the primacy of **grace** over all human achievement. For Tillich, human actions cannot earn divine favor; rather, **justification** and **acceptance by God** are rooted in the **unconditional grace** revealed in Jesus as the "New Being." Good works are a response to grace, not a means to merit it.

- "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness... sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying: 'You are accepted.'" (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Grace Over Merit**
    - Human beings are estranged from God and cannot achieve reconciliation through their own efforts.
    - **Grace** is the unmerited acceptance of the estranged by God, breaking into human existence.
    - Good works are not a means to earn salvation but a response to having received grace.
    - The concept of merit is incompatible with the unconditional nature of grace.
    - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected."

2. **Existential Understanding of Good Works**
    - Good works arise from the transformation of the person by grace, not from adherence to external law.
    - The **New Being** in Christ enables authentic ethical action.
    - Good works are expressions of the new reality inaugurated by Christ, not prerequisites for it.
    - Ethical action is rooted in the individual's participation in the **Ground of Being**.
    - "The New Being is manifest in the power of transforming lives and communities." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Legalistic Merit**
    - Tillich critiques any system that treats good works as a legal claim upon God.
    - The **covenant of grace** is not a contract but a relationship grounded in divine initiative.
    - Legalistic understandings distort the existential encounter with God.
    - Faith is trust in grace, not calculation of merit.
    - "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Justification as Acceptance**
    - Justification is the acceptance of the unacceptable, not the reward of the meritorious.
    - The **Protestant principle** insists that no human achievement can stand before God.
    - Good works follow justification but do not cause it.
    - The **covenant of grace** is realized in the acceptance of the sinner.
    - "Justification by faith means that no religious act, no moral achievement, and no doctrinal belief can justify us." (The Protestant Era)

5. **Ethics as Response to Grace**
    - Ethics is grounded in the reality of grace, not in the pursuit of merit.
    - Good works are the fruit of participation in the **New Being**.
    - The ethical life is a sign of the **Kingdom of God** breaking into history.
    - The motivation for good works is gratitude, not self-justification.
    - "The ethical imperative is the expression of the ontological power of grace." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential interpretation of **grace** and **good works** challenged traditional merit-based soteriologies, especially within Protestant thought. His emphasis on the **unconditional acceptance** of the sinner and the transformation wrought by the **New Being** influenced 20th-century theology’s understanding of ethics and salvation. Tillich’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between faith, works, and the nature of the **covenant of grace** in both academic and pastoral contexts.
