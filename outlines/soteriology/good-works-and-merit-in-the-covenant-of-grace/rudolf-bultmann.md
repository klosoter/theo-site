# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **good works** and **merit** in the **covenant of grace** through his existential interpretation of the New Testament, emphasizing the priority of **faith** over works. He denied any salvific merit to human actions, insisting that justification is a matter of **God’s grace** received in authentic faith, not through the accumulation of good deeds or adherence to legalistic requirements.

- "Man cannot boast before God; he can only receive in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
   - Salvation is a gift of **God’s grace** and cannot be earned by human effort.
   - **Faith** is an existential response to the kerygma, not assent to doctrine or performance of works.
   - Good works are a result of faith, not a means to attain righteousness.
   - The concept of **merit** is incompatible with the New Testament message.
   - "Justification is by faith alone, apart from works of the law." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization of Covenant Concepts**
   - Traditional covenant language is reinterpreted existentially, not as a legal or transactional framework.
   - The **covenant of grace** is understood as God’s initiative calling for authentic existence.
   - Good works are not contractual obligations but expressions of new life in Christ.
   - The focus shifts from external observance to inward transformation.
   - "The call of God is not a legal demand but an existential summons." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Rejection of Human Merit**
   - Human actions have no intrinsic merit before God.
   - All boasting is excluded; salvation is entirely God’s act.
   - The notion of accumulating merit is a misunderstanding of the gospel.
   - Good works are signs of faith, not grounds for reward.
   - "No man can place God under obligation by his works." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Ethics as Response, Not Requirement**
   - Christian ethics arise from the encounter with Christ, not from legalistic requirements.
   - Good works are the fruit of faith, not prerequisites for entering the covenant.
   - The believer’s life is characterized by freedom, not bondage to law.
   - Ethical action is authentic only as a response to grace.
   - "Ethics is not a system of rules but a response to the event of Christ." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Existential Interpretation of Grace**
   - **Grace** is experienced in the present encounter with the Word, not as a static status.
   - The **covenant of grace** is realized in existential decision, not in ritual or law.
   - Good works are meaningful only as expressions of authentic existence before God.
   - The believer stands continually in need of grace, never achieving merit.
   - "Grace is not a possession but an event in which man is encountered by God." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **good works** and **merit** in the covenant of grace profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, especially in its rejection of legalism and emphasis on **faith** as existential trust. His demythologizing project challenged traditional categories and redirected theological focus toward the individual’s encounter with the kerygma. While controversial, his views continue to influence discussions on the relationship between faith, works, and grace in modern theology. Bultmann’s legacy endures in debates over the relevance of biblical categories for contemporary Christian existence.
