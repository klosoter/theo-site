# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a Reformed theologian, taught that **good works** are the necessary fruit of **regeneration** and **union with Christ** within the **covenant of grace**, but firmly denied that such works possess any **merit** before God. He emphasized that all human obedience is enabled by **grace alone**, and that believers’ good works serve as evidence of faith rather than a basis for justification or reward in the sense of strict merit.

- "Good works are not the ground of our salvation, but they are its necessary fruit." (Saved by Grace)

## Key Works

- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Created in God’s Image (1986)
- Five Views on Sanctification (contributor, 1987)
- The Four Major Cults (1963)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good Works as Fruit, Not Ground, of Salvation**
    - Good works flow from genuine faith and are inseparable from true conversion.
    - They serve as evidence of **regeneration** and the believer’s new identity in Christ.
    - Hoekema insists that justification is by **faith alone**, excluding works as any ground.
    - Good works are the result of the Holy Spirit’s work, not autonomous human effort.
    "Good works are not the ground of our salvation, but they are its necessary fruit." (Saved by Grace)

2. **Rejection of Human Merit Before God**
    - Hoekema denies that believers can earn or merit favor from God by their works.
    - He distinguishes between **condign merit** (strict justice) and **congruent merit** (fittingness), rejecting both in the context of salvation.
    - All obedience is possible only through God’s enabling **grace**, not human achievement.
    - Any reward given by God is an expression of grace, not payment for merit.
    "There is no such thing as merit in the covenant of grace." (Saved by Grace)

3. **Role of Good Works in Assurance and Judgment**
    - Good works provide assurance to believers that their faith is genuine.
    - At the final judgment, works are cited as evidence of saving faith, not as the basis for entry into eternal life.
    - Hoekema affirms the biblical teaching that believers will be judged “according to works,” but interprets this evidentially.
    - This perspective safeguards both the necessity of **sanctification** and the primacy of grace.
    "Works are the evidence, not the ground, of our justification." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Union with Christ as the Source of Good Works**
    - All good works are the outworking of the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - The Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ, enabling them to bear fruit.
    - **Sanctification** is rooted in this vital union, not in autonomous moral striving.
    - The believer’s life of obedience is a participation in Christ’s own righteousness.
    "It is only in union with Christ that we can bring forth good works." (Saved by Grace)

5. **Covenant of Grace as the Framework for Obedience**
    - The **covenant of grace** establishes the context in which obedience is both commanded and enabled.
    - God’s promises and commands are inseparably linked in the covenant relationship.
    - The law is not a means of earning salvation but a guide for grateful living.
    - The covenantal structure ensures that all of salvation, including **sanctification**, is by grace.
    "The covenant of grace excludes all human merit and is grounded in God’s gracious initiative." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **good works** and **merit** within the covenant of grace has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **sanctification** and assurance. His clear distinction between the evidential role of works and the exclusive ground of justification in Christ has provided a robust defense of **sola fide** while affirming the necessity of obedience. Hoekema’s writings continue to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking to uphold both the demands of holiness and the sufficiency of grace in the Christian life.
