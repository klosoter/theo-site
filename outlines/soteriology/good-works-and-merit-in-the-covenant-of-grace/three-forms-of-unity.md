# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine** of **good works** within the **covenant of grace**, emphasizing that while believers are called to obedience, their works are not meritorious for **justification**. Good works are the fruit of **regeneration** and evidence of **gratitude**, but they do not earn **salvation** or establish any claim upon God. The confessions consistently reject the notion of **human merit** in the covenant of grace, grounding acceptance solely in **Christ’s righteousness**.

- "Our good works, however, are all of them defiled and mixed with so much weakness, that they cannot endure the severity of God’s judgment." (Belgic Confession, Art. 24)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 22–24
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 60, 62, 86–91
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine III/IV and V
- Lyle D. Bierma, "An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism" (secondary)
- Cornelis P. Venema, "The Promise of the Future" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone, Not by Works**
    - Justification is grounded solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.
    - Good works are explicitly excluded as any ground or part of justification.
    - Faith is the only instrument by which believers receive Christ and His benefits.
    - The confessions reject any notion that human works can merit favor before God.
    - "Therefore we justly say with Paul, that we are justified by faith alone, or by faith apart from works." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

2. **Good Works as Fruit and Evidence of Regeneration**
    - Good works flow from true faith and are evidence of **spiritual renewal**.
    - They are the result of the **Holy Spirit’s work** in the believer.
    - Good works demonstrate gratitude for redemption, not a means to obtain it.
    - The confessions stress that without regeneration, no true good works are possible.
    - "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 64)

3. **Rejection of Human Merit in the Covenant of Grace**
    - The confessions deny that even the best works can merit any reward from God.
    - All human works are tainted by sin and fall short of divine perfection.
    - Any reward given is of **grace**, not of merit or debt.
    - The believer’s relationship to God remains one of humble dependence, not contractual merit.
    - "Our best works in this life are all imperfect and defiled with sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 62)

4. **Role of Good Works in Assurance and Sanctification**
    - Good works serve to assure believers of their faith and election.
    - They are the means by which believers glorify God and win others to Christ.
    - The confessions teach that sanctification is inseparable from justification, though distinct.
    - Good works are necessary as the way of life for the redeemed, not as a condition for acceptance.
    - "By their fruits you shall know them." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 86)

5. **Necessity of Good Works Without Legalism**
    - Good works are necessary as the response of gratitude, not as a legal requirement for salvation.
    - The law remains a guide for Christian living, not a means of earning favor.
    - The confessions uphold the ongoing relevance of the **moral law** for believers.
    - Christian obedience is motivated by love and gratitude, not fear of punishment or hope of reward.
    - "We do good works, not that we may merit by them (for what can we merit?), but because God has so commanded us." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 86)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped the **Reformed understanding of the relationship between faith, works, and merit** in the covenant of grace. Their careful distinction between justification and sanctification, and their rejection of all forms of human merit, have provided a robust theological foundation for Reformed churches worldwide. By rooting good works in gratitude and the work of the Holy Spirit, these confessions continue to guard the gospel of grace while promoting genuine holiness. Their influence endures in catechesis, preaching, and ecumenical dialogue on the doctrine of salvation.
