### TITLE
Grace, Reward, and Covenant: Reformed Denial of Merit and Defense of Necessary Good Works

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How, in the **covenant of grace**, can good works be necessary and truly rewarded without introducing any human **merit** into justification or undermining sola fide.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Francis Turretin, John Owen.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian anti-Pelagianism, medieval scholastic accounts of merit, Reformation and Reformed orthodox **federal theology**, and post‑Tridentine Roman Catholic doctrine.
- Debates: Internal Reformed debates over conditions in the covenant of grace and “future justification”; external debates with Roman Catholic **merit de condigno/de congruo** and various forms of Neonomianism and antinomianism; contemporary disputes over Lordship salvation, final judgment “according to works,” and accusations that Reformed covenant theology smuggles in works-righteousness.
- Position defended: In the **covenant of grace**, good works are necessary as God‑ordained conditions and evidences for salvation and will truly receive reward, but they are in no sense meritorious before God, since Christ alone fulfills all **covenant of works** merit and believers’ works are accepted only in him.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of good works and merit in the **covenant of grace** forces a candidate to stand at one of the most delicate junctures in Reformed theology: the point where sola fide, the **covenant of works**, and **federal theology** meet the biblical insistence that God will judge every person “according to works” and that he “rewards” obedience. The question is not whether good works matter in the covenant of grace, but how they matter. Are they meritorious, instrumental, evidential, or merely ornamental? Can they be called “conditions” without collapsing the covenant of grace into a new law? The position to be defended is that in the covenant of grace good works are necessary as God‑ordained conditions and evidences of salvation, and are truly rewarded by God, yet they are in no sense meritorious in relation to justification or eternal life, because all true merit before God is exhausted in Christ’s obedience under the covenant of works, and believers’ imperfect works are accepted solely in him.

To frame this rightly we must begin with Augustine, who decisively set the Augustinian and later Reformed trajectory on both grace and reward. In his anti‑Pelagian works such as On the Spirit and the Letter and On Grace and Free Will, Augustine insists that fallen man can do no truly good work without prevenient and cooperating grace. Any “merit” language is subordinated to the axiom that whatever righteousness we have is God’s gift. His famous line that God crowns his own gifts in us expresses a crucial conceptual move: reward language is preserved, but its ground is not autonomous human performance; rather, it is grace working in the believer. Augustine thus creates a framework that allows the church to speak of “merit” while rendering it internally dependent on grace. This double move is the seed of both later Roman Catholic and Reformed developments. Roman doctrine will lean into the reality of infused righteousness as the formal principle of justification and genuine condign merit, while the Reformed will radicalize the asymmetry between grace and human contribution, rejecting merit language for the regenerate altogether. But Augustine’s core insight that reward does not imply Pelagian self-sufficiency is non‑negotiable for any orthodox account of good works in the covenant of grace.

The medieval scholastic tradition, especially in Thomas Aquinas, systematized “merit” with great precision, and any Westminster candidate will be pressed on Aquinas whether or not they have read the Summa in full. In the Summa Theologiae, especially in the Prima Secundae, questions on merit, Aquinas distinguishes **merit de condigno** from **merit de congruo**. Merit de condigno is a strict merit grounded in justice, where the reward is due in proportion to the work, given the order God has freely established. Merit de congruo is a kind of fittingness, where God’s reward is not owed in strict justice but is suitable given his generosity and promises. In Aquinas, the justified, by grace-infused charity, perform works that are truly meritorious de condigno of eternal life, because God has ordained that such works, done in grace, have this proportionate value relative to the reward. Yet even here, Aquinas insists that the whole order of merit is grounded in God’s antecedent grace and ordination; no one can merit the first grace. An examiner might challenge: does this not preserve sola gratia while allowing for real human merit? From a Reformed standpoint, the answer must be no. Aquinas’s structure effectively places created, inherent righteousness as a secondary ground of God’s favorable verdict, so that God’s judgment of life is not only for Christ’s sake but also in view of our inherent charity as a meritorious ground. This position laid conceptual foundations that Trent would codify, and from which Reformed **federal theology** decisively departs.

With Trent’s canonization of condign merit for the justified, the Reformation’s insistence on forensic justification by imputed righteousness appears as an alternative architecture of grace and reward. It is here that Calvin must be treated in detail. Writing in the Institutes of the Christian Religion, especially book 3, Calvin holds together four claims that define the classic Reformed position. First, justification is by faith alone, and its formal ground is the imputed righteousness of Christ, both his satisfaction and his active obedience. Second, faith is never alone but is always accompanied by regeneration and sanctification, and thus by good works that flow from union with Christ. Third, Scripture speaks truly of divine “rewards” and of judgment according to works, but this must be understood as God’s fatherly recompense toward his children, not as strict merit. Fourth, Calvin categorically rejects any notion that the works of the regenerate merit eternal life in the sense of establishing a just claim upon God.

Calvin’s handling of merit language is programmatic. He sometimes uses merit rhetorically, but carefully explains that even when God “rewards” the works of believers, he is crowning his own gifts, echoing Augustine. Calvin stresses the disproportion between finite, imperfect acts and the infinite good of eternal life, arguing that no strict proportion obtains that could ground merit in the Aquinas sense. Instead, God freely “esteeming” the works which he himself produces in us, recognizes and rewards them in the order of adoption and fatherly favor, not in the order of strict justice. An examiner may press: but does this not collapse all reward into a kind of gracious fiction, undermining the genuine seriousness of works? Calvin’s answer is that God’s rewards are real within the economy of grace, yet never detach from Christ’s mediation. Our works, being polluted by sin, could only incur judgment if weighed in themselves; but in Christ they are “covered” and thus made acceptable. This idea that God accepts our works “in Christ” is a key Reformed anchor: it preserves both the imperfection of sanctification and the reality of divine commendation. It also undergirds the Westminster Confession’s teaching that God, “looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.” The language is deliberately anti‑meritorious, yet robustly “reward” affirming.

The transition from Calvin to Reformed orthodox **federal theology** intensifies the contrast between merit and grace by structuring redemptive history in terms of the **covenant of works** and the covenant of grace. Francis Turretin in his Institutes of Elenctic Theology is decisive here. He explicitly locates all true human merit, in the strict justice sense, within the original covenant of works and its fulfillment by Christ as second Adam. Turretin defines merit as a work that obligates the reward in justice on the ground of due proportion. He denies that Adam’s original obedience would have merited God in an absolute sense, since the Creator can never be indebted to the creature, but argues that by God’s free condescension in the covenant of works he promised life upon obedience, so that relative to this covenantal arrangement there could be a kind of pactum merit. This “covenantal merit,” however, is still real merit within the covenantal terms. Turretin then insists that Christ, as the federal head, fulfills this covenant of works on behalf of the elect, rendering perfect obedience and suffering the curse, so that his obedience is strictly meritorious and the only ground of our title to eternal life.

On that basis, Turretin resolutely denies any merit of good works in the covenant of grace. For the justified believer, good works are necessary as the way to the possession of salvation and as conditions for certain blessings, but they cannot be considered meritorious, whether condign or congruous. Any “promise of reward” attached to them is grounded solely in the gracious ordination of God, who has already, for Christ’s sake, secured the inheritance. Works are thus the appointed path, not the price. Turretin addresses the Roman Catholic objection that this reduces the biblical talk of crowns and rewards to empty rhetoric. He responds that the Reformed do not deny reward but deny the ground of reward in creaturely merit. The reward is both real and gracious, rooted in the merit of Christ and distributed according to the measure of obedience he himself works in us. This federal structuring is critical to handle examiner challenges about how the Reformed can talk of conditions, obedience, and reward without compromising sola fide: by locating merit exclusively in Christ’s fulfillment of the covenant of works and treating the covenant of grace as the application, not the renegotiation, of that merit.

John Owen, representing high Reformed orthodoxy and Puritan precision, develops another crucial dimension: the relation of faith, works, and final judgment within the covenant of grace. In works like The Doctrine of Justification by Faith and his exposition of Hebrews, Owen relentlessly rejects any formulation that makes our evangelical obedience co-instrumental in justification. Faith alone receives Christ and his righteousness. Yet Owen also insists that the covenant of grace has its own conditions, not in the same sense as the covenant of works, but as the divinely appointed means and evidences by which believers persevere to the end. It is here that Owen anticipates later debates about so‑called “final justification according to works.” Owen is willing to say that works are the “secondary” causes with respect to the possession of salvation, but he sharply distinguishes between the right to life, grounded solely in Christ’s righteousness imputed and received by faith, and the way of life, in which obedience functions as the necessary path appointed by God. In Owen’s terms, works are necessary ad esse, for the being of salvation as it is actually enjoyed, but not ad titulum, for the title to that salvation. This distinction deflects the examiner’s charge that if works are in any sense conditions, then justification is no longer by faith alone. The answer is that there is a difference between the condition of receiving a right to life and the conditions under which that life is actually possessed and experienced. Faith alone is the instrument for the former; faith working through love is the sphere of the latter.

These decisive figures together shape the internal Reformed debates on good works in the covenant of grace. Within the tradition, tension has emerged around how strongly to state the necessity of works and whether to call them “conditions” of salvation. Some, wary of Neonomianism, emphasize that the covenant of grace is unconditional in its establishment and efficacy, fearing that any conditional language reintroduces a works principle. Others, following Westminster and the Puritans, are comfortable affirming that repentance, obedience, and perseverance are “conditions” in the sense of necessary concomitants and appointed means, while denying any causal role in justification. Examiners will likely probe whether one can say “salvation is conditioned upon obedience” without denying sola gratia. The appropriate answer is to clarify the layered structure: the decree and gift of salvation are unconditional in God’s purpose and Christ’s merit; the execution of that salvation in time is mediated through faith and produces an order in which only those who obey inherit the kingdom. There is thus an asymmetrical but real conditionality of the covenant’s enjoyment, not of its meritorious ground.

Externally, the primary contrast is with Roman Catholicism and varieties of Neonomianism. Rome, especially after Trent, affirms that justifying grace is infused, that the justified truly become inherently righteous, and that this righteousness, informed by charity, is in itself meritorious of eternal life. On that basis, final justification in Catholic theology considers not only Christ’s merits but also the believer’s inherent righteousness as a ground of God’s favorable verdict. The Reformed response, shaped by Calvin, Turretin, and Owen, is that this confuses the distinct yet inseparable benefits of union with Christ: it collapses justification and sanctification. It also underestimates the remaining sin in believers and violates the **divine holiness** that cannot accept any imperfect work as the ground of an eternal, indefectible favor. Against Neonomian tendencies, whether in seventeenth‑century controversies or in contemporary proposals of a “new law” of milder obedience instead of perfect obedience, the Reformed insistence on the strictness of the law and the totality of Christ’s fulfillment under the covenant of works guards the gratuity of the covenant of grace. If the covenant of grace is merely a relaxed law with lower standards, then Christ’s obedience is no longer the uniquely meritorious ground of life; instead, our compliance with that milder law plays a co‑grounding role. This is precisely what must be denied.

Contemporary debates repackage these issues under new terms. On one side, certain versions of so‑called Free Grace theology treat any insistence on necessary obedience or works as conditions for inheriting the kingdom as a betrayal of the gospel. On the other, some New Perspective and Federal Vision proposals suggest a form of “final justification” on the basis of Spirit-wrought works. A Westminster candidate must hold the line that good works are necessary as the evidential and way‑conditions for the eschatological verdict of acquittal, but not as its ground. When Scripture says that God will judge according to works, the Reformed can say that at the last day God will publicly vindicate his people by displaying the reality of their union with Christ in their transformed lives. Works function as evidences and criteria of judgment, but not as the meritorious basis. The verdict of that day, in its justifying aspect, will still be grounded in Christ’s obedience alone, already imputed and received by faith. Thus the so‑called “final justification according to works” cannot mean a second justification with a different ground, but rather the public manifestation of the first justification and of sanctification.

Another contemporary fault line is over “Lordship salvation” versus “easy believism.” Here the covenant of grace doctrine is directly relevant. The Reformed tradition, with Owen, holds that the Christ offered in the gospel is a whole Christ, both priest and king. Therefore, faith that truly receives Christ necessarily receives him as Lord. This implies that obedience is not an optional add‑on to justification but the inevitable fruit of union with Christ and thus part of the very logic of the covenant of grace. To say that obedience is optional after justification is to sever sanctification from justification and to posit a covenant of grace that does not actually bring people into fellowship with God. At the same time, the Reformed must resist formulations that make the degree or quality of one’s obedience a ground for assurance in a way that eclipses the objectivity of Christ’s righteousness. Examiner questions here will aim to test whether the candidate can affirm both the necessity of obedience as evidence and the sufficiency of Christ as the ground of assurance.

The doctrine of good works and merit in the covenant of grace also intersects with other loci. With respect to the **attributes of God**, especially **divine aseity** and **immutability**, the denial of human merit is an implication of God’s freedom and self-sufficiency. As Turretin insists, God can never be a debtor to the creature in an absolute sense; any talk of debt must be covenantal and freely instituted. With respect to **union with Christ**, the acceptance of our good works flows from the same union that grounds justification. Our works are pleasing only as they are the operations of Christ’s Spirit in us. With respect to **ecclesiology**, the church’s discipline and exhortations must communicate the necessity of obedience without turning the covenant of grace into a wage contract. Pastoral calls to holiness must be framed as calls to live out the identity already secured in Christ, not to secure a precarious standing before God.

In defending the position, a key conceptual anchor is the threefold distinction between the meritorious ground of life, the instrument of receiving life, and the way of walking in life. Christ’s obedience under the covenant of works is the sole meritorious ground. Faith alone, as the empty hand, is the instrument for receiving that righteousness and being justified. Good works, as Spirit-wrought fruits of faith, constitute the way and evidence of life. They are not extrinsic add-ons but integral to the covenant of grace as its teleological goal, since God predestined us to be conformed to the image of his Son. Yet they are never retrojected into the ground of our acceptance. Thus the Reformed can say that in the covenant of grace God promises life freely for Christ’s sake, and also promises to reward obedience, preserving both gratuitousness and moral seriousness.

When examiners press whether good works are “necessary for salvation,” the answer must be carefully layered. If “necessary” is taken as meritorious or co-instrumental for justification, then no. If “necessary” is taken as God’s ordained path and the inevitable fruit of union with Christ, then yes. The same care is needed with “condition.” If “condition” means something on whose basis God decides whether to justify us at all, then good works are not conditions. If “condition” means a sine qua non for entering the consummate state, evidence that one truly belongs to Christ, then Scripture itself speaks in such terms: without holiness no one will see the Lord. The covenant of grace, therefore, is unconditional in its establishment and Christ’s obedience, but conditionally enjoyed through faith and evidenced in obedience. That structure, already adumbrated in Augustine, refined in Aquinas but then radically recast in Calvin, concentrated in Turretin’s federal schema, and pastorally tightened in Owen, defines the classic Reformed rejection of merit and affirmation of good works.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: In the **covenant of grace**, good works are Spirit‑wrought fruits of faith that are necessary as the God‑ordained way and evidence of salvation and are truly rewarded, but possess no **merit** before God, since Christ alone, as second Adam under the **covenant of works**, provides the meritorious ground of eternal life.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: Anti‑Pelagian, “God crowns his own gifts,” reward grounded in grace, not autonomous merit.
  - Thomas Aquinas: Distinguishes **merit de condigno** and **de congruo**, affirms true condign merit of eternal life for the justified on the basis of infused charity.
  - John Calvin: Forensic justification by imputed righteousness, rejects merit of works, affirms real yet gracious rewards, our works accepted only “in Christ.”
  - Francis Turretin: Federal structuring of **covenant of works** and covenant of grace, locates all true merit in Adam and Christ, denies any merit of works in covenant of grace, clarifies pactum merit.
  - John Owen: Sharp distinction between right to life and way of life, faith alone as instrument of justification, works as necessary conditions of covenant enjoyment, not of title.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Whether to speak of “conditions” in the covenant of grace; strength of necessity of works; handling “judgment according to works” and “future justification.”
  - External: Roman Catholic condign merit of the justified and final justification partly on inherent righteousness; Neonomian “new law” models making obedience co‑ground; antinomian denial of necessary works.
  - Contemporary: Free Grace vs Lordship salvation; New Perspective and Federal Vision claims of final justification by works; assurance and the role of obedience.
- Defended position: All strict merit before God is exhausted in Christ’s obedience under the **covenant of works**; in the covenant of grace, good works are necessary evidences and way‑conditions for salvation and are truly rewarded, yet in no sense form a meritorious or co‑instrumental ground of justification or eternal life.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Can the regenerate “merit” anything from God?  
    No; all reward is gracious, grounded in Christ’s merit, and God “crowns his own gifts” in us.
  - Are good works “necessary for salvation”?  
    Yes, as necessary fruits and the ordained way of life for the justified, but not as meritorious or co‑instrumental causes of justification.
  - How is “judgment according to works” compatible with sola fide?  
    Works function as evidences and criteria of judgment, not as the ground; the justifying verdict rests solely on Christ’s righteousness received by faith.
  - How does the covenant of works safeguard the gratuity of the covenant of grace?  
    By locating strict merit in Adam and Christ and keeping the covenant of grace as application of Christ’s merit, not a new works principle.
  - Can we speak of “conditions” in the covenant of grace without becoming Neonomian?  
    Yes, if “conditions” refers to God‑ordained means and sine qua nons for covenant enjoyment, not to meritorious grounds; the title to life remains in Christ alone.
