# Andrew Fuller (1754–1815)

Andrew Fuller, a leading Baptist theologian, emphasized that **good works** are the necessary fruit of **saving faith** within the **covenant of grace**, but he firmly rejected any notion of **human merit** as the basis for acceptance with God. For Fuller, the obedience of believers is enabled by **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**, and is always subordinate to the sufficiency of **Christ’s atonement**.

- "Good works are the evidence of faith, not the ground of our acceptance with God." ("The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation")

## Key Works

- "The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation"
- "The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems Compared as to Their Moral Tendency"
- "Strictures on Sandemanianism"
- "Letters on the Gospel and Its Evidences"
- "The Works of Andrew Fuller" (Collected Edition)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Good works as evidence, not ground, of justification**
    - Good works are the necessary result of genuine faith, not its cause.
    - Justification is by **faith alone** in Christ, apart from any human merit.
    - Works serve as the public demonstration of the reality of faith.
    - Assurance is strengthened by the presence of good works, but not founded upon them.
    - "We are justified by faith, and not by works; yet faith which justifies is always productive of good works." ("The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation")

2. **Rejection of human merit in the covenant of grace**
    - No act of obedience can earn favor or acceptance before God.
    - All human righteousness is insufficient due to the pervasive effects of sin.
    - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are the sole basis for acceptance in the covenant of grace.
    - Believers’ works are accepted only as they are united to Christ.
    - "There is no merit in our best obedience; it is only through Christ that it is accepted." ("Strictures on Sandemanianism")

3. **Necessity of good works for sanctification**
    - Good works are essential as the fruit of regeneration and sanctification.
    - The indwelling Holy Spirit enables and motivates obedience.
    - Sanctification is progressive and inseparable from true faith.
    - The law remains a rule of life for believers, though not a means of justification.
    - "Sanctification is the inseparable attendant of justification, and the evidence of its reality." ("The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems Compared")

4. **Union with Christ as the foundation for acceptable works**
    - All spiritual blessings, including the ability to do good works, flow from union with Christ.
    - Believers are accepted in the Beloved, and their works are accepted for His sake.
    - The Spirit’s work in believers is grounded in their relationship to Christ.
    - Good works are the fruit of abiding in Christ, not independent achievements.
    - "All our services are accepted only as they are performed in union with Christ." ("The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation")

5. **Evangelical obedience and the moral law**
    - The moral law continues to guide Christian conduct within the covenant of grace.
    - Evangelical obedience arises from gratitude and love, not legal obligation.
    - The gospel calls believers to holiness as a response to grace, not as a means to earn it.
    - True obedience is marked by sincerity and dependence on divine grace.
    - "The gospel, while it excludes the hope of acceptance by the law, secures obedience to it as a rule of life." ("The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation")

## Legacy and Impact

Fuller’s robust articulation of **justification by faith alone** and his clear distinction between **good works** and **merit** shaped the soteriology of later evangelical and Baptist theology. His writings helped clarify the relationship between faith, works, and assurance for generations of pastors and theologians. By rooting obedience in union with Christ and the work of the Spirit, Fuller provided a framework that preserved both the necessity of holiness and the sufficiency of grace. His influence endures in discussions of the **covenant of grace** and the role of works in the Christian life.
