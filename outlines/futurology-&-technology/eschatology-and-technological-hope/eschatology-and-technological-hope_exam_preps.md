### TITLE
Between Resurrection and Singularity: Christian Eschatology Confronts Technological Hope

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how Christian **eschatology** can affirm, resist, or reconfigure modern **technological hope** without surrendering the primacy of the resurrection, the kingdom, and the Creator–creature distinction.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Jürgen Moltmann, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Jacques Ellul, and Oliver O’Donovan.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and Augustinian **eschatology**, modern Protestant theology of hope, Roman Catholic engagement with progress and science, and late modern philosophy of technology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Augustinian versus modern historicist and immanentizing eschatologies; differing Christian assessments of technology as cultural mandate or demonic power.
  - External: Secular progressivism, transhumanism, and technocratic politics as rival eschatologies.
  - Contemporary: AI, bioenhancement, digital immortality, and political-technological projects as stress tests of Christian hope.
- Defended position: Christian **eschatological hope** is irreducibly transcendent, Christocentric, and resurrectional, and therefore can affirm limited technological goods under the **cultural mandate**, while rejecting all technological eschatologies that promise salvation, perfection, or ultimate destiny apart from the risen Christ and the new creation.

### ESSAY
Eschatology and technological hope meet at the deepest level of human desire: the longing that history be going somewhere good and that our vulnerability to death, decay, and injustice might finally be overcome. The contemporary problem is not merely that technology gives us new tools, but that it supplies an alternative story of ultimate fulfillment. In this story, history culminates not in the return of Christ and the resurrection of the body but in a posthuman future, a singularity, or a perfected technocratic order. A Westminster candidate must be able to show that Christian **eschatological hope** is not a primitive version of technological optimism but a different thing in kind: grounded in the once-for-all resurrection of Christ, ordered to the beatific vision, and structured by the Creator–creature distinction. At the same time, one must avoid a romantic anti-technological stance that fails to honor the **cultural mandate** and the goodness of created means. The challenge is to articulate a theology that can discern between technology as creaturely gift and technology as idolatrous eschatology.

Augustine is the first decisive figure, because he offers a paradigmatic account of hope, history, and the two loves that shape the two cities. In The City of God, written in response to Rome’s fall, Augustine rejects both cyclical pagan histories and naive progressivism. History is linear, ordered by divine providence, and oriented to a definitive telos in the heavenly city, but its consummation is not achievable by human culture or politics. For Augustine, the core of Christian **eschatological hope** is the resurrection of the body, the vision of God, and participation in the eternal sabbath rest. He insists that even the most refined earthly goods cannot satisfy the human heart which is restless until it rests in God. In this light, technological projects, had he known them, would belong to the earthly city: good insofar as they are ordered to temporal peace and justice, but always ambiguous because they can become instruments of domination shaped by disordered love.

An examiner might press: Does Augustinian pessimism toward the earthly city entail a quietistic rejection of technological development? The answer requires appealing to Augustine’s doctrine of creation and providence. He affirms that God is the creator of all natures, including rational capacities and artisan skills. Temporal peace, maintained by law, culture, and what we might analogously call technology, is a genuine good that the pilgrim people of God may use. Yet Augustine is unyielding that such peace is penultimate and fragile; it cannot be conflated with the peace of the heavenly city. In contemporary terms, Augustinian **eschatological restraint** forbids us to invest technological projects with salvific significance. Technology belongs to the order of means, not ends. It can alleviate certain miseries of the saeculum but cannot remove original sin, reconcile us to God, or bestow incorruptibility.

The contrast between Christian and technological hope becomes sharper when we turn to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit paleontologist whose synthesis of evolution and theology has deeply influenced religious forms of techno-optimism. Teilhard reframes eschatology as the culmination of a cosmic evolutionary process of increasing complexity and consciousness. Matter itself is oriented toward spirit; the universe, he argues in works like The Phenomenon of Man, is moving from the geosphere to the biosphere and finally to the noosphere, a global consciousness that will be unified at the Omega Point. He explicitly identifies this Omega with Christ, giving his scheme a christological gloss. However, the logic of his thought strongly encourages Christian accommodation to technoscientific progress, because human technical and socio-political organization are treated as the principal means by which the noosphere advances toward Omega.

Many Christian technophiles and some Roman Catholic thinkers sympathetic to progress have mined Teilhard’s work to provide a theological warrant for seeing the internet, AI, and global networks as steps toward a higher collective intelligence. In this vision, technological development is not merely instrumentally good but carries quasi-sacramental significance in the onward march of creation to its telos. Theologically, however, Teilhard’s project is fraught. He tends to collapse the transcendence of the eschaton into the immanent process of history, rendering the final state a predictable extrapolation of present tendencies rather than a new creation by divine act. This blurs the Creator–creature distinction and downplays the catastrophic character of sin and judgment. The Omega Point ends up as the final phase of evolution, not the apocalyptic advent of the risen Christ who comes to judge the living and the dead.

Under examination, a candidate must be able to explain why this is not a trivial modification but a fundamental displacement of Christian hope. The biblical pattern of **eschatological discontinuity within continuity** is replaced by a scheme of upward continuity. Moreover, Teilhard’s confidence in an inevitably converging noosphere cannot easily account for the depth of evil and the scriptural expectancy of apostasy and antichrist. His scheme tends toward what Augustine would regard as the earthly city’s self-apotheosis. In contemporary terms, Teilhard-style thinking makes it too easy to baptize transhumanism or techno-globalism as if they inherently further the kingdom of God, rather than assessing them under the cross.

Jürgen Moltmann, our second detailed figure, offers a different kind of reconfiguration with his theology of hope. Writing in the aftermath of the Second World War and shaped by Marxist critiques of religion, Moltmann sought to liberate Christian **eschatology** from otherworldly quietism and make it the engine of transformative praxis. In Theology of Hope and later works, he argues that God’s promises of a future kingdom summon the church to political engagement and anticipatory signs of liberation in history. The future of God breaks into the present, calling existing structures into question. Hope, for Moltmann, is not resignation before an already fixed fate but active participation in God’s coming future.

Moltmann is crucial for the modern discussion of technology because he relocates hope from a static “end of the world” to an open, future-oriented horizon in history. This easily resonates with secular ideas of progress and with the ethos of innovation: history is open, the future can be shaped, and Christians are called to cooperate with the Spirit’s renewing work. Some liberationist and political theologies, influenced by Moltmann, have therefore interpreted technological development, when aligned with justice, as a means to anticipate the coming kingdom: medical advances that heal, ecological technologies that protect creation, digital networks that democratize power.

However, Moltmann also introduces a risk of **eschatological immanentism**. In stressing God’s future as a dynamic reality unfolding in history, his early work at times makes the final consummation feel like the horizon of historical process rather than its radical termination and transformation. Examiners will probe whether a Moltmannian framework can maintain robust doctrines of the last judgment, bodily resurrection, and the new heavens and earth as divine acts discontinuous with creaturely progress. If Christian hope is reinterpreted as an open project of liberation, technological progress can subtly become sanctified as the primary site of eschatological realization. Here, the line between a theology that motivates ethical engagement and one that sacralizes technocratic activism is thin.

In response, one can appropriate Moltmann’s insistence that Christian hope is future-oriented, public, and critical of oppressive structures, while insisting on three Augustinian–Reformed correctives. First, the future of God is not a vague openness but is normatively defined by the resurrected and ascended Christ. Second, the consummation of the kingdom is not the outcome of human development but the result of Christ’s parousia, resurrection, and judgment. Third, the Spirit’s work in history is to conform people to Christ and gather the church, not to underwrite any particular technological trajectory. With these correctives, technological projects can be evaluated as provisional instruments of neighbor love subject to moral norms, not as bearers of eschatological necessity.

Against both Teilhardian optimism and secular technocratic faith, Jacques Ellul stands as perhaps the most uncompromising Christian critic of modern technology. In The Technological Society and The Technological System, Ellul argues that modern technics has become an autonomous, self-augmenting system governed by the criterion of efficiency and indifferent to substantive human ends. Technique, in his sense, is not just machines but the totality of rationalized methods that pervade economics, politics, and even the church. Ellul contends that this system exerts a quasi-demonic power, shaping human perception and enslaving societies while claiming neutrality.

Ellul’s eschatological outlook is deeply shaped by Barth and a Reformed sense of the radical inbreaking of God’s kingdom. He insists that the kingdom is in but not of this world and that technological systems, no matter how improved, cannot be vehicles of ultimate reconciliation. His analysis anticipates contemporary worries about algorithmic governance, surveillance capitalism, and AI systems that reconfigure social life. From an Ellulian standpoint, modern technological hope is a counterfeit eschatology, promising control and security but delivering new forms of bondage. The gospel offers a different hope: freedom in Christ, the gift of the Spirit, and a kingdom that relativizes all structures.

Examiner pushback will target Ellul’s apparent pessimism: Does his view negate the creational goodness of human making and the **cultural mandate** of Genesis 1 and 2? Here one must distinguish between technology as such and the modern technological system as Ellul describes it. While Ellul sometimes blurs this distinction, a more nuanced reading allows us to affirm his prophetic critique of a totalizing system while preserving a doctrine of created means. Christian theology must insist that human art, craft, and medicine, under the lordship of Christ, can be genuine participations in God’s providential care, even as they are vulnerable to idolatrous capture by the powers. Ellul’s merit is to expose how technological hope, when absolutized, functions as a rival liturgy and catechesis, forming expectations about history’s end that displace the resurrection and judgment.

Oliver O’Donovan introduces a different angle by treating **eschatology** as the key to Christian ethics and political judgment. In Resurrection and Moral Order and Desire of the Nations, O’Donovan argues that the resurrection of Christ is the central interpretive event for understanding both creation and history. The resurrection is not merely a promise of individual afterlife but the vindication of God’s rule over the world, the inauguration of the kingdom, and the pledge of a renewed creation. Because the resurrection is already an eschatological act within history, Christians are called to discern the proper place of temporal institutions and actions in light of that definitive future.

In this framework, technological development must be assessed according to its fittingness with the created order as reaffirmed in the resurrection and its orientation to neighbor love. There is no independent eschatology of technology: all projects are relativized by the risen Lord who alone is the firstfruits of the new creation. O’Donovan is wary of both revolutionary utopianism and conservative nostalgia. Political and technological endeavors are neither vehicles of the kingdom nor sacrosanct achievements; they are to be judged and sometimes used, sometimes resisted, under the authority of the ascended Christ. His thought thus guards against both the sacralization of technological progress and the romantic rejection of modern tools.

Within the Christian tradition, the internal debates over **eschatology and technology** can be mapped roughly along three axes. First, there is a dispute about the status of history and culture in God’s final purposes. Augustinian and some Reformed voices stress the radical discontinuity of the heavenly city from earthly structures, making it difficult to speak of any lasting cultural contributions beyond judgment. Others, influenced by neo-Calvinism and some readings of Revelation 21, argue that the glory of the nations will be brought into the new Jerusalem and that redeemed cultural labors may have eschatological significance. This debate bears directly on whether technological artifacts or capacities might in some sense be transfigured rather than simply annihilated.

A robust position will affirm that the new creation is not a brand new ex nihilo entity but a transformation of this creation, which suggests some continuity of creaturely forms. Yet the criterion of continuity is not intrinsic human achievement but God’s sovereign judgment. We are not authorized to identify specific technologies as guaranteed eschatological contributions. Rather, technological work is to be undertaken as obedient stewardship, trusting that God will preserve what accords with his kingdom and burn away what is idolatrous.

Second, there is an internal debate about the scope of the **cultural mandate** after the fall and under redemption. Some construe Genesis 1 as imposing a standing obligation to maximize control over nature, which can then be read as a theological license for unbounded innovation. Others, following an Augustinian–Reformed line, interpret the mandate in light of sin, curse, and the cross, stressing humility, limits, and Sabbath. The latter view is to be preferred, particularly when considering powerful technologies like AI, gene editing, or geoengineering. These tools can be gifts when ordered to neighbor love and moderated by moral law, but they are also sites where hubris is most pronounced. Eschatological hope imposes limits: because the kingdom comes by Christ’s return, not by human mastery, we are freed from the compulsion to use every possible technology to secure our future.

Third, within Christian circles influenced by Moltmann or liberation theologies, there are debates about the place of technology in anticipatory signs of the kingdom. Should Christians see, for instance, universal access to healthcare technologies as a foretaste of the eschatological healing of the nations, or is that a category mistake? A careful answer is that acts of healing, justice, and mercy, sometimes mediated by technology, can indeed function as signs that correspond analogically to the coming kingdom. Yet they remain signs only, not installments of the eschaton. The failure to maintain this distinction leads to theologized technocracy, where policy programs and innovation agendas are granted spiritual ultimacy.

Externally, Christian eschatology confronts secular progressivism, transhumanism, and technocratic politics as rival eschatologies. Secular progressivism narrates history as the gradual triumph of reason, democracy, and scientific control over nature. It often retains a linear, quasi-eschatological shape borrowed from Christian history but deletes divine transcendence and judgment. Suffering is to be overcome by technical and institutional reforms. Transhumanism radicalizes this by explicitly promising the overcoming of biological limitations through enhancement, brain–machine interfaces, and perhaps digital mind uploading, offering a form of technological immortality. Technocratic politics, in turn, treats expert-managed systems as the primary means of securing human flourishing, marginalizing moral and spiritual concerns.

Christian theology must expose these as **parodies of hope**. They offer the form of eschatology without its substance: futurity without resurrection, progress without repentance, transformation without judgment. For example, digital immortality projects promise continuity of information patterns but cannot raise the dead body or reconcile the person to God. AI-based governance may optimize certain outcomes but cannot produce justice in the biblical sense that vindicates the oppressed under the rule of the righteous king. A Westminster candidate should be prepared to say that any narrative that offers total security, moral perfection, or ultimate meaning through technological power is, structurally, a form of idolatry and bears the marks of what Scripture calls the beastly kingdoms.

Contemporary issues such as AI, bioenhancement, and digital culture test whether we really believe in the sufficiency and uniqueness of Christian hope. Some theologians, perhaps influenced by Teilhard or by an uncritical accommodation to culture, speak enthusiastically of AI as a partner in the imago Dei or of gene editing as the next step in human evolution. Others, echoing Ellul, speak as though any advanced technology is inherently demonic. Both extremes are unsatisfying. A better account will say that technology is a created power that participates in the **ambivalence of fallen creation**. It can be ordered to the love of God and neighbor or can be annexed by the powers for domination. Christian **eschatology** supplies a critical criterion: Does this technological practice encourage trust in Christ and the coming kingdom, or does it invite us to repose ultimate hope in technique?

From this standpoint, we can frame a defended position. Christian eschatological hope is non-negotiably tied to the incarnate, crucified, and risen Christ, who by his resurrection is the firstfruits of the new creation and by his parousia will consummate the kingdom. This hope is covenantal and corporate, oriented to the resurrection of the body, the liberation of creation from bondage, and the beatific vision of the triune God. It is grounded in **divine sovereignty** and **providence**, not in the contingencies of human innovation. Therefore, no technological development can function as an eschatological guarantee or necessary step toward the kingdom. At the same time, precisely because the future is secured by God, Christians are free to employ technological means as provisional instruments of love, under clear moral norms, without needing them to bear the weight of ultimate expectation.

Examiners will likely challenge this position at crucial junctures. First, they may ask whether this makes technology irrelevant to eschatology. The response is that technology is eschatologically relativized, not irrelevant. Its significance lies in how it forms persons and communities in the present pilgrim state, either habituating them toward or away from the love that will be perfected in the kingdom. Second, they may press whether this stance is practically distinct from secular risk management. The answer is that Christian prudence is shaped by worship: we discern technological uses within the liturgical recognition that Christ is Lord, that history is under judgment, and that our citizenship is in heaven. The fundamental question is not efficiency but faithfulness.

Finally, one must guard against a disembodied spiritualization of hope that would underwrite irresponsibility. Because resurrection is bodily and the new creation includes renewed earth, Christian **eschatology** intensifies, rather than diminishes, concern for material life. That entails resisting technologies that degrade creation or instrumentalize bodies, even if they promise extended life, and supporting technologies that genuinely serve the weak, embody mercy, and respect creaturely limits. The criterion, however, is not whether a technology appears cutting-edge or regressive, but whether it accords with the pattern of the crucified and risen Lord who will return to judge and renew all things. In this way, Augustine’s two cities, Teilhard’s mistaken evolutionary Omega, Moltmann’s politicized future, Ellul’s critique of technique, and O’Donovan’s resurrection-centered ethics converge as interlocutors in a single question: where is our hope, and what story of the end silently governs our technological imagination?

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Christian **eschatology** is the doctrine of God’s final acts in Christ by which he raises the dead, judges the world, and brings a new creation, and **technological hope** is any expectation that human technics can secure salvation, perfection, or ultimate destiny.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: two cities, resurrectional and transcendent hope, strong critique of immanentized futures.
  - Teilhard de Chardin: evolutionary Omega Point, theology of progress that tends to sacralize technoscience.
  - Jürgen Moltmann: theology of hope, future-oriented praxis, risk of eschatological immanentism.
  - Jacques Ellul: critique of the autonomous technological system, technology as rival eschatology under the powers.
  - Oliver O’Donovan: resurrection-centered moral and political theology, technology judged under Christ’s rule.
- Debates:
  - Internal: continuity of culture into new creation; scope of the **cultural mandate**; whether technology can be anticipatory sign of the kingdom without becoming its vehicle.
  - External: secular progressivism, transhumanism, and technocracy as alternative eschatologies that mimic Christian forms without resurrection or judgment.
  - Contemporary: AI, bioenhancement, digital immortality, and global systems as tests of whether Christians entrust the future to Christ or to technique.
- Defended position: Christian **eschatological hope** is exclusively grounded in the risen and returning Christ and the promised new creation; technology is a limited, morally governed means for present stewardship and neighbor love, never a carrier of ultimate salvation or the kingdom’s arrival.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Can any technology be part of the new creation? Only what God, in sovereign judgment, chooses to transfigure; we cannot identify concrete artifacts as eschatologically guaranteed.
  - Does this position undermine cultural and scientific work? No, it frees such work from salvific pretensions and situates it as obedient stewardship under Christ.
  - How is transhumanist immortality different from resurrection? It prolongs or simulates life within death’s regime, without bodily resurrection, judgment, or reconciliation to God.
  - Is Ellul’s critique compatible with the cultural mandate? Yes, if we distinguish technology as such from the totalizing modern technological system he attacks.
  - How does the resurrection shape our view of progress? It sets a definitive, already-given future in Christ that relativizes historical progress and resists both despair and utopianism.
