### TITLE
Pilgrim Hope and the Machine: Testing Christian Eschatology against Technological Futures

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether modern technological progress furnishes a credible or idolatrous substitute for Christian hope, and how a rigorous eschatology orders penultimate projects without collapsing the **eschatological consummation** into history.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Francis Bacon, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Jacques Ellul, Jürgen Moltmann, Nick Bostrom.
- Traditions engaged: Augustinian eschatology, early modern Baconian science, twentieth-century theology of hope, Catholic evolutionary teleology, Reformed and neo-Calvinist approaches to **cultural mandate**, philosophy of technology.
- Debates: internal Christian disputes on **already and not yet**, amillennial versus postmillennial expectations, two-kingdoms and **common grace**; external contests with Enlightenment progressivism and transhumanism; contemporary tests from AI, biotech enhancement, digital mediation, and planetary risk.
- Position: Christian hope is anchored in the risen Christ and the **resurrection of the body**; technology is a real but penultimate good under **providence** and **created teleology**, to be stewarded with eschatological reserve, resisting any sacralization of progress or immanentization of the eschaton.

### ESSAY
Eschatology and technological hope meet at the fault line where the ends of humanity are decided. By eschatology I mean the doctrine of last things as the formal horizon of Christian theology, the promised future of God that retroactively orders creation, redemption, church, and vocation. By technological hope I mean the modern confidence that cumulative technique can resolve fundamental human limits, secure history against catastrophe, and deliver forms of salvation once entrusted to God. The question is not whether Christians may use technology. They must, because human making is part of **created teleology** and the **imago Dei** exercised in wise dominion. The question is rather whether technological mastery can bear the weight of ultimate expectation, and how classical Christian hope disciplines, limits, and redirects modern projects. My thesis is that the Christian can affirm technology as a penultimate instrument under **providence** and **common grace**, while rejecting its elevation to soteriological status. The church must cultivate what Jacques Ellul called eschatological reserve, neither baptizing the machine nor retreating into romantic Luddism, but bearing witness to the **eschatological consummation** in the midst of ongoing technical change.

The long arc of this problem is Augustinian. In The City of God Augustine interprets history as the intermingling of two cities constituted by two loves: the love of God to the contempt of self and the love of self to the contempt of God. His vision is not a flight from earthly affairs but a disciplined accounting of temporal goods as penultimate. Augustine’s saeculum is the time of patience between Christ’s first and second advents; it is precisely in this interim that political order, craft, and culture operate under God’s **providence**, distributing relative peace that serves the pilgrim city. He neither demonizes nor divinizes human arts. Shipbuilding aids missionary travel; agriculture feeds saints and neighbors. Yet he denies that any accumulation of technique or imperial achievement can secure the pax that only God finally grants. His polemic against Rome’s civil theologies rules out the transposition of divine promises into civic or technical projects. The defining features of Christian hope for Augustine are the **resurrection of the body**, the **beatific vision**, and the judgment that discloses the true use of all temporal means. This eschatology installs a grammar of the penultimate: use without idolatry, gratitude without enthrallment, patience without despair. It also protects **divine simplicity** by refusing to imagine God as a factor within a technological causal chain. God is not one competitive agent among others but the simple, triune end toward whom all ordered loves move. This grammar is decisive for any Christian valuation of technological hope. If an examiner presses whether Augustine’s critique licenses passivity, the answer is no. For Augustine, temporal order is the field of charity and discipline. What he excludes is the translation of charity into triumphalist historicism.

A second decisive figure is Francis Bacon, who reframed the goal of knowledge in early modernity and thereby constituted the cultural semantics of technological hope. The Baconian program unites new method and new end. The Novum Organum rejects scholastic disputation in favor of experimental induction aimed at works. The end of knowledge is power, but not naked domination. It is the relief of man’s estate, a quasi-charitable project to undo Adamic curse by organized inquiry and organized labor. The New Atlantis presents a sanctified technocracy, Salomon’s House, in which natural philosophy is institutionally coordinated for public benefit. Bacon’s theological rhetoric is strategic and sincere; he often casts his enterprise as the restoration of Adamic dominion. Here the hinge turns. Bacon does not deny that God is the giver of good gifts. But the new horizon he opens shifts the affective center of hope from divine promise to cumulative human mastery. Baconian hope is inherently progressive, accumulative, and this-worldly. It breeds a politics of anticipation in which the next discovery is the next emancipation. One must see the spiritual genius and the danger. The genius is his refusal of sterile speculation in favor of fruitfulness that alleviates hunger and disease. The danger is the eschatological pressure placed upon technique and the way power, once emancipated from teleological and moral constraints, can become self-justifying. The Baconian merger of knowledge and power largely set the conditions for Enlightenment progressivism and the subsequent secularization of eschatology. Defending a Christian stance requires acknowledging the genuine goods Bacon’s project catalyzed while denying that such goods can carry the weight of history’s meaning. The examiner will ask whether the Genesis **cultural mandate** authorizes Bacon’s vision. The answer is that dominion is real but teleologically ordered to God and neighbor within a fallen world moderated by **common grace**. Dominion without doxology deterritorializes into domination.

Twentieth-century theology wrestled self-consciously with hope and history in the shadow of technological warfare and industrial modernity. Here Jürgen Moltmann is decisive for recalibrating Protestant dogmatics around promise and future. The Theology of Hope interprets the resurrection of Jesus as the proleptic future of God invading the present, drawing the church into transformative praxis. Moltmann rightly refuses a timeless metaphysic that quarantines eschatology at the end. He insists that promise structures the whole Christian life and that the Spirit is the power of the future in the present. This invigorates mission and ethics, and corrects a bourgeois quietism that accommodated itself to national projects of violence. Yet Moltmann’s framework is vulnerable to immanentizing tendencies, especially where political or technological projects are styled as anticipations of the kingdom rather than judged by it. When hope is redrawn as a horizon for historical possibility without sufficient apocalyptic discontinuity, eschatology can become a theodicy of progress. A rigorous defense must affirm Moltmann’s insistence that eschatology is the shape of all doctrine while maintaining the sharpness of the final act of God, the irreducible novelty of the **resurrection of the body**, and the discontinuity between the kingdom and any technopolitical order. When asked whether this makes the kingdom unrelated to present transformation, we answer that the kingdom is analogically related. The church’s works of mercy and justice are true anticipations by the Spirit’s firstfruits, but they are signs and pledges, not engines of consummation. That is the heart of **analogical knowledge** under the **already and not yet**.

If Moltmann sought to repoliticize eschatology, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin sought to re-cosmologize it. Teilhard, a Jesuit and paleontologist, narrates cosmic history as a teleological ascent from geosphere to biosphere to noosphere, culminating in the Omega Point that he names as Christ. He treated technological interconnection, communication, and collective invention as the emergence of the noosphere. Teilhard’s vision is sweeping and seductive. It gathers scientific evolution, human creativity, and the Christic telos into one grand arc. By setting Christ as Omega, he aims to preserve transcendence while celebrating immanent development. Yet this synthesis reconfigures key Christian anchors. The line between creation and redemption blurs under an ontology of becoming. The eschaton is drawn into a naturalized convergence rather than arriving as apocalyptic gift. The **resurrection of the body** looks like a metaphor for spiritualized union rather than the reconstitution of creaturely life by the Spirit’s power. The risk is panentheistic diffusal in which grace is identical with the world’s tendency toward complexity. Teilhard’s impulse to see technology as a site of God’s drawing is understandable, but his framework dislocates judgment, undercuts the gratuity of new creation, and shifts hope to a horizon we advance by our own collaboration. A Westminster defense should bring Christology to bear: the resurrected and ascended Jesus is the concrete pledge of new creation, not an abstract cosmic attractor. The church confesses an eschatological discontinuity that cannot be captured by the horizontal thickening of connectivity or consciousness.

Jacques Ellul stands as the most penetrating theological diagnostician of modern technique. Trained in law and sociology and rooted in the French Reformed tradition, Ellul’s The Technological Society names technique as the single-minded pursuit of efficiency that tends toward autonomy. His thesis is not that machines are evil but that technique, once installed as the highest criterion, organizes institutions, habits, and imagination into a total system. The illusion of neutrality is replaced with an account of formative power. In The Meaning of the City, Ellul takes an Augustinian line, reading the city as the institutionalized self-love that reaches toward Babel. Yet Ellul refuses a retreatist stance. He calls for freedom in the midst of necessity, a Spirit-given nonconformity that bears witness to another kingdom. Ellul’s biblical and sociological acuity exposes the sacramentalizing of progress in modern societies. His warning is crucial for eschatology: when efficiency becomes the supreme value, any appeal to the good, the beautiful, or the holy looks irrational and is marginalized. The church must then embrace an **apocalyptic unveiling** of technique’s false transcendence. An examiner may charge Ellul with determinism. The answer is that he is describing systemic gravities, not absolute necessities, and that his theology of the cross grounds a hopeful freedom to act differently. Ellul helps Christians articulate why they feel both gratitude for medicine and dread at surveillance capitalism or algorithmic governance. He provides conceptual tools to resist the politicized liturgies of upgrade and to discern how technologies catechize us.

A contemporary non-theological voice that must be engaged is Nick Bostrom. In Superintelligence and related essays, Bostrom frames technological development in terms of existential risk and alignment. His work exemplifies technological hope purified by prudential fear. On one hand, transhumanism holds out life extension, cognitive enhancement, and perhaps digital substrate independence as the next stage of human flourishing. On the other hand, the same trajectory threatens human extinction or subjugation by misaligned systems. Bostrom’s proposal is to increase wisdom and governance at least as fast as capability increases, and to approach the future with longtermist ethics. There are points of contact with Christian prudence. Christians also care about future generations and take seriously the unintended consequences of power. But the theological critique is twofold. First, the end imagined is the indefinite prolongation or transformation of created life under our engineering, rather than the **resurrection of the body** given by God. Second, the moral grammar is consequentialist and managerial, lacking an account of sin that penetrates to the heart. AI alignment debates still suppose a controller who can be aligned. Scripture knows that the controller is us, and that our desires must be reordered by grace. Bostrom is more chastened than earlier utopians, but the hope remains immanent and technocratic. A Christian can learn the language of risk and adopt tools of governance while refusing to concede the definition of salvation.

These figures trace the main alternatives and temptations. The internal Christian debates next. The first is between amillennial and postmillennial expectations of historical progress. A postmillennial confidence often aligns with technological optimism, treating scientific and political advances as ordinary means of kingdom expansion. The amillennial view, classically Augustinian and widely held in Reformed theology, affirms the **already and not yet** while denying a historical golden age before Christ’s return. It does not preclude meaningful progress, nor disallow the Spirit’s effects on culture, but it refuses to identify any trajectory of improvement with the kingdom itself. This is the position I defend. It guards the apocalyptic discontinuity of the parousia, secures hope from cycles of boom and crash, and keeps charitable labor from triumphalism. A second internal debate is between neo-Calvinist transformationalism and two-kingdoms or pilgrim-theology approaches. Neo-Calvinists such as Kuyper and Bavinck affirmed **common grace** and the **cultural mandate**, encouraging Christians to leaven all spheres of culture. Two-kingdoms advocates warn against confusing the church’s spiritual mission with cultural projects and insist on the pilgrim identity of the saints. The best synthesis honors Kuyper’s insistence that Christ claims every square inch and that science and art are legitimate vocations, while embracing the two-kingdoms caution that the church as church is not an agent of technocultural programs and that the sacraments, preaching, and discipline are the church’s unique means. The key is eschatological reserve: receive technological goods as gifts for neighbor love; deny that any sphere is salvific; distinguish the church’s visible marks from broader Christian vocation.

Externally, Christian eschatology contends with Enlightenment and Marxist secularizations. Enlightenment progressivism took the Baconian project and shed its theological frame, enthroning reason and technique as the engine of emancipation. Marxism replaced divine consummation with the dialectical end of class conflict, recoding eschatology as immanent revolution. These external frames teach Christians two lessons. First, they are parasitic on biblical hope, borrowing eschatological structure while rejecting the Giver. Second, they collapse judgment into process, which licenses atrocious means. The Christian reply is simple and exacting: hope is a theological virtue ordered to God as last end, and judgment belongs to Christ. No dialectical or technical process absolves our sins. With these frames in mind, one must not romanticize technophobia. Prolonged hostility to technology erodes neighbor love when technology is the proximate means to heal and feed. The criterion is not for or against technology but sub specie vitae aeternae. What fosters love, justice, and truthful worship under God’s law, toward the promised end in Christ.

Contemporary tests of this position are concrete. Artificial intelligence promises acceleration of discovery and administration, but it also produces opacity, bias, and control. The criterion for Christian use must include end, means, and formation. AI used to detect disease or model climate can serve neighbor love if governed by justice and transparency; AI deployed to manipulate attention corrodes agency and truthfulness. Enhancement biotechnologies challenge creaturely limits and the goodness of dependence. Extending healthy lifespan can be a mercy; the pursuit of immortality denies the cross and the future of the **resurrection of the body**. Digital mediation expands the church’s reach but risks disembodiment. The church must insist that the assembly around word and sacrament is not replaceable by streams or headsets, because the Lord meets us in created signs and because salvation is not an information transfer but incorporation into Christ. Climate engineering offers techno-fixes to collective sin. Christians can deploy engineering talent to mitigate harm while naming the deeper call to repentance for greed and injustice. In all these cases the question is not whether we are optimists or pessimists. It is whether we are faithful realists under **providence**, grateful for **common grace**, governed by the **already and not yet**.

A likely examiner will ask whether this position makes eschatology ethically paralyzing. On the contrary, it yields patient courage. Because hope does not depend on the curve of innovation, we are free to use and to refuse technologies according to love, without panic. We can say no to surveillance when it violates neighbor and yes to surgery when it heals. Another examiner may press whether this position collapses creation and redemption into a dualism. It does not. It affirms a robust **created teleology** and celebrates creaturely arts as good, while refusing to make them redemptive. Redemption elevates and perfects nature by grace in Christ, but the perfection is given, not engineered. A third examiner may challenge the doctrine of God. Does talk of providential governance deny contingency and make God the author of technological evils. Classical theism teaches that **divine simplicity** and sovereignty do not eliminate secondary causes. God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass while creatures truly act and are accountable. Eschatology is not a divinely programmed upgrade but the free act of the triune God to consummate history in Christ.

What then is a constructive rule of life for the church and the Christian technologist. First, order hope. Confess with the creed the **resurrection of the body** and life everlasting. Resist the affective pull of secular eschatons, whether singularity or planetary decarbonization as ultimate meaning. Work for decarbonization because love of neighbor and nonhuman creation requires it, not because salvation depends on it. Second, exercise discernment. Ask of each technology: what end does it serve, what means does it deploy, and what kind of people does it form. Resist the tyranny of efficiency when it violates sabbath, truthfulness, or presence. Third, inhabit the church’s counter-politics. Word and sacrament are the real anticipations of the end because they are the Spirit’s appointed means. The Eucharist is a sign of the feast to come; baptism is the seal of new creation. These are not anti-technological but re-technologize the imagination, locating tools under the sign of the cross. Fourth, embrace vocation. Christians in labs, platforms, and policy can practice sanctified craft, refusing deceptive designs, advocating open oversight, building for the poor, and bending invention toward the weak. Ellul’s eschatological reserve does not forsake craft; it forsakes idolatry.

Finally, return to Augustine and Bacon as the enduring poles. Augustine’s two cities account for why technique cannot instantiate the kingdom and why it can still be used in love. Bacon’s charitable motive must be purified by a thicker account of sin, teleology, and judgment, such that relief of man’s estate is located within the divine economy rather than supplanting it. Moltmann, rightly insisting that eschatology is the center of theology, must be secured against immanent drift by the risen and returning Jesus. Teilhard’s expansive cosmic Christ must be corrected by the incarnate and crucified Lord whose exaltation is not a name for evolutionary convergence but the Father’s vindication of his Son. Bostrom’s prudent warnings can instruct our governance even as his eschaton is exposed as a thin soteriology. These corrections are not primarily polemical but doxological. The end of man is God. The structure of hope is not a growth curve but a promise fulfilled. That is why Christians can be both the most grateful users of technology and the sharpest critics of technological hope. The gospel disenchants the machine by teaching us to adore the Maker, and it ennobles craft by promising that our labor in the Lord is not in vain. The **eschatological consummation** will not be the crowning of our systems but the apocalypse of Jesus Christ. Because that is true, we are free to build, to heal, to code, to steward, and also to rest, to repent, to refuse, to wait.

This posture integrates adjacent doctrinal loci. In creation, we affirm **created teleology** that grounds the intelligibility of nature and the meaningfulness of work. In anthropology, we confess the **imago Dei** as relational and vocational, warning that enhancement without virtue deforms. In Christology, we confess the historical resurrection as the pledge of our future and the criterion of all hope. In soteriology, we confess justification by grace through faith, severing any attempt to make technology the condition of the blessed life. In ecclesiology, we confess the marks of the church as the true anticipations of the end. In providence, we acknowledge God’s wise governance of all means, including technical ones, without confusing them with grace. In ethics, we train prudence to evaluate power not only by outcomes but by the goods of love, truth, and worship. The point for an oral defense is clarity: technology is not a rival metaphysic, it is a realm of tools. Hope is not a mood attached to innovation, it is a theological virtue attached to the triune God. The church neither crowns the machine nor flees it. She names its proper place and walks with cruciform patience into the future already secured by the Lord who is coming.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Eschatology orders all doctrine toward the promised end of God in Christ; technological hope is the modern wager that cumulative technique can secure ends once entrusted to God. Christian hope locates technology under **providence** and **created teleology**, not as the **eschatological consummation**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: two cities, penultimate use, **resurrection of the body**, judgment; rejects immanentized eschatons.
  - Francis Bacon: experimental method for relief of man’s estate; inaugurates progressive technological hope.
  - Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: Omega Point synthesis of evolution and Christ; naturalizes eschaton and dilutes discontinuity.
  - Jacques Ellul: autonomy of technique, efficiency as idol, call for eschatological reserve and nonconformity.
  - Jürgen Moltmann: eschatology as horizon of theology; risks immanent drift if discontinuity is weakened.
  - Nick Bostrom: transhumanism and AI alignment; prudential governance with immanent soteriology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: amillennial versus postmillennial trajectories; neo-Calvinist transformationalism and two-kingdoms; scope of **common grace** and **cultural mandate**.
  - External: Enlightenment progressivism, Marxist historicism, transhumanism as rival eschatologies.
  - Contemporary: AI, biotech enhancement, digital mediation of worship, climate techno-fixes, surveillance capitalism.
- Defended position: Augustinian-amillennial stance that welcomes technological goods as penultimate under **providence** and **common grace**, resists sacralizing progress, and anchors hope in Christ’s return and the **resurrection of the body**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does this make Christians anti-technology? No, it promotes grateful, bounded stewardship ordered by love and truth.
  - Does amillennialism stifle cultural engagement? No, it frees action from triumphalism by locating success in God’s promise.
  - Can the **cultural mandate** justify Baconian optimism? Only under teleological and moral constraints; dominion without doxology becomes domination.
  - How does classical theism relate to technique? **Divine simplicity** rules out competition with creatures; God governs through secondary causes without sacralizing them.
  - Do present works anticipate the kingdom? Yes, analogically as signs by the Spirit’s firstfruits, not as engines of consummation.
