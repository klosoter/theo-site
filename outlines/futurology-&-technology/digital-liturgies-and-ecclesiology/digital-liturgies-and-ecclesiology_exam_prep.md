### TITLE
When the Medium Becomes a Sanctuary: Digital Liturgies and the Shape of the Church

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how digital media as formative environments reconfigure liturgy and thereby redefine the **visible church**, its **means of grace**, authority, and catholicity.
- Decisive figures: Marshall McLuhan, Jacques Ellul, James K. A. Smith, John Calvin, Joseph Ratzinger, Walter Ong.
- Traditions: Reformed ecclesiology and worship, Roman Catholic liturgical theology, media ecology and philosophy of technology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed disputes on the **regulative principle**, multisite and livestream preaching, online communion, scope of the **ordinary means of grace**.
  - External: technoutopian network ecclesiologies, church-growth pragmatism, liberal voluntarist ecclesiology, platform capitalism’s logic.
  - Contemporary: pandemic-era digital church, VR sacraments, AI pastors, attention economy, surveillance and pastoral care.
- Position: Digital tools can aid catechesis and mission, but digital liturgies cannot constitute the church’s Lord’s Day assembly; the church is an embodied covenant people gathered by Word and sacrament under discipline, and platform logics deform this order unless subordinated by strict, theologically grounded limits.

### ESSAY
Digital liturgies and ecclesiology meet at a practical and conceptual pressure point: if liturgy is not merely content but a form that enacts and forms the church’s being-in-Christ, then digital mediation is not neutral. By digital liturgies I mean the patterned, repeatable, and desire-shaping practices native to or reconfigured by networked platforms. These range from the algorithmically curated morning scroll to the livestreamed Sunday service and the habit loops of alerts, likes, and chat. The question is whether such forms can bear the weight of the church’s acts as church, especially the assembly on the Lord’s Day in which the **means of grace** are administered under Christ’s ordained oversight. I will argue that digital liturgies as primary media of the church’s gathering are insufficient and deforming. They can serve as ancillary instruments of catechesis and coordination, but the church’s ontological and sacramental structure requires embodied co-presence.

Two conceptual anchors frame the answer. First, the church is a visible society with marks: the pure preaching of the Word, the right administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of discipline. This visibility is covenantal and juridical, not merely affective. It is ordered to catholicity, which implies real, local assemblies that are nevertheless in communion with the whole. Second, media are ecologies that shape attention, authority, and social relations. The medium is not merely a pipe for content but a formative environment. If liturgy is the church’s formative public act, then medium and liturgy are inseparable.

Marshall McLuhan articulated the fundamental media-ecological axiom that the medium is the message, meaning that media forms reorganize sensory ratios, social patterns, and the conditions of meaning. Writing in Understanding Media and later in his religion-inflected work, McLuhan saw electronic media creating a global village marked by simultaneity and participation rather than the linear, typographic world of print. His method combined aphoristic probes and a catholic instinct for sacramentality, insisting that forms are not neutral. For ecclesiology, McLuhan’s conceptual center forces a blunt question: what does the livestream do to preaching and sacrament? A sermon that is produced for camera, even when delivered to a room, relocates the implied audience and shifts authority from local shepherd to platform persona. The gaze is triangulated through lenses and metrics. The homiletic act ceases to be a public address to a gathered body and becomes content packaged for asynchronous and diffuse consumption. This reframing is the message. McLuhan would say that electronic mediation intensifies presence as involvement, yet flattens locality. It encourages a mode of participation that is ambient and glanceable, which is at odds with the covenantal solemnity of vows and oaths historically tied to the church’s gatherings. McLuhan also noted that media environments numb; the church that grows accustomed to screens in worship can become unaware of the shift from common prayer to orchestrated spectatorship. Examiners may object that amplification and codex Bibles are also media. The reply, using McLuhan’s toolset, is not to deny mediation but to distinguish between proportionate extension and structural substitution. A microphone amplifies the existing act of public speech to those present; a stream substitutes the sphere of presence with telepresence, which changes the social ontology of the act. The scale and speed of network media introduce metrics and attention economies that feed back into the act itself.

Jacques Ellul supplies the other side of the media ecology with his theory of technique as an autonomous, totalizing milieu. In The Technological Society, Ellul defines technique not as tools but as the ensemble of methods seeking efficiency as their supreme value. For the church, the danger is not simply screens but the colonization of liturgy by the criterion of efficiency: optimize engagement, maximize reach, reduce friction, measure outcomes. Ellul’s later work on propaganda exposes the fusion of technique and mass communication into a formation system that renders persons available to manipulation through endless micro-suggestions and affective cues. Digital liturgies are the quintessential propaganda environment because their interfaces are designed to capture attention, produce predictable responses, and translate all action into data. When churches adopt platform logics, they unintentionally catechize congregants into a new political economy of the soul. Ellul was not a Luddite; he held a theological account of freedom within the technological system that requires critical nonconformity grounded in the Lordship of Christ. Applied ecclesiologically, this implies liturgies that resist optimization and commodification, that reinstate silence, bodily postures, and sacramental materiality as non-quantifiable goods. Examiners will press whether this is simply cultural conservatism. Ellul’s point is theological: the church’s worship should disclose the gratuity of grace rather than the necessity of technique. The divine address orders us to truth, not utility. The more liturgy is tuned to the dashboard, the less it manifests the sovereignty of God and the givenness of the **means of grace**.

James K. A. Smith’s cultural liturgies project provides the anthropological bridge from media ecology to ecclesiology. In Desiring the Kingdom and Imagining the Kingdom, Smith argues that human beings are not primarily brains on a stick but lovers, whose practices prime their affections and telos. The mall, the stadium, and the university are secular liturgical sites that enact rival eschatologies. The relevance for digital liturgies is obvious: the phone is a pocket cathedral whose call to prayer is the push notification. These micro-liturgies train attention toward immediacy and curated selfhood. Smith, drawing on Augustine, insists that Christian worship’s scripted, embodied, multisensory practices recalibrate desire. He thereby strengthens the case that churchly liturgy must be irreducibly bodily and communal, with sacramental signs that resist virtualization. One can retrieve Smith to critique the attempt to transpose the liturgy into a performative content stream. At the same time, Smith’s receptivity to cultural forms can be misapplied to baptize any format as long as it forms desire. Examiners may ask whether his flexibility supports online communion. A careful reading shows his emphasis on embodied habit and sacramental realism resists it. He explicitly underscores the formative significance of gathered, enacted practices, not simulated equivalents. Thus, a Smithian anthropology intensifies the Reformed insistence on **ordinary means of grace** as embodied and local.

At this point a theologian of the church must reset the foundation with John Calvin. Calvin’s ecclesiology is not merely a set of prudential guidelines but a coherent system in which Christ rules his church by Word and Spirit through ordained officers. The marks of the true church are the pure preaching of the Word and the right administration of the sacraments, to which the exercise of discipline corresponds. The sacraments are visible words, covenant signs that seal promises to gathered people. The supper is a communal meal, not an event of private consumption, since the cup is shared and the one loaf manifests the one body. Calvin’s insistence on the Lord’s Day assembly as the heartbeat of the church’s life flows from his understanding of the **visible church** as the mother of believers. The **regulative principle** follows: we worship God in the ways he has commanded. This does not ban the use of technologies as such, but it forbids forms that invent new sacramental media where God has not authorized them. The bread and wine have determinate materiality tied to a co-present assembly under pastoral oversight. A remote viewer cannot be fenced from the table, cannot be reconciled visibly to the brother, cannot be brought under the keys of the kingdom in the same way. Nor can a remote pastor exercise the same discipline as one who knows the flock by face and voice. Examiners will press hard on pastoral exceptions: the shut-in, the soldier, the pandemic. Calvin’s own practice allows for pastoral accommodation without redefining the norm. Elders bring the supper to the infirm; letters of admonition reach the absent. But the norm remains a gathered people. The distinction between accommodation under duress and normativity is essential to avoid collapsing a theology of exile into a permanent ecclesial model. Likewise, the appeal to Paul’s letters misses the mark. The apostolic letters are part of the divinely appointed **means of grace** that were read aloud in assembled congregations; they supplement and presuppose assemblies rather than replace them.

Joseph Ratzinger’s liturgical theology deepens the metaphysical register. In The Spirit of the Liturgy, he argues that Christian worship is not self-production but participation in the cosmic liturgy of the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Liturgy is received form, not creative content. This fundamentally resists the temptation to treat worship as a product optimized for engagement. Ratzinger insists on the primacy of God and the de-centering of the celebrant; he warns against turning the assembly in on itself. The turn to screens pulls the gaze away from altar and pulpit to the apparatus and the performers. Even when it connects the housebound to a sense of the assembly, it risks reducing liturgy to the spectacle the viewer can control. Ratzinger also retrieves sacred time and space as gifts that configure our bodies into a posture of adoration that is not fungible with domestic distraction. This Roman Catholic contribution, while developed within a different sacramental framework, is a necessary ally for a Reformed defense of worship’s Godward gravity. The sacraments are not tokens that can be dispatched by courier or stream. They require a place where the church becomes publicly herself as an ordered people. If the medium is the message, then the medium must manifest God’s primacy and the gratuity of grace, not user control.

Walter Ong brings the analysis to the level of cognition and communal hearing. In Orality and Literacy, Ong describes how electronic media engender a secondary orality distinct from both print-literate abstraction and primary oral cultures. This secondary orality is participatory, spontaneous, and sound-centered, but it is mediated by technologies that produce distance and control. Preaching in the digital age is heard within this altered sensorium, with shorter attention spans and greater expectation of interactivity. A preacher cannot simply denounce this environment; he must craft proclamation that inhabits it without capitulation, retrieving the public reading of Scripture and dialogical prayer while resisting the slide toward consumer choice. Ong underscores that hearing the Word is a communal act. The public reading in the assembly binds hearers together in a temporality and rhythm under the Spirit that differs from individualized on-demand consumption. For ecclesiology, this sets a baseline: Scripture’s authority is exercised in public, with elders and people under the same Word at the same time. Digital mediation that induces time-shifting and segmentation undercuts this common hearing.

These figures converge on a position: the church’s essence is enacted in embodied, local gatherings where God addresses his people by Word and sacrament through ordained office, and where Christ’s discipline orders the community. Digital liturgies, shaped by platform logics and the attention economy, cannot constitute this gathering without deforming it. They can, however, support catechesis, mission, and pastoral care if subordinated to the gathered life.

Internal debates within Reformed circles expose the fault lines. One concerns the **regulative principle** and the propriety of images and screens. Some argue that projecting lyrics and video sermons are adiaphora that serve the Word. Others contend they instantiate a different liturgical form, creating an audience and performer dynamic foreign to Reformed simplicity. A second debate concerns multisite churches with a single preacher beamed to multiple campuses. Defenders claim the preached Word need not be delivered in person at every assembly. Critics counter that the pastoral act is not separable from the pastor’s presence, that church power is local and relational, and that sacramental unity requires under-shepherds who actually know their sheep. A third debate erupted during pandemic lockdowns over online communion. Some Reformed bodies permitted it under emergency conditions; others refused, citing the nature of the signs and the necessity of gathered discipline. Here, the internal debate is not over compassion but over ecclesial ontology. The side I defend stresses that exceptions under duress should not define the church’s being. To those who cite the law of love for isolated believers, a Reformed reply must remember that love is ordered by God’s commands. Pastoral provision must aim to restore embodied assembly.

External debates pit the church’s gathered ontology against technoutopian and consumerist models. Some evangelical pragmatists treat the church as a content producer with campuses and online platforms as distribution channels. The church-growth calculus often treats presence and sacrament as variables to be optimized rather than constitutive goods. Liberal voluntarist ecclesiology reinforces the idea of church as expressive association with no ontic bond. In a different register, Big Tech’s platform capitalism imposes a liturgy of metrics, surveillance, and algorithmic curation that subtly disciples users into a market of attention. The church’s adoption of these platforms without critique risks forming members into consumers of spirituality rather than citizens of the kingdom under **pastoral authority**. One must acknowledge the missionary possibilities opened by network tools, yet the church cannot outsource her gathered life to infrastructures whose telos contradicts the gratuity and holiness of worship.

Contemporary challenges have sharpened the stakes. Pandemic lockdowns forced churches to improvise. The crucial theological work now is to distinguish emergency improvisations from normative theology. Virtual reality promises immersive worship experiences. The promise is false because it simulates presence while evacuating the shared material signs that constitute the sacraments and the juridical bonds that define membership. AI-generated sermons and liturgies threaten to strip pastoral ministry of its personal, covenantal character. Even if AI can rearrange orthodox content, the pastoral address is not raw material but a performative act of a called person, analogous to a judge pronouncing sentence or a bride and groom exchanging vows. The keys of the kingdom are not algorithms. The attention economy, pornified interfaces, and incessant alerts assault contemplation and chaste charity. The church’s liturgy must be a school of attention that refuses these patterns. Surveillance capitalism raises pastoral confidentiality and spiritual direction risks; churches must guard the flock’s data as part of their duty of care. None of these are peripheral; they directly pressure the church’s holiness and unity.

What, then, is the positive path? One must articulate criteria that reflect the church’s ontology. First, non-substitution: digital tools may not replace the Lord’s Day assembly or the administration of sacraments. No online communion, no virtual baptisms, no membership entirely online. Second, subsidiarity: use lower-tech, local tools where possible to preserve face-to-face fellowship and pastoral oversight. Third, resistance to platform logics: refuse metrics as masters of ministry, resist gamified engagement, and prioritize practices that do not scale well but form saints. Fourth, sabbath boundaries: protect sacred time from devices, cultivating holy silence and embodied song. Fifth, catechetical intentionality: teach congregants to discern and resist secular digital liturgies by naming them and providing counter-practices. Sixth, pastoral presence: insist that preaching is a live, local act of a shepherd under vow, and that streams, if provided for the infirm, are framed as accommodation rather than church.

At this point examiners will raise a standard set of objections. Are not the apostolic letters and the use of print evidence that God uses media to form his people apart from co-presence? Yes, and Scripture is an inspired **means of grace** designed by God to be publicly read in assemblies and to travel to plant churches. Its existence cannot be invoked to invent new media for sacraments. Does the use of a microphone or a hearing aid not already concede that technology mediates worship? Yes, but these are extensions of the same act within one room. They do not alter the social ontology of assembly. Does prohibiting online communion exclude the disabled or those in diaspora? No; it demands that the church go to them. Elders can bring the supper to shut-ins, and the scattered church under persecution sustains itself with the hope and plan of gathering, even in hidden ways, rather than canonizing dispersion. Are not digital communities real communities? They are real social bonds, but the church’s covenant bonds involve vows, oversight, and sacramental participation that bind persons in space and time. The difference is not between real and fake but between kinds of community. The church’s is not reducible to telepresence.

This position integrates adjacent loci. Christology forbids a docetic ecclesiology. The Word became flesh, and his body was handled, seen, and eaten sacramentally. Our communion with Christ’s body requires common bread and a shared cup in a place. Anthropologically, humans are ensouled bodies, whose habits and attention are trained by postures and rhythms. The phone trains fidgeting attention and consumption; liturgy trains patience, listening, and submission. Soteriology is at stake because faith comes by hearing the Word publicly preached, and sanctification requires the disciplines of community life. Discipline is no mere administrative add-on but an aspect of the keys of the kingdom, which cannot be executed by push notification. The doctrine of Scripture is crucial because the Word’s authority is exercised in the assembly through the public reading of Scripture, preaching, and prayer. The church’s authority presupposes a space to bind and loose, to admit and fence. Even **divine simplicity** has an indirect bearing: worship is ordered to God as simple, not a composite of our preferences. The simplicity of God implies that worship should be simple in focus, not fragmented by feeds and stimuli that multiply ends.

Finally, one must name the constructive contribution of each decisive figure to a practical ecclesial ethic. McLuhan disciplines us to interrogate the message in the medium and to make the embodied assembly the medium that carries the church’s message. Ellul catechizes us to resist efficiency as a master and to craft liturgies that manifest gratuity and truthfulness. Smith equips us to diagnose digital rituals and to construct counter-liturgies that form love for God and neighbor through bodily practice. Calvin anchors our commitments in the **regulative principle** and the ontology of the **visible church**, so that love is ordered by command. Ratzinger orients our gaze to God’s primacy and the received nature of liturgy, inoculating us against the entertainment paradigm. Ong helps us inhabit contemporary attention patterns without capitulation, retrieving communal hearing. Together they yield a coherent, defensible stance: the church should use digital media as tools for catechesis, evangelism, and care, but must guard the integrity of the assembly and the sacraments by refusing digital substitution and resisting platform formation.

If the church’s worship is where heaven touches earth, then the form of that act must be guarded with jealousy. The digital age has not altered the nature of the church. It has only intensified the need to articulate why the church is a people gathered by the triune God through visible words and enacted signs, under real shepherds, in real places, at set times. That conviction will sound stubborn to technocrats and quaint to pragmatists. It is, in fact, the only way to keep liturgy from becoming content and the church from becoming a brand. The medium cannot be allowed to become the sanctuary. The sanctuary must become the medium through which the message of the gospel gathers and forms a people for God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Digital liturgies are patterned, desire-forming practices native to networked platforms; ecclesiology concerns the **visible church** gathered under **Word, sacrament, and discipline**; the question is whether digital forms can constitute that gathering.
- Decisive figures:
  - McLuhan: medium is the message; electronic forms reshape authority and presence.
  - Ellul: technique’s autonomy and propaganda warn against optimizing worship into content.
  - James K. A. Smith: cultural liturgies show how practices form love, requiring embodied counter-liturgies.
  - Calvin: marks of the church, **regulative principle**, and sacramental materiality demand gathered, local worship.
  - Ratzinger: liturgy is received participation in God’s primacy, not self-produced spectacle.
  - Ong: secondary orality reframes attention, calling for communal hearing and presence.
- Debates:
  - Internal: screens and the **regulative principle**; multisite and video preaching; online communion; defining the **ordinary means of grace** in emergencies.
  - External: church-as-content pragmatism; liberal voluntarism; platform capitalism discipling congregants; technoutopian network ecclesiology.
  - Contemporary: pandemic livestreaming; VR church and metaverse sacraments; AI sermons; attention economy; surveillance and confidentiality.
- Defended position: Digital tools may assist catechesis, mission, and pastoral care, but they cannot replace the embodied Lord’s Day assembly or sacramental acts; platform logics must be resisted and subordinated to the church’s ontology.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Are microphones and streams not both technologies? Extension within one room differs from substitution by telepresence.
  - What about shut-ins and emergencies? Provide accommodations without redefining the norm; the church goes to them.
  - Do apostolic letters license mediated sacraments? Scripture presupposes and serves assemblies; it does not authorize new sacramental media.
  - Can online membership be real community? Church bonds involve vows, oversight, and sacraments requiring co-presence.
  - Why not online communion if intention is sincere? The signs require a gathered body sharing one loaf and cup under **pastoral authority**.
