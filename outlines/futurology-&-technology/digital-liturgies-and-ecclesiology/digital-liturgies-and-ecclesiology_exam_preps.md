### TITLE
Digital Liturgies and Ecclesial Form: Can the Church Be Itself Online?

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how **digital liturgies** can participate in the visible, sacramental, and communal reality of the church without collapsing **ecclesiology**, **sacramentology**, and **media theory** into technological pragmatism.
- Decisive figures: Marshall McLuhan, Jacques Ellul, Stanley Hauerwas, Craig Dykstra, Tish Harrison Warren.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and classic catholic ecclesiology on sacrament and visibility, Reformed and confessional Protestant **ecclesiology** and **means of grace**, postwar theology-and-culture engagement with technology and media, recent liturgical retrieval movements.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Among Reformed and liturgical theologians over the status of **online worship**, the **Lord’s Supper** mediated through screens, and the relation of habit-formation to sacramental ontology.
  - External: Liberal and pragmatic ecclesiologies that reduce the church to functional community or content-distribution; secular media theory that treats religion as communication or affect management.
  - Contemporary: Pandemic-driven normalization of livestreamed worship, “digital campuses,” VR church, algorithm-shaped piety, and data-driven spiritual formation.
- Defended position: Digital media can serve derivative, ordered roles in the church’s **ministry of the Word** and mutual exhortation, but properly speaking the church’s primary **liturgical** and **sacramental** life is irreducibly embodied, local, and temporally gathered; “digital liturgies” are formative and must be critically ordered to, and subordinated under, the visible church’s concrete practices rather than treated as equivalent extensions.

### ESSAY
The question of digital liturgies and ecclesiology forces a collision between classic accounts of the church as a visible, sacramental, and ordered body and the contemporary reality of media-saturated existence in which screens function as the primary environment of attention, desire, and social belonging. To survive a Westminster-style oral defense on this topic one must hold together three things without confusion or separation: a robust doctrine of the church and the **means of grace**, a theologically thick account of technological mediation shaped by serious media theory, and an analysis of contemporary digital practices as de facto **liturgies** that catechize persons and communities. The central claim that must be defended is that the church as church cannot be reduced to, or primarily realized in, digital environments, even though digital instruments may serve subordinate roles in its mission; furthermore, the forms and rhythms of digital life themselves constitute rival liturgies that must be resisted and re-ordered rather than naively baptized.

Marshall McLuhan is decisive here because he reframed the conceptual center of media discussions by insisting that “the medium is the message.” McLuhan, writing in works such as “Understanding Media” and “The Medium is the Massage,” argued that media are not neutral channels conveying preexisting content, but environments that reshape perception, social relations, and imagination at a structural level. Every medium is an extension of some human faculty and in extending it, it also amputates and reconfigures others. From the standpoint of **ecclesiology**, this means one cannot treat livestreamed worship or Zoom sacraments as mere changes in delivery system that leave “the same” Word and sacrament content intact. The digital mediation itself reshapes temporality, attention, embodiment, and authority. An examiner will rightly press: does not the preached Word remain the Word, regardless of whether it is mediated through acoustics or bandwidth? A McLuhan-informed answer is that while the Word of God has its own divine power, we cannot abstract it from its appointed **form of administration**. In biblical and classic traditions, the Word is publicly heralded by an embodied minister to a gathered people who see and hear one another, who respond together in prayer, song, and confession, and whose mutual presence creates a particular social field of accountability and shared history. When the sermon becomes a video on demand, consumed alone with earbuds, what is changed is not only the sensory mode but the communal and covenantal context that gives the act its proper ecclesial form.

Jacques Ellul extends McLuhan’s insight by situating technology within a broader theology of **the powers** and of human autonomy. In “The Technological Society” and “The Presence of the Kingdom,” Ellul describes “la technique” as a pervasive, quasi-autonomous system governed by the imperative of efficiency, which tends to subordinate all other ends to its own expansion. For Ellul, technology is never simply a neutral tool in the hands of the church; it exerts pressure to reshape goals and norms in its own image. If efficiency, reach, and immediacy become the operating criteria for “effective” ministry, then the church has already conceded its **telos** to technical rationality. The shift to digital liturgies during the pandemic illustrated this temptation: instead of asking first what the church is and what the sacraments are, many pastors asked how to “deliver” an equivalent experience to as many people as possible with minimal friction. Under Ellul’s analysis, that question is already a capitulation, because it regards the church as a set of experiences or goods to be distributed rather than as a concrete people constituted by God’s own acts in Word and sacrament, gathered in time and space.

Ellul also helps articulate a robust external critique of liberal and pragmatic ecclesiologies that define the church in terms of functions like moral influence, spiritual encouragement, or social justice mobilization. If the essence of the church is narrowed to such functions, then digital media can easily be treated as adequate or even superior platforms for church life: one can encourage, teach, and organize efficiently via video, social networks, and apps. Under that framework, a “digital campus” is simply a reasonable extension of ministry. By contrast, a classical and Reformed ecclesiology insists that the church is first of all a visible congregation where Christ rules by his Word and Spirit through ordained ministry, in which the **sacraments** are rightly administered, and where mutual discipline and concrete neighbor-love take form. The question “can church fully be online?” thus becomes not a question about technological possibility but about what we confess the church to be.

To avoid a merely negative or nostalgic stance, we must bring these media-theory insights into conversation with contemporary ecclesial and liturgical theologians. Stanley Hauerwas is a decisive figure because he re-centered ecclesiology around the church as a disciplined community whose shared practices shape a distinctive politics and moral imagination. In works like “A Community of Character” and “Resident Aliens,” Hauerwas, often with William Willimon, insists that the church does not have a social ethic but is itself the social ethic: a community formed by **narrative** and **practice** to be a foretaste of God’s kingdom. This is directly relevant to digital liturgies. If the identity of the church lies in its practices of gathered worship, confession, table fellowship, truth-telling, and peacemaking, then the shift to digitally mediated “attendance” threatens not just the aesthetics of worship but its formative power as a communal discipline. Screens fragment the shared bodily discipline of standing, kneeling, singing, passing the peace, and eating bread and wine; they privatize what is meant to be public and common. A Hauerwasian would argue that digital mediation tends to turn worship into religious content consumption rather than participation in a disciplined polity. Even if the same words are said, the form of life they sustain is different.

An examiner may object that Hauerwas’s emphasis on practices could be used to argue the opposite: what matters is that we continue certain practices, even if digitally mediated, since practices are, for him, socially learned skills. But here the concrete specification of practices matters. The Lord’s Supper, for example, is not just any shared meal or remembrance, but an act of **sacramental** communion administered by Christ through the church’s ordained ministry in a local body. A scattered set of viewers each eating their own bread in front of a screen lacks the mutual visibility and recognized local oversight that the New Testament associates with “coming together as a church.” While some Hauerwas-influenced pastors experimented with virtual Eucharist during the pandemic in the name of preserving practice, a more coherent application of his own emphasis on the church as a visible polis would insist on fasting from the Supper in dispersed seasons rather than transforming it into a private ritual accompanied by a broadcast.

Craig Dykstra presses the analysis by bringing the language of **practice** and **habituation** into explicit conversation with pastoral theology. In “Vision and Character” and later essays on Christian practices, Dykstra argued that the Christian life is sustained by identifiable communal practices such as interpreting Scripture, worshiping, forgiving, and keeping Sabbath, which are “socially embodied” and over time shape persons into Christ’s likeness. This strand of theology influenced later work on “cultural liturgies” by figures like James K. A. Smith, but Dykstra’s emphasis is more ecclesial and less merely philosophical. His framing is key to understanding “digital liturgies” as a theologically serious category: the routines of waking to a smartphone, scrolling feeds, participating in platform-driven outrage cycles, curating a digital self, and being constantly addressable by notifications are not neutral. They are practices that form attention, desire, and identity in ways that often rival or undermine the church’s own formative practices. From a Dykstra-informed standpoint, the church must treat digital environments as competing catechetical spaces governed by commercial and political forces. To simply transpose church practices onto these platforms without critical discernment is to risk having the deeper logic of those platforms dictate the actual formation.

Here the internal debate within Reformed and evangelical circles emerges clearly. On one side are those who, informed by McLuhan and Ellul, argue that digital mediation structurally undermines the **catholic** marks of the church: one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, concretized in the Reformed marks of pure preaching, right administration of sacraments, and discipline. On the other side are those who see media as providential tools that can extend the reach of preaching and fellowship, and who are more confident that the church’s essence is resilient under changing forms. This dispute is exacerbated by differing accounts of the sacraments. Those with a more symbolic or memorial view of the Supper find it easier to imagine “online communion,” whereas those with a stronger sense of sacramental presence and ecclesial oversight resist such innovations as category mistakes. The candidate must be prepared to argue that the confessional Protestant understanding of sacraments as visible words administered in the gathered assembly under ordained oversight logically excludes treating dispersed, screen-linked actions as equivalent. The sacrament’s form includes bodily sharing of one loaf and one cup, concrete recognition of fellow communicants, and the accountability of elders who “fence the table.” These elements are not replicable in an environment where the pastor does not actually know who is present, what elements they are using, or what their relation to one another is.

Tish Harrison Warren represents a more recent, pastoral-liturgical retrieval that is directly engaged with the digital question. In “Liturgy of the Ordinary” and other writings, Warren emphasizes that Christian worship is not only about a formal Sunday service but about the structuring of everyday life through habitual practices governed by **embodied liturgies**. Her analysis intersects with Dykstra’s in treating attention and bodily routines as theologically significant. Warren has also written directly about digital life, warning that our devices tend to dis-integrate our attention, fragment community, and counteract the slow, repetitive, bodily nature of traditional liturgies. Her work is decisive in bridging high-level liturgical theology with the ordinary experience of believers who check a worship livestream while also tracking sports scores and social media. For Warren, the church’s gathered liturgy is meant to retrain our senses and desires away from distraction and toward patient presence with God and neighbor. To the extent that digital liturgies intensify multitasking, anonymity, and disembodied spectatorship, they sabotage this retraining.

An examiner might ask whether figures like Warren and Dykstra, with their emphasis on practice and habit, simply reflect a Protestant discomfort with sacramental ontology and thus leave us unable to assert non-negotiable embodied requirements. The response must be that a Reformed account of **means of grace** already binds Word and sacrament to bodily gathering and ordered ministry. Practice theory clarifies the formative stakes but does not supply the normative core; that normativity arises from Scripture’s depiction of the church as an assembly, the Supper as a shared table, and pastoral oversight as face-to-face. Practice theory then adds that when we move these acts into digital frames, we are not just breaking rules but unforming the people.

The external debate is also with secular media theory that treats religion as content or affect rather than as a concrete body politic. In such accounts, a “religious community” is simply a network of individuals sharing beliefs and emotional experiences, so digital media are entirely adequate for its continuation. By contrast, classic ecclesiology insists on **visibility**, **order**, and **place**: the church is not an invisible net of spiritual affinities but a public body that meets, eats, and bears one another’s burdens in specific locales. The New Testament’s instructions regarding elders, widows, visiting the sick, and church discipline assume committed, knowable membership. Digital mediation can supplement but not replace this concreteness. To say that a Discord server or VR gathering “is church” in the full sense is to tacitly redefine the church along the lines of consumer affinity and disembodied presence. That is not merely an adaptation of form but a doctrinal shift.

Contemporary debates around hybrid models and accessibility bring a further set of pressures. What about the homebound, disabled, or chronically ill who cannot attend in person? Does a refusal to call digital participation “full” church involvement marginalize them? Here the candidate must distinguish extraordinary pastoral accommodation from the normative form. Historically, the church has always made pastoral provision for the sick and imprisoned through home visits, bringing the Lord’s Supper, and ensuring they are included in the church’s care. These cases do not redefine church as wherever one is individually located; rather, they witness to the church’s commitment to the body’s weakest members. Likewise, livestreams and recorded sermons can be useful pastoral tools for those providentially hindered, but they remain derivative extensions of a primary, gathered reality. To call them “just as much church” obscures both the loss involved and the call to seek embodiment where possible. Ellul’s warning about the logic of technique is especially relevant: once exceptions are normalized and then expanded for convenience, efficiency replaces charity as the guiding principle.

A related contemporary pressure arises from missional rhetoric. Advocates of online campuses and metaverse churches claim that the church must meet people where they are: online. There is some truth here; evangelism and catechesis can occur in digital spaces, just as they can via print or broadcast media. McLuhan would remind us, however, that when we enter a medium we enter its environment of formation. Evangelistic presence in digital spaces must therefore be coupled with calls out of those environments into the more humanizing and sanctifying space of bodily gathering. To treat the metaverse as an adequate long-term habitat for the church is to align with the very logics of disembodied existence that the gospel ultimately calls into judgment by affirming **resurrection**, new creation, and the goodness of creaturely limits. Digital tools are best regarded as porch or bridge, not temple.

The internal disputes also intersect with broader doctrinal loci. A weak doctrine of **creation** and **human embodiment** will more readily accept digital ecclesiologies because it fails to see bodily presence, temporal limits, and local particularity as positively willed by God. If the human person is implicitly treated as a thinking or feeling mind, then communication of content seems sufficient for church life. By contrast, a robustly creational and christological anthropology, which sees humanity as body-soul unity and notes that the Son assumed a real body, stresses that salvation and sanctification are bodily. The church as the body of Christ is not a mere metaphor for relational connection but a description of a community whose members are joined to one another in concrete ways. This has implications for sacramental realism as well: the Supper is not a mental remembrance of absent realities, but an embodied participation. Digital mediation cannot convey touch, taste, shared space, or the sense of a congregation’s thickness over time.

This does not entail a rejectionist Luddism. A theologically ordered stance will affirm that the church has always used media: codices, printing presses, radio, and now digital networks. The question is not whether but how and under what constraints. McLuhan’s insight suggests that the church must ask of each medium: what kinds of community and attention does this form foster? Ellul adds: what technocratic logics does this tool smuggle in? Hauerwas and Dykstra press: do these forms sustain the church’s distinctive practices or hollow them out into consumable experiences? Warren draws attention to the level of daily habit: does our use of devices support or erode prayer, hospitality, and presence?

On that basis, one can articulate a constructive position: digital media may be legitimately used by the church to extend the reach of preaching, to facilitate certain kinds of communication and catechesis, and to assist those providentially hindered from gathering. Yet the church’s primary **liturgical** and **sacramental** acts must be understood as intrinsically embodied, locally gathered, and led within ordered structures of authority and accountability. The language of “digital church” should be resisted as conceptually misleading; better to speak of digital ministries of or from a church. Similarly, the language of “online communion” should be rejected, not because God’s grace cannot reach through screens, but because the act described no longer matches the Scriptural and confessional form of the Supper as an ecclesial, bodily meal. What is at stake is not only doctrinal consistency but Christian formation: once worship becomes a privatized, on-demand, low-friction experience, the church will inevitably be reshaped into a loose network of consumers rather than a disciplined people.

In anticipation of examination, one must also be ready to face the charge of absolutizing certain cultural forms of church. Are we not simply privileging a western, brick-and-mortar model over creative, global expressions? The answer is that the commitment is not to a particular architecture or liturgical style, but to certain theological constants: gathered presence, mutual recognizability, shared physical elements, and visible oversight. These can be realized in house churches, under trees, in refugee camps, and even in technologically minimal settings. Digital platforms, however, systematically loosen or erase these constants by making presence anonymous, authority distant, and participation easily exited. It is these structural tendencies, not the absence of pews or pipe organs, that conflict with sound ecclesiology.

Finally, one must underline that “digital liturgies” is not only a term for explicitly religious uses of technology. The more pervasive and perhaps more insidious liturgies are those of the attention economy, the politics of outrage, and the commodification of self, all enacted daily through digital rituals. The church’s own liturgy cannot simply be moved onto those platforms without being contaminated by their form. The wise path is to acknowledge digital media as part of our fallen but usable environment, to employ them with stringent theological criteria, to keep them clearly subordinate to the embodied assembly, and to treat them themselves as objects of discipleship: we must teach believers to repent of and resist practices that malform desire and to rediscover the slow, vulnerable disciplines of bodily, local, shared worship.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: “Digital liturgies” are the patterned, repeated practices of digital life that shape attention, desire, and community, including explicitly religious uses such as livestreamed worship; a sound **ecclesiology** insists that the church’s primary **liturgical** and **sacramental** life is irreducibly embodied, locally gathered, and ordered.
- Decisive figures:
  - McLuhan: media are environments that reshape perception and community; digital mediation changes the form, not just the delivery, of Word and sacrament.
  - Ellul: technology as an autonomous system driven by efficiency; warns that “online church” often capitulates to technocratic logics and redefines the church functionally.
  - Hauerwas: church as a disciplined polis formed by practices; digital worship tends to reduce the church to content consumers rather than a visible community.
  - Dykstra: Christian practices as socially embodied habits; digital routines are rival liturgies that catechize against the church’s own practices.
  - Warren: retrieval of **embodied liturgies** and attention to ordinary habits; digital media fragment presence and undermine the slow, bodily disciplines of worship.
- Debates:
  - Internal: within Reformed and evangelical traditions over online worship, digital sacraments, hybrid models, and the weight of habit-formation versus sacramental ontology.
  - External: liberal/pragmatic ecclesiologies that define church as function or experience, and secular media theories that see religion as communicative content rather than a visible body.
  - Contemporary: pandemic-normalized streaming, VR church, digital campuses, accessibility vs normativity, and algorithm-shaped piety.
- Defended position: Digital tools may serve derivative roles in the church’s **ministry of the Word** and pastoral care, especially for the hindered, but they cannot constitute the church’s primary liturgical and sacramental life; “digital church” language should be resisted, and digital practices must be critically subordinated to embodied, local, and ordered ecclesial forms.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Can the church be fully online? No; by nature it is a visible, locally gathered body under ordered ministry, though digital tools may serve it.
  - Is “online communion” valid? No; it lacks the necessary ecclesial form of a bodily shared table under local oversight and mutual presence.
  - How do digital liturgies relate to sanctification? They function as rival practices that form attention and desire, often deforming believers unless intentionally re-ordered.
  - Are you absolutizing a western church model? No; the non-negotiables are gathered presence, shared physical elements, and visible oversight, realizable in many cultures but structurally undermined by digital mediation.
  - How do you care for the homebound and disabled? Use digital extensions and pastoral visitation as extraordinary accommodations while upholding embodied gathering as the normative form of church life.
