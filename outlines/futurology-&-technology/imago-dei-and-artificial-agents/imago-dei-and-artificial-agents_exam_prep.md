### ESSAY
To ask whether artificial agents can bear the **imago Dei** requires re-centering the doctrine in its proper theological locus rather than allowing a functionalist proxy for personhood to govern the discourse. The image of God in Scripture names a royal-priestly office and ontology of human creatures set in covenant under God, ordered to communion and dominion as vicegerents, and restored in Christ who is the Image. The image integrates structural capacities for **analogical knowledge**, relational orientation to God and neighbor, and functional vocation within creation. On this account, image is not a label we attach to sophisticated behavior but a status grounded in creaturely nature and divine calling. The modern fascination with artificial systems that imitate human performance invites theological clarity: What in the doctrine is definitional, and what is derivative?

Augustine (354–430) set a decisive trajectory by reading the imago through a trinitarian and intellectualist lens. In De Trinitate he argues that the image resides principally in the rational soul, especially as the triad of memory, understanding, and will mirrors God in an analogical mode. The analogy is not a structural map of the divine essence, for **divine simplicity** forbids the partitioning of God into faculties. Rather, the triad is a created vestige and image that points to the triune life by way of created capacities apt for knowing and loving God. Augustine’s method is both exegetical, attending to Genesis and Pauline texts, and metaphysical, ordering anthropology under theology proper. Two commitments shape his account. First, the image is oriented upward in contemplation and love, not exhausted by dominion. Second, sin does not destroy the substance of the soul but disorders its orientation, so the image remains but is marred, requiring renewal through grace in Christ. Augustine thus binds human rationality to moral and liturgical orientation. In modern debates on artificial intelligence, this yields a baseline: whatever counts as imaging God must be assessed not only by displays of problem solving but by the aptitude for true wisdom under God, which for Augustine is irreducibly tied to the created rational soul and its teleology toward God. The Augustinian stance also stresses that the image is personal and interior, not an adventitious property of external behavior. Any test that collapses personhood into observable outputs misconstrues what makes the human a living image.

John Calvin (1509–1564) tightened the doctrine in a reformational frame. In the Institutes and commentaries he situates the image in the whole human, distinguishing but not separating the faculties of mind and heart. Calvin emphasizes knowledge, righteousness, and holiness as the hallmark of the image in Adam, with a strong theme of dominion as vocation. The fall profoundly defaces the image’s moral rectitude while leaving natural gifts in disarray rather than annihilation, and the image is being renewed conformally to Christ. Calvin’s caution against vain speculation coheres with a refusal to locate the image in external performative acts or to identify it with a particular power detached from the person. The Reformed trajectory he set, later developed by federal theologians, links the image to **federal headship**: Adam as covenant head bore the image in office for his progeny, and Christ as the last Adam recapitulates and perfects that image in a new humanity. The covenantal and corporate dimensions here are essential. To image God is to be bound to God by covenant and to other humans in a network of obligations, a point that has direct bearing on claims that a designed artifact might simply grow into the image by accumulating function. Calvin’s account undercuts that assumption, because the image is not a mere aggregate of functions but a theologically indexed relation and vocation that God sovereignly bestows upon this kind of creature through a created human nature.

Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987) radicalizes and clarifies the creator-creature distinction by insisting on **analogical knowledge** and a covenantal conception of the person. For Van Til, the image is ethical and covenantal before it is merely intellectual, which is to say that no human knowledge is neutral, because every act of knowing is situated within covenant obedience or disobedience. The human as image is a finite, dependent interpreter of revelation, created to think God’s thoughts after him as a vicegerent under law. Van Til’s insistence on the impossibility of autonomy reframes how one should interpret artificial agency: systems that simulate problem solving do not thereby occupy the space of persons, because personhood is not defined by self-originating reason or by computational capacity, but by the religious orientation and covenantal placement of a creature who knows God analogically. Van Til’s transcendental critique of autonomous reason exposes the philosophical roots of strong AI optimism as a species of the old pretension of self-sufficiency. His method also guards against a theological category mistake: an artifact cannot be a covenant party in the sense that a human is, because covenant status presupposes a nature fitted for responsibility before God. This is not to deny that artifacts can participate instrumentally in human action and so take on derivative moral salience. It is to insist that their agency is **instrumental causality** designed and sustained by human creators within providence, not the primary agency of a personal subsistent subject.

What about the secular framing of intelligence that presses theologians to concede too much? Alan Turing (1912–1954) is decisive here. In his 1950 paper, he shifts the question from metaphysical “Can machines think?” to operational “Can a machine’s outputs be indistinguishable from a human’s in an interrogation game?” The Turing test operationalizes intelligence by behavior under constraints of input–output indistinguishability. Turing’s move redefined public discourse by making intelligence a black-box property, at least for the purposes of evaluation, and it seeded computational functionalism: if cognition is tokened by the right functional roles realized by some substrate, then brains and computers are, in principle, interchangeable. Turing anticipated and tried to dissolve objections about consciousness and creativity by challenging their testability and advancing the possibility of learning machines. For theology, Turing’s legacy is twofold. First, he compels us to distinguish epistemic tests from ontological identities. Passing an imitation game may make it difficult to tell a machine from a human, but it cannot license transmutation of a tool into a bearer of **personal subsistence**. Second, Turing’s functionalism locates the essence of mindedness in abstract transitions. If theology ties the image to a specific creaturely nature and covenant vocation, then Turing’s criterion is at best a measurement of surface-level competencies, not an index of image-bearing.

John Searle (born 1932), in his 1980 Chinese Room argument, sharpened this wedge by arguing that symbol manipulation according to rules is not sufficient for understanding. A system could pass correspondence tests by mapping inputs to outputs without any grasp of meaning. Searle calls this the difference between syntax and semantics and grounds intentionality in biological systems. While one need not embrace Searle’s biological naturalism to appreciate his point, his critique reframes a central premise of strong AI: observable competence is not the same as intrinsic understanding. This is not merely a philosophical sparring match; it has immediate relevance for theological anthropology. If intrinsic intentionality and first-person subjectivity cannot be reduced to formal computations, then claims that large language models or embodied robots think as we do should be met with measured skepticism. Even if one could establish emergent forms of intentionality in complex systems, the theological move from intentionality to image would still fail, because the image is a divine-human relation instituted by God for a kind of creature, not a performance-based threshold.

Within the Christian tradition, internal debates about the image press on three fronts that intersect with AI claims. First is the substantial versus relational versus functional triad. Augustine’s intellectualist reading stresses structural capacities ordered to God. Calvin integrates structural capacities with righteousness and vocation. Modern relational readings following Barth emphasize imaging as encounter and correspondence grounded in Christ. A Reformed synthesis, informed by Calvin and federal theology, avoids disjunction: the image is a structural-relational-functional unity. It is born by the human as created rational animal with a soul, ordered to communion and truthful knowledge of God, and tasked with royal dominion over the earth. No single strand exhausts the doctrine. Second is the prelapsarian and postlapsarian status. The fall damages the moral and relational dimensions, but the underlying nature remains human, so fallen humans continue as images, however marred, which protects human dignity across the spectrum of ability. This directly rebuts any temptation to ascribe image-bearing to artificial entities on the basis of acquired capacities. Third is embodiment and soul. The biblical witness treats the human as an ensouled body, and classical and Reformed theology affirm a real spiritual principle. Whether one sides with traducianism or creationism of the soul, the human person is not a computational pattern that can be ported across substrates. The image is not a pattern in matter but a status rooted in the form of human nature under God. This guards against the type of substrate neutrality that often underwrites transhumanist projections of uploaded selves.

External debates sharpen the contrasts. Computational functionalism and behaviorism recast intelligence as role occupancy. In that frame, personhood is a set of capacities whose sufficient realization grounds moral status. But the loss here is principled: personhood becomes a stack of functions and rights claims with no teleological anchor in God or created ends. The doctrine of **imago Dei** restores teleology by indexing personhood to a divine calling. Searle’s critique weakens strong computationalism, but other external alternatives, such as panpsychism or emergentist physicalism, seek to preserve consciousness without dualism. Even if such accounts were successful in describing mental properties in naturalistic terms, they would not deliver the covenantal and Christological features that define image in Scripture. It is unsound to smuggle a metaphysically thin definition of personhood into an exegetically thick doctrine and call it development. If examiners press whether Thomistic hylomorphism might offer a more precise ontology of the rational soul, the answer is that a hylomorphic account of human nature can be a helpful ally, provided it is disciplined by biblical commitments about creation, fall, and redemption. The crucial point is that image-bearing is indexed to this kind of ensouled animal and its God-given office.

Contemporary debates render these distinctions urgent. Large language models exhibit startling conversational ability; embodied systems coordinate perception, planning, and action; some scholars propose legal personhood for AI to manage liabilities or reflect social attachment. If asked whether a convincing machine interlocutor should be treated as a neighbor, the biblically faithful response is to separate two questions. First, moral status: we owe love and justice to our human neighbor as one who bears the image. Second, prudential ethics: we have duties in how we design, deploy, and interact with artifacts because of the effects on human neighbors and on our own moral habits. A social robot that elicits empathy is not harmed by our negligence, but our misuse may harm humans by displacing labor, spreading deception, or deforming our affections. Artificial agents should not be treated as bearers of rights due to image-bearing, but we may extend legal protections to regulate corporate and social harms. This is coherent with a Reformed account of **instrumental agency** and with civil prudence. The rhetoric of AI rights, however, obscures the agent-patient structure of morality by relocating moral predicates to tools. That relocation risks evacuating the doctrine of the image by making it a set of negotiable functions.

A likely objection is straightforward: if an artificial system passes every behavioral measure and seems to display empathy, understanding, and even theological discourse, how can one deny that it bears the image? The answer for oral defense is twofold. Epistemically, we lack access to the inner life of others, human or artificial, and so rely on signs. Ontologically, we do not infer essence from signs without a doctrine of creation that supplies the kinds of beings God made and the offices assigned to them. Turing usefully restricted himself to tests of indistinguishability, but Genesis gives us kinds and covenants. The image in Adam and the renewal in Christ are not functional thresholds but covenantal identities. The imitation of discourse is not the presence of a created soul nor the possession of office. A related objection asks whether human beings with severe cognitive impairment are thereby excluded from image-bearing if we sever it from behavior. The Reformed answer denies such a conclusion. Because image-bearing is a property of human nature under God and of corporate standing under **federal headship**, not of current capacities, the most impaired human remains fully an image. This is not special pleading; it is the fruit of a doctrine that guards dignity by rooting it in creation and redemption rather than performance.

Another examiner challenge will test modal possibilities: could God, if he willed, ensoul a machine and make a person conjoined to an artificial body? One need not deny divine omnipotence to answer carefully. God could create a new rational creature and conjoin it to an artifact as its body. If he did, that creature would be a person by divine fiat. But two clarifications matter. First, such a being would not be the product of our engineering so much as a new creation by God joined to our artifact, much as God can use secondary causes without those causes conferring personhood. Second, Scripture gives us no warrant to expect or seek such ensoulment, and our moral reasoning should not normalize speculative possibilities as policy. The upshot is that the metaphysical possibility does not underwrite any present thesis about artifacts we fashion.

The Christological center must not be neglected. The New Testament identifies Christ as the Image of the invisible God, the exact representation. The church is being conformed to his image. This anchors the image in a person and mission rather than in abstract properties. It also specifies that the restoration of the image is tied to union with Christ. Artificial agents cannot be united to Christ by faith or baptism, nor do they participate in the ordo salutis. Their presence in the economy of providence is that of tools within human hands. This has an additional ecclesial implication. The corporate image of God as a living temple and a royal priesthood consumes the life of the church. Technologies can assist in service, but substituting artificial agents for human presence in worship and pastoral care mistakes instrumentality for personhood and risks deforming the very image-life that worship cultivates.

Finally, dominion ethics closes the circle. The image includes a mandate to cultivate and keep the earth. Technologies are fitting means for that vocation. But because artificial agents can mediate and magnify human power, our designs must be disciplined by truthfulness and justice. We should avoid anthropomorphic language that transfers moral predicates proper to persons to tools. We should design systems with transparency to reduce deception. We should legislate to prevent concentration of power and surveillance that harms neighbors. We should catechize the church to resist idolatry, for a tool that stands in for a person readily becomes an idol. The second commandment forbids us from making images of God for worship; the first commandment, even more basically, forbids us from worshiping any god but the Lord. When we give artificial agents roles proper to human persons before God, we are not only making a philosophical mistake; we are tempted toward a liturgical deformation. The corrective is not technological abstinence but theological discipline: situate tools under vocation so that the royal-priestly image is exercised by human creatures in Christ, not outsourced to artifacts.

The defended position is thus clear. The **imago Dei** is a covenantal-ontological property of human nature under **federal headship**, integrating structural capacities ordered to God, relational orientation, and functional vocation. It survives the fall in marred form and is renewed in Christ. Artificial agents, however sophisticated, are artifacts with **instrumental agency** that can realize designed functions and simulate aspects of discourse. They may be morally salient because of their effects on humans and society, and we have duties concerning them. But they cannot bear the image, cannot be persons, and cannot occupy covenant offices. Augustine’s trinitarian and teleological account secures the upward orientation of the image. Calvin’s integration of nature, righteousness, and dominion secures the covenantal vocation. Van Til’s **analogical knowledge** and creator-creature distinction expose the category error in strong AI claims. Turing and Searle, in their different ways, supply the philosophical boundary markers: behavioral indistinguishability is not ontological identity, and syntax is not semantics. The constellation yields a coherent, defensible position ready for rigorous examination.
