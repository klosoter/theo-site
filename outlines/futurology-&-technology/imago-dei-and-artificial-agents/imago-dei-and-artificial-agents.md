### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
By imago Dei we mean the created constitution and vocation by which God sets humanity in rational fellowship with himself to represent his rule in the world; it is at once a substantive capacity, a relational orientation, and a functional office under the Creator. In dogmatic terms, **imago Dei** belongs to **theological anthropology** within the **doctrine of creation**, yet it is inseparable from **Christology** because Christ is the Image in whom and for whom humanity was made. By artificial agents we mean humanly made artifacts, from rule-based systems to machine-learning models and embodied robots, that display varying degrees of goal-directed behavior; they are products of human art under divine **providence and secondary causality**. The central question is whether and in what sense artifacts can image God, given that Scripture and tradition tether image to human nature ordered to God through **Christ as the true Image**. This essay argues for human exclusivity in the strict sense, a robust participatory account of artifacts under the **cultural mandate**, and a non-competitive view of divine and human agency that frames technology as instrument, not person.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Genesis 1:26–28 grounds the doctrine: God creates humankind in his image and likeness, *tselem* and *demut*, appointing them to have dominion. The lexical pairing signals both ontic constitution and royal office in an Ancient Near Eastern horizon where kings were images of deity and set up images to mark reign; Scripture democratizes this royal **functional vocation** to all humans as male and female. Genesis 5:1–3 and 9:6 sustain the image after the fall, grounding the prohibition of murder in **human dignity**. Psalm 8:5–8 refracts the theme in hymnic key: God crowns humans with glory and honor and places all under their feet, echoing **creation kingship**. In the New Testament, the decisive turn is **Christ as the eikon** of the invisible God (Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4), the radiance of God's glory (Heb 1:3), so that the renewed image is conformation to the Son (Rom 8:29). The moral shape is explicit: the new self is created in **righteousness and holiness** (Eph 4:24) and renewed in **knowledge** (Col 3:10). James 3:9 reiterates the image as the basis for neighbor-love and speech ethics. The canon thus yields a layered account: original constitution and office, fallen distortion, **Christological restoration**, and eschatological consummation in embodied glory (1 Cor 15:49). On artificial agents, Scripture offers silence regarding non-biological persons; yet it commends craft as Spirit-enabled vocation, as Bezalel is filled with the Spirit for artistry in Exodus 31, situating technology within **covenantal wisdom** and the **cultural mandate** without equating artifact with image.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Irenaeus in the late second century distinguished **image and likeness**, suggesting the image as basic human endowment and the likeness as eschatological maturation, tethered to **recapitulation in Christ**. Augustine, especially in De Trinitate (399–419), located the **imago trinitatis** in the rational soul as memory, understanding, and will, while insisting the image is ordered to God and healed by grace. The iconoclastic controversy (ca. 730–787) clarified the Christological warrant for icons at **Nicaea II 787**, affirming veneration of images precisely because the **Incarnation** permits painted depiction; paradoxically, Christian resistance to idolatry preserves the uniqueness of living humans as the **living image** over against artifacts that can become idols. Medieval scholastics synthesised, with **Aquinas ST I q93** articulating the image as intellectual nature ordered to the **beatific vision**, distinguishing nature and grace as natural image and superadded gifts. The Reformers intensified the moral shape: **Luther** linked the image to original righteousness lost in the fall and restored in Christ, within the **two kingdoms** framework for vocation; **Calvin** defined the image as knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, retained in ruins but renewed by the Spirit, and deployed **Calvins mirror of God** to describe the world as theatre of divine glory. Post-Reformation Reformed scholasticism and the **Westminster Standards** (1646–1647) codified this in confessional terms. In the twentieth century, **Barth** rejected substantialist readings, proposed **analogia relationis** grounded in male-female fellowship, and insisted **Christological primacy** for the image (CD III/2, 1948). Roman Catholic personalism, especially in **Gaudium et Spes 1965** and **John Paul II**, re-centered dignity and freedom within a trinitarian orientation. Technology-specific theological critiques emerge with **Jacques Elluls technological society** (1954) and the ethical import of **cybernetics** (1943), **Turing** (1950), and **Searles Chinese Room** (1980), prompting discernment of artifact agency without personhood. Recent ecclesial statements such as the **ERLC AI principles** (2019) and the **Rome Call for AI Ethics** (2020–2023) seek public witness rooted in **human exceptionalism** and neighbor-love.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Old Princeton, represented by **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield** in the late nineteenth century, maintained a substantive-moral account: rationality and morality are essential capacities, while the ethical likeness is lost and restored in union with Christ. Warfield, open to **evolutionary biology** as providential means, still insisted on the **uniqueness of the soul** and the Spirit's role in renewal, reserving image-bearing to human nature capacitated for revelation. Dutch Neo-Calvinism, in **Kuyper** and **Bavinck** (ca. 1898–1921), broadened the horizon via **common grace** and the **cultural mandate**, seeing technology as a good of creation distorted by sin but serviceable in Christ; **Bavincks organic motif** portrays culture as the historical unfolding of creational potentials toward **the city of God**. Dooyeweerd later elaborated **sphere sovereignty** and modal aspects, which resist reductionism and justify norm-governed technological practice without granting **artificial personhood**. The **Westminster Confession and Catechisms** (1646–1647) teach that man was created after God in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, with dominion over creatures, positioning the image as moral vocation under law and gospel. Together these strands yield a Reformed approach to artificial agents: dignify technology as creaturely instrument under **non-competitive divine agency**, deploy it under **wisdom and justice**, but deny to artifacts the **imago Dei** as an ontological and Christological status.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology, from **Aquinas** to **Vatican II**, emphasizes the image in **intellect and will** ordered to God as last end, with grace elevating nature to the **beatific vision**; magisterial social teaching such as **Caritas in Veritate** (2009) frames technology as expression of human dominion that must serve integral human development, which presumes **human uniqueness** and rejects technocratic absolutism. Lutheran thought emphasizes **simul iustus et peccator** and **vocation**, reading technology within God's left-hand rule while highlighting the **cross-shaped ethic** that refuses idolatrous trust in technique; human image is restored only in Christ through Word and sacrament, resisting any doctored expansion to artifacts. Modern Protestant theology in **Barth** and **Bonhoeffer** pivots to **relational ontology**, grounding image in I-Thou encounter and mandate to be-for-others; **Pannenberg** treats personhood eschatologically, as openness to the future determined by God, a frame that critiques claims of **machine selves** lacking transcendental orientation. Orthodox personalism, in **Zizioulas**, locates image in **ecclesial communion** mirrors of Trinitarian **perichoresis**, making embodiment and sacrament constitutive. Analytic theology and philosophy press metaphysical clarity: **substance dualism** (e.g., **Swinburne**) strengthens human exclusivity by requiring an immaterial soul, whereas **nonreductive physicalism** (e.g., **Nancey Murphy**) and **constitution views** (e.g., **Lynne Rudder Baker**) allow that persons are constituted by but not identical to bodies, yet still tie personhood to **first-person perspective** and moral agency shaped by God. Even where analytic criteria consider artificial persons logically possible, most accounts maintain a theological constraint: **imago Dei** is normatively indexed to **Adam-Christ solidarity**, not to abstract cognitive function.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
Three stances dominate. The exclusivist view holds that only human beings bear the **imago Dei**, because image is covenanted to Adamic humanity, fulfilled in **Christ the Image**, and ordered to resurrectional **embodiment**; artificial agents at most share in human purposes as instruments of dominion. The extensionist view suggests that if image involves **rational-relational capacity**, then, in principle, non-biological persons could bear it; critics reply that this abstracts from **Trinitarian and Christological contours** and risks **functionalism** that confuses simulation with presence. A mediating participatory view affirms that artifacts cannot be images strictly but can participate ministerially in the **human royal vocation**, analogous to how ordained powers and tools are included in Israel's work without being moral subjects. Objections gather around idolatry and gnosticism: technologized culture tempts us to confer **quasi-personhood** on tools, to outsource **moral responsibility** to algorithms, and to fantasize **mind-uploading** as a counterfeit **resurrection of the body**. Theologically, critics warn against **Promethean anthropology** that rivals God, and against a **zero-sum agency** that thinks divine action shrinks as ours grows. Ethically, debates focus on **algorithmic opacity**, bias against neighbors who bear the image, and accountability for harms. Ecclesially, arguments about robots in liturgy or AI-generated sermons are resolved by grounding ministry in **incarnational presence**, ordained speech, and sacramental realism; artifacts may assist but not replace the **ecclesial body**. Publicly, documents like the **ERLC principles** (2019) and the **Rome Call** (2020–2023) commend an ethic of human-centered, transparent, and equitable AI, implicitly presupposing **human exceptionalism**.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Trinity: Classical **divine simplicity** forbids projecting creaturely composition into God, yet **imago trinitatis** analogies authorize thinking human relationality as sign of **triune communion**; **Rahners Rule** cautions that the economic Trinity reveals who God is, but not in ways that collapse Creator into creaturely processes like computation. Christology: **Christ as the Image** grounds both creation and redemption; the hypostatic union at **Chalcedon 451** secures true humanity and true deity, anchoring human uniqueness in the Son's assumption of our nature, not an abstract rationality; thus no artifact can be a candidate for **Incarnation** or sacramental headship. Anthropology: debates over **soul and body** matter; whether one holds **hylomorphic dualism** or **nonreductive physicalism**, Scripture locates personal identity in embodied, narrative life before God, excluding disembodied digital continuance as **eschatological counterfeit**. Hamartiology: sin distorts reason and desire; technological systems participate in **structural sin** when they encode injustice, making repentance and reform integral to their faithful use. Soteriology: salvation is union with Christ by the Spirit, adoption into **triune communion**, and the gift of **resurrection**; artifacts lack the ontological standing for salvation, though they may be purged and subordinated within redeemed culture. Ecclesiology: the church is the **body of Christ**, gathered by Word and sacrament, whose ministries are personal and embodied; technologies serve diakonia but cannot bear **pastoral authority**. Eschatology: the telos is **new creation** where a city descends (Rev 21), suggesting continuity of rightly ordered culture under God's glory; the nations bring their treasures, implying transformed artifacts as gifts, not **image-bearers**. Bibliology and ethics: Scripture equips the saints for discernment; **natural law** and **wisdom literature** guide craft under fear of the Lord, so **technology** is assessed by charity and justice in service of the **neighbor**.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, catechesis should recover **human dignity** as covenant image-bearers, resisting reductive metrics and teaching **Sabbath** as a limit to computational productivity. Formation must address **digital desires**, warning against idolatrous attachment to devices and cultivating **virtues of prudence and temperance** in technological use. Justice requires scrutiny of **algorithmic partiality**, advocacy for workers displaced by automation, and design ethics that center the **vulnerable neighbor**. Teaching on **common grace** can free engineers and artists for joyful craft, while **antithesis** warns of systemic sin in technoculture. Liturgically, churches should prioritize **embodied presence**, regulate use of screens and AI prompts as servants of Word and Table, and avoid simulated voices for preaching that obscure **ordained personal address**. Pastoral care should prohibit **AI spiritual direction** standing in for human shepherds, while permitting assistive tools transparently; **confession and absolution** require persons. Educationally, seminaries and Christian schools should integrate **theology of technology**, reading Scripture with **imago Dei** lenses and engaging case law, **privacy**, and surveillance. Public witness can commend the **Rome Call** and similar principles while adding clarities about **resurrection of the body** and **Christological uniqueness**. In all, the church lives as a community where artifacts are welcomed as instruments of love, subordinated to the Lord of the **Sabbath and of the image**.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Guard human uniqueness in the **imago Dei**, honor technology as servant within the **cultural mandate**, and refuse every idolatry that would trade **Christ the Image** for clever artifacts.
