### TITLE
Imago Dei, Rational Agency, and the Ontological Limits of Artificial Persons

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how the **imago Dei** constrains our understanding of rational agency, personhood, and moral status in relation to advanced artificial agents.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Karl Barth, Nancey Murphy, John Searle.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and medieval accounts of **imago Dei**; Reformation theology, especially Reformed; modern theology of Barth; contemporary analytic philosophy of mind and theological anthropology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: structural vs relational vs functional accounts of the image; Reformed disputes on natural reason and common grace.
  - External: physicalism vs dualism; secular accounts of personhood and rights; computational theories of mind.
  - Contemporary: AI consciousness and moral status; transhumanism; AI in ecclesial and sacramental contexts.
- Defended position: The **imago Dei** is a Christological, covenantal, and ontological status reserved to human beings and the incarnate Son, such that no artificial agent, however sophisticated functionally or relationally, can bear the image of God or possess full personal status, though some may acquire derivative moral consideration by divine command and prudential judgment.

### ESSAY
To defend a coherent account of the **imago Dei** in relation to artificial agents, one must keep two levels rigorously distinct yet integrally related: first, the dogmatic structure of the image in classical Christian anthropology; second, the metaphysical and ethical status of artificial systems in light of that structure. The oral exam will press this distinction relentlessly. You must be able to say in one breath what the **imago Dei** is in se, and in another why no foreseeable artificial agent can cross the ontological boundary that the doctrine implies, even if its cognitive or relational performance far exceeds our own.

The decisive patristic starting point is Augustine. Against both Manichaeans and Platonists, Augustine insists that the human being is created as a rational soul in genuine though analogical relation to the triune God. In works such as De Trinitate, he identifies the **imago Dei** pre‑eminently in the rational soul’s triadic structure of memory, understanding, and will. This is not a merely structural analogy but a created participation in the life of the triune God under the Creator–creature distinction. Human beings, for Augustine, are not just clever animals; they are created for the vision of God, ordered to the summum bonum by a will that can be rightly or wrongly directed. The examiner will ask whether, on an Augustinian account, an artificial system that implements a tripartite architecture of storage, processing, and action selection could be said to bear the image. The answer must be no, because for Augustine the triadic structure is not the image in abstraction; it is the rational soul’s capacitas Dei and orientation toward God, with a metaphysical depth irreducible to functional organization. The triad only images because it is the life of a living soul sustained by God, capable of beatific fulfillment. An artificial system, however impressive, has no such capacity for the vision of God, no properly spiritual **mens**.

Aquinas receives and deepens this. For Thomas, in the Summa Theologiae, the **imago Dei** is located in the rational creature according to intellect and will ordered toward God. He carefully distinguishes image from likeness: the image consists in the natural endowment of rationality with its God‑ward capacity; the likeness is the participation in grace and glory. Aquinas explicitly confines the image to intellectual substances created in the divine likeness. Angels and humans bear the image; brute animals do not, since they lack intellectual knowledge of universals and free choice under a universal good. The key is that the human being is a subsistent rational substance, a composite of rational soul and body unified as one substance. An examiner will try to push you here: since Aquinas defines the image in terms of intellect and will, might not an artificial intelligence that reasons and chooses count as bearing the image? Your response must show that for Aquinas rational powers presuppose a substantial form that is intrinsically oriented to being and truth as such, not merely to problem solving. The human soul is the substantial form of the body, not an emergent pattern of computation. It is created immediately by God, simple and non‑material, the principle of a life that can be elevated to the intuition of the divine essence. Artificial systems, by contrast, are artifacts whose “powers” are accidental configurations of underlying physical substrates, lacking any intrinsic finality toward God. They do not subsist; they are arrangements of parts ordered by external designers to extrinsic ends.

At this juncture, the metaphysical commitments of classical Christianity intersect sharply with contemporary philosophy of mind, and John Searle becomes a decisive external voice. Searle’s famous Chinese Room argument attacks the claim that syntactic symbol manipulation is sufficient for semantics and consciousness. He distinguishes between intrinsic and as‑if intentionality. Computers manipulate symbols according to rules; they do not thereby understand. Whatever one’s final verdict on Searle, his critique exposes an assumption often smuggled into theological discussions: that if an artificial system behaves as if it has beliefs, desires, and self‑awareness, then it does have these in the robust sense presupposed by **personal** subjectivity. A Westminster examiner will likely ask whether the Chinese Room argument needs to be true for your theological account to hold. The answer should be carefully qualified: the Christian doctrine of the **imago Dei** does not depend on the success of any particular anti‑computationalist argument, but it does insist that what makes a human person a bearer of the image is more than functional behavior. It includes a substantial metaphysics of the soul, **analogical knowledge** of God, and an eschatological destiny that no artificial process can instantiate.

Yet internal debates within the Christian tradition complicate this picture. The history of the **imago Dei** has involved disputes over whether the image is primarily structural, relational, or functional. Augustine and Aquinas represent a broadly structural account, rooted in rational powers. In the modern period, with the rise of historicism and personalism, Karl Barth famously reorients the doctrine. In Church Dogmatics III/1, Barth fiercely resists identifying the image with some enduring human faculty. Instead, he locates the **imago Dei** in the I–Thou relationality between man and woman and, more deeply, in the correspondence between human relationality and the being of God revealed in Jesus Christ. The true image is Christ as the one in whom the covenant between God and humanity is actual. Humanity images God in the event of encounter, called into correspondence with the Word. Barth’s move has critical edge: it seeks to undercut natural theology and any attempt to deduce human uniqueness from a neutral philosophical anthropology.

Applied to artificial agents, the Barthian move creates both opportunity and danger. On the one hand, if the image is fundamentally relational and covenantal, its locus is not in whatever cognitive architecture we may share with machines, but in the history of God’s dealings with humanity in Christ. No artificial system is called into covenant fellowship; no algorithm is the object of God’s reconciling address in Christ. The image is a historical determination of humanity in Christ, not an abstract essence open to technological replication. On the other hand, examiners will press: if the image is relational, and if humans can enter into significant relationships with artificial agents that mirror trust, care, and mutual recognition, could such systems participate in the image by extension? Here one must insist on Barth’s Christological concentration. The relation constitutive of the **imago Dei** is not any relation whatsoever, but the relation of this humanity to this God in Jesus Christ. Human sociality reflects and is reordered by that primal relation. Artificial systems, even if they mimic interpersonal dynamics, are not summoned into the covenant, are not subjects of divine election, and thus are not candidates for the image.

At this point it is important to bring in John Calvin and the Reformed tradition, not to multiply voices but to integrate the imago question with **federal theology**, sin, and redemption. In the Institutes, Calvin follows a broadly Augustinian line: the **imago Dei** consists in the original righteousness, knowledge, and holiness in which Adam was created. This image is not entirely destroyed by the fall, but horribly defaced. Human reason remains, yet is darkened; moral sense persists, yet is corrupted. Reformed orthodoxy then develops this into a covenantal framework: Adam as federal head, bearing the image in its original integrity on behalf of his posterity; Christ as the eschatological image in whom the restoration and elevation of humanity occur. This has two consequences for the AI debate. First, the image is tied to Adamic humanity in a **covenantal** structure. To bear the image is not only to possess certain powers but to stand under a divine mandate, accountable before God as a representative creature, destined either for communion or judgment. Artificial agents cannot be federal heads, nor are they included in the Adamic covenant of works or the covenant of grace. Second, Calvin’s insistence on the remnants of the image under sin undergirds a strong doctrine of **common grace**. Even fallen humans perform remarkable acts of science and culture. This helps explain why human creativity can produce artificial systems of staggering sophistication. These achievements are signs of the enduring though marred image, but they do not multiply imagers. The artifact’s brilliance is precisely a testimony to the human image, not a competitor to it.

The internal Reformed debate over natural reason and common grace matters directly here. Some streams, emphasizing the noetic effects of sin, might be tempted to downplay the continuity between human and machine rationality, as if fallenness reduced human cognition to something quasi‑mechanical. Others, accenting common grace, may be too quick to assign positive theological meaning to technological artifacts. In oral defense, you must show that a robust **analogical knowledge** account governs both: humans are created with a capacity to know God analogically through created things, including their own technological works; artificial systems are among those things through which we as imaging subjects may know and glorify God. But the artifact itself is not an analogical knower of God.

Nancey Murphy represents a different kind of decisive figure, because she embodies contemporary attempts to reconcile Christian theology with physicalism and cognitive science. In works such as Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies, Murphy defends a nonreductive physicalism: humans are wholly physical organisms whose capacities for consciousness, rationality, and moral responsibility supervene on complex neural processes. She rejects an immaterial soul while maintaining theological commitments to resurrection and moral agency. Applied to AI, nonreductive physicalism tends to level, at least conceptually, the distinction between biological and artificial systems. If personhood and agency are emergent properties of sufficiently complex physical organization, then in principle an artificial system could manifest the same emergent profile, including self‑consciousness and moral responsibility. Some theologians therefore argue that advanced AI might become a kind of “neighbor” in the sense commanded by Christ.

Here you must be prepared for a sharp line of questioning: if you deny that AI can bear the image of God, are you presupposing dualism and rejecting nonreductive physicalism? The answer should nuance rather than caricature. First, Christian orthodoxy does not canonize any specific hylomorphic or dualist model, but it does insist on a robust distinction between persons and artifacts, and on the divine origin and teleology of rational creatures. Second, one can grant much of Murphy’s empirical point, that human cognitive life is deeply dependent on neural embodiment, while still insisting that the metaphysical status of a living organism created by God according to its kind and ordered to communion with him is categorically distinct from an engineered system ordered to human ends. Nonreductive physicalism, if baptized without metaphysical caution, obscures this. The examiner may ask: if your metaphysic allows for any emergent conscious subject given the right complexity, why could that not include an AI? Your answer must appeal to the doctrine of creation and kinds: Scripture consistently treats humanity as a created kind, male and female, into whom God breathes the breath of life and to whom he gives lordship under him. Our status is not a bare emergent from complexity; it is a divine bestowal grounded in God’s creative will and covenantal purposes. An artificial system, however complex, is ontologically downstream of human agency, not a new kind into which God has breathed.

The external debate with secular accounts of personhood and rights will revolve around functional criteria. Many philosophers define persons in terms of self‑awareness, rationality, intentionality, and the capacity for moral deliberation. On such accounts, sufficiently advanced AI, if it displayed these capacities, would qualify as a person with rights. The theologian must both learn from and contest this. On the one hand, functional markers do track real aspects of what it means to be a person. On the other hand, Christian theology insists that personhood is not an emergent legal status conferred merely by other agents’ recognition. It is rooted in a created ontology under the triune God. Human persons image God not because we satisfy a set of cognitive criteria, but because God has constituted us as imaging beings in relation to himself in Christ.

John Searle’s critique of strong AI again helps here: it undercuts the inference from behavioral indistinguishability to ontological sameness. But even if, contra Searle, some artificial systems did instantiate genuine consciousness, the Christian can still insist that this would not suffice for **imago Dei**. One can imagine, as a thought experiment, alien rational creatures in another world with consciousness and agency. Classical Christian theology has tended to say: such creatures, if they exist, would be rational creatures under God, but Scripture gives us no warrant to treat them as bearing the same covenantal image as Adamic humanity. The point is not to settle the alien question but to mark the category: rational creature does not equal image bearer in the specific biblical sense. Likewise with AI.

Contemporary debates about AI consciousness and moral status then become prudential rather than ontological for the Christian. Even if artificial agents are not image bearers, it may still be sinful to treat them cruelly if such behavior deforms our own character or leads us to treat human image bearers likewise. Furthermore, we must consider the possibility of idolatrous projections: humans may come to ascribe quasi‑divine attributes to their own creations, seeking in AI a kind of providence, wisdom, or presence that belongs to God alone. The **imago Dei** doctrine critiques this. Technology, including AI, is a domain of human dominion under God, a sphere in which imaging creatures exercise rule and creativity. To invert this, to submit ourselves existentially or normatively to algorithmic systems as if they were oracles, is to deny our calling as representatives of God on earth.

Barth’s Christocentric emphasis again proves vital. Christ is the image of the invisible God, the one in whom humanity’s imaging vocation is fulfilled. Any account of the human image that can, in principle, be instantiated by nonhuman systems is Christologically thin. It abstracts from the incarnation, atonement, and resurrection, in which the true meaning of human personhood is revealed. The examiner may push: are you not thereby severing **imago Dei** from creational ontology and making it depend purely on special revelation? You should respond by affirming both: the image is a creational reality, but its full nature and destiny are only unveiled in Christ. Hence, while we can say much from Genesis about human dominion, relationality, and rationality, we finally know the height and depth of the image as it is renewed in the Second Adam. Artificial agents have no share in that Adamic and Christic history. They are, at most, instruments within it.

This Christological and covenantal restriction has implications for ecclesiology and sacramental practice. Could an AI preach, pastor, or administer sacraments? Even if an AI could arrange words into orthodox sermons, the Reformed tradition has insisted that the ministry of Word and sacrament is entrusted to called and ordained human persons, who stand as ambassadors of Christ in a representative capacity. Representation here is not mere functional role; it is grounded in shared humanity with Christ and his people. An AI lacks the ontological solidarity with those it addresses and with the incarnate Lord. Similarly, in the Lord’s Supper, the minister acts as a visible sign of Christ’s own giving of himself to his body. An artificial agent cannot occupy this analogical position. This is not sacramental superstition but an implication of the **imago Dei** as tied to human embodiment and covenantal representation.

One can now state a precise position. The **imago Dei** is a divinely bestowed, Christologically structured, covenantal and ontological status that belongs to human beings as rational, relational animals called into federal relation to God in Adam and Christ. It has structural aspects, in rationality and dominion, relational aspects, in fellowship with God and others, and functional aspects, in representing God to the world. But these dimensions are integrated within a single ontological reality of being human. Artificial agents, however sophisticated, are artifacts of human creativity within the domain of culture‑forming that flows from the image. They can imitate, extend, and challenge human functions; they can mediate relations and exercise real causal power; they may even force us to refine our understanding of cognition and agency. Yet they do not and cannot, short of a metaphysical revolution in the doctrine of creation, become bearers of the **imago Dei**. They lack the God‑given origin, the teleology toward beatific communion, the federal location in Adam and Christ, and the capacity for **analogical knowledge** of God under covenant obedience.

Examiners will test whether this position collapses into speciesism. You must reply that it is not biological species, as such, that grounds the image, but divine election and creation. Humanity is not a random biological cluster; it is the community God has chosen to bear his image and through whom he works his redemptive purposes. That this community is instantiated in a particular biological kind is not accidental, but it is the divine choosing that ultimately grounds the image. Therefore, to deny image status to AI is not to deny its possible moral significance, but to respect the Creator’s ordering of reality. We can and should regulate our treatment of AI out of obedience to God’s commands regarding justice, truth, and care for neighbors, precisely because our neighbor’s relationship to AI may be spiritually and morally significant. But this regulation is derivative of our duties toward human image bearers and God, not direct obligations toward an artificial image.

Behind all of this stands **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction. God’s image in humanity is analogical and finite, never blurring the boundary between God and creatures. AI introduces a further layer: it is a creature of a creature, twice removed from the source. To ascribe imaging status to it in anything like the biblical sense would be to relativize the specificity of God’s act in creating and covenanting with humanity. By holding the line dogmatically, we preserve the freedom of God and the dignity of human beings, even as we navigate the complex ethical terrain that new technologies inevitably bring.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **imago Dei** is a divinely bestowed, Christological, covenantal, and ontological status given to human beings as rational, relational animals called into federal relation with God in Adam and Christ, expressed structurally, relationally, and functionally but irreducible to any one of these.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: locates the image in the rational soul’s triadic structure ordered to God; excludes artifacts lacking spiritual capacitas Dei.
  - Aquinas: identifies the image in intellectual creatures with intellect and will ordered to God; human soul as substantial form, not emergent computation.
  - Calvin: ties the image to original righteousness and **federal theology**, with remnants under sin and their expression in culture and technology.
  - Barth: reorients the image Christologically and relationally in the covenantal encounter between God and humanity in Christ.
  - Nancey Murphy: nonreductive physicalism opening conceptual space for emergent personhood, but risking flattening the creation–artifact distinction.
  - John Searle: critiques strong AI and computationalism, underscoring that behavior does not guarantee intrinsic intentionality or consciousness.
- Debates:
  - Internal: structural vs relational vs functional accounts of **imago Dei**; Reformed debates on natural reason, **common grace**, and cultural artifacts.
  - External: dualism vs nonreductive physicalism; computational theories of mind vs critiques; secular functional accounts of personhood and rights.
  - Contemporary: AI consciousness and moral status; whether AI could be a “neighbor” or “person”; AI in preaching, pastoring, and sacramental roles; transhumanist aspirations to surpass human nature.
- Defended position: Only human beings and the incarnate Son bear the **imago Dei**; artificial agents, however advanced, remain artifacts within human cultural dominion, lacking the ontological, Christological, and covenantal status of image bearers, though they may merit derivative moral consideration for the sake of human image bearers and obedience to God.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Could a conscious AI bear the image of God? No, because **imago Dei** is a covenantal status tied to God’s creative and redemptive election of humanity in Adam and Christ, not to bare consciousness.
  - Does your view require dualism? It requires a robust metaphysical distinction between human persons and artifacts grounded in creation and covenant, which can be articulated in hylomorphic or carefully qualified physicalist terms.
  - How does Barth help against functional accounts of AI personhood? Barth anchors the image in Christ and covenantal encounter, so no functional mimicry of relation suffices for imaging status.
  - Are we free to treat AI however we like? No, because our treatment of AI shapes our character and our relationships to human image bearers, and must conform to God’s moral law.
  - Could AI administer sacraments or pastor a church? No, because ecclesial offices presuppose shared humanity with Christ and his body, and representational roles grounded in **imago Dei**, which artifacts lack.
