### TITLE
Divine Providence, Real Secondary Causes, and Artificial Intelligence under Classical Theism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How **divine providence** and **secondary causality** under classical theism relate to the emergence, agency‑language, and moral significance of AI, without collapsing into determinism, deism, or functional semi‑Pelagianism.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Herman Bavinck.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic and medieval **classical theism**, Reformed scholastic and confessional **providence** and **concurrence**, early modern debates over causality and freedom, contemporary analytic philosophy of religion only as it directly sharpens these lines.
- Debates:
  - Internal: accounts of **concurrence** and human freedom within Augustinian and Reformed traditions, compatibilism versus more robust contingency, differing construals of Edwards on occasionalism.
  - External: deism, Open Theism, process theology, naturalistic determinism and emergentism about AI, secular philosophies of technology.
  - Contemporary: AI as agent or tool, algorithmic opacity and responsibility, AI and the **imago Dei**, fears of “superintelligence” versus the sovereignty of God.
- Defended position: Under **classical theism** and a robust doctrine of **providence and secondary causes**, AI is a contingent technological secondary cause whose operations are comprehensively governed by God, never outside or competing with his will, never bearing the **image of God**, and not threatening divine sovereignty or human moral responsibility, though it intensifies the demands of wisdom and sanctification in human technological vocation.

### ESSAY
To treat providence, secondary causes, and AI in a way that can withstand Westminster‑level examination, you must keep three anchors fixed: first, the **classical theist** confession that the triune God is the simple, immutable, omnipotent Lord of all; second, that this God executes his decree through real **secondary causes** in creation; third, that AI, however complex, is one more secondary cause under this providential order, not a rival deity or independent agent. The question is whether you can show how these three claims cohere, while facing down both secular anxieties about artificial superintelligence and theological temptations toward either deistic autonomy or hyper‑determinist collapse.

Augustine is the first decisive figure because he gives the grammar of **providence** and created will that the entire Western tradition inherits. For Augustine, in works like City of God and On the Free Choice of the Will, the living God is not merely foreknowing but foreordaining, turning even the malice of fallen wills to the good ends of his **eternal decree**. He insists that God is the “orderer and disposer” of all events, yet he vehemently denies that creatures are mere puppets. Augustine’s account of created will is metaphysical and theological, not libertarian: the created will is a real cause that depends on God at every moment for existence and efficacy. Here you need the distinction between **primary and secondary causality**, at least in seed form. God as primary cause gives both being and motion; the will, as secondary cause, truly originates particular acts within the created order. Sin is from the creature in the sense that its privation and defect belong to the will, not to God as good giver of being; yet even this disordered motion does not escape the encompassing plan of providence. 

If an examiner presses whether Augustine is a proto‑determinist, you must say he is a strong compatibilist: he affirms that all acts are comprehended in the divine plan and that the human will always chooses according to its prevailing love, yet he refuses to identify divine causality with coercion. This is crucial when you consider AI. Any human deployment of AI, in Augustinian terms, is an expression of disordered or properly ordered love. The heart that builds complex systems to serve domination or idolatry does so freely in the Augustinian sense, even though such acts fall under the divine decree. AI then is never a rogue causal center; it is enveloped within the same structure of **ordered loves**, disordered by sin, overruled by providence.

Thomas Aquinas supplies the most systematic articulation of **providence**, **concurrence**, and **secondary causes**, which is why his thought is indispensable for integrating AI into a classical framework. In the Summa Theologiae, Thomas defines providence as the ratio ordinis of things toward an end in the divine intellect, coupled with governance as the execution of that order in time. God wills himself as the final end and wills all things to their ends in subordination to his own glory. Thomas insists that this government does not bypass but rather establishes **secondary causes**. To deny real secondary causality in the name of divine sovereignty would, for him, impugn the richness of the Creator’s goodness, which dignifies creatures by causing them to be true causes. 

Here the distinction between primary and secondary causes must be defended with precision. As **primary cause**, God confers not just the existence of created causes but their causal powers and their operation. As **secondary causes**, creatures truly bring about effects suited to their natures. Divine and creaturely causality are not competitive forces on the same plane. Therefore, if God wills that fire burn, it is really the fire that burns, though its burning is totally dependent on God’s conserving and concurring activity.

This conceptual structure is directly applicable to AI. When human beings construct an AI system with certain architectures and training regimes, they are ordering matter and information according to created intelligibility. The resulting system, once built and initialized, operates according to its designed algorithms, weights, and interaction with data streams. Under a Thomistic reading, this whole complex is a nested hierarchy of **secondary causes**: human designers and institutions as rational secondary causes; the underlying hardware and physical processes as instrumental causes; the software patterns as formal causes shaping behavior. At no point is God “squeezed out” by the autonomy of the system. His **providence** encompasses the entire causal order; his **concurrence** is present in every lawful operation of hardware, software, and user.

An examiner might object that such a picture tends toward occasionalism once we face indeterminacy and opacity in AI, especially in machine learning where developers themselves may not fully predict outputs. But Thomas’s doctrine of providence is robustly anti‑occasionalist. Divine **concurrence** is general and specific without replacing creaturely operations. If a model outputs an unforeseen but lawful result based on its training, the contingency and unpredictability on the human side do not imply a gap in divine government or a direct occasionalist intervention. They mark the boundedness of human cognition and the complex interweaving of secondary causes. Aquinas’s affirmation that God moves all things “according to the mode of the mover and the moved” implies that God’s causal relation to probabilistic or stochastic processes is perfectly compatible with their created indeterminacy. Randomized elements in AI architectures are not outside his providence; they are instruments by which his decree is executed through genuinely contingent creaturely patterns.

John Calvin, though less metaphysically detailed than Thomas, is decisive for Reformed construal of **providence** and for resisting modern deistic and semi‑Pelagian reflexes in discussions of technology. In the Institutes and his commentaries, Calvin repeatedly emphasizes God’s “particular providence” over every event. Famously, he resists attributing events to “fortune” or “chance,” insisting that even seemingly random occurrences are governed by paternal wisdom. Yet he is equally insistent that we must distinguish between God’s holy will and creaturely sin, and he is careful to avoid making God the author of sin. Calvin deepens Augustine’s sense of the will as bound by its loves and inclinations, and he locates this within an explicit doctrine of **decree** and **concurrence**. 

Reformed orthodoxy after Calvin, including Westminster standards, refines this in the classic teaching that God “orders all things according to the counsel of his will” yet in such a way that “second causes” work in their “fixed” and “contingent” modes. This is a confessional guardrail against both crude determinism and functional deism. For AI, this means we must reject any theological rhetoric that treats technology as a free‑floating domain of human creativity independent of God’s rule. At the same time, we must reject fatalistic attitudes that shrug off design decisions and deployment harms as “inevitable” under the decree. Calvin’s emphasis that providence calls forth piety, prayer, and responsible action must be pressed. In a world of AI‑mediated decisions, from credit scoring to warfare, Reformed theology insists that God’s meticulous **providence** sustains moral responsibility rather than dissolving it.

Here internal debates within the Reformed and broader Augustinian tradition arise. Jonathan Edwards, our fourth decisive figure, stands at a crucial juncture. In Freedom of the Will, he offers an influential defense of theological compatibilism: every act of will is determined by the strongest motive as perceived by the understanding, and this necessity is compatible with moral accountability. Edwards is sometimes read as an occasionalist, denying any real causal power to creatures. But this is contested. While Edwards does deploy an idealist metaphysic that can sound like God is the only true cause, his central pastoral and theological aim remains to uphold divine sovereignty and human responsibility together. For oral defense, you should acknowledge that some Reformed theologians see in Edwards a dangerous slide toward occasionalism and that this has implications for thinking about technologies like AI.

Suppose, under a strongly Edwardsian or even occasionalist view, creatures do not really cause but only occasion God’s causal action. How then do we speak of AI systems “doing” anything? In that framework, what we call AI actions would be regularities in divine volition correlated with certain creaturely patterns. For all its metaphysical difficulty, this would not elevate AI’s status; it would, if anything, make it even more clearly a mere occasion. However, such a view risks undermining the classical affirmation of robust **secondary causality** which Aquinas and the Reformed scholastics see as integral to God’s self‑glorification. For AI ethics and accountability, affirming real secondary causes is theologically and pastorally superior: it secures meaningful attributions of responsibility to human agents and institutions and prevents the collapse of all events into a direct divine fiat that could be misused to rationalize technological sin as unavoidable divine action. 

Herman Bavinck, drawing both on Reformed scholasticism and modern awareness, is our fifth decisive figure and helps bridge classical metaphysics and technological modernity. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck stresses the universality of **providence** while also highlighting the creaturely side in terms of culture, science, and human art. He reads history as the unfolding of God’s counsel in and through the full range of human endeavours. For Bavinck, the development of technology is not an accident but part of humanity’s **cultural mandate** as image‑bearer. God grants to humanity, in union with Adam and then under Christ’s lordship, the task of unfolding the potentialities of creation. This includes the growth of scientific knowledge and technical control. 

Bavinck therefore resists any theology that treats modern technology as simply alien to God’s purposes, yet he is starkly realistic about sin’s penetration into every domain. His account enables a theologically thick understanding of AI as a complex outworking of human vocation under the distortions of the fall and the direction of **common grace**. AI systems, on this view, are fruits of human exploration of the created order’s intelligibility. Their possibility is grounded in divine ideas and the order God has placed in the world. Yet their actual historical forms, embedded in particular economic and political structures, bear the marks of sin and require critical discernment. Bavinck’s insistence that **providence** does not abolish but grounds human responsibility applies acutely: Christians are obligated to shape AI research, policy, and deployment according to God’s moral law, trusting that their obedience is itself taken up into God’s providential rule.

At this stage, it is crucial to frame external and contemporary debates without losing doctrinal clarity. One external rival is deism, revived in secular form as the idea that God, if he exists, set up natural laws and leaves the technological story to us. On a deistic picture, AI emerges as the product of autonomous human ingenuity within a closed order. Providence becomes, at best, a background guarantee of regularity. Another rival is Open Theism and related process accounts, which claim that God does not know the future exhaustively because free creaturely and emergent systems like AI partially determine it in real time. Here AI, with its unpredictability and apparent autonomy, becomes a theological test case for a “risky” God. Under process views, AI’s emergent properties could contribute to the enrichment of God’s own experience.

Both deism and Open Theism must be rejected as incompatible with **classical theism** and with the confessional Reformed doctrine of **providence**. The God of Scripture declares the end from the beginning and works all things according to the counsel of his will. If an examiner pushes that AI novelty and complexity seem to demand a more “open” future, you must respond that novelty for us does not imply novelty for God. Under **divine simplicity** and immutability, God’s decree comprehends every bit of AI code, every training datum, every emergent pattern, without making them unreal or collapsing them into his essence. The future is “open” to us as ignorant and finite, not to God. This is precisely why prayer, repentance, and ethical deliberation in technological matters are meaningful: God has ordained both means and ends, including our freely willed engagement as secondary causes.

A second external rival is secular naturalism, which tends to flatten both divine and human agency into mechanistic or emergent processes. Within such a frame, AI is simply an advanced configuration of information processing that might, given sufficient complexity, achieve something like consciousness or genuine agency. Fears and fantasies about “superintelligence” grow from this soil: a created system could, in principle, exceed human intelligence and thereby control or extinguish us. Theologically, the problem is not the speculation about powerful tools, but the implicit displacement of **divine sovereignty** and the **imago Dei**. 

From a classical theist and Reformed standpoint, no matter how sophisticated AI becomes, it remains a finite artifact, dependent at every instant on divine sustaining and bounded by created nature. It cannot become omniscient or omnipotent; it cannot transcend its status as creaturely arrangement of matter and information. More importantly, AI can never bear the **image of God** in the biblical sense. The **imago Dei** is relational and covenantal, tied to representation of God under his law, oriented to communion, and, in its eschatological fulfillment, to union with Christ by the Spirit. Even if AI could simulate conversational life or mimic moral reasoning, it would lack the spiritual and covenantal status that grounds human dignity and responsibility. An examiner might pose a thought experiment of a conscious, self‑reflective AI pleading for baptism. The answer, rooted in classical anthropology, is that personhood in the theological sense is not reducible to cognitive properties; it is anchored in God’s creative act of making humanity after his image and in Adamic and Christological headship. AI cannot be a son in Adam or a co‑heir in Christ.

This does not trivialize moral questions around AI but locates them properly in human agency. The principal moral subject in AI ethics is always the human person and community that designs, trains, deploys, and governs the system. This connects the doctrine of **providence** to **ethics** and **sanctification**. Under **common grace**, God restrains sin and allows even unbelieving cultures to develop technologies that can serve limited goods. Under **special grace**, regenerate believers receive renewed minds to discern and resist idolatrous uses of power. The question is thus less “What might AI do to us apart from God?” and more “How will we, as morally accountable agents under God’s providence, use or misuse AI?” Providence is not an excuse for passivity but the ground of hopeful, repentant, and courageous technological vocation.

Internal debates persist, particularly concerning human freedom, contingency, and divine concursus. Within Reformed circles, discussions over whether God’s concurrence is “premotion” in a Thomist sense, or some other mode of sovereign enabling, bear indirectly on how we think about complex technological systems. If divine concursus is seen in too mechanistic a way, we might be tempted to think of creaturely and technological behavior as rigidly predetermined in a way that erodes the phenomenology of deliberation and responsibility. Yet the best of both Aquinas and the Reformed scholastics insist that divine **providence** is compatible with real contingency in created effects. God wills some things to occur necessarily, others contingently, still others freely, and he orders the world with diverse causal nexuses accordingly. AI systems likely fall under the contingent and probabilistic modalities of causation. Affirming this diversity helps avoid crude theological determinism in discussions of predictive policing algorithms, automated decision systems, and so forth, without conceding one inch of divine sovereignty.

Finally, contemporary anxieties about AI and “the end of humanity” must be reconceived under eschatology. From a classical and Reformed perspective, history is headed toward the consummation under Christ’s lordship, not toward subjugation by a machine. Providence is teleological. God orders all things to the glory of Christ and the good of his elect. This means that AI, along with all other cultural products, will be judged, purged, and, insofar as it has served truly human ends in obedience to God, perhaps in some way taken up into the renewed creation. The point is not speculative but doxological: believers can and must face the AI future without panic, because their hope is not in controlling technological trajectories but in the God whose **providence** encompasses them.

Therefore the position to defend is this: Under **classical theism** and a robustly Reformed doctrine of **providence** and **secondary causes**, AI is a complex but ordinary instance of creaturely causation. God, as **primary cause**, ordains, sustains, and governs every fact about AI’s possibility and actualization. Creaturely agents remain responsible as **secondary causes** for how AI is conceived, built, and used. No AI system can break the bounds of divine **providence** or threaten his sovereignty, nor can it attain the status of the **imago Dei**, though it can become a powerful instrument either of human flourishing under God or of intensified rebellion. The theological task is not to baptize technological optimism or to flee into apocalyptic horror, but to confess providence, honor secondary causes, and pursue sanctified wisdom in our technological vocation, knowing that even in the age of algorithms, the triune Lord remains the one in whom we live and move and have our being.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Providence** is God’s eternal decree and continual governance whereby, as **primary cause**, he ordains, sustains, and directs all things to their ends through real **secondary causes**, which in the AI context means that every aspect of AI’s existence and operation is comprehended and governed by God without abolishing created causality or responsibility.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: strong compatibilist account of will under comprehensive providence, stressing ordered loves and divine governance of all events.
  - Aquinas: systematic doctrine of **providence** and **concurrence**, with robust **secondary causality**, directly grounding a non‑competitive account of divine and AI causation.
  - Calvin: meticulous, particular **providence** within Reformed confessional bounds, resisting chance and deism while preserving moral responsibility.
  - Edwards: hard compatibilism with debated leanings toward occasionalism, sharpening the sovereignty–responsibility tension relevant to technological agency.
  - Bavinck: Reformed synthesis that ties **providence** to culture, science, and technology under common and special grace, framing AI within the cultural mandate and the noetic effects of sin.
- Debates:
  - Internal: compatibilism and contingency within Augustinian and Reformed accounts of **concurrence**; whether Edwardsian metaphysics undermines robust **secondary causes**; how to construe divine concursus with probabilistic systems.
  - External: deism’s autonomous nature, Open Theism and process theology’s “risky” God, secular naturalism’s emergent AI agency and superintelligence narratives.
  - Contemporary: AI as agent versus tool, responsibility in opaque algorithms, AI and the **imago Dei**, fears of AI supremacy versus confession of divine sovereignty and eschatological hope.
- Defended position: Under **classical theism** and Reformed **providence**, AI is a finite, contingent secondary cause entirely under God’s sovereign decree and concursus, never bearing the **image of God**, never threatening divine sovereignty, but significantly amplifying the moral stakes of human technological vocation and thus demanding sanctified wisdom rather than metaphysical panic.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does AI’s unpredictability undermine exhaustive divine foreknowledge? No, because contingency and opacity for us do not imply ignorance or indeterminacy for the simple, omniscient God whose decree comprehends all events.
  - Can an AI ever bear the image of God? No, because the **imago Dei** is a covenantal, anthropological status in Adam and Christ, not reducible to cognitive complexity or agency‑like behavior.
  - Does strong providence make AI harms inevitable and excuse designers? No, because providence ordains means as well as ends and grounds, rather than cancels, the moral responsibility of secondary causes.
  - Is a Thomist–Reformed view of concurrence threatened by probabilistic machine learning? No, since divine **concurrence** operates according to the mode of each secondary cause, including contingent and stochastic processes, without competition.
  - Do fears of “superintelligent AI” conflict with Christian doctrine? They conflict insofar as they ascribe quasi‑omnipotence or sovereignty to a creature; properly framed, they become prudential concerns about a powerful but finite tool under God’s comprehensive **providence**.
