### TITLE
Between Enframing and Sabbath: Ordering Technological Power under Creaturely Limits

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: Whether and how modern technological power, which tends to expand human agency and dissolve constraints, can be ordered under God-given **creaturely finitude** so that dominion does not become domination.
- Decisive figures: Martin Heidegger, Jacques Ellul, Hans Jonas, Egbert Schuurman, Albert Borgmann.
- Traditions: philosophy of technology and phenomenology, Christian Reformational theology of culture, ethics of responsibility and virtue-oriented design.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: instrumentality versus substantivism versus social constructivism; Kuyperian transformationalism versus Ellulian skepticism; neutrality of tools versus value-ladenness.
  - External: transhumanism and secular progress myths, utilitarian techno-optimism, market libertarianism and technocracy.
  - Contemporary: AI alignment, surveillance and platform power, bioengineering and enhancement, geoengineering and climate-scale interventions.
- Position: Technology is a creational possibility and civilizational calling under the **dominion mandate**, but must be normed by gifted limits, **Sabbath**, and love of neighbor; reject **technological determinism** and Promethean hubris; commend prudential, institutional, and liturgical constraints that re-center **moral agency**, focal practices, and long-horizon **responsibility**.

### ESSAY
Technological power and human limits name a single moral knot rather than two adjacent themes. Technology is not merely a collection of tools but a cultural pattern of rationalization that promises reliable outcomes across domains through repeatable procedures. Human limits are not merely deficits to be overcome but the theological and creaturely conditions of agency, including temporality, embodiment, dependency, ignorance, and mortality. The modern project tends to treat technological power as permission to redraw, suspend, or abolish limits. The theological task is to order power under received limits so that dominion remains service, not seizure, and so that the gifts of finitude become the grammar of wise action. The core thesis defended here is that technology is structurally good as a mode of human **technē** within creation yet directionally perilous under sin, and so it must be constrained and ordered by norms that express our **imago Dei** vocation under **providence**, namely **creaturely finitude**, **Sabbath**, and love of neighbor, institutionalized through prudential design, law, and liturgy. This agenda rejects both **technological determinism** and naïve instrumentality and situates the question within a theologically thick account of ends.

Two figures set the philosophical coordinates of the problem. Martin Heidegger, writing in the aftermath of industrial war and the spread of electrification and mass production, argued that the essence of modern technology is not technological. In The Question Concerning Technology he calls this essence enframing, a comprehensive style of revealing that discloses beings as standing-reserve. The hydroelectric plant on the Rhine reduces the river to a resource to be ordered and stored. Enframing is a metaphysical disposition of the human toward the real, a way of seeking certainty by rendering the world calculable. The danger is the reduction of truth to availability and of beings to inventory. Heidegger’s critique pierces the illusion that technology is simply neutral means. It also discloses a temptation in the soul: the will to secure being by control. For Christian theology, this analysis is diagnostically powerful. The biblical polemic against idolatry often concerns precisely this exchange, when the living God is replaced by the manipulable. Heidegger’s diagnosis, however, assigns the drama to the history of being rather than sin and providence and cannot finally specify morally binding limits. He evokes a saving possibility in poetry and dwelling, but he does not command the will.

Ellul deepens the critique at the social scale. A French Protestant jurist and sociologist, he gave a name to the civilization-wide pattern in The Technological Society. Technique for Ellul is the ensemble of means and the search for the one best way. It expands through automatism, universalism, and self-augmentation. He argued that once technique becomes autonomous and self-accelerating, politics becomes a ritual that masks the real sovereignty of procedure, propaganda becomes the chief tool for harmonizing humans to machines, and freedom is redefined as access to efficient options. Ellul’s theological writings connect this to Babel and the idol of the city, warning that technique promises salvation while veiling its absoluteness. The power of Ellul’s analysis lies in naming the totalizing drift and the way small, benign optimizations aggregate into civilizational dependence. The weakness lies in the charge of determinism. Does technique leave room for resistance, reform, or faithful design The determinist tone sometimes blurs the distinctions necessary for prudential governance. To use a distinction from the Reformational tradition, Ellul confuses structural features of technical mediation with directional capture by disordered loves. Still, in a world of platforms whose network effects are self-reinforcing and whose scale eludes local correction, Ellul’s language of autonomy is not mere rhetoric; it names macro-level feedback loops that must be broken by countervailing institutions rather than by private virtue alone.

Between these two critiques, Hans Jonas supplies an ethic that answers the expanded radius of action. In The Imperative of Responsibility he insists that modern technology extends human action so far into future generations and across ecosystems that traditional ethics is insufficient. The principle that one ought to act so that the effects of one’s action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life reframes duty around vulnerability and futurity. Jonas commends a heuristics of fear, not as nihilism but as the rational sentiment that scans for catastrophe when stakes are civilizational. His ethic is deeply resonant with a Christian understanding of stewardship and accountability before a sovereign Lord whose **providence** encompasses the generations we cannot see. It guards against casual experimentation when the substrate at risk is the biotic possibility of humanity itself. Yet fear cannot be the last word; hope and courage must animate the disciplines of governance that Jonas calls for. A Christian reception of Jonas converts fear into **prudence** under faith, ordering response not by paralysis but by the due reverence for the fragile.

Two further voices help specify constructive direction. Albert Borgmann argues in Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life that modern devices disburden and commodify by creating availability without engagement. The device paradigm replaces focal practices with effortless consumption. Music becomes ubiquitous background instead of the focused practice of playing or listening; warmth is delivered by a thermostat rather than by gathering wood and tending the hearth. Borgmann is not nostalgic for toil; he is attentive to the way certain practices command our full presence and draw us into communities of discipline and delight. In Christian terms, this resonates with **Sabbath** and liturgy. The point is not to renounce devices but to design and choose in ways that protect focal practices. Churches and households can cultivate resilient rhythms against the total mobilization of attention and time. Borgmann thus corrects any ambition to solve the problem of technology by regulation alone. The remedy is also architectural, liturgical, and educational.

Egbert Schuurman, representing the Reformational stream, brings the richest theological grammar for norming technē. Building on the structure-direction distinction, he argues that technology is structurally a good unfolding of creational possibilities under divine law but directionally captured by absolutized norms when it is made ultimate. He articulates multi-aspectual norms for technological practice, including economic efficiency, social justice, aesthetic form, and spiritual orientation. He warns against the absolutization of **instrumental reason** and commends **sphere sovereignty**, a pattern of limits where family, church, state, economy, and science serve distinct goods and may not be swallowed by technical administration. Schuurman thus translates both Heidegger’s and Ellul’s warnings into institutional and design constraints that honor created diversity and give practical handles to engineers, policymakers, and pastors.

From these figures several judgeable propositions emerge. First, technology is neither neutral nor fate. Its form as a cultural totality tilts us toward certain ends, yet its artifacts can be designed, governed, and embedded within wise practices. Second, human limits are not obstacles to be overcome but normative gifts that define the space of flourishing. Time, embodiment, relational dependency, and death are not merely pretechnological constraints but part of the good order of life under God, even in a fallen world where healing and relief are works of mercy. Third, governance must be multi-level: personal virtue and community liturgy, institutional checks and market design, and state authority as minister of public justice. Theologically, these are expressions of **providence** administered through creaturely means.

Consider the internal debates. Within philosophy of technology, instrumentalists insist that tools are neutral and that only intentions matter, while substantivists argue that technology has a logic that reshapes social and moral orders. Social constructivists emphasize that artifacts gain meaning only in networks of practice and power. The essay’s position rejects naïve instrumentality and a strong substantivism. Ellul was right that technique amplifies itself through feedback loops and network effects. Borgmann shows that artifacts stage our lives in ways not reducible to intention. Yet both are wrong if they imply that the drift is irresistible. Schuurman and Jonas equip us with a different stance: technology is value-laden and path dependent, but norms and institutions can redirect it. In Christian internal debates, Kuyperian transformationalists celebrate cultural development under the **dominion mandate**, while those emphasizing two kingdoms warn against sacralizing cultural projects. The proposed position is Kuyperian in affirming technē as vocation yet Augustinian in treating limits as disciplines that guard against libido dominandi. Dominion is ordered by **Sabbath**, which reveals that the world is not sustained by human effort and that rest is a command that interrupts productivity. This guards against the total mobilization of life and against collapsing every creaturely good into utility.

External debates put pressure on the account at decisive points. Transhumanism portrays human limits as bugs to be patched. It promises enhancements to cognition, mood, and longevity up to the abolition of death. It secures rhetorical force by appealing to compassion for suffering and to freedom as self-authorship. Theological analysis must concede the value of healing and the real goods of extended healthy life, while drawing bright lines between therapy aimed at restoring damaged functions toward species-typical flourishing and enhancement that redefines the telos of the human. The **imago Dei** is not a set of capacities to be indefinitely augmented but a vocation to image God in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness in community with others and with the earth. Mortality is an enemy conquered by Christ, not a problem to be solved by code. Moreover, dependency is not a defect. In the economy of love, needs summon gifts and bind persons. To engineer away all limits would be to engineer away the conditions of charity. The critique here is not that enhancements are unnatural, but that their telos is often self-exaltation and control. The boundary principle is simple: receive technologies as servants of bestowed ends, not as engines for inventing new ends.

Technocratic utilitarianism offers a different external challenge. If the calculus favors maximal aggregate utility, why not risk bold interventions if expected value is high The reply brings Jonas’s prudence to bear. When stakes include irreversible harm to living systems and deep time human goods, expected value models must be constrained by precautionary thresholds. Moral theory must also account for justice. Aggregates hide the distribution of burdens and benefits. A Christian account prioritizes the protection of the vulnerable and future generations and refuses to treat some communities as expendable testbeds for others’ comfort.

These contours shape recommendations for contemporary disputes. Artificial intelligence concentrates power through opacity, scale, and speed. Its promise to optimize decisions often smuggles in the **means-end rationality** that flattens goods into metrics. The moral problem is not that models are mathematical but that their embedding threatens **moral agency** by displacing judgment into systems whose action cannot be responsibly owned. Jonas requires that any actor take responsibility commensurate with the scope of effects. Therefore, when opaque systems make decisions affecting persons, responsibility must be traceable to accountable authorities, and power must be checked by auditability and institutional veto. Borgmann cautions that even benign uses of AI risk eroding focal practices by saturating attention and offloading skill. Therefore, Christian institutions should establish liturgical and educational spaces of device limitation, teaching wise abstinence and presence. Ellul’s warning about propaganda is newly relevant: algorithmic systems are machines for persuasion at scale. Their capacity to modulate symbolic environments makes truthfulness and consent fragile. Prudence demands transparency regimes, friction against virality, and enforceable controls on surveillance economics. To the objection that such limits stifle innovation and harm prosperity, the reply is that unchecked innovation erodes the moral and institutional substrate on which legitimate prosperity depends. **Subsidiarity** in the broad sense of appropriate scale is a prudential norm: keep powers near the persons and communities that must answer for them.

In bioengineering, gene editing and reproductive technologies promise relief of disease and the prevention of suffering. The therapy enhancement distinction guides here, but it must be filled with content. Therapy aims at repairing goods embedded in human nature; enhancement re-specifies the good. Where lines blur, apply three tests. First, the telos test: does the intervention aim at restoring species-typical capacities for rational, relational, and embodied flourishing Second, the justice test: does it create caste-like advantages by commodifying children or traits, thereby violating the equal dignity of persons Third, the irreversibility test, drawn from Jonas: does it risk introducing changes whose downstream harms cannot be recalled In all cases, embed practice within communities of care that refuse to outsource the social handling of disability to technical fixes alone. **Sabbath** again is crucial; it reminds that our identity is not exhausted by productivity or genetic excellence.

Climate-scale technologies like geoengineering raise the sharpest Jonasian warning. If aerosols in the stratosphere could dim the sun and avoid warming, should we attempt it The position argued here is that such proposals should be treated, in Jonas’s terms, as suspect by default, requiring an exceptionally high burden of proof and international governance before any deployment. The theological reason is not technophobic but covenantal. Creation is ordered as a theatre of communion. To alter planetary systems as a first resort manifests precisely the posture of enframing. The path of conversion begins with repentance from excess and a redirection of ordinary technē toward efficiency, conservation, and just transition, not with acts that would habituate us further to treating the earth as standing-reserve.

At this point examiners typically press whether Heidegger’s analysis can be harmonized with Christian doctrine or whether it smuggles in a quasi-divine fate. The reply is to receive his phenomenology as a diagnosis of cultural disposition while locating both danger and rescue within sin and grace. Enframing is a posture of fallen reason that confuses dominion with control and truth with mastery. Its cure is not a mystical return to Being but conversion, catechesis, and institutions that teach gratitude and limits under God. Similarly, they will press whether Ellul’s pessimism collapses Christian hope. The answer is that hope is not a forecast of gradual technical sanctification but a theological virtue anchored in the promises of God. It licenses resistance to idolatrous systems and creativity in design without presuming civilizational success. Ellul is a prophet, not a planner. His warnings become salutary when tempered by Schuurman’s normative pluralism and Borgmann’s craft of focal practice.

Others will ask whether the insistence on limits amounts to quietism that abandons healing. On the contrary, the theological anchor of **dominion mandate** and the parables of stewardship authorize vigorous cultivation and healing work. The insistence on **creaturely finitude** as gift rather than curse is precisely what prevents the slide from mercy to manipulation. We receive our bodies as good, even when broken, and treat suffering persons not as projects to perfect but as neighbors to love. Medicine that relieves pain and restores function is a participation in God’s common grace. Enhancement that treats the body as raw material to be optimized for competitive advantage invites disordered loves.

A further challenge concerns governance. Are law and regulation adequate when platforms and labs move faster than states The answer is that no single lever suffices. The order of response must be layered. First, design virtues that build constraints into artifacts: defaults that favor privacy, friction that slows diffusion of harms, transparency that enables audit, and sunset clauses that force reevaluation. Second, institutional checks: independent oversight bodies with teeth, civil liability that internalizes externalities, and antitrust action that reduces concentration. Third, communal liturgies: Sabbath keeping in households and churches that honors limits on attention and labor, catechesis that names idolatry of efficiency, and pastoral disciplines that form patience. These are not romantic gestures but practices that recalibrate desire and thereby reconfigure demand. Finally, legal frameworks guided by **prudence** and justice, recognizing that certain classes of power require prior permission rather than post hoc sanction. The biblical portrait of political authority as servant of good implies the legitimacy of coercive limits on technologies that predictably erode moral agency or liberty.

Throughout, the anchor is **analogical knowledge**. Creatures know as creatures, not as gods. This gives content to humility in design. We cannot foresee all effects. Therefore, we prefer reversible to irreversible interventions, small scale to global where possible, and transparency to opacity. This epistemic humility is not skepticism. It is the moral sense that measures action against the measure of creatures. The Sabbath command embodies this humility in time. Weekly cessation announces that the world is not upheld by human technique. Within such a frame, technology can become a servant again, a way of extending care and cultivating the earth without assuming the mantle of creator.

What then of progress The confession is that genuine progress remains possible when measured against substantive goods. Mortality rates have fallen through antibiotics. Communication has extended the reach of love and learning. These are gifts. But it is not progress when the time saved is immediately colonized by more work, when attention is fragmented, when communities are hollowed out by relentless optimization. Borgmann’s focal practices give a touchstone for discernment. Ask which technologies expand the depth of engagement with God, neighbor, and world, and which replace engagement with consumption. Ask whether designs honor the plurality of norms rather than monocultures of efficiency. Ask whether this use respects the dance of **sphere sovereignty**, letting family be a household rather than a node in a network of perpetual availability, letting church be a worshiping body rather than a content platform, letting politics be deliberation rather than data extraction.

Against the background of these judgments, the defended position can be summarized in three theses. First, technology is a creational good under law, and the **dominion mandate** properly includes creative artifacts and complex systems of practice. Second, human limits are the theological boundary conditions of faithful dominion. **Creaturely finitude** and **Sabbath** are not constrictions to be overcome but rules of the game. Third, because modern technological power scales and accelerates action, ordinary virtue must be supplemented by institutional and liturgical architecture that disciplines power toward love of God and neighbor. The constitutive vices to resist are **technological determinism**, which excuses without repenting, and Prometheanism, which exalts without worshiping. The corresponding virtues are humility, patience, courage, and hope.

The examiner who still fears that this stance is romantic or unrealistic should consider three realities. First, systems already embed values. Defaults are decisions. To refuse to name and order those values is not neutrality but abdication. Second, limits already govern power, if only by breakdown. Our choice is not between limits and no limits but between wise, foreseen limits and catastrophic, imposed ones. Third, Christian communities can be laboratories of realistic fidelity, modeling use and abstinence, craft and critique, and thereby offering society proof of concept that a humane technological life is possible.

None of this denies the ambiguity that will persist between achievement and loss. In this aeon, every extension of power opens new fields of temptation. The call is not to purity but to faithfulness. Within such faithfulness, we can receive technological power as a discipline in love, a way of tending the garden with tools that will never make us gods and that, under grace, may cease to make us act like them.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Technological power is a culture of reliable means that scales human agency; human limits are the God-given conditions of **creaturely finitude** that norm agency. The task is to order power under limits by **Sabbath**, **prudence**, and love.
- Decisive figures:
  - Martin Heidegger: essence of technology as enframing that renders the world standing-reserve; diagnostic of **instrumental reason** without theological cure.
  - Jacques Ellul: technique as autonomous, self-augmenting system; prophetic critique of **technological determinism** and propaganda; needs tempering for agency and governance.
  - Hans Jonas: imperative of responsibility for long-horizon, high-stakes action; heuristics of fear disciplined by prudence and justice.
  - Egbert Schuurman: Reformational structure-direction, multi-aspectual norms, **sphere sovereignty**; constructive path for normed technē.
  - Albert Borgmann: device paradigm versus focal practices; design and liturgy to sustain engagement and **Sabbath**.
- Debates:
  - Internal: neutrality versus value-ladenness; determinism versus design governance; Kuyperian transformationalism versus cautionary two-kingdoms sensibilities.
  - External: transhumanist overcoming of limits, utilitarian techno-optimism, market libertarianism and technocracy.
  - Contemporary: AI opacity and alignment, surveillance and platform power, bioengineering therapy versus enhancement, geoengineering and planetary risk.
- Defended position: Technology is structurally good under the **dominion mandate** but must be directionally ordered by gifted limits, with institutional and liturgical constraints that resist Prometheanism and sustain **moral agency** and focal practices.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Is Heidegger compatible with Christian doctrine? Use his diagnosis, relocate cure to sin and grace under **providence**.
  - Does Ellul leave any room for reform? Treat autonomy as macro-level drift; counter with norms, institutions, and design.
  - Are you anti-progress or anti-medicine? No; affirm therapy as mercy, reject enhancements that redefine human telos.
  - Why privilege Sabbath as a technological norm? It interrupts total mobilization and reorders time under God’s sufficiency.
  - Can governance keep up with innovation? Not by one lever; embed constraints in design, institutions, law, and communal liturgy.
