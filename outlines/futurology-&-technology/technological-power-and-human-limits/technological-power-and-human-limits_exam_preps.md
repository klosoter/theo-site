### TITLE
Technological Power, Creaturely Limits, and the Temptation to Transcend Finitude

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How modern **technological power** reshapes the experience of **human limits** and whether Christian theology should interpret this as a legitimate extension of **cultural mandate** or as a Promethean bid to escape **creaturely finitude** and dependence on God.
- Decisive figures: Jacques Ellul, Martin Heidegger, Hans Jonas, Oliver O’Donovan, and Sherry Turkle.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed and broader Augustinian theology of creation and **cultural mandate**, twentieth‑century philosophy of technology, contemporary theological ethics and political theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Competing Christian readings of technology as common-grace fulfillment of **dominion** versus structural **idolatry of technique**; disputes over how to construe **creaturely limits**.
  - External: Heideggerian and posthumanist accounts of technology versus Christian doctrines of **creation**, **providence**, and **imago Dei**.
  - Contemporary: AI and automation, bioengineering and enhancement, digital mediation of selfhood, surveillance capitalism, and ecological crisis as tests of theological claims about limits.
- Defended position: I will argue that technological development is a legitimate, though deeply ambivalent, expression of the **cultural mandate**, but that Christian faith must affirm non‑negotiable **creaturely limits** as gifts, actively resist technocratic attempts to abolish or reengineer them, and order all technological power toward sabbath, vulnerability, and love of neighbor under the lordship of Christ.

### ESSAY
To speak responsibly about technological power and human limits for a Westminster oral examination, one must clarify at the outset that this is not a question about gadgets but about the spiritual grammar of modern civilization. Technology here names not merely tools but a comprehensive pattern of relating to the world in which reality is rendered as material for control, optimization, and efficiency. Human limits name not merely current constraints that might be solved by innovation, but the givenness of **creaturely finitude** under God: bodily vulnerability, temporal embeddedness, moral dependence, and ultimate mortality short of resurrection. The central question is whether increasing technological power constitutes faithful exercise of the **cultural mandate** or a rebellion against those very limits that define us as creatures. 

A robustly theological account must begin where Westminster examiners will press hardest: with **creation**, **providence**, and **imago Dei**. Genesis 1–2 presents humanity as called to “fill the earth and subdue it” under divine blessing. Read through a Reformed lens, this **cultural mandate** authorizes technical and cultural labor as a mode of obedient dominion, a structured participation in God’s own wise rule. Abraham Kuyper’s notion of common grace, later developed in Reformed neo-Calvinism, interprets modern technology as a real though compromised benefit of God’s preserving grace, extending creaturely capacities for care, communication, and stewardship. On this view, the airplane and the internet are not prima facie acts of hubris but instances of lawful **creaturely power** within providential order.

Yet this optimistic line creates an immediate internal tension. If technology is an aspect of the cultural mandate, why does Scripture so relentlessly warn against **idolatry** and trust in human devices, whether chariots, towers, or cities? A more Augustinian strand within the Reformed tradition insists that after the fall, every cultural form is an arena of the conflict between the two cities: the city of God ordered by **love of God** to the contempt of self, and the earthly city ordered by **disordered love** to the contempt of God. The same technical artifact can be either a means of neighbor love or a sacrament of self-exaltation. This tension animates much of the twentieth‑century philosophy of technology, and it is in this context that the first decisive figure, Jacques Ellul, must be read.

Ellul  (1912–1994), a Reformed lay theologian and sociologist, writing in the shadow of industrial warfare and totalitarianism, argued in The Technological Society and The Technological System that modern technology has become an autonomous, totalizing phenomenon he called la technique. For Ellul, **technique** is the relentless pursuit of the most efficient means in every domain, subordinating all other criteria to efficiency. While premodern tools were embedded within thicker cultural and moral frameworks, Ellul contends that the modern age has inverted this relationship: culture, politics, and even religion are increasingly structured by the imperatives of **technical efficiency**. Technology has become a quasi-sovereign principality that orders society according to its own logic.

Theologically, Ellul interprets this as a form of structural idolatry: a rival “lordship” that displaces trust in God with trust in systems of control. Human limits, on his account, are no longer received as gifts but treated as malfunctions to be eliminated. The desire to abolish vulnerability, contingency, and dependence reveals what Ellul sees as the demonic character of technique. Under examiner pressure one must acknowledge that Ellul can sound overly deterministic, as though technique were a fate rather than a set of human practices. Yet his central insight is crucial: technology is not neutral. Every artifact is woven into a broader **technological system** whose default orientation is expansion of control. This presses directly against a naive appeal to the cultural mandate. If dominion is construed in purely technocratic terms, it collapses into the very dynamics Ellul critiques. 

A likely objection from an examiner will be that Ellul underplays common grace and the real goods of medical and communications technologies. One must concede that he sometimes paints with too broad a brush, but respond that his target is not the existence of tools but the absolutization of efficiency as the highest good. Properly received, Ellul’s work functions as a prophetic critique internal to the Christian tradition: he calls the church to disentangle obedience to Christ from captivity to the **idolatry of technique**. His warning helps us see that technological power tends to mutate into a refusal of limits whenever it lacks transcendent orientation.

If Ellul diagnoses the sociological and spiritual totalization of technique, Martin Heidegger  (1889–1976) supplies the most influential philosophical analysis of what technology does to our understanding of being itself. In The Question Concerning Technology Heidegger argues that modern technology is not simply a collection of instruments but a mode of revealing, a way in which reality shows itself to us. He calls this mode Gestell, usually translated “enframing.” Under enframing, the world appears primarily as Bestand, or “standing-reserve”: a stockpile of resources to be ordered, exploited, and optimized. Forests become “lumber potential,” rivers “hydroelectric potential,” and, crucially, human beings become “human resources.”

Heidegger’s account of **enframing** is not theological, yet it resonates profoundly with Christian concerns about the loss of **analogical knowledge** and a forgetfulness of dependence on the Creator. In a world ordered by Gestell, beings no longer appear as gifted, as having their own God-given integrity. They are flattened into objects of manipulation. This directly attacks Christian accounts of **imago Dei**, because the neighbor no longer confronts me as a mystery bearing God’s image, but as data to be mined, a profile to be optimized, a node in a system. Enframing pushes us toward a functional atheism in which there is no room for divine address because all that is, is already pre-interpreted as usable.

Here examiners may object that Heidegger romanticizes premodern forms of techne and fails to offer a clear alternative. Indeed, his appeal to “releasement” and poetic dwelling is notoriously obscure and ontologically thin compared with Christian **providence**. Yet the theological appropriation of Heidegger, for instance by Reformed and Catholic thinkers in philosophy of technology, has focused less on his proposed solution and more on his diagnosis. He clarifies conceptually how technological power threatens not only particular limits but our very capacity to experience the world as created and given. Without such an ontology of givenness, affirmations of **creaturely limits** sound merely prudential rather than principled.

Hans Jonas  (1903–1993) develops this further by recasting ethics in light of technological power. In The Imperative of Responsibility he argues that modern technology creates actions with long-range, irreversible consequences, especially for the biosphere and future generations. Classical ethics, both ancient and Kantian, presupposed that human action had limited scope. But nuclear weapons, genetic engineering, and ecological impacts extend human causality beyond the horizon of direct reciprocity. Jonas proposes a new, asymmetrical moral principle: act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the genuine life of future human beings on earth. This is an ethics of **responsibility** rooted in the vulnerability of life.

Jonas is not writing within a confessional frame, but his emphasis on vulnerability, futurity, and finitude is deeply congenial to a Christian theology of **stewardship** and **providence**. He insists that technological power does not reduce human limits so much as relocate them. We gain new powers but thereby assume new obligations whose scope we can neither fully know nor control. From an Augustinian-Reformed angle, one can affirm Jonas’s call to responsibility while correcting his anthropocentrism with an account of creation ordered to the glory of God. Human dominion is then bounded by the prior telos of the nonhuman world in praise. An examiner might push here: does this not relativize human uniqueness? The response is that it rightly relativizes instrumentalization of creation by reasserting that human lordship is vassal lordship, derivative of Christ’s lordship, and thus accountable.

Oliver O’Donovan  (b. 1945) stands as a crucial bridge figure, bringing the Reformed and Augustinian moral tradition into explicit engagement with technological modernity. In Resurrection and Moral Order and Begotten or Made he frames moral theology as reflection on what God has done in Christ, especially the resurrection, which confirms the created order while inaugurating its eschatological transformation. Technological questions, especially in bioethics, must be located within what O’Donovan calls “the order of creation,” an order already affirmed and destined for fulfillment, not abolition.

Begotten or Made is paradigmatic. Confronting reproductive technologies, O’Donovan argues that between begetting and making lies a fundamental moral difference. Begetting receives the child as a given, a gift; making produces a product to specification. To treat human generation as a technical project is to confuse divine and human roles, to deny that we stand under an order we did not create. For O’Donovan, some limits are contingent and can be altered without moral loss, but others are constitutive of the created good. These **non-negotiable limits** include sexual dimorphism, generational succession, and mortality short of resurrection. Attempts to erase these in the name of autonomy risk a revolt against creation itself.

Examiners often probe whether O’Donovan is simply baptizing a conservative status quo. One must answer by emphasizing his resurrection framework: the order he defends is not a static natural law but the order as affirmed and reoriented in Christ. This guards against both technological utopianism and reactionary traditionalism. It also connects to a broader Reformed emphasis on **eschatology**: our hope for transformation is anchored not in cumulative technical power but in the sovereign act of God. To seek redemption by technique is to confuse **providence** with progress.

Where Heidegger, Ellul, Jonas, and O’Donovan illumine structural and ethical dynamics, Sherry Turkle  (b. 1948) exposes the interior and relational consequences of digital technology. A clinical psychologist and sociologist of technology at MIT, Turkle’s works such as Alone Together and Reclaiming Conversation document how digital devices reconfigure intimacy, attention, and self-perception. Her empirical finding is paradoxical: as we become more connected, we become more alone. Always-on connectivity cultivates a self that craves constant affirmation yet fears unmediated presence. Relationships are curated through screens, vulnerability is managed, and the messiness of embodied encounters is minimized.

From a theological standpoint, Turkle’s work shows how technological mediation tempts us to refuse the limits inscribed in our social and temporal being. The smartphone’s promise of permanent availability erodes **sabbath** and silence; the curated profile erodes honesty about sin and need; the filtered image resists aging and bodily particularity. These are not trivial shifts but touch directly on **sanctification**, because Christian growth occurs precisely in embodied, time-bound, and often inconvenient communities. Turkle’s research confirms in psychological terms what Ellul and Heidegger articulated philosophically: technology tends to disembed us from concrete givens. 

One might push back that Turkle’s data are descriptive, not prescriptive, and that communities can use digital tools wisely. That is correct, and a responsible position must avoid demonizing specific technologies. Yet Turkle’s studies indicate that without deliberate counter-formation, technological defaults habituate us away from the practices that sustain Christian life: patient attention, confession, hospitality. This underscores that debates about technology are not merely about external power but about the formation of desire in light of **original sin** and grace.

Having traversed these figures, we can now clarify the central debates and stake out a position. Internally, within Christian theology, the debate turns on how expansively to interpret the **cultural mandate** and how sharply to construe **creaturely limits**. One camp, indebted to Kuyper and some strands of evangelical activism, leans toward a celebratory stance: technology is a primary arena in which Christians can exercise creativity for cultural renewal. Human limits are seen mostly as problems to be overcome, save for mortality which is reserved for eschatological hope. Another camp, drawing on Ellul, O’Donovan, and an Augustinian suspicion of power, warns that modern technology systematically trains us to refuse limits, and so must be approached under rigorous disciplines of renunciation and discernment.

The position I defend mediates these by affirming that technological development belongs in principle to the **cultural mandate** under common grace, but insisting that postlapsarian reality and the structure of modern **technological systems** generate powerful pressures toward idolatrous transcendence of limits. Therefore, Christians must treat some creaturely limits as principial: the givenness of bodily sex, the moral significance of dependence, the finitude of time, the contingency of our plans under **providence**, the inevitability of death before resurrection. Any technology whose operative logic is to erase these in the name of autonomy should be prima facie suspect and often rejected. In contrast, technologies that alleviate suffering, extend communication, or repair damage, while acknowledging and even highlighting our dependence and finitude, may be embraced critically as gifts.

Externally, Christian theology must contend with rival frameworks. Secular technocratic optimism treats technological power as the engine of human progress, with “problems” defined as technical challenges. Human limits are mere engineering constraints. Transhumanism radicalizes this, explicitly aiming at the abolition of aging, enhancement of cognition and affect, and eventual uploading of consciousness. Here the **imago Dei** is reinterpreted as a mandate to self-transcendence by our own means. Heideggerian critique of technicity aligns with Christian concerns at the level of diagnosis but lacks theological resources to name sin or hope for redemption. Some ecological philosophies respond to technological devastation by demonizing human agency altogether and valorizing nature’s autonomy in a way incompatible with biblical **dominion**.

In response, Christian theology must affirm simultaneously that human beings are uniquely called to responsible dominion and that this dominion is bounded by an order and telos not of our own making. We reject both technological Pelagianism, which expects salvation by innovation, and romantic anti-technology, which forgets that human making is itself part of created goodness. We also resist posthumanist fantasies as replays of the primal temptation to “be like God.” The doctrine of **incarnation** is crucial here: in Jesus Christ, God assumes, rather than escapes, our finite, vulnerable, and mortal condition and bears it through death into resurrection. Any bid to achieve invulnerability by technique thereby runs counter to the grain of redemption.

Contemporary debates sharpen these tensions. Artificial intelligence and automation raise questions about agency, responsibility, and the meaning of work. If AI systems outstrip human capacities in certain domains, is this an illegitimate trespassing of limits? A nuanced answer is required. On one hand, devising tools that extend our abilities has always been part of human vocation; on the other, if such systems erode human participation in judgment, obscure accountability, or render large populations economically superfluous, they directly attack the relational and vocational dimensions of **imago Dei**. Christian engagement must therefore emphasize the maintenance of human responsibility and the protection of the vulnerable over sheer efficiency gains.

Bioengineering and enhancement technologies test bodily and temporal limits. While therapeutic interventions that restore damaged functions can be understood as cooperation with God’s healing purposes, enhancements aimed at redesigning what it is to be human cross into rebellion against created order. O’Donovan’s begetting versus making distinction is especially pertinent. Gene editing to correct a lethal defect respects the child as given; editing to produce a desired personality or physique treats the child as a project. Examiners may probe the boundary here, demanding criteria. One can answer that therapies aim at normative species functioning while enhancements aim to redefine those norms in line with market or ideological ideals, thus usurping divine prerogative.

Digital mediation of selfhood, as Turkle shows, challenges social and temporal limits. Here ecclesiology becomes central. The church’s practices of gathered worship, sacraments, and discipline are irreducibly embodied, time-bound, and localized. An overreliance on digital mediation risks hollowing out these structures, turning Christian community into consumable content. Yet digital tools can serve mission and catechesis if subordinated to and not substituted for embodied fellowship. The examiner who asks whether streaming services count as “real” church is, in effect, asking whether technological mediation can abolish the spatial and temporal limits integral to ecclesial life. The answer must be no, because those limits are tied to Christ’s own incarnate presence and to the nature of **sacrament** as material sign.

Finally, ecological crisis represents the macro-scale consequence of unbounded technological exploitation. Jonas’s emphasis on responsibility, joined to a doctrine of **stewardship**, underscores that exceeding certain ecological limits is not just imprudent but sinful, because it despises both neighbor and Creator. Christian resistance to technocratic solutions that merely displace problems without repentance is therefore imperative. Geoengineering schemes, for instance, may be necessary as emergency measures, but they do not substitute for the deeper moral work of accepting simpler, more frugal forms of life that align with our creaturely place in creation.

Across these debates, the unifying claim is that human limits are not merely deficits to be technologically overcome but are, at key points, constitutive of our vocation before God. **Creaturely finitude** is the site where grace meets us. To live faithfully with technology is therefore to discern, in concrete practices, which uses of power honor that finitude as gift and which attempt to negate it. The church must cultivate disciplines of sabbath, hospitality, and confession that resist the empire of efficiency and performance. It must articulate publicly, against technocratic and transhumanist narratives, that our ultimate flourishing lies not in endless optimization but in communion with the triune God who, in Christ, took on our limits to redeem them, not to teach us to escape them by our own machines.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Technological power is the socially organized capacity to reshape the world through systems of **technique** ordered to efficiency and control; human limits are the God-given structures of **creaturely finitude** in body, time, dependence, and mortality that define our vocation under **creation** and **providence**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Jacques Ellul: Reformed critic of the autonomous **technological system**, seeing modern technique as structural **idolatry** that refuses limits.
  - Martin Heidegger: Philosopher of **enframing**, diagnosing technology’s reduction of beings to standing-reserve and erasure of givenness.
  - Hans Jonas: Ethicist of **responsibility**, arguing that technological power creates new duties toward future life and ecological limits.
  - Oliver O’Donovan: Theological ethicist grounding moral order in resurrection, defending non-negotiable **creaturely limits** particularly in bioethics.
  - Sherry Turkle: Empirical analyst of digital culture, showing how connectivity reconfigures selfhood, intimacy, and practices crucial to Christian formation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Is technology primarily a common-grace fulfillment of **cultural mandate** or a pervasive structure of **idolatry of technique**; which limits are alterable versus constitutive of creation.
  - External: Technocratic and transhumanist optimism and posthumanism versus Christian doctrines of **imago Dei**, **dominion**, and **incarnation**; Heideggerian critique as a non-theological ally.
  - Contemporary: AI and work and agency, bioengineering and human enhancement, digital mediation of church and selfhood, ecological crisis and stewardship.
- Defended position: Technological development is in principle a legitimate aspect of **cultural mandate** under common grace, but Christian theology must affirm and protect certain **creaturely limits** as gifts, resisting technocratic attempts to abolish or redesign them and ordering all technological power toward sabbath, vulnerability, and love of neighbor under Christ’s lordship.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How do you distinguish legitimate from illegitimate technological uses? By testing whether a technology serves or negates constitutive **creaturely limits** and neighbor love within the order of creation affirmed in resurrection.
  - Does Ellul overstate the autonomy of technique? Yes, but his critique rightly exposes technology’s structural drift toward **idolatry of efficiency** that theology must confront.
  - Are you simply baptizing a conservative status quo? No, because the norm is not “how things are” but the created order as confirmed and oriented by Christ’s resurrection, which can both affirm and judge existing practices.
  - Can AI ever bear the image of God? No, because **imago Dei** is bound to embodied, relational, and accountable human existence, not to functional intelligence or information processing.
  - How should the church use digital media? As subordinate tools for teaching and communication that never replace embodied, time-bound, sacramental gathering, thus honoring ecclesial limits as gifts.
