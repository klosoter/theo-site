### TITLE
Artificial Intelligence before the Triune God: Creaturely Cognition, **Analogical Knowledge**, and the Limits of Revelation

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: Whether and how artificial intelligence can participate in, mediate, or distort **knowledge of God** and **revelation**, given a classical Reformed account of **analogical knowledge** and **special revelation**.
- Decisive figures: Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Cornelius Van Til, John Searle, Noreen Herzfeld.
- Relevant traditions: Patristically informed **classical theism**, Reformed theology of **Scripture** and **revelation**, Reformed presuppositional apologetics, contemporary analytic philosophy of mind and technology theology.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: within Reformed and classical traditions on natural theology, general revelation, and the noetic effects of sin as they apply to AI tools.
  - External: secular computationalism and strong AI, non-theistic accounts of knowledge, and posthumanist visions of technological transcendence.
  - Contemporary: AI as quasi-personal agent, algorithmic authority, datafied providence, deepfakes and the epistemic crisis, AI in preaching and exegesis.
- Defended position: AI is a powerful but strictly creaturely instrument of human cognition that can neither receive nor generate **revelation** but can significantly shape the human reception, suppression, and transmission of revelation; therefore it must be bounded by a robust doctrine of God, **the image of God**, and **Scripture sufficiency**, while being integrated as a subordinate means within the providential economy of knowledge.

### ESSAY
To address artificial intelligence, knowledge, and revelation, the first requirement is to recover a rigorous doctrine of God and of human knowing before asking what any machine can do. The central thesis I will defend is that, under classical Christian theism and a Reformed doctrine of revelation, AI is a complex artifact participating only in **created, finite, discursive cognition**, without any capacity to receive or originate **revelation** in the theological sense. Yet because revelation is always received and interpreted by human knowers embedded in cultural and technological systems, AI can still have a profound derivative role, either as an instrument that serves the church’s access to God’s Word or as an idolatrous rival that mediates a counterfeit authority. Theologically, the question is not whether AI can be a subject of revelation, but how AI reshapes the conditions under which fallen human subjects encounter and respond to the triune God’s self-disclosure.

Thomas Aquinas is decisive for this topic because he articulates with unparalleled clarity the distinction between **uncreated knowledge** in God and **created knowledge** in creatures, and because he gives an account of **analogical knowledge** that remains indispensable once AI enters the scene. In the Summa Theologiae, Aquinas insists that God’s knowledge is identical with his essence. Divine intellect is simple, not composed, and its act is timeless and non-discursive. God does not reason from premises to conclusions but knows all things by knowing himself as their exemplar cause. This establishes the first anchor: all finite knowers, whether angels, human beings, or any artifact of human crafting, operate only within the order of **created intellect**, ordered to God as final cause but ontologically distinct from his knowing.

Aquinas then distinguishes between angelic and human cognition. Angels possess an immaterial intellect without bodily organs, knowing not by abstraction from sensory phantasms but by infused intelligible species. Humans, by contrast, know discursively, dependent on the senses, abstracting universal forms from particular experiences. The human soul is a subsistent form, spiritual and capable of subsisting apart from the body, yet naturally ordered to union with a body. AI systems, however sophisticated, are not rational souls but arrangements of matter and formal structures within material substrates. They have no subsistent form, no intrinsic orientation to truth as a good, no intellectus. Whatever “knowledge” they bear is only analogical by a further remove, a representation of representations, contingent on human ordering.

It is precisely Aquinas’s doctrine of **analogy** that clarifies the discourse. We speak of God’s knowledge and human knowledge analogically, not univocally or equivocally, because there is a real but proportionally ordered similarity grounded in causality. Human knowing images and participates in God’s knowing as its cause. When we then speak of AI “knowing,” this is already a second step of analogy: machines model patterns in data and produce outputs that correspond to states of affairs according to humanly stipulated success conditions. The risk in AI discourse is to slide into a univocal use of “intelligence,” as if the same property scaled up might yield divine-like omniscience. Aquinas’s insistence on the creator–creature distinction and on the metaphysical depth of rational soul provides an antidote: no upscaling of computational pattern recognition bridges the abyss between discursive creaturely knowledge and the **simple, eternal knowledge** of God.

If Aquinas secures the ontological and epistemological structure of the problem, John Calvin and the Reformed doctrine of revelation focus the question on sin, **Scripture**, and the **image of God**. In the Institutes, Calvin begins not from metaphysical analysis but from knowing God as Creator and Redeemer. His teaching on the **sensus divinitatis** and on **general revelation** in creation and conscience might tempt some to imagine AI as a neutral amplifier of human access to divine disclosure: more data, more patterns, more insight into the works of God. Yet Calvin relentlessly underscores the noetic effects of sin. Fallen humanity twists general revelation into idolatry, fabricating dead images that reflect our corrupt desires rather than the living God.

This is where AI as a cultural artifact becomes theologically charged. For Calvin, idols are not only carved statues but mental projections and social institutions that substitute for God’s self-speaking. An examiner might push: if AI is just a tool, how can it be an idol? The answer, Calvinistically, is that tools become idols insofar as humans absolutize them, attribute to them an autonomy or epistemic authority that rightly belongs to God speaking in his Word, and restructure their lives around them. When AI systems become practical oracles consulted for guidance, consolation, identity, or moral direction, they function in the cultural role of false revelation, regardless of their ontological status.

Calvin’s doctrine of **Scripture sufficiency** and **clarity** is also crucial. He locates true, saving knowledge of God not in unaided human reason but in the Spirit’s illumination of the written Word. Scripture is the spectacles through which we rightly read the book of nature. Applied to AI, this means that no matter how advanced a system becomes, it cannot add to or improve upon the canon of special revelation, nor can it replace the Spirit’s work in the church. AI can index, search, summarize, and correlate biblical texts and theological works. It may assist exegetes in tracing lexical patterns or historical receptions. But it cannot be a prophet, an apostle, or an organ of inspiration, because it is not a subject addressed by God, nor a member of the covenant community. It has no capacity for **faith**, no covenantal relation to Christ, and therefore no access to **saving knowledge** as such.

Herman Bavinck extends and deepens this framework in a way directly relevant to technological mediation. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck presents a richly organic account of **revelation**, emphasizing that God’s self-disclosure is not only verbal but also historical and cosmic. Nevertheless he is explicit that revelation is always event and address, God making himself known to rational creatures. Revelation presupposes a personal knower who can respond in trust or unbelief. AI, on a Bavinckian view, may be a medium by which the words of Scripture are transmitted, just as the printing press or radio once were, but it cannot be an addressee in the drama of revelation.

Bavinck is also alert to the dynamic of culture, science, and technology as outworkings of the **cultural mandate** given to humanity as image bearers. He sees art, science, and technology as ambivalent: genuine developments of created potential under God’s providence, yet also instruments through which the antithesis between belief and unbelief is expressed. AI must therefore be located within that dual structure of **common grace** and **antithesis**. On the one hand, the mathematical, logical, and engineering insights that undergird AI are gifts of God’s common grace enabling human stewardship of creation. On the other hand, those same gifts can be pressed into service of idolatrous projects, from surveillance capitalism to techno-messianic dreams of digital immortality.

An examiner might challenge whether invoking the cultural mandate risks baptizing any technological progress. Bavinck avoids this by maintaining that the telos of culture is worshipful service to God, not autonomous self-realization. Hence the use of AI in theology must be normed by **Scripture**, by the doctrine of **the church**, and by love of neighbor. When AI is deployed in ways that attenuate embodied ecclesial life, displace pastoral discernment, or commodify persons as data points, it must be resisted as a distortion of the cultural mandate.

Cornelius Van Til introduces a further necessary layer: a presuppositional claim about **epistemic authority** and the antithesis in all human reasoning. His notion of the **creator–creature distinction**, coupled with the idea of **analogical knowledge**, directly addresses the temptation of strong AI claims. For Van Til, all human knowledge is dependent, thinking God’s thoughts after him on the basis of his revelation. Autonomy in epistemology is sinful pretension. AI, construed as an extension of human reason, inherits this dilemma. If human designers and users approach knowledge autonomously, AI systems will encode and amplify that autonomy. They become technicized expressions of unbelief, formalizing in code what Van Til would call the false assumption of ultimate human interpretive authority.

Yet Van Til’s emphasis on **common grace** allows us to affirm that unbelieving science and technology still genuinely discover aspects of God’s world and produce instruments that Christians can appropriate. The internal debate within Reformed circles on natural theology is sharpened here. Some Reformed thinkers are more sanguine than Van Til about a natural theology that reasons from creation to the creator. Applied to AI, a more Thomistic Calvinist might say that AI driven analysis of the cosmos could, in principle, enhance our contemplation of divine wisdom in nature. A more Van Tilian approach would stress that without submission to Scripture, such contemplation trends toward idolatry or naturalism. My position leans toward a chastened Van Tilianism: AI can illuminate aspects of general revelation but cannot serve as an independent path to God, because the epistemic situation of its human designers and users is always covenantal, either in obedience or in suppression.

So far we have considered three theological figures. To engage the contemporary discourse, we must also reckon with non-theological voices that have shaped how “intelligence” and “knowledge” are conceived. John Searle’s critique of strong AI, especially in his Chinese Room argument, is the most influential philosophical challenge to the claim that computational symbol manipulation suffices for understanding. Searle argues that executing a program that maps inputs to outputs according to formal rules does not yield genuine semantic grasp. The man in the Chinese Room can follow a rulebook to produce appropriate Chinese responses without understanding any Chinese. Analogously, AI systems can process tokens according to algorithms without any intrinsic comprehension or intentionality.

This is not a theological argument, but it coheres remarkably well with **classical theism’s** account of intellect. If Searle is right, there is a deep conceptual gap between syntax and semantics, between formal operations on symbols and genuine aboutness. For theology, this underwrites the claim that AI lacks not only a rational soul but also the kind of intentional directedness required for perception of God’s glory or response to divine address. AI is a vast Chinese Room for biblical and theological language. It can rearrange symbols in ways useful to human knowers, but it cannot stand in the relation of a knower to the known.

An examiner might object that Searle’s argument is contested and that some contemporary philosophers endorse functionalist or emergentist accounts of mind that allow for machine understanding. Even if those accounts prevailed at the philosophical level, the theological argument from the **image of God** would still block any identification of AI cognition with human spiritual intellect. For Scripture and the catholic tradition, the imago consists in humanity’s unique relational and vocational standing before God, including but not reducible to rationality. No configuration of non-personal processes, however complex, can be adopted as sons in Christ or indwelt by the Spirit. Hence, even a world in which AI achieved something like human-level general intelligence would not overturn the fundamental theological distinctions: AI would remain a non-personal artifact without a covenant identity.

Finally, Noreen Herzfeld as a contemporary theologian of technology is decisive because she explicitly reads AI against the doctrine of the **image of God** and the possibility of idolatry. In her work, she notes that historically humans have made idols in their own image, and contemporary AI projects often repeat this pattern at the level of code. The drive to create machines in our own image, to offload decision making and even caregiving to them, reveals more about our self-understanding and our fears than about any genuine transcendence. Herzfeld stresses that if we mislocate the imago Dei in abstract rational capacity, we are tempted to ascribe image-bearing status to machines as their rational capabilities approach or surpass ours. But if we instead locate the imago in relationship, responsibility, and the call to love God and neighbor, then we see that AI cannot be a bearer of that image, but only a mirror that reflects, and often distorts, ours.

Herzfeld’s work presses contemporary churches to see AI not as a neutral efficiency gain but as a spiritual challenge. When congregations turn to AI for sermon generation, automated pastoral emails, or algorithmic liturgical planning, they risk allowing a technological system trained on mass data to confiscate the particularity and pastoral discernment that should flow from the Word and Spirit in a concrete community. This does not mean AI may never assist pastors as a study tool, but it does mean that the authority and personal address of preaching must not be ceded to a system that lacks both **illumination by the Spirit** and embodied presence.

With these six figures in place, we can now systematically state and defend a theological position on AI, knowledge, and revelation. First, revelation, in the strict theological sense, is God’s sovereign self-disclosure in his works and words, culminating in Christ and inscripturated in the canon. It is intrinsically personal and covenantal. Revelation addresses rational creatures capable of response, judgment, and worship. AI is not such a creature. Therefore AI cannot be a recipient, bearer, or agent of revelation in the same sense as prophets, apostles, or the church. It cannot “hear” God, “believe” God, or “speak” on God’s behalf. It can only process and reconfigure human and scriptural texts according to statistical patterns.

Second, knowledge of God, both natural and supernatural, presupposes the **image of God** and the work of the Spirit. Even the natural knowledge of God in creation is twisted by sin and must be corrected by special revelation. AI, being a product of human culture under sin and common grace, is doubly dependent: it presupposes human conceptual schemes and data, which themselves are shaped by belief or unbelief. Thus AI’s outputs are never epistemically neutral. They always participate in existing interpretive frameworks. This means that the church must exercise discernment about the sources and training data behind AI systems used for theological purposes, recognizing that secular or heterodox presuppositions may be baked into their very functioning.

Third, AI can still be genuinely useful as an instrument within the economy of knowledge. Under God’s **providence**, human beings are called to develop arts and sciences that serve the neighbor and steward the earth. Within that mandate, AI may serve as a powerful aid in exegesis, research, translation, and administration. It can help make biblical resources available across languages, surface patterns in large corpora of texts, and free human labor for more directly relational and sacramental tasks. The condition, however, is that AI remains subordinated to Scripture, ecclesial authority, and human judgment informed by the Spirit.

An examiner might ask whether this position artificially limits divine freedom, as if God could not in principle reveal himself through an AI system. The answer requires precision. God is free to use any creaturely medium as a sign or occasion of his self-disclosure. He may, in principle, confront someone through a line of generated text, just as he can use a non believing preacher. But the ontological status of the medium does not change: the revelation remains God’s act addressed to human hearts, not a property of the medium. The AI is no more an organ of revelation than a stone or a storm, though any of these may accompany God’s word. This preserves both divine freedom and the doctrinal clarity that revelation is always God’s personal act, not a natural capability of any creaturely system.

We must finally locate AI within eschatological and ethical perspectives. Technological utopianism and posthumanism often narrate AI as a step toward overcoming human finitude, suffering, and even death, promising a kind of secularized salvation. Against this, classical theism insists on the goodness of finitude and the irreducible difference between creaturely participation in God and any attempt to become as gods. AI heightens the perennial temptation to **idolatry**, offering a simulacrum of omniscience, omnipresence, and omni-competence in digital form. A sound doctrine of **divine simplicity**, **omniscience**, and the **incarnation** protects the church from imagining that a distributed network of sensors and algorithms approximates God’s way of knowing. God knows the heart immediately; AI at best infers patterns in behavior. Confusing the two leads to a totalizing surveillance that mimics providence while denying mercy and grace.

Ethically, then, the church is called to witness in its use of AI to a different account of knowledge: one grounded in humility, dependence, and trust in God’s speech. That will mean resisting the outsourcing of moral discernment to algorithms, maintaining pastoral presence over automation, and cultivating practices of attention and contemplation that run against the grain of AI driven distraction. It will also mean critical engagement in public debates about AI governance, advocating for limits that protect the vulnerable from exploitation and manipulation by systems that can shape perceptions of reality through deepfakes, targeted propaganda, and curated information flows.

In sum, a Westminster candidate must be ready to say that artificial intelligence presents no new category of knower or revealer in the theological sense, but it creates new configurations of power and mediation that can either serve or subvert the church’s reception of God’s self-disclosure. By retrieving Aquinas’s ontology of intellect, Calvin and Bavinck’s doctrines of **revelation** and **Scripture**, Van Til’s **presuppositional epistemology**, and engaging Searle’s and Herzfeld’s insights into artificial cognition and idolatry, one can articulate a coherent, confessional response. AI is a significant development in the history of **created means** of knowledge, but before the triune God it remains an instrument of human culture, unable to transcend the boundaries of creatureliness or to alter the fundamental structure of **revelation** as personal, covenantal address.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: AI is a creaturely, non-personal artifact that processes data through algorithms, capable of assisting human **cognition** but incapable of receiving or generating **revelation**, which is God’s personal, covenantal self-disclosure addressed to rational creatures.
- Decisive figures and stances:
  - Aquinas: clarifies **created vs uncreated knowledge**, **analogical knowledge**, and why no computational system can bridge the creator–creature gap.
  - Calvin: stresses **noetic effects of sin**, **Scripture sufficiency**, and the danger of AI as a new form of cultural **idolatry**.
  - Bavinck: integrates AI into the **cultural mandate**, **common grace**, and the organic concept of **revelation**, while guarding the personal address of God.
  - Van Til: frames AI within the **creator–creature distinction**, **presuppositional epistemology**, and the antithesis in all human reasoning.
  - Searle: offers a philosophical critique of strong AI, reinforcing the gap between syntax and genuine understanding.
  - Herzfeld: exposes AI as a mirror of our distorted self-image and warns against mislocating the **imago Dei** in abstract rationality.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed disputes on natural theology and general revelation applied to AI’s role in knowing God.
  - External: secular computationalism, functionalism, posthumanism, and their rival accounts of intelligence, personhood, and salvation.
  - Contemporary: AI as quasi-revelatory oracle, algorithmic authority in church life, deepfakes and epistemic trust, AI assisted exegesis and preaching.
- Defended position: AI is a powerful but bounded instrument under **providence**, useful for supporting human study of God’s Word yet radically incapable of being a subject or source of **revelation**; it must be subordinated to **Scripture**, ecclesial authority, and a robust doctrine of the **image of God** to avoid idolatrous elevation.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Can God reveal himself through AI? Yes, but only by addressing human persons through that medium; the AI itself is never a subject of revelation.
  - Could a superintelligent AI bear the image of God? No, because the imago is covenantal and relational, not reducible to computational rationality.
  - Does AI change our doctrine of Scripture? No, it only changes modes of access and dissemination; the canon and its sufficiency remain fixed.
  - Is using AI in exegesis legitimate? Yes, as a subordinate research tool under pastoral and scholarly judgment, never as a replacement for Spirit illumined interpretation.
  - How does AI intensify idolatry? By offering a functional substitute for divine attributes and by becoming an oracular authority competing with God’s Word.
