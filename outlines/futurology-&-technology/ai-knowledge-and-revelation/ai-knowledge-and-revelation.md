### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
By artificial intelligence I mean artifacted systems that learn patterns from data to generate outputs that resemble human judgments, including language and images, such as models inspired by **Transformers 2017** and contemporary large language models in **2022–2025**. The dogmatic question is whether these systems can participate in or threaten **divine revelation** and Christian knowledge, which for classical theology is God's self-disclosure culminating in Jesus Christ and inscripturated by the **Spirit’s inspiration**. Locating the topic within **Bibliology and Theology Proper** clarifies that revelation is first a divine act, not a human discovery, and that technologies belong to **providence and common grace** rather than to the inner life of God.

Revelation in Christian usage names both **general revelation** in creation and conscience, and **special revelation** in redemptive history culminating in Christ and Scripture. The church has distinguished **revelation**, **inspiration**, and **illumination**, reserving inspiration to biblical authors as **theopneustos** and illumination to the Spirit's work in readers. AI, as artifact, can be an instrument within **illumination's providential context**, but it cannot itself be the agent of **divine speech** because it lacks personal agency and the **imago Dei** that grounds covenantal address.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Scripture frames knowledge of God as an event of God's initiative. The heavens declare God's glory in **Psalm 19**, and what may be known of God is manifest in creation according to **Romans 1.19–21**, yet sinners suppress the truth because of the **noetic effects of sin**. The Word was with God and was God, and this **Logos** became flesh in **John 1.1–14**, locating definitive revelation in the **incarnation of the Son** rather than in human technique. In many times and ways God spoke by prophets, but now in these last days by his Son, as **Hebrews 1.1–2** insists, setting the finality of **Christic revelation**.

Paul teaches that the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are spiritually discerned in **1 Corinthians 2.10–14**, which grounds **illumination by the Spirit** as essential to knowing God. The secret things belong to the Lord, but the things revealed belong to us in **Deuteronomy 29.29**, establishing **sufficiency and clarity** for the covenant community. The prophetic critique of idols in **Isaiah 44** and the warning against crafted images in **Exodus 20** caution against artifacts that feign speech yet cannot speak, warning the church against **technological idolatry** that would substitute machine outputs for God's living address.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Patristic and medieval theology tied revelation to the economy of the **Triune God**. **Augustine** linked illumination to the **inner Teacher** in the Spirit, while **Aquinas** ordered **natural and supernatural knowledge** under grace, with the **analogia entis** preserving the Creator-creature distinction. Invention of the printing press around **1450–1455** prefigures today's questions, since type profoundly augmented biblical dissemination without becoming a source of revelation, an instance of **providence and means** rather than a new **principle of theology**.

The Reformation clarified **sola Scriptura** and the **sufficiency of Scripture**, codified in **Westminster Confession 1646–1648**, while emphasizing the **perspicuity** of the Word administered by the church. **Old Princeton** in the nineteenth century, especially **A. A. Hodge and B. B. Warfield** in their 1881 work on **inspiration**, combined high confidence in Scripture with esteem for empirical science, appealing to **concursus** to describe divine and human action. Twentieth-century debates sharpened contrasts: **Barth's Church Dogmatics I.1 1932** re-centered revelation as God's free self-communication in Christ, skeptical of elevating human religious capacities, while **Rahner and Vatican II's Dei Verbum 1965** articulated revelation as God's self-communication mediated through Scripture and Tradition in the **Spirit-governed church**.

Processing information became central to culture with **Wiener's Cybernetics 1948** and **Turing 1950**, and by **2012** deep learning tutorials a new wave of algorithmic pattern recognition transformed knowledge work. Christian theology responded with documents like the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy 1978** and the **Rome Call for AI Ethics 2020**, each addressing the trustworthiness of **divine speech** versus the fallibility of **human systems**. Contemporary analytic reflection, from **Plantinga's Warrant 1993** to **Alston's Perceiving God 1991**, has developed models of warranted Christian belief that center **Spirit-produced cognition**, not computational capacity.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
A Reformed account begins with **God's aseity and simplicity**, securing the gratuity of revelation as **ad extra** act of the triune Lord. The **Westminster Standards 1646–1648** teach that Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and life, sufficient in all things necessary for salvation, while the Spirit inwardly witnesses to its truth, grounding **sufficiency and illumination**. Hence, AI may assist as a fallible tool of scholarship, yet it cannot augment what God has already given in **canonical sufficiency** or replace **ministerial authority**.

**Old Princeton** held together confidence in **reason under revelation** with piety, so **Warfield** could receive certain scientific discoveries while guarding verbal inspiration by **concursus**. Applied to AI, this posture commends rigorous empirical testing of systems while refusing to translate **algorithmic predictability** into **theological authority**. The **Dutch Neo-Calvinist** strand in **Kuyper 1898** and **Bavinck 1906–1911** views technology within the **cultural mandate** and **common grace**, yet under the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, arguing that artifacts are normatively directed by love of God or idolatry. Thus AI can be a creational unfolding that amplifies exegesis and diaconal care, provided **sphere sovereignty** keeps the church's spiritual office distinct from **technical expertise**.

Finally, a presuppositional note from **Van Til 1930s** reminds us that all reasoning operates covenantally, so the claim that AI is neutral is itself a **faith-laden claim**. The church should therefore interrogate the **metaphysics of data** and reject any **totalizing algorithmic providence** that mimics divine omniscience, maintaining that knowledge of God remains analogical, covenantal, and **Spirit-enabled**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
A **Roman Catholic** account shaped by **Dei Verbum 1965** understands revelation as God's self-communication fulfilled in Christ, transmitted by **Scripture and Tradition**, and authentically interpreted by the **magisterium**. Here AI may serve as an instrument within the church's **sensus fidei**, subject to ecclesial discernment, fitting with a **sacramental ontology** that sees creation as capable of bearing grace while insisting on personal mediation by **Word and sacrament** rather than by impersonal artifacts.

A **Lutheran theology of the cross** emphasizes God's hiddenness under contrary signs and the primacy of **viva vox evangelii** in preaching, with **two-kingdoms** prudence regulating technology in service of neighbor-love. AI is welcomed as a civil tool for catechetical aids and translation, but it cannot generate the **performative promise** of absolution that God speaks through called ministers, keeping the line between **law and gospel** crisp against **technological confusion**.

In **Barthian modern actualism**, revelation is God's self-event in Christ by the Spirit, free and sovereign, which resists every naturalizing account that would fold God's address into human capabilities. Thus AI's capacities would be judged theologically marginal, lest the church fall into **religion as projection**. In **analytic philosophy of religion**, models of **testimony, extended cognition, and epistemic authority** are debated, with **Plantinga** granting warrant through properly basic belief occasioned by the **internal instigation of the Spirit**, while **Zagzebski** on authority and **Clark and Chalmers 1998** on extended mind suggest careful categories for how artifacts become parts of our knowing without becoming the source of **divine revelation**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A first objection claims that at scale AI discovers patterns beyond human reach, so it functions like a new **oracle of truth**. The response is that revelation is **personal divine speech**, not statistical novelty, and that the **Spirit's illumination** is irreducible to pattern detection. The church may gratefully use tools like computational linguistics for textual criticism, as in the **CBGM developments after 2011**, but it must deny any **algorithmic authority** to norm doctrine or conscience.

A second debate concerns **AI in exegesis and preaching**. Machine assistance can surface intertextual echoes and semantic domains across languages, aiding readers of *apokalypsis* or *dikaiosune* with breadth. Yet **plagiarism and pastoral formation** risks arise when sermons are ghostwritten, severing the **ministerial Word** from the shepherd's prayerful study, and confusing the role of **Word and sacrament** with content production. A third concern addresses **deepfakes and disinformation**, which exacerbate the **noetic effects of sin**, requiring communal practices of verification rooted in **truth-telling as discipleship** rather than naive trust in virality.

A fourth objection asks about **AI moral status** and whether a sufficiently advanced system might merit inclusion within the **moral community** or even count as a new **imago Dei** bearer. Classical theology replies that the image is a created relation to God ordered to communion, not a threshold of complexity, and that **divine sonship in Christ** is not achievable by artifacts. Even if future systems pass **Turing-like tests**, they remain within the created order of tools, accountable to **human vocation** and the Lord who alone speaks life.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The **Trinity** is the grammar of revelation: the Father sends the **Word**, and the **Spirit** unites hearers to the Son in whom they cry Abba. AI has no place in the **processions ad intra**, and only a derivative one in the **missions ad extra** as a creaturely medium that can carry human words of God. **Divine simplicity and aseity** keep us from positing any external necessity for God's self-communication, guarding against a technological **Pelagianism** that would secure access to God by better methods.

In **Christology**, the incarnate Son is the exegesis of the Father in **John 1.18**, and his risen presence through **Word and sacrament** constitutes the church's knowledge. There can be no **digital incarnation** or sacramental mediation by code, though technologies may assist proclamation of the **hypostatic union** to the ends of the earth. In **Anthropology**, the **imago Dei** both grounds human creativity under the **cultural mandate** of Genesis 1.26–28 and is healed in Christ, while the **noetic effects of sin** and disordered loves skew our tool making, requiring sanctified prudence.

In **Soteriology**, faith comes by hearing in **Romans 10.17**, locating salvation in the Spirit's application of Christ through preached **gospel** rather than through informational access. In **Ecclesiology**, the church is the pillar and buttress of the truth in **1 Timothy 3.15**, charged to guard the **apostolic deposit** and to test spirits, which in a digital age includes testing statistical spirits. In **Eschatology**, the unveiling of Jesus as Lord relativizes **techno-apocalyptic** narratives, summoning the church to hope in the **parousia** rather than in progress or catastrophe.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Practically, churches should adopt a rule of **instrumental reception** under **Word and Spirit**. Use AI to translate sermons, generate reading plans, assist with language learning, accelerate benevolence logistics, and map neighborhood needs, while maintaining **human pastoral presence** and communal discernment. Establish policies that forbid opaque AI authorship of sermons, require disclosure for assistance, and prioritize **lectio continua** and public reading of **Scripture's sufficiency**.

Catechesis should teach media literacy as a form of **wisdom and sanctification**, training congregants to evaluate sources, resist **algorithmic manipulation**, and practice slow, prayerful reading. In academic settings, digital tools should be nested within **ministerial formation**, with emphasis on interleaving computational helps with **Hebrew and Greek** study, memorization, and communal exegesis. Liturgically, we should resist screens that displace **sacramental presence** while receiving projection as aide, keeping the **means of grace** irreducibly embodied.

Ethically, congregations should attend to labor disruption, data justice, and accessibility as matters of **neighbor-love and justice**, following trajectories like the **Rome Call for AI Ethics 2020** while embedding them within a thicker theological account of **providence and sin**. Finally, pastors should preach against **technological idolatry** with the hope of **new creation**, reminding the church that the Lord who spoke in the beginning still speaks today, and that his sheep know his voice amid the din of many models.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Receive artificial intelligence as a fallible instrument within **providence and common grace**, but let the church's knowledge be governed by **Christic revelation, Scriptural sufficiency, and the Spirit's illumination**.
