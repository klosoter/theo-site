# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge viewed the **Holy Spirit** as central to the application of **redemption** within **redemptive history**, emphasizing the Spirit's role in **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the **progressive realization of salvation**. He maintained that the Spirit's work is inseparable from the **covenant of grace** and is consistently active throughout both the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the full outpouring at **Pentecost**.

- "The Holy Spirit is the great gift which Christ procured for his people by his death, and which he bestows upon them as their indwelling life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 & 3

- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the Holy Spirit)
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Role in Regeneration**
    - The Spirit is the efficient cause of the new birth, imparting spiritual life to the elect.
    - Regeneration is not a cooperative act but a sovereign work of the Spirit alone.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemption to individuals in time.
    - This work is necessary due to human inability and total depravity.
    - "Regeneration, therefore, is the act of God, and not the act of man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Continuity of the Spirit’s Work in Redemptive History**
    - The Spirit operated in the Old Testament, though with less fullness than after Pentecost.
    - All true believers in every age are regenerated and sanctified by the same Spirit.
    - The difference between the Old and New is in the measure and manifestation of the Spirit’s presence.
    - The Spirit’s work is unified across the covenants, pointing to the unity of the people of God.
    - "The Spirit was always the source of all spiritual life, but his influences are now more abundant and glorious." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **The Spirit and the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Spirit is the agent who applies the promises of the covenant of grace to believers.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of all covenant blessings.
    - The indwelling of the Spirit is the distinguishing mark of the new covenant community.
    - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in the Spirit’s covenantal work.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the great promise of the new covenant." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Sanctification as the Spirit’s Ongoing Work**
    - Sanctification is a progressive work accomplished by the Spirit in the believer.
    - The Spirit enables mortification of sin and growth in holiness.
    - The means of sanctification include the Word, sacraments, and prayer, empowered by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s work in sanctification is both individual and corporate within the church.
    - "Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit, by which the soul is renewed after the image of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **The Spirit’s Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost marks a climactic stage in redemptive history.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the guarantee (arrabōn) of future glorification.
    - The Spirit’s work will be consummated in the resurrection and final redemption.
    - The church’s mission is empowered and directed by the Spirit until Christ’s return.
    - "The Spirit is given as the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of the **Holy Spirit’s role in redemptive history** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially within the Princeton tradition. His emphasis on the Spirit’s continuity across the covenants and the centrality of the Spirit in **regeneration** and **sanctification** provided a theological foundation for later discussions on the application of redemption. Hodge’s careful exegesis and systematic approach continue to influence evangelical and Reformed understandings of the Spirit’s work in both individual and corporate salvation.
