# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of the **Holy Spirit** within the framework of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the Spirit's role in both the **application of redemption** and the **progressive unfolding of the covenant of grace**, highlighting the Spirit’s work from the Old Testament through the New. Turretin maintained that the Spirit’s operations are essential for **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the **effectual calling** of the elect.

- "The Holy Spirit is the principal efficient cause of regeneration, who inwardly and efficaciously works in the hearts of the elect." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism of the Christian Religion
- Selected sermons and disputations on the work of the Holy Spirit
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context on Turretin’s method)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Role in the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Spirit is active in both Old and New Testament administrations of the covenant.
    - He applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect throughout redemptive history.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is not a novelty of the New Testament but is intensified after Pentecost.
    - The unity of the covenant is preserved through the Spirit’s continuous work.
    - "The Holy Spirit was always the author of faith and sanctification, even under the Old Testament." (Institutes)

2. **Effectual Calling and Regeneration**
    - The Spirit is the efficient cause of regeneration, not merely a moral persuader.
    - Regeneration is a supernatural act, distinct from external calling.
    - The Spirit’s work is necessary to overcome human depravity.
    - Effectual calling is inseparable from the Spirit’s inward operation.
    - "The Spirit does not merely persuade, but powerfully and efficaciously renews the heart." (Institutes)

3. **Progressive Revelation and the Spirit**
    - The Spirit progressively reveals redemptive truth across history.
    - Old Testament believers had the Spirit, but with less clarity and fullness.
    - The outpouring at Pentecost marks a new epoch in redemptive history.
    - The Spirit’s illumination is essential for understanding revelation.
    - "The difference is not of substance, but of degree and clarity in the administration of the Spirit." (Institutes)

4. **Sanctification and Preservation**
    - The Spirit sanctifies believers, enabling growth in holiness.
    - Sanctification is a lifelong process, rooted in union with Christ.
    - The Spirit preserves the elect, ensuring perseverance to the end.
    - Assurance of salvation is a fruit of the Spirit’s testimony.
    - "Sanctification is begun by the Spirit and carried on to perfection in glory." (Institutes)

5. **The Spirit and the Means of Grace**
    - The Spirit works through ordinary means: Word, sacraments, and prayer.
    - The efficacy of the means depends on the Spirit’s inward operation.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ through faith.
    - The church is the sphere of the Spirit’s ordinary activity in redemptive history.
    - "The Spirit is not tied to the means, but ordinarily works by them." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **Spirit’s role in redemptive history** shaped later Reformed theology, especially regarding the continuity and development of the **covenant of grace**. His careful distinctions between the Spirit’s work in different epochs influenced both confessional standards and subsequent theologians. Turretin’s emphasis on the Spirit’s sovereign, effectual work remains foundational for Reformed understandings of **regeneration** and **sanctification**. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the Spirit’s centrality in salvation and the life of the church.
