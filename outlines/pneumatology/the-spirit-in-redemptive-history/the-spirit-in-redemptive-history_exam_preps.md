### TITLE
The Eschatological Spirit: From Creation to Consummation in the History of Redemption

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How the one, eternal Holy Spirit acts in a historically progressive, covenantal way so that his work is truly new in Christ and Pentecost without denying **trinitarian unity**, **immutability**, or **ordo salutis** coherence.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, Herman Bavinck, Richard Gaffin.
- Relevant traditions: Nicene and Augustinian trinitarianism, Reformation and post-Reformation **federal theology**, Dutch neo-Calvinism, classic Reformed biblical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: extent of the Spirit’s presence and regeneration in the Old Testament, relation of **union with Christ** to the Spirit, ordo salutis vs historia salutis, continuity and discontinuity of gifts and indwelling.
  - External: anti-trinitarian and liberal historicist pneumatologies, Pentecostal and sacramentalist revisions of the Spirit’s role in redemptive history.
  - Contemporary: charismatic vs cessationist tensions, already–not yet eschatology and spiritual gifts, the Spirit’s role in ecclesiology and mission.
- Defended position: In continuity with Augustinian and Reformed dogmatics, I will argue that the Spirit is the eschatological gift of the risen Christ whose work is one and the same in all ages as to **substance of salvation**, yet intensively and extensively heightened in the new covenant economy as the climactic realization of the kingdom.

### ESSAY
The phrase “the Spirit in redemptive history” names not an abstract doctrine of the third person of the Trinity, but the concrete, covenantal way the Holy Spirit acts from creation to consummation, ordered to Christ and his kingdom. To speak properly of the Spirit in redemptive history is to locate pneumatology within the **historia salutis**, the once-for-all history of God’s saving deeds, and then to relate that to the **ordo salutis**, the application of redemption to individuals. A defensible account must show both that the Spirit is fully God, coequal and coeternal with the Father and the Son, and that his work truly unfolds historically so that there is real newness at Pentecost and in the new covenant without compromising **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, or the unity of salvation across the covenants.

Augustine is decisive for setting the metaphysical grammar within which such a historical account can be made. Writing in the context of the post-Nicene consolidation of trinitarian orthodoxy, Augustine labored to articulate how the Spirit is consubstantial with Father and Son while also being the gift of God poured out in time. His central move is to define the Spirit as the **nexus amoris**, the mutual love and gift between Father and Son, so that the Spirit is both God given and the giver God. For Augustine the external missions of the Son and the Spirit in history manifest, but do not alter, their eternal processions. This means that when the Spirit is poured out at Pentecost, no new hypostasis emerges, no new attribute arises in God; rather, a new historical relation of rational creatures to the unchanging triune God is constituted.

An examiner might press: does Augustine’s emphasis on the Spirit as love and gift risk collapsing the Spirit into a mere relation or effect, rather than a distinct person? Augustine avoids this by insisting on the Spirit’s personal subsistence and by rooting his historical coming in the eternal procession from Father and Son. The historical sending presupposes the eternal being. This metaphysical grounding makes possible any subsequent Reformed insistence that the Spirit’s redemptive-historical newness is a matter of **economic** administration rather than ontological composition in God.

Augustine’s second decisive contribution for redemptive history is his reading of Scripture as a unified economy that moves from the old to the new covenant under the one Spirit. He interprets the various Old Testament theophanies and charismatic empowerments as the work of the Spirit condescending to the weakness of a childish people, preparing for the fullness that comes in Christ. Already here we see a proto-typological and covenantal reading: the same Spirit who hovered over the waters, came upon the prophets, and filled the tabernacle, is the Spirit poured out on all flesh in the last days. Yet Augustine is relatively less developed on the fine-grained differences between the Spirit’s work before and after Christ in terms of the application of salvation. That task falls historically to the Reformation.

John Calvin stands as a second decisive figure, since he not only receives Augustinian trinitarianism but reshapes the entire structure of soteriology around the Spirit as the bond of **union with Christ**. For Calvin there is no benefit of Christ that is not communicated by the Spirit. Justification, sanctification, adoption, perseverance, and even faith itself are effects of the Spirit’s uniting us to the risen Christ. This immediately relocates pneumatology: the Spirit is not an add-on doctrine of experience after Christology but is the personal agent who executes in history what Christ accomplished once for all. Calvin thus integrates the **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** under a trinitarian framework: the Father decrees and gives the Son, the Son accomplishes redemption in history, and the Spirit applies that redemption to the elect.

In terms of redemptive history proper, Calvin stresses both continuity and discontinuity of the Spirit’s work under the old and new covenants. Against Anabaptist and radical conceptions, he argues that the Old Testament saints were truly regenerated by the same Spirit and shared the same **substance of the covenant**. Abraham had the same Christ and the same Spirit as believers after Pentecost as to saving grace. Yet Calvin is equally insistent that there is a “new and uncommon” grace in the new covenant: the Spirit is more richly and extensively given after the ascension of Christ. Calvin typically locates the difference in the measure and clarity of operation, not in different kinds of salvation.

A likely examiner challenge arises here: if the Spirit’s work in regeneration and faith is substantially the same before and after Pentecost, what is genuinely new about Pentecost? Does Calvin’s view not flatten the significance of Acts 2? Calvin’s answer, taken up later in the Reformed tradition, turns on **eschatological fullness** and the corporate, ecclesial dimension. The newness consists not in a first introduction of the Spirit as such, but in a heightened, eschatological effusion tied to the finished work and exaltation of Christ. The Spirit now comes as the Spirit of the glorified Christ, sealing a completed redemption and extending it to all nations, constituting a catholic church in a way not seen under the pedagogical constraints of the Mosaic economy. The difference is covenantal-administrative and eschatological, not ontological.

Calvin also stands over against external opponents in his day whose positions reverberate into contemporary debates. Against Rome, he denies that the Spirit is bound ex opere operato to sacramental acts. The Spirit uses Word and sacrament as ordained means, but remains sovereign and free, giving life where and when he pleases. Against the Libertines and enthusiasts, he insists that the Spirit never speaks apart from or contrary to Scripture. This dual emphasis sets a Reformed trajectory in which the Spirit is tied to the **means of grace** and the inscripturated Word, while remaining the living, sovereign agent who renews hearts and gathers the church. It provides a key control against later charismatic distortions that oppose Spirit and Scripture, yet also against rationalist tendencies that reduce the Spirit to an abstract principle identical with the Word.

If Augustine and Calvin provide the dogmatic grammar and soteriological center, Geerhardus Vos decisively develops the explicitly redemptive-historical and eschatological shape of the Spirit’s work. Writing as the father of Reformed biblical theology in the modern context of liberal historicism, Vos insisted that Scripture itself is a record of progressive revelation and progressive realization of the kingdom. For Vos, the Spirit is not only the agent of individual renewal but is the eschatological power of the age to come, intruding into history in provisional and climactic ways. His work on **eschatology** and the kingdom highlights that from the beginning, the Spirit’s presence is ordered to a final, higher state of communion, not merely to restoring a static Eden.

Vos’s reading of the Garden of Eden is especially significant. Adam, as federal head, enjoys the presence of the Spirit as the bond of original life and communion with God, but not yet the unlosable, consummated fullness that would have been granted upon obedience. The Spirit is already the principle of higher, heavenly life. This means that even before sin, the Spirit’s role is eschatological. After the fall, the Spirit’s operations in the patriarchs, prophets, and Israel’s institutions are anticipatory intrusions of that eschatological order, typological previews of the final kingdom. Pentecost, for Vos, is the decisive inbreaking of the age to come, when the Spirit of the glorified Christ is poured out in a way that is both climactic in redemptive history and determinative for the already–not yet structure of the church’s existence.

An examiner might ask: does this eschatological emphasis jeopardize the unity of salvation across the covenants by making Old Testament experience qualitatively inferior? Vos avoids this by retaining the classic Reformed distinction between **substance** and **administration** of the covenant of grace. The same Christ and the same Spirit save believers in both testaments, but the form of revelation and the intensity and scope of the Spirit’s work differ according to the unfolding of the kingdom. The unity lies in the one Mediator and one Spirit; the diversity lies in the stages of the kingdom’s advance and the typological forms employed.

Herman Bavinck, working in the same Dutch neo-Calvinist milieu but with a more systematic bent, plays a complementary decisive role. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck articulates a richly trinitarian and organic doctrine of the Spirit in creation and re-creation. He refuses to isolate redemptive pneumatology from the Spirit’s role as the breath of God in creation, providence, culture, and common grace. For Bavinck the Spirit orders and adorns the original creation, sustains all life, equips human beings with gifts and capacities, and then, in the sphere of re-creation, regenerates and sanctifies. This broader canvas guards against an overly individualistic or churchly construal of redemptive history. History is one unified theater of the triune God’s work, and the Spirit’s redemptive operations are particular intensifications of his more general activity.

Yet Bavinck is equally clear that the Spirit’s new covenant work is unique. He underscores the link between the Spirit and Christ’s exaltation, aligning with the Reformed emphasis that the Spirit is the gift of the ascended Lord. The **Spirit of adoption**, poured out on sons and daughters, presupposes the finished obedience and resurrection of the Son. This yields a strong Christological tether for all redemptive-historical pneumatology: whatever we say about the Spirit’s work in history must be ordered to Christ’s mediatorial office and stages of humiliation and exaltation.

Bavinck also faces contemporary external and internal challenges head-on. Against liberal theology that had reduced the Spirit to the immanent religious consciousness of the community or the process of culture, Bavinck insists on the Spirit’s personal, supernatural, and miraculous character. The church is not merely the self-unfolding of the religious idea; it is the work of the Spirit applying Christ’s merits in space and time. At the same time, Bavinck resists pietistic subjectivism by stressing that the Spirit binds believers to the concrete Word and sacraments, and that his redemptive-historical work is corporate and ecclesial before it is individual. This is crucial for addressing modern evangelical tendencies to privatize the Spirit as a matter of inner experience severed from the church’s historical life.

Richard Gaffin stands as a contemporary decisive figure within the Westminster and broader Reformed tradition, synthesizing these lines into a robust Pauline and redemptive-historical framework. His work on the resurrection and the Holy Spirit has re-centered the discussion on the Spirit’s role in uniting believers to the once-for-all events of Christ’s death and resurrection. For Gaffin, the Spirit is first of all the eschatological gift the exalted Christ receives and then pours out upon his body. The ordo salutis is not a sequence of quasi-timeless steps, but the existential synchronization of the believer’s history with the history of Christ. To be justified and sanctified is to be brought by the Spirit into the already-accomplished resurrection-life of Christ.

Gaffin’s emphasis has major implications for internal debates. It sharpens the conviction that **union with Christ** is central and that all benefits flow from that union. It also challenges models of the Christian life that separate justification and sanctification as distinct gifts that could be temporally or logically pried apart. In Gaffin’s reading of Romans and Galatians, the Spirit is the Spirit of the crucified and risen Christ, and to receive the Spirit is to participate in Christ’s once-for-all saving acts. This holds together the objective, historical dimension and the subjective, experiential dimension in a way that responds to both antinomianism and legalism.

On the controversial question of the Spirit and charismatic gifts, Gaffin’s redemptive-historical method is likewise significant. He argues that the miraculous, revelatory gifts in the apostolic era are closely bound to the unique, foundational period of inscripturation and canon formation. Their primary function is to bear original, foundational witness to the once-for-all Christ event. With the closure of canon, the Spirit’s normative ministry is through the apostolic Word, and the extraordinary revelatory gifts cease. This is not a denial that the Spirit still heals or acts powerfully, but a claim about the redemptive-historical uniqueness of apostles and prophets and the sufficiency of Scripture. When examiners test this point, the key is to ground cessation not in a fear of the Spirit’s sovereignty but in the completed foundation of the church and the integrity of the **apostolic office** as non-repeatable.

External debates at this contemporary level involve both Pentecostal-charismatic and sacramentalist positions. Pentecostal theologies often posit a “second blessing” baptism in the Spirit, temporally distinct from conversion, as a higher stage of spiritual life typically evidenced by tongues. Sacramentalist traditions sometimes construe the Spirit’s new covenant presence as so bound to the institutional church and sacramental rites that regenerate life is virtually equated with ecclesial membership. Against the former, a redemptive-historical Reformed position insists, on Pauline grounds, that every believer has the Spirit, that Spirit-baptism is coextensive with incorporation into Christ and his body, and that while experiences of filling and empowerment vary, there are not two classes of Christians. Against the latter, it affirms the Spirit’s free and sovereign work beyond visible boundaries, while maintaining that his ordinary pattern is to accompany Word and sacrament in the church.

The internal debates on the Spirit in the Old Testament must also be faced candidly. Some Reformed theologians have posited that Old Testament believers lacked permanent indwelling of the Spirit and that regeneration proper is a new covenant reality. Others argue, in line with Calvin, that regeneration and indwelling were already present, if under shadows. In defending the latter view, I would argue that passages like Psalm 51, where David pleads that God not take his Holy Spirit from him, and descriptions of circumcision of heart and the law written on the heart, imply genuinely regenerating work before Pentecost. The promises of Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 36 then intensify and universalize this reality, focusing on the corporate renewal of the people and the removal of the pedagogical burdens of the Mosaic system. The Spirit’s indwelling is thus not entirely absent before, but is now given in eschatological fullness to all members of the new covenant, from the least to the greatest.

This stance also helps avoid a Christologically problematic dichotomy whereby Old Testament saints would be saved without full participation in Christ and his Spirit. If there is one Mediator and one salvation, then the Spirit must have been effectually applying Christ’s future work proleptically to those saints. The redemptive-historical newness at Pentecost is therefore not the beginning of the Spirit’s saving work but its climactic expansion and clarification in light of the finished cross and empty tomb.

Throughout, the Spirit in redemptive history is inseparable from **covenant** and **kingdom**. The Spirit hovers over the primal chaos, fashions Israel as a priestly kingdom, empowers judges and kings, inspires prophets, rests upon the Servant, leads the Son, raises Christ from the dead, and then constitutes the church as a Spirit-filled, missionary people gathered from all nations. Ecclesiology is thus a pneumatological locus: the one, holy, catholic, apostolic church is the historical form that the Spirit’s redemptive work assumes. Mission too is pneumatological: the Spirit drives the church outward, convicts the world, and gathers the elect. A robust doctrine of the Spirit in redemptive history will therefore resist both a purely individual, experience-centered piety and a purely institutional, sacramental ecclesiology, and instead see the church as the living, Spirit-formed body of Christ existing between the already and the not yet.

The contemporary stress points for this doctrine cannot be ignored. In a secular age, some reduce the Spirit to immanent processes of community formation or psychological uplift. Others, reacting against sterile formalism, absolutize spectacular experiences as the mark of the Spirit’s presence. A Reformed redemptive-historical position must answer both by returning to the **trinitarian economy**. The Spirit is the Spirit of the crucified and risen Christ, sent from the Father. He glorifies Christ, illumines Scripture, convicts of sin, grants faith and repentance, incorporates believers into the church, and conforms them to the image of the Son. His redemptive-historical work is historically located: climaxing in Christ’s exaltation and Pentecost, carrying forward in the missionary expansion of the church, and consummated when Christ returns and the Spirit’s work of resurrection and renewal is complete.

In defending this position under examination, the essential through-line is that the Spirit’s work is one, trinitarian, Christ-centered, covenantal, and eschatological. Augustine guards the ontological unity and the notion of **mission** grounded in procession. Calvin centers union with Christ and insists on one Spirit across the covenants with heightened new covenant effusion. Vos makes explicit the eschatological and redemptive-historical structure of the Spirit’s operations from Eden to consummation. Bavinck widens the horizon to include creation and culture, while still affirming the newness of the Spirit of adoption. Gaffin crystallizes the Pauline insight that the Spirit is the eschatological gift of the risen Christ who unites believers to his once-for-all history and that the apostolic age of revelatory gifts is foundational and non-repeatable.

The Spirit in redemptive history is therefore not an optional appendix to Christian doctrine but the very way the triune God realizes his eternal counsel in time. To confess the Holy Spirit in the creed is to confess that God does not remain remote but comes in power, before the face of Christ, to bring about a new creation. The same Spirit who began to hover over the formless deep now broods over the history of redemption, bringing to completion the purposes of the Father in the Son, until the earth is filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Spirit in redemptive history is the one, eternal Holy Spirit acting in a progressive, covenantal, and eschatological way to apply and realize the work of Christ from creation to consummation, with real newness at Pentecost that does not compromise **trinitarian unity** or **immutability**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: grounds the Spirit’s historical mission in eternal procession, defines him as love and gift, safeguards **divine simplicity** and personal distinctness.
  - Calvin: centers the Spirit as the bond of **union with Christ**, affirms one Spirit and one salvation across covenants with heightened new covenant effusion, ties Spirit to Word and means of grace.
  - Vos: develops explicit **redemptive-historical** and **eschatological** reading of the Spirit’s work from Eden to Pentecost, emphasizes kingdom and already–not yet structure.
  - Bavinck: integrates creation and redemption under the Spirit’s agency, resists liberal and pietistic distortions, stresses the Spirit of the exalted Christ and the church.
  - Gaffin: articulates Spirit as eschatological gift of the risen Christ who unites believers to his once-for-all history, argues for foundational, non-repeatable revelatory gifts.
- Debates:
  - Internal: continuity and discontinuity of regeneration and indwelling before and after Pentecost; relation of **ordo salutis** to **historia salutis**; extent and cessation of charismatic gifts.
  - External: anti-trinitarian and liberal reductions of the Spirit; Pentecostal “second blessing” baptism and tongues; sacramentalist over-identification of Spirit with institutional church.
  - Contemporary: charismatic vs cessationist practice; experientialism vs formalism; the Spirit’s role in mission, ecclesiology, and culture.
- Defended position: One Christ, one Spirit, one salvation in all ages as to the **substance of the covenant of grace**, with Pentecost marking the climactic, eschatological effusion of the Spirit of the risen Christ, intensifying and universalizing his work without introducing a different kind of salvation or compromising classical trinitarian theology.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - What is genuinely new about Pentecost if Old Testament saints were regenerated?  
    Answer: Not a first introduction of the Spirit, but an eschatological intensification and universalization of his presence tied to Christ’s finished work and exaltation, especially in corporate, catholic scope.
  - How do you relate ordo salutis and historia salutis in the Spirit’s work?  
    Answer: The Spirit applies to individuals, in union with Christ, the once-for-all events of Christ’s history; the ordo is the existential appropriation of the historia.
  - Why affirm cessation of revelatory gifts?  
    Answer: Because apostles and prophets and their gifts are foundational and tied to inscripturation; with the completed canon, the Spirit’s normative revelatory ministry is through Scripture.
  - Did Old Testament believers have the Spirit indwelling them?  
    Answer: Yes, as to regenerating and indwelling grace, though under shadowy, limited administration; new covenant promises heighten and broaden that reality to all covenant members.
  - How does this doctrine shape ecclesiology and mission?  
    Answer: The church is the Spirit-constituted body of Christ dwelling in the already–not yet, and mission is the Spirit’s extension of Christ’s reign through Word, sacrament, and witness to all nations.
