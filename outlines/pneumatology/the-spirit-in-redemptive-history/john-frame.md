# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame emphasizes the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in the unfolding of **redemptive history**, highlighting the Spirit’s role in **revelation**, **regeneration**, and the application of **redemption**. He situates the Spirit’s work within the broader framework of the **Trinity** and the **covenantal administration** of salvation, arguing that the Spirit is active from creation through consummation, empowering God’s people and ensuring the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purposes.

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s robust articulation of the **Spirit’s role in redemptive history** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in emphasizing the Spirit’s presence from creation to consummation. His integration of the Spirit’s work with **covenant theology** and the **trinitarian framework** has provided clarity and depth for understanding the Spirit’s activity in both revelation and redemption. Frame’s influence is evident in the renewed focus on the Spirit’s application of salvation and the practical outworking of redemptive history in the life of the church.
