# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray emphasized the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in the unfolding of **redemptive history**, particularly in relation to the application of **redemption** and the accomplishment of **union with Christ**. He viewed the Spirit as the agent who actualizes the benefits of **Christ’s work** in the lives of believers, integrating the Spirit’s role within the broader framework of **covenant theology** and the **ordo salutis**.

- "The Holy Spirit is the agent through whom all the redemptive blessings of the covenant are bestowed and applied." ("Redemption—Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption—Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- "The Agency of the Holy Spirit" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit as the Agent of Application**
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s accomplished redemption to the elect.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for **regeneration**, **faith**, and **sanctification**.
    - Application of redemption is not automatic but is personally effected by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s agency ensures the efficacy and certainty of salvation for God’s people.
    - "It is by the Holy Spirit that the redemption secured by Christ is brought to fruition in the hearts and lives of men." (Redemption—Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Union with Christ by the Spirit**
    - Union with Christ is the central reality of salvation, effected by the Spirit.
    - All saving benefits flow from this Spirit-wrought union.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ in both his death and resurrection.
    - This union is both mystical and vital, grounding all aspects of the Christian life.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption—Accomplished and Applied)

3. **The Spirit in Redemptive History**
    - The Spirit’s work is progressive and climactic in redemptive history.
    - Old Testament anticipation is fulfilled in the outpouring at Pentecost.
    - The Spirit inaugurates the new age and empowers the church’s mission.
    - The Spirit’s presence marks the eschatological fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - "Pentecost is the great epochal event of redemptive history in respect of the Holy Spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **The Spirit and the Ordo Salutis**
    - The Spirit is operative at every stage of the **ordo salutis** (order of salvation).
    - Regeneration, effectual calling, faith, justification, adoption, and sanctification are all Spirit-wrought.
    - The Spirit’s work is both sovereign and effectual, ensuring the application of redemption.
    - The ordo salutis is not merely logical but reflects the Spirit’s dynamic activity.
    - "Every phase of the application of redemption is to be traced to the Holy Spirit." (Redemption—Accomplished and Applied)

5. **The Spirit and Covenant Theology**
    - The Spirit’s work is integral to the unfolding of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Spirit mediates the blessings promised in the covenant to God’s people.
    - The new covenant is characterized by the Spirit’s indwelling and transforming power.
    - The Spirit’s role is both corporate (in the church) and individual (in believers).
    - "The Holy Spirit is the bond of communion in the covenant relationship." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **Holy Spirit’s role in redemptive history** has shaped Reformed soteriology and contemporary discussions of the **ordo salutis**. His integration of the Spirit’s work with **union with Christ** and **covenant theology** has provided a framework for understanding the Spirit’s ongoing ministry in both the individual and the church. Murray’s careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to influence systematic theology and the Reformed tradition’s approach to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
