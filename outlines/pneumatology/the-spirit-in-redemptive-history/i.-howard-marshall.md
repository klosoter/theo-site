I. Howard Marshall emphasized the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in the unfolding of **redemptive history**, especially within the **Lukan corpus**. He argued that the Spirit’s work is both continuous with the Old Testament and climactically fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus and the life of the early **church**, marking the **inauguration of the new age** and empowering believers for mission.

- "The coming of the Spirit at Pentecost marks the decisive turning-point in the history of salvation." (The Acts of the Apostles)

## Legacy and Impact

Marshall’s scholarship significantly shaped contemporary understanding of **pneumatology** in the context of **redemptive history**, especially within Lukan studies. His careful exegesis and theological synthesis highlighted the Spirit’s role in both the continuity and fulfillment of God’s saving purposes. Marshall’s work continues to influence evangelical and ecumenical discussions on the Spirit’s work in the church and the world.
