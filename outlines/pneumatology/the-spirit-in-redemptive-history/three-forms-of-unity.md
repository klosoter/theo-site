# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity present a coherent Reformed understanding of the **Holy Spirit’s role in redemptive history**, emphasizing the Spirit’s work in **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the application of **Christ’s benefits** to the elect. The confessions articulate the Spirit’s presence throughout both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the Spirit’s agency in uniting believers to Christ and effecting the **ordo salutis** within the covenant community.

- "The Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces Jesus Christ with all His merits, makes Him our own, and no longer leaves us to seek for anything apart from Him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 21)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8, 9, 22–24, 27–35
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), notably Q&A 1, 8, 21, 53, 65–66, 70, 76, 86, 114–115
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), particularly Heads III/IV and V

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit applies Christ’s redemption**
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making His benefits effective in their lives.
    - Faith, as the instrument of justification, is itself a gift of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit works inwardly, effecting regeneration and renewal.
    - The Spirit’s work is necessary for the appropriation of salvation.
    - "We believe that, to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery, the Holy Ghost kindles in our hearts an upright faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

2. **The Spirit operates through the means of grace**
    - The Spirit uses the preaching of the Word and the sacraments to strengthen faith.
    - The sacraments are visible signs and seals of the Spirit’s inward work.
    - The efficacy of the means of grace depends on the Spirit’s operation, not on the elements themselves.
    - The Spirit’s presence is essential for the means of grace to be effectual.
    - "The Holy Ghost works by these means in our hearts, but not apart from them." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 65)

3. **The Spirit’s work is sovereign and effectual**
    - Regeneration is a sovereign act of the Spirit, not dependent on human will.
    - The Spirit irresistibly draws the elect to faith and perseverance.
    - The Spirit’s grace cannot be thwarted by human resistance.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s testimony and sealing.
    - "This grace of regeneration does not treat men as senseless stocks and blocks, nor take away their will... but spiritually quickens, heals, corrects, and at the same time sweetly and powerfully bends it." (Canons of Dort, III/IV.16)

4. **The Spirit’s presence in both Old and New Covenants**
    - The Spirit was active among the faithful before Christ’s incarnation.
    - Old Testament believers were regenerated and sanctified by the same Spirit.
    - The difference between the covenants is one of degree, not kind, regarding the Spirit’s work.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is a mark of the true church in every age.
    - "The Holy Ghost has always been with the Church, from the beginning of the world." (Belgic Confession, Art. 27)

5. **The Spirit produces sanctification and good works**
    - Sanctification is the fruit of the Spirit’s indwelling, not human effort alone.
    - Good works are evidence of the Spirit’s renewing power in believers.
    - The Spirit enables believers to mortify sin and live in gratitude.
    - The Christian life is marked by ongoing dependence on the Spirit’s strength.
    - "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 64)

These confessions continue to serve as foundational standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring that the Spirit’s centrality in salvation and sanctification remains a hallmark of Reformed identity.
