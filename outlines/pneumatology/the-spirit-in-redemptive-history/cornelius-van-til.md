# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til understood the role of the **Holy Spirit** in **redemptive history** as inseparable from the self-revelation of the **triune God** and the accomplishment and application of **redemption**. He emphasized the Spirit’s work in both **special revelation** and the **regeneration** of the elect, situating the Spirit’s activity within the unfolding of the **covenant of grace** and the consummation of God’s redemptive plan in history.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Role in Special Revelation**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent of inspiration and illumination in the giving and understanding of **Scripture**.
    - The Spirit ensures the unity and coherence of **redemptive history** as it unfolds in the biblical narrative.
    - Without the Spirit’s work, fallen humanity cannot rightly apprehend God’s revelation.
    - The Spirit’s testimony is necessary for the certainty and authority of **special revelation**.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who must open the eyes of men to see the truth of Scripture." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Redemptive History as Trinitarian**
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the work of the **Father** and **Son** in the economy of redemption.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **Christ’s redemptive work** to the elect throughout history.
    - All acts of redemption in history are ultimately acts of the triune God, not isolated to one Person.
    - The Spirit’s presence is essential in every stage of the **covenant of grace**.
    - "The work of redemption is Trinitarian in character, and the Spirit applies what the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **The Spirit and the Noetic Effects of Sin**
    - Human knowledge is corrupted by sin and requires the Spirit’s renewing work for true understanding.
    - The Spirit restores the **imago Dei** in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - Regeneration by the Spirit is necessary for any saving knowledge of God.
    - The Spirit enables believers to interpret reality according to the truth of **redemptive history**.
    - "Only by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit can man interpret the facts of the universe aright." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **The Spirit’s Role in Covenant Community**
    - The Spirit forms and sustains the **covenant people** across redemptive epochs.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and to one another in the church.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the guarantee of the new creation and the consummation of redemption.
    - The Spirit empowers the church’s witness in the world as part of God’s redemptive mission.
    - "The church is the body of Christ, animated and empowered by the Holy Spirit." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetics and the Spirit’s Testimony**
    - The Spirit is the ultimate ground of certainty in **Christian epistemology**.
    - Apologetic encounter depends on the Spirit’s sovereign work to convict and regenerate.
    - The Spirit’s internal witness is necessary for the acceptance of the gospel’s truth.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is overcome only by the Spirit’s redemptive action.
    - "No argument can bring men to Christ apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit." (Christian Apologetics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robustly **Trinitarian** and redemptive-historical understanding of the Spirit has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to revelation, epistemology, and apologetics. His emphasis on the Spirit’s indispensable role in both the accomplishment and application of redemption continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **revelation**, **regeneration**, and the **covenant community**. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of presuppositional apologetics and the integration of redemptive history into systematic theology.
