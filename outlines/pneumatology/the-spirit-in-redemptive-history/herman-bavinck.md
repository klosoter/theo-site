## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust doctrine of the **Holy Spirit** in redemptive history has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the Spirit’s comprehensive role in both creation and redemption. His integration of the Spirit’s work across the entire sweep of biblical history influenced later neo-Calvinist and evangelical theologians. Bavinck’s emphasis on the Spirit’s unifying presence in **revelation**, **salvation**, and **eschatology** continues to inform contemporary discussions on pneumatology and the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
