# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the dynamic and personal work of the **Holy Spirit** within the unfolding of **redemptive history**, highlighting the Spirit’s role in mediating the presence of Christ and actualizing **revelation** in the believer. He viewed the Spirit as central to the **event of faith**, enabling genuine encounter with God and participation in the **new creation** inaugurated by Christ. Brunner’s theology resists reducing the Spirit to an impersonal force, instead stressing the Spirit’s relational and transformative agency in the history of salvation.

- "The Holy Spirit is the power of the new life, the presence of Christ Himself in the believer." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter
- Revelation and Reason

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit as the Agent of Revelation**
    - The **Holy Spirit** makes the objective revelation of God subjectively real to individuals.
    - Revelation is not merely propositional but an **event** in which the Spirit brings about personal encounter.
    - The Spirit bridges the gap between God’s transcendence and human experience.
    - Without the Spirit, the knowledge of God remains abstract and impersonal.
    - "Revelation becomes real for us only through the Holy Spirit." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **The Spirit and the Event of Faith**
    - Faith is not a human achievement but a response enabled by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit awakens and sustains faith within the context of **redemptive history**.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for the existential appropriation of salvation.
    - Faith is always a personal encounter, never a mere assent to doctrine.
    - "Faith is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, not our own work." (The Mediator)

3. **The Spirit and Christocentric Redemption**
    - The Spirit’s mission is inseparable from the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemptive work to believers.
    - Brunner rejects any separation between the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit brings about the new creation inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, making His work effective in us." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **The Spirit and the New Community**
    - The Spirit forms and sustains the **church** as the fellowship of the reconciled.
    - The Spirit’s presence is manifest in the communal life and mission of believers.
    - The church is not a static institution but a dynamic reality shaped by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit enables genuine love and unity within the body of Christ.
    - "The Church is the creation of the Holy Spirit, the fellowship of those who are in Christ." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **The Spirit’s Eschatological Role**
    - The Spirit is the pledge and foretaste of the **eschatological** fulfillment of redemption.
    - The Spirit’s presence points believers toward the consummation of God’s purposes in history.
    - The Spirit empowers hope and perseverance amid the tension of the “already” and “not yet.”
    - The Spirit’s work anticipates the final renewal of all things in Christ.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the guarantee of the coming Kingdom, the power of the future in the present." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **Holy Spirit** in redemptive history contributed significantly to 20th-century discussions on revelation, faith, and the nature of the church. His emphasis on the Spirit’s personal and relational agency influenced later neo-orthodox and existential theologians. While sometimes overshadowed by Barth, Brunner’s focus on the Spirit’s role in actualizing revelation and forming Christian community remains a vital resource for understanding the dynamic interplay between **revelation**, faith, and history.
