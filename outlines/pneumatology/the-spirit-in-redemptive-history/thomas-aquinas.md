# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas situates the **Holy Spirit** within the broader framework of **Trinitarian theology** and **salvation history**, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in both the **inspiration of Scripture** and the **sanctification** of believers. For Aquinas, the Spirit is the bond of love within the **Godhead** and the agent who actualizes the effects of **grace** throughout **redemptive history**, especially in the life of the Church.

- "The Holy Spirit is given to men in order that they may be moved by Him to act." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 68, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology of the **Holy Spirit** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in articulating the Spirit’s role in both **Trinitarian relations** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**. His synthesis of patristic sources and Aristotelian philosophy provided a durable framework for understanding the Spirit’s work in **inspiration, sanctification, and ecclesiology**. Later Catholic and Protestant theologians have engaged Aquinas’s insights, ensuring his ongoing influence in discussions of pneumatology and salvation history.
