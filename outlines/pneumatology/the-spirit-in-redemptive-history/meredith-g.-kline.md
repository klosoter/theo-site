# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a robust biblical-theological framework in which the **Holy Spirit** is central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the Spirit’s role in both the **old covenant** and **new covenant** economies, highlighting the Spirit’s work in **creation**, **covenant administration**, and the **eschatological consummation**. Kline’s approach situates the Spirit as the divine agent who brings about the **kingdom of God** through the historical progression of God’s covenants.

- "The Spirit is the divine executor of the kingdom program, effecting both creation and re-creation in redemptive history." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit as Creator and Consummator**
    - The Spirit is active in both the original creation and the new creation.
    - Kline links the Spirit’s work in Genesis to the eschatological renewal of all things.
    - The Spirit’s hovering in Genesis 1 prefigures His role in redemptive re-creation.
    - The consummation of history is marked by the Spirit’s transformative presence.
    - "The Spirit who hovered over the primal waters is the same who brings the new creation to its telos." (Images of the Spirit)

2. **The Spirit and Covenant Administration**
    - The Spirit is the divine agent who mediates covenant blessings and curses.
    - In both old and new covenants, the Spirit authenticates and empowers God’s people.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the distinguishing mark of the covenant community.
    - Covenant signs (e.g., circumcision, baptism) are linked to the Spirit’s work.
    - "The covenant community is constituted and sustained by the Spirit’s indwelling." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Typology and the Spirit’s Redemptive Work**
    - Kline emphasizes typological patterns in redemptive history, with the Spirit as the unifying agent.
    - Old Testament types (e.g., the tabernacle, the exodus) are fulfilled by the Spirit’s work in Christ and the church.
    - The Spirit’s activity in Israel prefigures His eschatological outpouring.
    - Typology reveals the continuity and escalation of the Spirit’s redemptive mission.
    - "Typology is the Spirit’s artistry in the tapestry of redemption." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Eschatology and the Spirit**
    - The Spirit inaugurates the age to come within history, especially at Pentecost.
    - The Spirit’s outpouring is both a fulfillment and a foretaste of the final consummation.
    - Kline connects the Spirit’s eschatological role to the kingdom’s arrival and the defeat of evil.
    - The Spirit empowers the church as the vanguard of the new creation.
    - "The eschatological Spirit is the pledge and power of the world to come." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

5. **The Spirit and Kingdom Warfare**
    - The Spirit equips God’s people for spiritual conflict throughout redemptive history.
    - The Spirit’s presence is associated with the conquest motif, from Joshua to Christ.
    - Spiritual warfare is interpreted through the lens of the Spirit’s kingdom-establishing work.
    - The final victory over evil is accomplished by the Spirit’s power.
    - "The Spirit is the divine warrior who secures the triumph of the kingdom." (Images of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s biblical-theological approach has profoundly shaped Reformed understanding of the **Spirit’s role in redemptive history**, especially through his covenantal and typological insights. His work has influenced generations of scholars in the fields of **biblical theology**, covenant theology, and eschatology. Kline’s emphasis on the Spirit as both creator and consummator continues to inform contemporary discussions on the unity of Scripture and the unfolding of God’s kingdom. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of redemptive-historical hermeneutics within the Reformed tradition.
