# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther viewed the **Holy Spirit** as central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**, emphasizing the Spirit’s work in applying **justification by faith** and forming the **church** as the community of the redeemed. For Luther, the Spirit operates through the **Word of God** and the **means of grace**, effecting regeneration and sanctification in believers and guiding the church throughout history.

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s theology of the **Holy Spirit** in redemptive history shaped Protestant understandings of the Spirit’s role in **justification**, **sanctification**, and the life of the **church**. His insistence on the Spirit’s inseparable connection to the **Word and sacraments** became foundational for Lutheran and broader Reformation thought. Luther’s Christ-centered pneumatology continues to influence discussions on the Spirit’s work in salvation and the ongoing renewal of the church.
