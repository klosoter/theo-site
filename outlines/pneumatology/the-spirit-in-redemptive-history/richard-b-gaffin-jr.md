# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **the Holy Spirit** emphasizes the Spirit’s central role in **redemptive history**, particularly as it relates to **union with Christ**, **eschatology**, and the application of **salvation**. Gaffin argues that the work of the Spirit is inseparable from the accomplishment and application of redemption, highlighting the Spirit’s role in both the resurrection of Christ and the believer’s participation in new creation.

- "The gift of the Spirit is nothing less than the eschatological realization of the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Work of Christ Applied" (chapter in Theonomy and Eschatology)
- "The Holy Spirit" (in The New Dictionary of Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Work is Eschatological**
    - The Spirit’s coming at Pentecost inaugurates the **age to come** within history.
    - The Spirit is the agent of **new creation**, linking Christ’s resurrection to the believer’s transformation.
    - The Spirit’s presence is both a **down payment** and guarantee of future consummation.
    - Eschatology is not merely future but is realized in the Spirit’s present work.
    - "The outpouring of the Spirit is the eschatological event par excellence." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Union with Christ is Spirit-Wrought**
    - The Spirit unites believers to the resurrected Christ, making his benefits theirs.
    - **Justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption** are all mediated by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the means by which believers participate in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - Union with Christ is both forensic and transformative, rooted in the Spirit’s work.
    - "There is no participation in Christ apart from the Spirit." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Priority of Pentecost**
    - Pentecost marks a decisive shift in the history of redemption.
    - The Spirit’s work is not merely individual but corporate, forming the **new covenant community**.
    - The gifts of the Spirit are distributed in the context of the church’s mission.
    - Pentecost fulfills Old Testament promises of the Spirit’s universal outpouring.
    - "Pentecost is not a second blessing but the historical realization of Christ’s redemptive work." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **The Spirit Applies the Work of Christ**
    - The Spirit appropriates the benefits of Christ’s death and resurrection to believers.
    - Regeneration, faith, and repentance are all Spirit-wrought responses.
    - The Spirit’s application is inseparable from the accomplishment of redemption.
    - The ordo salutis (order of salvation) is subordinate to the historia salutis (history of salvation).
    - "The application of redemption is as much the work of the Spirit as its accomplishment is the work of Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Scripture’s Pneumatology is Christocentric**
    - The Spirit’s ministry is always oriented to the person and work of Christ.
    - The Spirit glorifies Christ and mediates his presence to the church.
    - All true spiritual experience is grounded in the objective work of Christ.
    - The Spirit never works independently from the Word or from Christ’s redemptive mission.
    - "The Spirit is the eschatological gift of the exalted Christ to his church." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by clarifying the relationship between **the Holy Spirit**, **union with Christ**, and redemptive history. His emphasis on the eschatological and corporate dimensions of the Spirit’s work has influenced both academic theology and pastoral ministry. Gaffin’s careful exegesis and redemptive-historical approach continue to inform debates on **pneumatology**, the order of salvation, and the nature of the church in the age of the Spirit.
