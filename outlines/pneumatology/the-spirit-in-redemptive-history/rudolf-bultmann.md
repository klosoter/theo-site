# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the role of the **Spirit in redemptive history** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He emphasized the **kerygma** as the locus of the Spirit’s work, focusing on the encounter between the individual and the proclaimed word, rather than on a linear, supernatural unfolding of salvation history. For Bultmann, the **Spirit** is experienced in the existential transformation of the believer rather than as a distinct agent in historical events.

- "The real meaning of the Spirit is disclosed only in the event of faith, in which man is opened to the future and to God." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Spirit**
    - The biblical language about the **Spirit** is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
    - The Spirit is not a supernatural force acting in history but a symbol for the existential openness to God.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind the New Testament’s pneumatology.
    - The Spirit’s role is to confront individuals with the call to authentic existence.
    - "It is not the Spirit as a cosmic power, but the Spirit as the power of the new existence, that is decisive." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Kerygma as the Site of the Spirit’s Work**
    - The proclamation of the **kerygma** is where the Spirit is encountered.
    - The Spirit’s activity is inseparable from the existential response to the preached word.
    - The transformative event of faith is the true miracle of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is not tied to historical acts but to the present encounter with the gospel.
    - "The Spirit is present wherever the kerygma is believed." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Redemptive History**
    - Redemptive history is not a sequence of supernatural interventions but an existential reality.
    - The Spirit’s work is the actualization of salvation in the present moment of faith.
    - The meaning of history is disclosed only in personal decision and response.
    - The Spirit enables authentic existence in the here and now, not through historical process.
    - "History becomes meaningful only in so far as it becomes my history." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Heilsgeschichte as Objective Process**
    - Bultmann rejects the notion of a linear, objective **Heilsgeschichte** (salvation history).
    - The Spirit does not guide history in a supernatural sense.
    - The focus is on the existential significance of the Christ event, not on historical causality.
    - The Spirit’s work is realized in the proclamation and acceptance of the message.
    - "The saving event is not a cosmic process but an existential happening." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Spirit and Authentic Existence**
    - The Spirit brings about **authentic existence** by liberating individuals from self-reliance.
    - The Spirit is the power that enables faith and new life.
    - Authentic existence is characterized by openness to God and the future.
    - The Spirit’s presence is discerned in the existential transformation of the believer.
    - "The Spirit is the power of new life, the life of faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to the **Spirit in redemptive history** profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament studies and theology. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional views of salvation history and the Spirit’s role, shifting the focus to personal encounter and existential transformation. While controversial, his work continues to provoke debate on the relationship between history, faith, and the Spirit in Christian theology. Bultmann’s legacy endures in discussions of **kerygma**, hermeneutics, and the existential interpretation of Scripture.
