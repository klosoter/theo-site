# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **Pentecostalism** through his expansive theology of the **Holy Spirit**, emphasizing the **eschatological** and **communal** dimensions of the Spirit’s work. While not Reformed in the confessional sense, Moltmann critically engages both **Reformed theology** and Pentecostalism, seeking a **renewed pneumatology** that transcends traditional boundaries and fosters unity, liberation, and hope within the church.

- "The church in the power of the Spirit is the sign, instrument and anticipation of the kingdom of God." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s engagement with **Pentecostalism** and the **Reformed tradition** has encouraged a more robust, ecumenical, and socially engaged **pneumatology**. His work challenges both traditions to move beyond their limitations and embrace the Spirit’s ongoing, liberating work in the world. Moltmann’s theology has influenced global dialogues on the Holy Spirit, fostering greater openness to charismatic renewal within traditionally non-charismatic churches. His vision of the church as a Spirit-empowered community continues to shape contemporary discussions on unity, mission, and hope.
