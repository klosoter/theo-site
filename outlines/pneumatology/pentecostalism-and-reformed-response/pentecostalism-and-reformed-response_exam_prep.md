### TITLE
Pentecost, Prophecy, and the Ordinary Means: A Reformed Response to Pentecostal Claims

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: whether the gifts associated with Pentecost are normative ecclesial endowments or epochal foundations, and how this bears on **sufficiency of Scripture**, **union with Christ**, **ordinary means of grace**, and church authority.
- Decisive figures: William J. Seymour, Gordon D. Fee, John Owen, Jonathan Edwards, B. B. Warfield, Richard B. Gaffin.
- Traditions engaged: classical Reformed orthodoxy and Puritan pneumatology, Old Princeton, Westminster redemptive-historical theology, Wesleyan-Holiness and classical Pentecostalism, global Pentecostal theology and exegesis.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed cessationism vs cautious continuation, doctrine of Spirit-baptism and **ordo salutis**, ecclesial authority versus congregational immediatism.
  - External: Pentecostal subsequence and initial-evidence vs Reformed **analogy of faith** and canon-closure, descriptive vs prescriptive hermeneutics of Acts, miracles as signs vs ongoing norms.
  - Contemporary: global Pentecostal growth, prosperity distortions, deliverance practices, neuroscience and psychology of glossolalia, pastoral integration of charismatics in Reformed churches.
- Position defended: principled redemptive-historical cessationism regarding revelatory and confirmatory gifts, Spirit-baptism coincident with conversion and **union with Christ**, robust expectation of the Spirit’s sanctifying and providential works through the **ordinary means of grace**, with due openness to God’s sovereign extraordinary acts that do not reintroduce ongoing revelatory ministries.

### ESSAY
The contested crossroads between Pentecostalism and the Reformed tradition is not finally about zeal or prayerfulness but about the architecture of the economy of the Spirit: what Pentecost is, what it gives, how it is normatively mediated, and what authority charismata, if any, possess in the church. Pentecostalism emerged as a practical dogmatics of immediacy. It assembles a field of emphases—post-conversion baptism with the Spirit, tongues as initial evidence, healing, prophecy, deliverance, missionary fervor, democratized worship—around a reading of Acts as repeating pattern. The classic Reformed response centers the same field within a different grammar: Pentecost as once-for-all redemptive-historical event linked to the exaltation of Christ, Spirit-baptism coincident with **union with Christ**, the Spirit’s ordinary work through Word and sacrament, and the temporary foundational function of revelatory and confirmatory signs. The dispute turns on the nexus of pneumatology, Scripture, and ecclesiology: whether the Spirit’s immediacy displaces or perfects the **ordinary means of grace**, and whether the New Testament pattern of gifts is a perpetual charter or a foundational scaffolding removed once the house stood.

William J. Seymour was the catalytic pastor of the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles whose preaching and praxis crystallized this modern Pentecostal grammar. Born in 1870 in Reconstruction-era Louisiana, shaped by Wesleyan-Holiness piety and the sermons of Charles Fox Parham, Seymour led the interracial, prayer-soaked meetings beginning in 1906 that observers described as a Pentecostal outpouring. His theological center was simple and forceful: a distinct post-conversion baptism with the Holy Spirit, universally available and attested by glossolalia; a restorationist expectation that Acts is church order; and an eschatological horizon that read tongues and healing as latter-rain prelude to the evangelization of the nations. Seymour’s method was experiential and pragmatic. He drew lines between the Acts narrative and the gathering’s embodied phenomena and refused creedal narrowing, trusting the Spirit to order and purify. The debates he shaped concerned subsequence and evidence, and through his imprimatur apostleship and prophecy were tacitly normalized in popular expectation. The global missionary effects were undeniable. But so too were the tensions: a thinned account of church office and discipline, a tendency toward anti-institutional suspicion, and the incentive to authenticate spirituality by visible charismata. Seymour’s legacy is the modern plausibility structure in which tongues and prophecy feel inherently evangelical and apostolic.

Gordon D. Fee exemplifies a second stream within Pentecostalism, the learned exegetical defense of continuation without all of Seymour’s restorationist entailments. Born in 1934, Fee’s work on Pauline pneumatology, especially God’s Empowering Presence and his commentaries on 1 Corinthians, pressed Pentecostals to locate the Spirit’s charismata within the wider soteriological matrix, not simply as post-conversion add-ons. With careful textual work, he opposed initial-evidence dogma, arguing that tongues are neither universal nor the required sign of fullness but one gift among many for the common good. He insisted that the Spirit’s presence is soteriological and ecclesiological before it is ecstatic. Yet Fee maintained continuationist convictions and read 1 Corinthians 12–14 as ongoing directive for congregational prophecy and tongues regulated by love and order. He challenged cessationist harmonizations, contending that the New Testament nowhere explicitly closes the door on these gifts, and that the burden of proof lies with those who would declare them ceased. Fee therefore reframes Pentecostalism’s core question: not whether God can but how the Spirit’s presence relates to Christ’s lordship, sanctification, and churchly edification.

The Reformed tradition answers that question by doubling down on the fullness of the Spirit already embedded in its dogmatics. John Owen stands as a monument to this retrieval. In his massive Discourse Concerning the Holy Spirit and related works, Owen articulated a comprehensive pneumatology without which the Reformed response to Pentecostal claims can only appear as anxious negation. Owen’s method is exegetical and dogmatic at once: Christ’s mediation and the mission of the Spirit are inseparable; the whole of Christian life and church order is pneumatic. The Spirit inspires Scripture, regenerates, indwells, illumines, sanctifies, and gifts the church with ministers, graces, and at the apostolic foundation, extraordinary gifts for revealing and confirming. Crucially, Owen locates the Spirit’s operations within **federal theology** and the **ordinary means of grace**. There is no spiritual gift that bypasses or competes with the ordained ministry of Word and sacrament instituted by Christ. The distinction between extraordinary and ordinary operations is not metaphysical but **redemptive-historical**. Once Scripture is completed, the form of the Spirit’s speaking becomes normative through the text, by which all spirits are tested. Owen’s framework is capacious enough to account for genuine outpourings and unusual providences while preventing the subtle displacement of Christ’s instituted order by episodic enthusiasms.

Jonathan Edwards supplied the discerning experimental theology that guards Owen’s cathedral from ossification. In The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God and Religious Affections, Edwards both defended the Great Awakening as a work of God and policed its excesses. He rejected the simplistic inference from phenomena—ecstasy, visions, bodily effects—to divine causality and insisted that the Spirit’s presence is known by doctrinal fidelity to the exalted Christ, a humbling love for God’s beauty, and lasting transformation into holiness. Edwards’s tests, grounded in a robust doctrine of regeneration and affections, are crucial for the Reformed response to Pentecostal claims. He authorizes expectancy for seasons of unusual blessing and cautions against absolutizing them. He rebukes skepticism toward spiritual experience and critiques a spirituality that seeks spectacle or new revelations to sustain faith. In Edwards, the Reformed can resist both rationalist retreat and charismatic credulity by holding experiential assurance together with **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **analogy of faith**.

B. B. Warfield represents the Old Princeton articulation of principled cessationism. In Counterfeit Miracles and related essays, Warfield argued that miracles in Scripture are clustered in revelatory epochs and serve as divine credentials of special messengers whose teaching forms the canonical deposit. He linked the cessation of apostolic office to the cessation of revelatory signs. His method united historical investigation of post-apostolic miracle claims with a theological conviction that the purposes of signs are foundational, not perennial. Warfield’s thesis turns on two claims. First, that apostolic miracles served to authenticate the once-for-all revelation of Christ and his apostles, now inscripturated. Second, that the church’s ordinary equipment for its entire age is the complete canon and the Spirit’s sanctifying presence through ordained means, not a perpetually renewed apostolate. Warfield’s combative tone can mislead students into thinking his concern is narrow. Properly stated, his case safeguards the unique authority of Scripture and the stability of church office under Christ. If an examiner asks whether Warfield makes God a prisoner of his own past, the answer is no: Warfield limits not God’s freedom but our expectations, tethering them to the ends God himself has revealed for miraculous signs and to the sufficiency of the Word that those signs once served. Warfield also does not deny that God heals or answers prayer. He denies that a stable ministry of healers, prophets, and tongues speakers persists with the same nature and authority as in the apostolic era.

Richard B. Gaffin, working within the Westminster tradition, refined Warfield’s core thesis by emphasizing the redemptive-historical uniqueness of Pentecost and the ascension-gift character of the Spirit. In Perspectives on Pentecost, he argues that Pentecost is not an experiential template to be sought anew by believers but the once-for-all historical inauguration of the last days coincident with Christ’s exaltation. For every believer, Spirit-baptism is not subsequent crisis but the soteriological gift of union with the risen Christ. Acts charts the transition of the covenant people across epochal thresholds—Jews, Samaritans, Gentiles—where signs dramatize inclusion, not a norm for subsequence. On gifts, Gaffin appeals to Ephesians 2 to assert that apostles and prophets are the church’s foundation. Once the foundation is laid, the superstructure rises by ordinary ministries of Word, sacrament, and discipline. He presses that prophecy in the New Testament bears divine authority tethered to the same revelatory stream as Scripture, even if not itself Scripture, and therefore cannot be reconceived as fallible impressions without slicing prophecy away from its biblical meaning. If pressed by an examiner about those who argue for a lower-tier prophecy that continues without challenging **sufficiency of Scripture**, the reply is clear: while one may speak of impressions, wisdom, and counsel, to call these prophecy evacuates the biblical category and risks a parallel magisterium in the congregation. Gaffin’s positive gift is a hermeneutical posture: read Acts descriptively within the flow of redemptive history and interpret the letters’ ecclesiology as normative for church order.

Placed together, these figures locate the substantive nerve of the debate at four junctures. First is Spirit-baptism and the **ordo salutis**. Seymour, influenced by Holiness theology, posited a second work of grace marked by tongues, while Fee softened this to fullness language. Owen, Edwards, Warfield, and Gaffin insist that the Spirit’s baptism is the gift of union with Christ, received by faith at conversion. There can be repeated fillings but not a two-stage soteriology that creates two classes of Christians by charisma. Second is hermeneutics. Pentecostalism tends to treat Acts as a prescriptive ecclesial manual. The Reformed deploy **analogy of faith**, letting the didactic epistles interpret narrative and reading Acts within covenantal transitions that are not indefinitely repeatable. Third is revelation and authority. For classic Pentecostalism, prophecy is an ongoing word from God to be weighed but still divine address. Reformed dogmatics, anchored in **sufficiency of Scripture**, treats prophecy and tongues as revelatory and foundational, now finished, and disallows a fallible prophecy category that would blur the line between the canon and congregational impressions. Fourth is the economy of means. Pentecostal immediacy often sidelines or relativizes the ordained, stable channels of grace as if the Spirit’s freedom were proportional to institutional elasticity. The Reformed insist that the Spirit’s freedom is shown in his self-consistency with Christ’s institution. The **ordinary means of grace** are not constraints on the Spirit but his chosen conduits.

Internal Reformed debates remain. Some argue for cessationist principle tempered by openness to rare charismata that lack public authority. Others propose a continuation of noncanonical prophecy defined as human report of divine impression, fallible and subordinate. The former position, represented by Warfield and Gaffin in different idioms, stresses the link between revelatory gifts and foundation. The latter attempts to preserve congregational charisma while preserving biblical authority. The difficulty is definitional. If prophecy is fallible religious speech, it is not the biblical phenomenon in which the Spirit speaks and the church hears with obedience. Moreover, a routinized culture of impressions calibrated as divine speech, however hedged, tends to create a soft canon and to distribute de facto authority by personalities rather than by ordained office. The more careful continuationist will deny equivalence with Scripture and insist on discernment. Even so, the Reformed must ask whether the net effect is a practical rival to preaching and catechesis. A Westminster examiner will ask whether your cessationism collapses into naturalism. The answer is to double down on providence and prayer. The God of **divine simplicity** is not divided between ordinary and extraordinary; he is one, and his works harmonize. He heals, guides, and guards. But he has assigned to the church a form of life in which expectation is focused on the Word preached, water and bread administered, and discipline practiced. Extraordinary providences are not an ordinary program.

External debates must be conducted with candor. Pentecostalism’s appeal lies partly in its missionary energy and experiential concreteness. It addresses spiritual affliction directly and with hope, and its global explosion, especially in the Global South, cannot be dismissed as a fad. The Reformed response must therefore not present as a cool negation but as a richer fullness. Owen’s expansive pneumatology and Edwards’s experimental theology inoculate against the misperception that Reformed theology is a theory of the Spirit’s retirement. The Reformed insist that the Spirit’s power is seen in deep repentance, transformed loves, faithful marriages, steadfast endurance under the cross, and corporate holiness, not only in phenomena. Against the Pentecostal charge that cessationism quenches the Spirit, the Reformed answer is that the Spirit cannot be honored by practices he has not instituted, and that asking for his work where he promises to be—Word, sacrament, prayer, and disciplined fellowship—is the true expectancy. Against the Reformed charge that Pentecostalism creates a parallel canon, the best Pentecostal scholars like Fee plead for continuations that edify without rivaling Scripture. Here the debate narrows to whether the New Testament’s prophecy, tongue, and sign categories can be redefined without exegetical violence.

Contemporary pressures complicate the field. Prosperity teaching has colonized large swaths of global Pentecostalism, wedding charismata to a thin providence that treats suffering as a failure of faith. A Reformed response exposes this as a soteriological error and an ethical distortion. The Spirit unites believers to a crucified and risen Lord and conforms them to him in suffering and hope. Likewise, deliverance practices sometimes manifest a dualistic cosmology and instrumentalize rituals, thereby undermining the finished work of Christ and pastoral care grounded in catechesis and repentance. The Reformed must not capitulate to reductionist psychology but neither to a sacramentalization of techniques. On tongues, neuroscience can map glossolalic states without answering whether the speech is Spirit-given. That is a theological discernment measured by Scripture and fruit. Pastoral realities are pressing: many Reformed congregations include charismatics. The wise course is neither blanket scorn nor uncritical adoption. Church sessions should teach a full-orbed Reformed pneumatology, invite members to pray for healing while submitting to God’s will, encourage testimony constrained by truth and modesty, and discourage practices that assign divine authority to impressions. Where sincere Christians claim to prophesy, elders should thank God for zeal, teach the difference between wise counsel and divine speech, and require that no revelation language be used that confuses the sheep. The **regulative principle** of worship must be guarded, not to protect an aesthetic but to safeguard God’s appointed fellowship.

The position I defend is principled cessationism regarding revelatory and confirmatory gifts, combined with maximal affirmation of the Spirit’s present operations in sanctification, mission, prayer, and providential mercies. It stands on three doctrinal pillars. First, Pentecost is a once-for-all inauguration bound to Christ’s exaltation. Its soteriological gift, Spirit-baptism, belongs to every believer at conversion and defines Christian identity in **union with Christ**. Second, the revelatory and confirmatory gifts served a foundational era tied to the apostles and prophets. Their cessation is not the withdrawal of the Spirit but the stabilization of the church’s life under the finished canon and ordinary ministries. Third, the Spirit’s freedom operates chiefly through the **ordinary means of grace** that Christ ordained, and his extraordinary works today are providential, not programmatic or attached to standing offices of ongoing revelation. These commitments do not deny that God may heal or guide in ways beyond our planning. They deny that the church is authorized to constitute permanent charismatic practices as if they were divine institutions.

Several likely objections deserve reply. Does this view unduly domesticate God? No. It disciplines expectations by God’s self-revelation and refuses to confuse our appetite for immediacy with the Spirit’s sovereignty. Does it collapse into rationalism? Not if Owen and Edwards are embraced. A Reformed church should pray for revival, confess sin, expect seasons of unusual blessing, and testify to answers to prayer. Does a redemptive-historical reading evade clear commands in 1 Corinthians 14 to pursue prophecy? It locates those commands within an apostolic context in which prophecy functioned with real divine authority during a foundational period. With the foundation laid, we obey the same Spirit by submitting to the enduring institutions he established rather than replicating the scaffolding. What about modern accounts of prophecy as fallible, noncanonical, and therefore safe? They are formally safer but exegetically unstable. By redefining prophecy to escape the force of **sufficiency of Scripture**, they detach the gift from its biblical authority and simultaneously create a culture in which the Lord is habitually said to speak outside Scripture, confusing sheep and pressuring consciences. The wiser path is to cultivate congregational wisdom, exhortation, and mutual counsel, clearly distinguished from divine speech.

This position coheres with adjacent loci. In Scripture, it secures the canon’s closure and the finality of Christ’s prophetic office, therefore guarding **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **analogy of faith**. In ecclesiology, it preserves the distinct authority of ordained offices and the stability of discipline. In soteriology, it unifies the **ordo salutis** around **union with Christ**, precluding two-tier Christianity. In sacramentology, it affirms that baptism and the Supper are not inferior, humanly imposed forms but the Spirit’s own instituted channels. In Christology, it honors the Spirit as the gift of the ascended Lord, not as a parallel economy competing with his body and blood. Even in apologetics, it secures a stable public criterion for claims about God’s speech. And it leaves ample room for God’s daily gifts, for unexpected healings, for personal leadings held with humility, and for the Spirit’s global mission through the foolishness of preaching.

Where Pentecostalism has stressed the missional and eschatological dynamism of the last days, the Reformed should be grateful and repent any complacency. There is no principled cessationism of prayer, zeal, or compassion. Our cessationism is narrowly tailored to the revelatory and confirmatory gifts tied to the apostolic foundation. Pastors should teach their people to read Acts with reverence for the once-for-all history it records and to read the epistles for the normative shape of congregational life. They should invite believers to seek the Spirit’s fullness in holiness, corporate worship, and loving service, and to measure all experiences by doctrine and fruit per Edwards. They should commend Owen’s vision of the Spirit saturating every inch of the Christian life, and Warfield’s warning that signs untethered from their revelatory purpose slide into credulity. They should draw on Gaffin’s redemptive-historical clarity and on Fee’s best insistence that the Spirit’s presence is about Christ’s lordship and communal edification. Where Pentecostal brothers and sisters love the Lord Jesus, we should gladly own them as family, while encouraging their growth into a form of life under the Word that does not need fresh words to stay warm.

The conceptual center of this topic, then, is not a modality war but a doctrine of God’s economy. The one God, the Spirit of the Son, distributes gifts according to his will to build the body. He has given foundational gifts that once attested the revelation now inscripturated, and he has given ordinary gifts that carry that revelation through time. To confuse these is to sap the church of both stability and expectancy. To distinguish them is to be free to ask for much from God where he promises much, and to be at peace when he denies us spectacle but grants us the miracle of ordinary holiness. In a Reformed key, Pentecost is not the suspension of instituted means but their empowerment, not rival access to God beyond the Word but the inauguration of the age in which the Word runs and is glorified. The better path is not to suppress Pentecostal fervor but to catechize it, so that the zeal for gifts becomes zeal for edification under the rule of Christ through the **ordinary means of grace**, with hearts aflame by the Spirit who wrote the Scriptures and fills the church forever.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Pentecostalism is a restorationist, experiential movement asserting a post-conversion Spirit-baptism with tongues as initial evidence and ongoing prophecy and healing; the Reformed response interprets Pentecost as a once-for-all **redemptive-historical** event, identifies Spirit-baptism with **union with Christ**, and locates the Spirit’s power in **sufficiency of Scripture** and **ordinary means of grace**.
- Decisive figures:
  - William J. Seymour: Azusa Street architect of subsequence and initial-evidence expectations.
  - Gordon D. Fee: Pentecostal exegete rejecting initial evidence yet defending continuation, centering gifts on edification.
  - John Owen: Puritan architect of comprehensive pneumatology, extraordinary versus ordinary operations, means-anchored spirituality.
  - Jonathan Edwards: experimental Calvinist discernment, fruit and doctrine as tests, expectancy without credulity.
  - B. B. Warfield: principled cessation of revelatory signs tied to apostolic foundation and canon completion.
  - Richard B. Gaffin: Pentecost as once-for-all, Spirit-baptism at conversion, apostles and prophets as foundation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: cessationism vs cautious continuation, Spirit-baptism in the **ordo salutis**, nature of prophecy, ecclesial authority.
  - External: Acts as normative vs descriptive, signs as foundational vs ongoing, prophecy’s authority vs fallible impressions.
  - Contemporary: global Pentecostal growth, prosperity aberrations, deliverance practices, neuroscience of tongues, pastoral integration.
- Defended position: principled cessationism of revelatory and confirmatory gifts with robust affirmation of the Spirit’s present sanctifying and providential work through Word, sacrament, prayer, and discipline.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does cessationism bind God? No, it regulates expectations by revealed ends while affirming God’s sovereign extraordinary providences.
  - What is Spirit-baptism? The soteriological gift of the exalted Christ at conversion, identical with **union with Christ**.
  - Is 1 Corinthians 14 normative today? Its call to edification and order abides; its prophecy and tongues functioned in a foundational context that has ceased.
  - Can there be fallible prophecy now? No; impressions and counsel should be named as such to safeguard **sufficiency of Scripture** and church order.
  - How do you pastor charismatics? Teach Owen and Edwards, welcome prayer for healing, require modest testimony, and anchor life in the **ordinary means of grace**.
