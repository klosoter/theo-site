# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, as a foundational figure in **Reformed biblical theology**, approached the rise of **Pentecostalism** with a strong commitment to the **continuity of redemptive history** and the sufficiency of **Scripture**. He emphasized the once-for-all nature of **revelation** and the completed work of the **Holy Spirit** in the formation of the church, distinguishing the apostolic era from subsequent developments in Christian experience.

- "The principle of revelation is not continuous, but is completed in Christ and the apostolic witness." ("Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Pauline Eschatology
- Reformed Dogmatics
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Redemptive-Historical and Completed**
    - Revelation unfolds progressively and climaxes in Christ.
    - The canon of Scripture is closed; new revelation is not normative.
    - The apostolic era is unique in redemptive history.
    - Pentecostal claims to new revelation are inconsistent with the finality of Christ.
    - "Revelation has reached its culmination in the person and work of Christ." (Biblical Theology)

2. **The Holy Spirit’s Work is Normatively Ecclesial**
    - The Spirit’s primary work is to apply redemption accomplished by Christ.
    - Spiritual gifts in the apostolic age served to authenticate the gospel.
    - The ordinary operation of the Spirit is through the means of grace.
    - Extraordinary gifts are not normative for the post-apostolic church.
    - "The Spirit’s gifts are organically related to the body of Christ and its historical development." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Scripture is Sufficient and Authoritative**
    - The Bible is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - All spiritual experience must be tested by Scripture.
    - Pentecostalism’s emphasis on new revelation undermines sola Scriptura.
    - The Reformed tradition upholds the sufficiency of the Word.
    - "Scripture is the norm by which all claims to spiritual experience must be judged." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Distinction of the Apostolic Age**
    - The apostolic period is unrepeatable in redemptive history.
    - Signs and wonders served a foundational, not perpetual, function.
    - The church now lives in the era of the Spirit’s ordinary operations.
    - Pentecostalism blurs the distinction between foundation and continuation.
    - "The miraculous gifts were signs of the new age, not its permanent features." (Pauline Eschatology)

5. **Objective over Subjective in Christian Experience**
    - Emphasizes the objective work of Christ and the Spirit.
    - Warns against overemphasis on subjective spiritual phenomena.
    - True assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not ecstatic experience.
    - The Reformed tradition values doctrinal clarity over experiential novelty.
    - "The subjective must always be subordinate to the objective in the Christian faith." (Reformed Dogmatics)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s **redemptive-historical** approach has shaped the Reformed response to Pentecostalism by grounding the work of the **Holy Spirit** in the completed revelation of Scripture and the unique role of the apostolic era. His insistence on the sufficiency of the Bible and the ordinary means of grace continues to inform Reformed critiques of ongoing revelatory claims. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions about the nature of spiritual gifts and the boundaries of Christian experience within the church.
