# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology is foundational for the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**, the sovereignty of the **Holy Spirit**, and the cessation of **extraordinary gifts** after the apostolic era. While Calvin acknowledged the reality of the Spirit’s work, he insisted that **revelation** is now mediated through the written Word, not ongoing prophecy or tongues, setting a trajectory for later Reformed critiques of **Pentecostalism**.

- "For by a kind of perpetual miracle, the Spirit makes the preaching of the gospel fruitful." (Institutes 3.24.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 7–9; Book IV, chapters 8–19)
- Commentaries on Acts and 1 Corinthians (notably on Acts 2 and 1 Corinthians 12–14)
- Treatises Against the Anabaptists and Libertines
- Selected Letters (esp. correspondence with contemporaries on spiritual gifts)
- Richard A. Muller, The Unaccommodated Calvin (secondary, for context on Calvin’s pneumatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - The **canon** is closed; new revelation is unnecessary and suspect.
    - The Spirit’s illumination is always tied to the written Word.
    - Claims of new prophecy or tongues are evaluated by Scripture alone.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against subjective spiritual excesses.
    - "The Holy Spirit so cleaves to his own truth as not to depart from it, or to change anything in it." (Institutes 1.9.2)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - **Miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were for the apostolic age.
    - Their primary purpose was to confirm the gospel’s initial proclamation.
    - The ordinary means of grace now supersede extraordinary manifestations.
    - Ongoing claims to such gifts risk undermining the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "The gift of healing, like the rest of the miracles, which the Lord willed to be brought forth for a time, has vanished away in order to make the preaching of the gospel marvelous forever." (Institutes 4.19.18)

3. **The Spirit’s Work is Inward and Ecclesial**
    - The Spirit regenerates, sanctifies, and assures believers through the Word.
    - The Spirit’s presence is discerned in the church’s ordinary ministry.
    - True spiritual experience is inseparable from the visible church.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, not to private revelations.
    - "The Word is the instrument by which the Lord dispenses the illumination of his Spirit to believers." (Institutes 3.2.6)

4. **Guarding Against Enthusiasm**
    - Calvin warns against **enthusiasm**—claims of direct revelation apart from Scripture.
    - Such claims threaten church order and doctrinal purity.
    - The Spirit never contradicts the written Word.
    - Spiritual experiences must be tested by the church’s teaching.
    - "The fanatics wrongly pretend the Spirit for themselves, rejecting the Word." (Institutes 1.9.3)

5. **Providence and the Spirit’s Sovereignty**
    - The Spirit is sovereign in distributing gifts according to God’s will.
    - The ordinary work of the Spirit is more to be sought than the extraordinary.
    - God’s providence governs the church’s life and gifts in every age.
    - The focus is on Christ’s finished work, not on ongoing signs and wonders.
    - "The Spirit is not given to us to produce new revelations, but to seal the truth of the gospel in our hearts." (Commentary on John 16:13)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s theology established the **Reformed doctrine of cessationism**, shaping the tradition’s response to later charismatic and Pentecostal movements. His insistence on the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the ordinary means of grace provided a framework for evaluating claims of new prophecy and tongues. Calvin’s influence endures in Reformed critiques of Pentecostalism, emphasizing discernment, ecclesial order, and the centrality of the Word and sacraments.
