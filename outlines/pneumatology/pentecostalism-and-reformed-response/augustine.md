# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not encounter **Pentecostalism** as a movement, but his theology of the **Holy Spirit**, **miracles**, and the **continuation or cessation of spiritual gifts** has profoundly influenced later **Reformed responses** to charismatic phenomena. Augustine’s mature position emphasized the uniqueness of **apostolic miracles** and the sufficiency of **Scripture**, shaping later skepticism toward ongoing miraculous gifts in the post-apostolic era.

- "In the earliest times, the Holy Ghost fell upon them that believed: and they spake with tongues, which they had not learned, as the Spirit gave them utterance. These were signs adapted to the time." (Homilies on the First Epistle of John, 6.10)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Miracles as Apostolic Signs**
    - Miracles served to authenticate the **apostolic message** during the church’s foundation.
    - The frequency of miracles diminished after the **canon of Scripture** was established.
    - Augustine acknowledged some ongoing miracles but saw them as rare and exceptional.
    - He distinguished between the **normative** and **extraordinary** in church history.
    - "These miracles were done for a time, to signify something; they passed away."

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - The completed **Scriptures** are the ultimate authority for faith and practice.
    - Augustine warned against seeking new revelations beyond the biblical canon.
    - He argued that the church should not expect new doctrines through ongoing prophecy.
    - The **Word** is sufficient for salvation and spiritual growth.
    - "For the faith itself, which is now established, comes by reading and hearing the Scriptures." (Homilies on the First Epistle of John, 6.10)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** indwells and sanctifies all believers.
    - The Spirit’s primary work is to unite believers to Christ and the church.
    - Augustine emphasized the Spirit’s role in **regeneration** and **illumination**.
    - He did not tie the Spirit’s presence to outward signs like tongues or prophecy.
    - "The Spirit is given now, not so that men may speak with tongues, but that they may love one another."

4. **Cessation of Certain Charismatic Gifts**
    - Augustine’s later writings suggest that **tongues** and similar gifts ceased after the apostolic era.
    - He saw these gifts as necessary for the church’s initial expansion, not its ongoing life.
    - The focus shifted from signs to the **fruit of the Spirit** and love.
    - He acknowledged God’s freedom to act miraculously but did not expect it as normative.
    - "Why then is no one speaking in the tongues of all nations, unless it be that the Church itself now speaks in the tongues of all nations?" (Homilies on the First Epistle of John, 6.10)

5. **Discernment and Order in Worship**
    - Augustine valued **order** and **edification** in public worship.
    - He warned against disorderly displays that distract from the gospel.
    - The church must discern true spiritual manifestations from false or misleading ones.
    - Augustine prioritized the unity and peace of the church over spectacular experiences.
    - "Let all things be done unto edifying." (City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology of **miracles**, the **Holy Spirit**, and the **sufficiency of Scripture** laid the groundwork for later **Reformed critiques of Pentecostalism**. His distinction between the apostolic era and the ongoing life of the church shaped the doctrine of **cessationism**. Reformed theologians have frequently cited Augustine to support the view that miraculous gifts were foundational and are no longer normative, emphasizing the primacy of Scripture and the ordinary means of grace.
