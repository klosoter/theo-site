# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate the classic **Reformed confessional position** on the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**, the cessation of **extraordinary gifts**, and the normative work of the **Holy Spirit** through the ordinary means of grace. In contrast to **Pentecostalism**, the Standards uphold the **regulative principle of worship** and deny ongoing **revelation** or miraculous gifts as normative for the post-apostolic church.

- "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Sufficient and Final**
   - **Scripture** contains all things necessary for faith and life.
   - Ongoing **revelation** or new prophecies are rejected as authoritative.
   - The **canon** is closed; biblical revelation is sufficient and complete.
   - All spiritual experiences must be tested by Scripture.
   "Nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men." (WCF 1.6)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
   - **Miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were for the foundation of the church.
   - These gifts ceased with the end of the **apostolic age**.
   - The Spirit now works primarily through the ordinary means of grace.
   - Seeking new signs or wonders as normative is discouraged.
   "Those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased." (WCF 1.1)

3. **The Holy Spirit Works Through Ordinary Means**
   - The Spirit operates through **Word, sacraments, and prayer**.
   - Sanctification and assurance are mediated by these means.
   - The Spirit’s inward work is always tied to the outward means appointed by God.
   - Extraordinary manifestations are not necessary for genuine spiritual life.
   "The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption are his ordinances." (WSC Q.88)

4. **Regulative Principle of Worship**
   - Only what is commanded in **Scripture** is permitted in worship.
   - Innovations and practices not grounded in biblical warrant are rejected.
   - The church is protected from subjective or unauthorized spiritual expressions.
   - Worship is to be God-centered, not driven by human enthusiasm.
   "But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will." (WCF 21.1)

5. **Discernment of Spiritual Experience**
   - All spiritual experiences must be evaluated by the **Word of God**.
   - Emotional or ecstatic experiences are not self-authenticating.
   - The church is called to test the spirits and avoid deception.
   - True spiritual fruit is measured by conformity to Scripture and godliness.
   "They who, upon pretense of Christian liberty, do practice any sin, or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty." (WCF 20.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed response** to Pentecostalism, providing a theological framework that prioritizes the sufficiency of Scripture and the cessation of extraordinary gifts. Their influence endures in the ongoing commitment of Reformed churches to the ordinary means of grace and the regulative principle of worship. By insisting on discernment and the finality of biblical revelation, the Standards continue to guide Reformed engagement with movements that claim ongoing supernatural manifestations.
