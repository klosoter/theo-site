# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, engaged with the rise of **Pentecostalism** by emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** and the unique, unrepeatable nature of **redemptive history**. He critiqued Pentecostal claims regarding **continuing revelation** and **extraordinary gifts**, insisting that the **work of the Holy Spirit** in the present age is primarily through the **ordinary means of grace**.

- "The canon of Scripture is closed, and with it the era of special revelation and the extraordinary gifts has ceased." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Principles of Conduct
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- "The Guidance of the Holy Spirit" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - Scripture is the complete and sufficient revelation of God's will.
    - No new revelation is to be expected after the apostolic era.
    - The **canon** is closed, and all doctrine must be tested by Scripture.
    - Claims of ongoing prophecy or tongues are viewed with suspicion.
    - "The finality of Scripture is basic to the Reformed faith." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **extraordinary gifts** (e.g., tongues, prophecy) served a foundational role in the early church.
    - These gifts authenticated the apostolic message and era.
    - With the completion of the canon, such gifts are no longer normative.
    - The ordinary operation of the Spirit is now through the Word and sacraments.
    - "The gifts peculiar to the apostolic age have fulfilled their purpose." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **The Holy Spirit’s Ordinary Work**
    - The Spirit works primarily through the **means of grace**: Word, sacraments, and prayer.
    - Regeneration, sanctification, and assurance are the Spirit’s ongoing ministries.
    - Emphasis is placed on the Spirit’s inward work rather than outward signs.
    - The Christian life is marked by growth in holiness, not by miraculous manifestations.
    - "The Holy Spirit’s ministry is inseparable from the Word." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - The history of redemption is marked by unique, unrepeatable events.
    - The apostolic age was a distinct period in salvation history.
    - Pentecostalism’s expectation of repeated Pentecostal phenomena misunderstands redemptive history.
    - The church now lives in the era of the Spirit’s ordinary presence.
    - "We must not confuse the epochal with the perpetual in the Spirit’s work." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Sanctification and Assurance**
    - Assurance comes through faith in Christ and the promises of Scripture.
    - The Spirit’s witness is inward and tied to the gospel, not external signs.
    - Sanctification is progressive and rooted in union with Christ.
    - Reliance on extraordinary experiences for assurance is discouraged.
    - "The witness of the Spirit is not to be identified with ecstatic experience." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust **Reformed critique of Pentecostalism** has shaped conservative Presbyterian and Reformed responses to charismatic movements. His insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the cessation of extraordinary gifts remains influential in Reformed seminaries and churches. By rooting the work of the Holy Spirit in the ordinary means of grace and the finished work of Christ, Murray provided a theological framework that continues to guide Reformed engagement with Pentecostal and charismatic claims.
