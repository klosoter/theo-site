# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson approaches **Pentecostalism** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**, the unique and unrepeatable nature of **Pentecost**, and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** in sanctification rather than in new revelatory gifts. He affirms the importance of the Spirit’s ministry but critiques the **continuationist** claims of Pentecostalism, especially regarding **tongues**, **prophecy**, and **miraculous gifts**. Ferguson’s response is marked by a pastoral concern for spiritual vitality within the boundaries of **Reformed confessionalism**.

- "The New Testament does not encourage us to expect a repetition of Pentecost, but rather to live in the good of its once-for-all accomplishment." (The Holy Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Pentecost as Redemptive-Historical Event**
    - Pentecost is a unique, unrepeatable event in salvation history.
    - The outpouring of the Spirit fulfills Old Testament promises and inaugurates the new covenant.
    - The church is called to live in the reality established at Pentecost, not to seek its repetition.
    - The gifts given at Pentecost served to authenticate the apostolic message.
    - "Pentecost is not a model for subsequent Christian experience, but the foundation for it." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - The **canon** is closed; new revelation is neither expected nor necessary.
    - The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from it.
    - Claims of ongoing prophecy or new revelation are inconsistent with Reformed doctrine.
    - The authority of Scripture is central to discerning the Spirit’s work.
    - "The Spirit leads us to Christ through the Scriptures, not beyond them." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Cessation of Apostolic Gifts**
    - Miraculous gifts such as tongues and prophecy were for the foundational period of the church.
    - These gifts authenticated the apostles and their message.
    - Their cessation does not imply the Spirit is inactive today.
    - The ordinary means of grace are the Spirit’s primary instruments now.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were tied to the extraordinary phase of redemptive history." (Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?)

4. **Ongoing Work of the Spirit in Sanctification**
    - The Spirit’s primary work is to apply redemption and sanctify believers.
    - Spiritual growth, assurance, and fruit are marks of the Spirit’s presence.
    - The Spirit empowers believers for obedience and service within the church.
    - Emphasis is placed on the Spirit’s ordinary, not extraordinary, operations.
    - "The Spirit’s work is seen most clearly in the transformation of character, not in spectacular gifts." (The Christian Life)

5. **Pastoral Sensitivity and Unity in the Body**
    - Recognizes the spiritual hunger that often drives Pentecostal experience.
    - Encourages discernment without dismissiveness or hostility.
    - Calls for Reformed churches to cultivate spiritual vitality and dependence on the Spirit.
    - Seeks unity in the essentials of the faith while addressing differences charitably.
    - "We must not quench the Spirit, but neither must we confuse His work with our own expectations." (The Holy Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s engagement with **Pentecostalism** has helped shape a robust Reformed response that is both theologically rigorous and pastorally sensitive. His emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique role of the **Holy Spirit** in sanctification has influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on spiritual gifts and charismatic phenomena. Ferguson’s writings continue to guide pastors and theologians in navigating the challenges posed by Pentecostalism while maintaining a vibrant, Spirit-dependent Reformed faith.
