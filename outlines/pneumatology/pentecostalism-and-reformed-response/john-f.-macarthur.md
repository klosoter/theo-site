# John MacArthur (1939– )

John MacArthur is a leading critic of **Pentecostalism** and the broader **Charismatic Movement**, advocating for a classic **Reformed cessationist** position. He emphasizes the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**, rejecting the ongoing validity of **sign gifts** such as tongues and prophecy, and warns against the theological and practical dangers he perceives in Pentecostal practices.

- "The Charismatic Movement offers nothing to true worship because it points away from the sufficiency of Scripture." ("Strange Fire")

## Key Works

- Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship (2013)
- Charismatic Chaos (1992)
- The MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series (select volumes addressing spiritual gifts)
- The Sufficiency of Scripture (sermons and articles)
- The Truth War (2007)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessationism of Sign Gifts**
    - Argues that **apostolic-era gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) ceased with the close of the canon.
    - Grounds cessationism in the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**.
    - Sees the purpose of sign gifts as foundational and non-repeatable.
    - Warns that ongoing claims to such gifts undermine biblical authority.
    - "The miraculous gifts were given to authenticate the apostles and their message, not to be normative for the church." (Charismatic Chaos)

2. **Sufficiency and Authority of Scripture**
    - Maintains that **Scripture alone** is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - Critiques Pentecostalism for elevating subjective experience over biblical revelation.
    - Argues that new revelations or prophecies threaten the **completeness of the canon**.
    - Emphasizes expository preaching as the primary means of spiritual growth.
    - "God’s Word is sufficient; we do not need new revelation." (Strange Fire)

3. **Doctrine of the Holy Spirit**
    - Affirms the **Holy Spirit’s** ongoing work in regeneration, sanctification, and illumination.
    - Rejects the idea that the Spirit’s primary work is manifested in miraculous gifts today.
    - Critiques Pentecostalism for confusing emotionalism with the Spirit’s true ministry.
    - Stresses the Spirit’s role in applying the finished work of Christ, not in new revelation.
    - "The true work of the Holy Spirit is always in harmony with the written Word." (Strange Fire)

4. **Reformed Soteriology and Worship**
    - Upholds **Reformed doctrines** of grace and the regulative principle of worship.
    - Argues that Pentecostal worship practices often violate biblical norms.
    - Sees emotional excess and disorder as contrary to **biblical worship**.
    - Calls for worship centered on the Word, not on ecstatic experiences.
    - "Worship must be regulated by Scripture, not by personal experience." (Strange Fire)

5. **Critique of Contemporary Charismatic Practices**
    - Identifies theological and ethical dangers in modern Pentecostalism.
    - Warns against prosperity gospel, false healings, and unbiblical authority claims.
    - Sees the movement as a threat to **orthodox doctrine** and church unity.
    - Calls for discernment and a return to historic Reformed convictions.
    - "The Charismatic Movement is a breeding ground for doctrinal error and spiritual deception." (Charismatic Chaos)

## Legacy and Impact

MacArthur’s robust **cessationist** critique has shaped the Reformed response to Pentecostalism in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. His works, especially "Strange Fire," have sparked significant debate within evangelical and Reformed circles, reinforcing the centrality of **Scripture** and the dangers of extra-biblical revelation. While controversial, his stance has provided a clear articulation of the Reformed position on spiritual gifts and continues to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople concerned with doctrinal fidelity.
