### TITLE
Spirit, Word, and Church: A Reformed Evaluation and Engagement with Pentecostalism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How to relate Pentecostalism’s emphases on **baptism in the Spirit**, **charismatic gifts**, and **experience** to the Reformed commitments to **sola Scriptura**, **covenant theology**, and **ordinary means of grace** within a doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the church.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Karl Barth, William J. Seymour, John Wimber, Wayne Grudem.
- Relevant traditions: Classical Reformed orthodoxy and **federal theology**, early Pentecostal and Holiness traditions, twentieth‑century neo‑orthodoxy, and contemporary evangelical-charismatic theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: cessationism vs continuationism within Reformed circles; differing Reformed appraisals of Pentecostal spirituality and ecclesiology.
  - External: Reformed covenantal and sacramental paradigms vs Pentecostal subsequence, restorationism, and experience‑driven hermeneutics.
  - Contemporary: global Pentecostalism, prosperity teaching, ecumenism, and the place of **charismatic gifts** in Reformed churches.
- Defended position: A robustly Reformed yet non‑Pentecostal continuationism that affirms the **perpetuity of gifts** under the norm of **sola Scriptura**, rejects Pentecostal subsequence and restorationism, critiques prosperity distortions, and situates all charismatic practice within **covenant**, **ecclesiology**, and the **ordinary means of grace**.

### ESSAY
The controversy between Pentecostalism and Reformed theology is not primarily about whether the Holy Spirit is active, but about how the Spirit is related to the **Word**, the **church**, and the **history of redemption**. At stake are the nature of **baptism in the Spirit**, the status of **charismatic gifts**, the place of religious **experience**, and competing accounts of the **continuity and discontinuity** between the apostolic era and the present. A Reformed engagement must therefore be pneumatological, covenantal, and ecclesiological all at once, refusing to reduce Pentecostalism either to a set of exotic phenomena or to a merely sociological movement.

A natural point of departure is John Calvin, often called the theologian of the Holy Spirit. Calvin does not address Pentecostalism as such, but he decisively frames Reformed instincts in this debate. His context is the sixteenth‑century clash with Rome on one side and Radical spiritualists on the other. Against Rome, Calvin insists that the Spirit is not bound to an infallible magisterium; against the enthusiasts, he rejects an unmediated, antinomian appeal to the Spirit over against Scripture. His central move is to bind Spirit and Word in a covenantal economy. The Spirit is the **internal witness** who grants **assurance** and **illumination**, sealing the external Word in the heart, never bypassing or correcting that Word. Calvin’s view of the **means of grace** is equally decisive. The Spirit works through the preached Word and the sacraments to engraft believers into Christ, nourish faith, and build the church. There is no dichotomy between an institutional church and a Spirit‑filled church; the visible church, under the Word and sacraments, is the Spirit’s appointed arena.

This Calvinian pattern has several implications for assessing Pentecostal claims. First, Calvin refuses to locate the climactic gift of the Spirit in a post‑conversion crisis experience. For him, union with Christ entails the full gift of the Spirit given in justification and adoption. Growth may include profound intensifications of assurance or zeal, but these are sanctifying operations of the same Spirit already bestowed in Christ. Second, Calvin does not offer a systematic doctrine of cessationism. He notes a special concentration of signs in the apostolic era, but his emphasis falls more on the proper focus of faith. Believers are not to crave spectacular signs but to rest in Christ offered in Word and sacrament. A Westminster examiner will press: does Calvin allow for tongues or prophecy today? The honest answer is that he gives no explicit, principled prohibition, but his theology strongly disincentivizes seeking such manifestations, because it orients faith to the stable promises of the covenant rather than to episodic experiences. Calvin thus furnishes a robust theology of the Spirit that is deeply experiential yet covenantally tethered.

Moving into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, B. B. Warfield represents a decisive crystallization of a more explicit cessationism within the Reformed tradition. Writing in an American context marked by revivalism, Mormon claims, and rising faith‑healing movements, Warfield’s Counterfeit Miracles argues that miracles and revelatory gifts functioned as **signs of an apostle** and as divine accreditation of the foundational period of revelation. Once the canon is closed and the apostolic office has ceased, the need for such signs disappears. Warfield’s method is historical and theological. Historically, he seeks to demonstrate that robust continuation of apostolic‑type gifts is lacking in post‑apostolic Christianity, and that modern claims are either misinterpretations or frauds. Theologically, he grounds miracles in redemptive history as epochal markers. For Warfield, to expect continuing apostolic‑type miracles is to misunderstand their unique role in the once‑for‑all establishment of Christianity. He fears that continuationism tends inexorably toward undermining **sola Scriptura**, opening the door to new revelations and to a religious epistemology funded by private experience rather than by the closed canon.

A Reformed candidate must be prepared to evaluate Warfield critically yet appreciatively. His central insight, that miracles and prophecy have a redemptive‑historical function tied to the foundation of the church, captures something important in texts like Ephesians 2 and Hebrews 1. It guards **canonical sufficiency** and the finality of Christ. Yet examiners will ask whether Warfield proves too much: does the foundational role of apostolic signs entail an absolute cessation of all non‑ordinary gifts, or only of those that function as new redemptive‑historical revelation? Furthermore, Warfield’s historical argument is no longer as secure as he thought. Patristic sources and later reports provide at least some evidence of charismatic phenomena in the church’s life, however uneven and contested. One can affirm Warfield’s concerns about spurious miracle‑mongering and theological downgrade while questioning whether his universal negative claim regarding post‑apostolic gifts is sustainable. The Reformed response need not absolutize Warfield’s conclusions to preserve his best instincts: zeal for **Scripture’s unique authority** and resistance to experientialism as a norming standard.

Pentecostalism as a distinct movement emerges in the early twentieth century from the matrix of Wesleyan Holiness and revivalist traditions. William J. Seymour is a central founding figure. A black Holiness preacher shaped by Charles Parham’s doctrine of initial evidence, Seymour leads the Azusa Street revival in Los Angeles beginning in 1906. The theological core of early Pentecostalism that crystallizes there can be sketched under three emphases. First, a doctrine of **baptism in the Holy Spirit** as a distinct, post‑conversion empowerment for witness, generally evidenced by speaking in tongues. Second, a strong restorationist impulse that views early twentieth‑century events as the recovery of an apostolic pattern lost or suppressed in the intervening centuries. Third, a marked experiential and eschatological orientation. The felt presence of God, healings, and tongues are not merely edifying; they are interpreted as signs of the last days and the restoration of apostolic Christianity before Christ’s return.

Seymour’s theological contribution is not systematic, but his sermons and the Azusa Street Apostolic Faith publication exhibit a distinctive ecclesiological and pneumatological vision. The Spirit is poured out on all flesh, crossing racial, gender, and class lines. Participation in the Spirit manifests in free congregational worship, lay participation, and spiritual gifts. This vision has had immense global impact. Pentecostalism is now arguably the fastest‑growing stream within world Christianity, reshaping worship, mission, and expectations of spiritual experience across denominational lines. A Reformed candidate must recognize not only the theological problems but also the providential significance of this movement’s global reach and its challenge to Western formalism and rationalism.

From a Reformed standpoint, Seymour’s theology raises several concerns. The doctrine of subsequence conflicts with the Reformed understanding of union with Christ and **definitive sanctification**. To say that one may be a justified Christian lacking the baptism in the Spirit cuts against the apostolic pattern where the gift of the Spirit is inseparable from incorporation into Christ. The insistence on tongues as initial evidence introduces a two‑tiered Christianity and pressures believers into performance rather than resting in Christ’s finished work. Moreover, the strong restorationist rhetoric can functionally delegitimize the historical church under Christ’s providential guidance, implying a spiritual eclipse until Pentecostal revival. This stands in tension with a Reformed confidence in Christ’s promise to preserve his church through history. Yet, to dismiss Seymour and early Pentecostalism outright would be to ignore its function as a critique of a lifeless, sometimes racially segregated Christendom. Pentecostalism exposes how Reformed and other traditions at times neglected the **affective** and **experiential** dimensions of salvation that Reformed sources like Calvin and Edwards actually affirm.

Karl Barth does not engage Pentecostalism extensively, but his pneumatology and doctrine of revelation are structurally decisive for larger debates about charismatic phenomena and the authority of Scripture. Barth’s context is a struggle with liberal theology and its domestication of revelation into human religious consciousness. He insists on the **sovereign freedom of the Word of God**, with the Spirit as the one who makes Christ present in the event of proclamation. Revelation is personal encounter, not a deposit of propositions that humans possess as an object. This has a complex relation to Pentecostalism and to Reformed responses. On the one hand, Barth’s stress on the Spirit as free and sovereign could seem to legitimate a dynamic, unpredictable pneumatology friendly to charismatic phenomena. On the other hand, Barth is adamant that the Spirit’s work is to witness to the once‑for‑all self‑revelation of God in Christ and to the scriptural witness, not to add new doctrinal content alongside or beyond Scripture.

For a Reformed defense, Barth’s best insights sharpen a key boundary: the Spirit’s charismatic activity, however robust, must be subordinated to the unique and unrepeatable **Christ event** and its canonical attestation. Modern charismatic claims that in practice rival or relativize Scripture, or that function as quasi‑oracles governing believers’ decisions, are incompatible with this. At the same time, Barth’s emphasis on the living event of God’s address pushes back against any Reformed tendency to reduce Word and sacrament to static instruments controlled by ecclesiastical technique. Examiners may probe whether Barth’s account risks undermining **Scripture as a stable norm** by making it dependent on the event of God’s speaking. A Reformed candidate should respond by appropriating Barth’s stress on God’s freedom while insisting that God has freely bound himself by promise to his written Word as the sufficient and final rule. That commitment provides the non‑negotiable horizon within which all charismatic experience must be interpreted.

The rise of the so‑called “third wave” of the Spirit, associated with John Wimber and the Vineyard movement in the late twentieth century, represents a significant development in charismatic theology that complicates the simple Pentecostal vs Reformed dichotomy. Wimber seeks to distance his approach from classical Pentecostal subsequence and tongues as initial evidence, while retaining a strong expectation of signs and wonders in evangelism and discipleship. His “power evangelism” envisions the church as continuing Jesus’s ministry of healing and deliverance as a normal part of mission. Theologically, Wimber insists on the **already and not yet** of the kingdom, arguing that healings and other manifestations are foretastes of the coming consummation. He often appeals to Reformed‑friendly themes such as the kingdom of God and the Lordship of Christ. His movement has had substantial impact on evangelicals, including some within broadly Reformed circles.

From a Reformed standpoint, Wimber’s approach offers both possibilities and perils. On the positive side, he rejects the Pentecostal doctrine of a two‑stage Spirit reception, aligning more closely with Reformed soteriology. He also emphasizes that gifts are for service and mission, not self‑exaltation. However, his practical ecclesiology still tends toward a bifurcation between a “naturally supernatural” Christianity and “traditional” or “religious” forms often associated with historic liturgy and sacraments. Here the Reformed concern is that Wimber’s praxis, even when dressed in kingdom language, can functionally marginalize the **ordinary means of grace** in favor of visible manifestations as the index of vitality. Moreover, the “third wave” often tolerates a loosely regulated prophetic culture where words of knowledge and prophetic impressions, though formally subordinated to Scripture, operate de facto as authoritative guidance. This raises again Warfield’s and Barth’s concerns about the functional authority structures in charismatic environments.

Wayne Grudem, as an evangelical theologian with Reformed sympathies who defends contemporary prophecy and other gifts, brings the debate directly into Reformed and conservative evangelical theology. Grudem argues for spiritual gifts, including prophecy, as ongoing but as categorically distinct from canonical revelation. His key analytical move is to distinguish between the infallible inspiration of Scripture and a fallible, non‑binding prophetic gift in the church. In his exegesis of New Testament prophecy, Grudem contends that New Testament prophets can err and that their utterances must be sifted. Thus contemporary prophecy, in his view, does not compete with **sola Scriptura** but functions as a kind of Spirit‑prompted application or guidance. He embraces a broadly charismatic practice while affirming Reformation principles of Scripture’s final authority and salvation by grace alone.

Grudem’s work is decisive because it articulates a possible Reformed‑adjacent continuationism that attempts to safeguard Scripture while welcoming gifts. A Westminster examiner will press whether his distinction between inspired and non‑inspired prophecy is exegetically warranted. If New Testament prophecy is fallible and mixed, why is it treated with such gravity in texts like 1 Thessalonians 5 and 1 Corinthians 14? If prophecy can be in error, in what sense is it prophecy rather than sanctified opinion? Here, a Reformed response can affirm Grudem’s instinct to hold together **Scriptural sufficiency** and spiritual vitality, while questioning whether his redefinition of prophecy maintains the weight Scripture attaches to speaking in God’s name. One may argue instead that what many charismatics call prophecy is better described as impressions, exhortations, or wisdom, which can indeed be valued and weighed within the church, but without labeling them revelation from God.

This survey allows us to articulate a constructive Reformed position vis‑à‑vis Pentecostalism and its heirs. First, on **baptism in the Spirit**, a Reformed view must insist that all who are united to Christ by faith have been baptized in the Spirit. There is no class of Christians who have Christ but lack the Spirit as person. Subsequent intensifications of experience, assurance, or empowerment should be classified as deepening experiences of sanctification and filling, not as entry into a higher tier of spirituality. This guards the **ordo salutis** and protects assurance from being tethered to a particular crisis experience, thereby addressing pastoral devastation often seen when believers are told they are “missing something” because they have not spoken in tongues.

Second, on the **charismatic gifts**, the Reformed tradition historically includes both cessationist and continuationist strands. In light of Scripture and the global situation, a defensible position is a restrained continuationism. Scripture nowhere provides an explicit, principled statement that gifts such as tongues or prophecy will cease before the eschaton. The redemptive‑historical arguments of Warfield rightly underline the foundational role of the apostles and of inscripturating revelation, but they do not compel the conclusion that God cannot or does not distribute such gifts today in non‑foundational ways. However, any exercise of such gifts must be rigorously subjected to **sola Scriptura** and integrated into a robust ecclesiology. Charismatic phenomena must be tested, ordered, and subordinated to Word and sacrament. The church’s central identity is not a community of ecstatic experience but the covenant community gathered by the triune God through the gospel, living under elders, discipline, and the ministry of the Word.

Third, on **experience and assurance**, Pentecostalism rightly insists that Christianity involves the living presence of God and not mere mental assent. Reformed theology, when true to Calvin and the best of Edwards, also affirms that the Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts and that faith involves a **spiritual sight** of God’s glory. The Reformed critique is not of experience per se but of experientialism as norm. Any experience must be interpreted, disciplined, and sometimes relativized by Scripture. Likewise, tongues and visions cannot be permitted to function as sacramental centers of assurance; that role belongs to Christ as offered in Word and sacraments. Here the Reformed emphasis on **covenant objectivity** protects believers from the tyranny of fluctuating experiences.

Fourth, on **ecclesiology and mission**, Pentecostalism’s global evangelistic fervor and expectation of God’s active power in mission ought to humble and provoke Reformed churches that have grown comfortable. A Reformed response should embrace a robust dependence on the Spirit for mission, including prayer for healing and boldness, while rejecting a pragmatic or sensationalist missiology. The church is not called to manufacture the extraordinary but to be faithful in the ordinary means, leaving extraordinary interventions to God’s sovereign will. At the same time, Reformed ecclesiology must challenge Pentecostal congregationalism and anti‑institutionalism with the biblical vision of elders, discipline, sacraments, and creedal continuity.

Finally, contemporary issues such as the prosperity gospel and political mobilization in parts of global Pentecostalism intensify the need for Reformed engagement. A theology that associates Spirit presence with material success deviates sharply from the cruciform pattern of New Testament discipleship and from Reformed doctrines of **providence** and **suffering**. Here Reformed theology must speak prophetically, calling Pentecostal movements back to the Christ who suffered and the Spirit who conforms believers to his image through trials. Yet Reformed churches must also resist a cultural conservatism that simply reacts against Pentecostal exuberance without self‑examination. The Reformed confessions themselves envision a deeply spiritual, lively Christianity, not a formalist ritualism.

In sum, a Reformed evaluation of Pentecostalism should be neither reactionary dismissal nor naive synthesis. Calvin’s Word‑Spirit economy, Warfield’s zeal for canonical finality, Barth’s witness to Christ’s unique revelation, Seymour’s eschatological and experiential impetus, Wimber’s missionary charisma, and Grudem’s attempt at charismatic‑Reformed integration all mark crucial coordinates. The position defended here is a Christocentric, covenantal, ecclesial continuationism: affirming the **perpetuity of gifts** under the inviolable authority of Scripture, denying any subsequence doctrine that divides the body of Christ, and insisting that the Spirit’s primary work is to unite believers to Christ, build them up through **Word and sacrament**, and propel them in mission. Exercising gifts remains possible and even desirable when pursued humbly, tested rigorously, and embedded in the ordinary life of the church. Examiners probing this stance will ask whether it concedes too much to Pentecostalism or too little to the Spirit’s freedom. The answer must hold firm: the Spirit is most free when he binds us to Christ in the concrete structures Christ himself ordained for his church.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Pentecostalism is a twentieth‑century, globally influential movement emphasizing **baptism in the Spirit** as a post‑conversion experience, **charismatic gifts** as normative, and intense religious **experience**, which the Reformed tradition must evaluate in light of **sola Scriptura**, **covenant theology**, and the **ordinary means of grace**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Calvin: Word‑Spirit conjunction, assurance by the Spirit through the Word, no subsequence; shapes Reformed instincts against enthusiasm.
  - Warfield: strong cessationism grounded in redemptive‑historical finality of apostolic signs; guards canonical sufficiency but overstates historical and theological case.
  - Barth: sovereign, eventful Word and Spirit witnessing to Christ and Scripture; resists new revelation yet affirms God’s living address.
  - Seymour: Azusa Street leader; articulates subsequence, tongues as initial evidence, restorationist and experiential ecclesiology.
  - Wimber: third‑wave leader; rejects subsequence but normalizes signs and wonders in mission, sometimes marginalizing ordinary means.
  - Grudem: Reformed‑leaning continuationist; proposes fallible prophecy under Scripture to integrate gifts with evangelical orthodoxy.
- Debates:
  - Internal Reformed: cessationism vs continuationism; degree of openness to charismatic practice within confessional structures; adequacy of Warfield’s arguments.
  - External: Reformed union‑with‑Christ pneumatology vs Pentecostal subsequence; covenantal ecclesiology vs restorationist anti‑institutionalism; Scripture as final norm vs experiential authority.
  - Contemporary: global Pentecostal growth, prosperity distortions, prophetic cultures and guidance, charismatic influence in Reformed churches, ecumenical tensions.
- Defended position: A Reformed, covenantal continuationism affirming the **perpetuity of gifts** under the absolute norm of **sola Scriptura**, rejecting subsequence and initial‑evidence doctrines, critiquing prosperity and restorationism, and locating all charismatic practice within the **church’s ordinary means of grace**, **covenant objectivity**, and **Christ‑centered** mission.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does your position undermine Scriptural sufficiency?  
    Answer: No; any gift is non‑foundational, must be tested by Scripture, and cannot add doctrinal content or rival canonical authority.
  - How do you respond to Warfield’s cessationism?  
    Answer: Affirm his redemptive‑historical insight and concern for miracles as apostolic signs, but question the necessity of total cessation and note weak historical evidence.
  - What is wrong with Pentecostal subsequence?  
    Answer: It divides Christ and the Spirit, contradicts union‑with‑Christ soteriology, and creates a two‑tiered church contrary to New Testament teaching.
  - Can Reformed churches practice tongues and prophecy?  
    Answer: Only if understood as non‑revelatory, carefully ordered, subjected to eldership and discipline, and never made central over Word and sacrament.
  - How do you evaluate prosperity preaching in global Pentecostalism?  
    Answer: It conflicts with Reformed doctrines of providence, suffering, and the cross, and must be rejected as a serious distortion of the gospel.
