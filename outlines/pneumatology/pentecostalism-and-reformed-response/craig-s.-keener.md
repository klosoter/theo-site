# Craig S. Keener (1960–)

Craig S. Keener is a leading New Testament scholar whose work on **Pentecostalism** emphasizes the continuity of **miraculous gifts** and the **empowerment of the Holy Spirit** for the church today. While not Reformed himself, Keener engages deeply with **Reformed theology**, advocating for a biblically grounded openness to the **charismata** and challenging cessationist interpretations often found in Reformed circles.

## Legacy and Impact

Keener’s scholarship has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **Pentecostalism** and its relationship to **Reformed theology**, especially regarding the ongoing validity of spiritual gifts. His rigorous biblical exegesis and engagement with global Christianity have challenged cessationist assumptions and encouraged a more open, yet discerning, approach to the work of the Holy Spirit. Keener’s work remains influential among evangelicals, charismatics, and Reformed thinkers wrestling with the implications of the Spirit’s activity in the church today.
