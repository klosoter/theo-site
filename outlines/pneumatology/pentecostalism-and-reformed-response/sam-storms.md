# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms is a leading advocate of the **Reformed charismatic** position, combining a robust commitment to **Reformed soteriology** and the **authority of Scripture** with the conviction that the **gifts of the Spirit** continue today. He insists that spiritual gifts such as prophecy, healing, and tongues are for the edification of the church, while maintaining the centrality of **sola Scriptura** and the sovereignty of God.
