# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose engagement with **Pentecostalism** centers on the nature and cessation of **spiritual gifts** in the post-apostolic church. He argues that the **extraordinary gifts** (such as prophecy and tongues) were unique to the foundational era of **redemptive history** and are no longer normative, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** in the ordinary means of grace.

- "The New Testament gifts of prophecy and tongues were tied to the foundational period of the church and are not to be expected as ongoing features of the church’s life." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **apostolic era** was unique in its manifestation of revelatory gifts.
    - Gifts such as **prophecy** and **tongues** served to authenticate the foundational revelation of Christ and the apostles.
    - With the closure of the **canon**, these gifts ceased as normative for the church.
    - The ongoing ministry of the Spirit is now tied to the **Word** and sacraments.
    - "The gifts of prophecy and tongues were temporary and foundational, not permanent features of the church." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

2. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - The **canon of Scripture** is complete and fully sufficient for faith and life.
    - No new revelation is needed or expected beyond the apostolic witness.
    - The church is to test all claims of spiritual experience by the written Word.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the ministry of Scripture.
    - "The Spirit does not supplement the Word with new revelation but works through it." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - The history of redemption unfolds in distinct epochs, each with unique features.
    - The **apostolic age** was a once-for-all, unrepeatable stage in redemptive history.
    - Extraordinary gifts were signs of the transition from old to new covenant.
    - The church today lives in the era of the Spirit’s ordinary operations.
    - "The pattern of redemptive history is decisive for understanding the gifts of the Spirit." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Ordinary Means of Grace**
    - The Spirit’s ongoing work is primarily through **preaching**, **sacraments**, and prayer.
    - These means are sufficient for the church’s growth and sanctification.
    - Emphasis on the ordinary means guards against seeking new, extrabiblical experiences.
    - The Reformed tradition upholds the regular ministry of the Word as central.
    - "The Spirit’s presence is known chiefly through the ordinary means Christ has appointed." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Critical Engagement with Pentecostalism**
    - Pentecostalism’s emphasis on ongoing revelation is seen as a challenge to **sola Scriptura**.
    - Gaffin acknowledges the need for spiritual vitality but warns against doctrinal error.
    - He calls for discernment and a return to biblical norms for spiritual experience.
    - The Reformed response is both pastoral and theological, seeking to uphold the sufficiency of Christ and his Word.
    - "The Reformed tradition must respond to Pentecostalism with clarity about the Spirit’s true work." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has shaped the **Reformed response** to Pentecostalism by providing a robust biblical and theological rationale for the cessation of extraordinary gifts. His redemptive-historical approach has influenced generations of pastors and scholars in understanding the work of the **Holy Spirit** within the boundaries of Scripture. By emphasizing the sufficiency of the Word and the ordinary means of grace, Gaffin has helped anchor Reformed churches in a theology that is both Spirit-filled and Word-centered. His contributions continue to inform contemporary debates on charismatic gifts and the nature of spiritual experience in the church.
