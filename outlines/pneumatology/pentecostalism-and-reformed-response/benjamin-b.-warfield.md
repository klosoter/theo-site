# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a leading **Reformed theologian** who offered a robust critique of **Pentecostalism**, particularly its claims regarding **miraculous gifts** and **continuing revelation**. He argued that the **extraordinary charismata** ceased with the close of the **apostolic age**, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** for the church’s faith and practice.

- "The miraculous gifts were part of the credentials of the Apostles, as authoritative agents of God in founding the church." ("Counterfeit Miracles")

## Key Works

- Counterfeit Miracles (1918)
- Revelation and Inspiration (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 1)
- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible
- Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 2 (essays on miracles and the supernatural)
- Calvin and Augustine (contextualizes Reformed views on the Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Apostolic Gifts**
    - The **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were unique to the **apostolic era**.
    - These gifts served to authenticate the **apostles** as foundational witnesses.
    - With the completion of the **New Testament canon**, such gifts ceased.
    - Modern claims to these gifts are viewed as misunderstandings or imitations.
    - "These gifts were not intended to be characteristic of the permanent life of the Church." (Counterfeit Miracles)

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - The **Bible** is the complete and final revelation of God.
    - No new **revelation** is necessary or expected after the apostolic age.
    - All spiritual experience must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - Pentecostal claims to new revelation undermine the **authority of the Word**.
    - "The Scriptures are the Word of God, and nothing else is the Word of God." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

3. **Providence over Ongoing Miracles**
    - God continues to work through **providence**, not ongoing miracles.
    - The ordinary operations of God are sufficient for the church’s life.
    - Claims of frequent miracles distract from God’s ordinary means of grace.
    - The focus should be on **Word and Sacrament**, not signs and wonders.
    - "God’s hand is not shortened, but His method is changed." (Counterfeit Miracles)

4. **Reformed Pneumatology**
    - The **Holy Spirit** works primarily through the **Word** and **regeneration**.
    - The Spirit’s role is to apply redemption, not to grant new revelation.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is evidenced by sanctification, not by miraculous gifts.
    - The Reformed tradition emphasizes the Spirit’s ordinary, not extraordinary, operations.
    - "The Spirit’s witness is not in new revelations, but in the heart’s response to the Word." (Revelation and Inspiration)

5. **Discernment and the Dangers of Enthusiasm**
    - The church must exercise discernment regarding claims of supernatural phenomena.
    - **Religious enthusiasm** can lead to error and division.
    - True spiritual experience is grounded in **doctrine** and **Scripture**.
    - Warfield warns against confusing emotionalism with genuine work of the Spirit.
    - "The history of the Church is strewn with the wrecks of enthusiastic movements." (Counterfeit Miracles)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s critique of **Pentecostalism** shaped the **Reformed response** to charismatic movements throughout the twentieth century, reinforcing the doctrine of **cessationism**. His insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the finality of apostolic revelation remains foundational for conservative Reformed theology. Warfield’s arguments continue to be cited in debates over spiritual gifts, providing a theological framework for evaluating claims of modern miracles and revelations.
