# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth engaged **Pentecostalism** primarily through his broader critique of **enthusiasm** and the subjective appropriation of the **Holy Spirit** outside the bounds of **Scripture** and the **Church’s proclamation**. Barth affirmed the ongoing work of the Spirit but insisted that authentic revelation is always anchored in **Christocentric revelation** and the **Word of God**, cautioning against experientialism that bypasses the normative authority of Scripture.

- "The Holy Spirit is not a spirit of enthusiasm, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who binds us to the Word." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Church Dogmatics IV/1: The Doctrine of Reconciliation
- The Holy Spirit and the Christian Life (1938)
- Protestant Theology in the Nineteenth Century
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Christocentric and Scriptural**
    - Revelation occurs supremely in the person of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **Holy Spirit** never works apart from the **Word of God**.
    - All spiritual experience is subject to the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Barth rejects any claim to new revelation that bypasses Christ and the biblical witness.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and His work is to lead us to Christ as attested in Scripture." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Critique of Enthusiasm and Subjectivism**
    - Barth warns against spiritual movements that prioritize **subjective experience** over the objective Word.
    - He identifies Pentecostalism as susceptible to **enthusiasm**—the elevation of inner experience as revelation.
    - True faith is grounded in God’s act, not in human feeling or ecstasy.
    - The Spirit’s work is always to point away from self to Christ.
    - "Where the Spirit is, there is no enthusiasm, but obedience to the Word." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **The Spirit’s Work is Ecclesial**
    - The Holy Spirit operates within the context of the **Church** and its proclamation.
    - Barth emphasizes the communal, not individualistic, nature of the Spirit’s activity.
    - The gifts of the Spirit serve the upbuilding of the body, not private spiritual experience.
    - Pentecostal claims to individual charismatic gifts are subordinated to the Church’s witness.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the community, not of the isolated individual." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Miracles and Spiritual Gifts are Secondary**
    - Barth does not deny the possibility of **miracles** or **charismatic gifts** but sees them as secondary to the Word.
    - The primary miracle is the event of faith and the Church’s existence.
    - Signs and wonders are not the normative mark of the Spirit’s presence.
    - The focus remains on Christ and the proclamation of the gospel.
    - "The miracle is that we believe, not that we speak in tongues." (Evangelical Theology: An Introduction)

5. **Pneumatology is Subordinate to Christology**
    - The doctrine of the **Holy Spirit** is inseparable from the doctrine of **Christ**.
    - Barth resists any pneumatology that operates independently from Christ’s person and work.
    - The Spirit’s role is to unite believers to Christ and make His benefits effective.
    - Any spiritual movement must be tested by its conformity to Christ as revealed in Scripture.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and His work is to glorify Christ." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s response to Pentecostalism shaped much of the **Reformed critique** of charismatic movements, emphasizing the primacy of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ** in all spiritual experience. His warnings against enthusiasm and subjectivism have been influential in Reformed and mainline Protestant circles. Barth’s robust **pneumatology**, while affirming the Spirit’s ongoing work, continues to challenge both Pentecostal and Reformed theologians to ground spiritual life in the objective reality of God’s revelation in Christ.
