# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, though not a Pentecostal himself, engaged critically with the rise of **Pentecostalism** and its emphasis on **spiritual experience** and the **Holy Spirit**. From his **Reformed** perspective, Brunner affirmed the ongoing work of the Spirit but warned against separating the Spirit’s activity from the **Word of God** and the centrality of **Christ**. He advocated for a theology that maintains the primacy of **revelation in Christ** and the authority of **Scripture** over subjective religious experiences.

- "The Holy Spirit never works apart from the Word, nor does the Word work apart from the Spirit." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Key Works

- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God (1949)
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (1952)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)
- The Mediator (1934)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Christocentric**
   - Revelation is given supremely in the person of Jesus Christ.
   - All authentic spiritual experience must be measured by its conformity to Christ.
   - The work of the Holy Spirit is to point to and glorify Christ, not to draw attention to itself.
   - Any movement, including Pentecostalism, is critiqued by its faithfulness to the revelation in Christ.
   - "The revelation of God is identical with Jesus Christ; outside Him there is no revelation." (The Mediator)

2. **Word and Spirit are inseparable**
   - The Holy Spirit works through the proclamation of the Word.
   - Spiritual experiences must be tested by Scripture.
   - Brunner rejects any dichotomy between Spirit and Word as unbiblical.
   - The authority of the Spirit is never independent of the authority of Scripture.
   - "The Spirit and the Word belong together; the one cannot be understood without the other." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Caution against Subjectivism**
   - Brunner warns that overemphasis on personal experience can lead to theological subjectivism.
   - Authentic Christian faith is grounded in God’s objective revelation, not in inner feelings.
   - Pentecostalism’s focus on ecstatic experience is critiqued as potentially undermining doctrinal stability.
   - The church must discern the spirits by the standard of the gospel.
   - "Faith is not an experience, but an encounter with the living God who addresses us." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **The Church as the Community of the Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit creates and sustains the church as the body of Christ.
   - Spiritual gifts are given for the edification of the community, not for individual exaltation.
   - Brunner affirms the diversity of gifts but insists on their order and purpose within the church.
   - The unity of the church is grounded in the Spirit’s work through the Word.
   - "The Spirit binds us together in the fellowship of Christ, not in the pursuit of private ecstasies." (Dogmatics II)

5. **Critical Engagement with Modern Movements**
   - Brunner engages contemporary religious movements, including Pentecostalism, with openness and critique.
   - He acknowledges the need for renewal and the reality of spiritual power.
   - However, he insists that all renewal must be rooted in the gospel and the historic faith.
   - The Reformed tradition provides resources for discerning true from false spiritual movements.
   - "Every movement of the Spirit must be tested by the message of Christ crucified and risen." (Dogmatics I)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s response to **Pentecostalism** shaped Reformed engagement with charismatic movements by emphasizing the inseparability of **Word and Spirit** and the centrality of **Christ**. His warnings against subjectivism and insistence on the authority of **Scripture** continue to inform Reformed critiques of experiential theologies. Brunner’s nuanced approach encouraged dialogue while maintaining the distinctives of the Reformed tradition, leaving a lasting mark on 20th-century theology.
