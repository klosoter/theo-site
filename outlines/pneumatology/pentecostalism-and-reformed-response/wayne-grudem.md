# Wayne Grudem (1948– )

Wayne Grudem is a leading evangelical theologian who has engaged extensively with **Pentecostalism** from a broadly **Reformed** perspective, particularly regarding the **continuation of spiritual gifts**. While affirming the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **justification by faith**, Grudem diverges from traditional cessationism by arguing that the **miraculous gifts** of the Spirit, such as prophecy and tongues, continue today but must be exercised under biblical guidelines.

- "I believe that the New Testament gives us ample reason to expect that spiritual gifts, including prophecy, will continue throughout the church age." (The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today)

## Key Works

- Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (ed., 1996)
- 1 Corinthians: Tyndale New Testament Commentary (1982)
- "Should Christians Expect Miracles Today?" (Journal articles and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuationism of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Argues that **miraculous gifts** (prophecy, tongues, healing) have not ceased.
    - Bases this on exegesis of key texts such as 1 Corinthians 12–14 and Ephesians 4.
    - Distinguishes between **apostolic revelation** and contemporary, non-canonical prophecy.
    - Emphasizes that all gifts must be tested and subject to **Scripture**.
    - "The evidence of the New Testament points to the continuation of all the gifts until Christ returns." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Authority and Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - Maintains that **Scripture** is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - Spiritual gifts must never undermine or add to the **closed canon**.
    - Prophetic impressions are always subordinate to the Bible.
    - Warns against any form of extra-biblical revelation that rivals Scripture.
    - "No modern prophecy should be considered equal to Scripture in authority." (The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today)

3. **Reformed Soteriology and Pneumatology**
    - Upholds **justification by faith alone** and the sovereignty of God in salvation.
    - Sees the Holy Spirit’s work as essential in both regeneration and sanctification.
    - Affirms that spiritual gifts are not signs of superior spirituality or salvation.
    - Integrates charismatic experience within a **Reformed** doctrinal framework.
    - "The gifts are given for the building up of the church, not as marks of spiritual status." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Order and Edification in Worship**
    - Insists that all exercise of gifts must promote **edification** and order in the church.
    - Draws on Paul’s instructions in 1 Corinthians 14 for practical guidelines.
    - Opposes emotionalism and disorder often associated with some Pentecostal practices.
    - Encourages discernment and accountability in the use of gifts.
    - "Let all things be done for building up." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Critical but Appreciative Engagement with Pentecostalism**
    - Recognizes the vitality and global growth of **Pentecostal** and charismatic movements.
    - Critiques excesses, doctrinal errors, and abuses within some Pentecostal circles.
    - Seeks common ground on the work of the Holy Spirit while maintaining Reformed distinctives.
    - Advocates for theological dialogue and mutual correction.
    - "We can learn from our Pentecostal brothers and sisters, even as we hold fast to biblical truth." (Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?)
