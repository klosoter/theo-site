# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper engaged the rise of **Pentecostalism** from a distinctly **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** while maintaining the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**. He affirmed the reality of spiritual experience but was critical of movements that, in his view, threatened the **order of the church** and the **normativity of the Word** with claims of new revelation or extraordinary gifts.

- "The Reformed confession has always maintained that the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were for the foundation of the church and not its ongoing edification." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit’s Work Is Ordinarily Mediated by the Word**
    - The Holy Spirit works primarily through **Scripture** and the **preaching of the Word**.
    - Extraordinary gifts were foundational, not normative for the ongoing church.
    - Emphasized the **ordinary means of grace** over ecstatic experiences.
    - Warned against separating the Spirit from the Word in Christian life.
    - "The Holy Spirit does not work independently of the Word, but always in and through it." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - Miraculous gifts were given for the **apostolic era** to establish the church.
    - The Reformed tradition holds that such gifts have ceased with the close of the canon.
    - Ongoing claims to prophecy or tongues risk undermining the **sufficiency of Scripture**.
    - The focus should be on **sanctification** and spiritual fruit, not signs and wonders.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were for the church’s foundation, not its permanent edification." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Emphasis on the Sovereignty of God in Revival**
    - True revival is a sovereign act of God, not a product of human manipulation.
    - Spiritual renewal must align with **biblical truth** and the **confessions**.
    - Emotionalism and disorder are to be avoided in favor of **Reformed piety**.
    - The Spirit’s work is recognized by its conformity to the **Word and order**.
    - "All true revival is the work of the sovereign God, not the product of human enthusiasm." (Lectures on Calvinism)

4. **The Church’s Order and Discipline**
    - The church must maintain **order** and **discipline** in worship and doctrine.
    - Charismatic phenomena threaten the unity and structure of the church.
    - The **offices of the church** are instituted by Christ and not to be bypassed.
    - Spiritual gifts are to be exercised within the bounds of **ecclesiastical order**.
    - "The Reformed church has always insisted on order and discipline as marks of the true church." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Affirmation of the Spirit’s Ongoing Work in Sanctification**
    - The Holy Spirit continues to work in believers through **regeneration** and **sanctification**.
    - Emphasized the **transforming power** of the Spirit in daily Christian life.
    - Spiritual growth is evidenced by the **fruit of the Spirit**, not by miraculous signs.
    - The Spirit’s presence is discerned in the believer’s conformity to Christ.
    - "The Spirit’s work is seen in the renewal of life and character, not in extraordinary manifestations." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s response to **Pentecostalism** shaped the **Reformed** engagement with charismatic movements, reinforcing the centrality of **Scripture** and the ordinary means of grace. His insistence on the cessation of extraordinary gifts and the importance of church order provided a framework for later Reformed critiques of Pentecostal and charismatic phenomena. Kuyper’s nuanced pneumatology continues to influence Reformed theology, especially in discussions of the Holy Spirit’s work in the church and the world.
