# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **Pentecostalism** from a distinctively **Reformed** perspective, affirming the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** while critiquing certain Pentecostal emphases on **extraordinary gifts** and **revelation**. He stresses the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the regulative principle of worship, yet acknowledges the need for vibrant spiritual experience within the boundaries of **Reformed theology**.

- "The Reformed tradition has often been suspicious of Pentecostalism, but we must not let that suspicion blind us to the reality of the Spirit’s work in the church." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- Worship in Spirit and Truth
- Perspectives on the Word of God
- "Pentecostal Worship: A Reformed Critique" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - Scripture is the supreme norm for faith and practice, above all claims of new revelation.
    - All spiritual experiences must be tested by the **Word of God**.
    - The canon is closed; no new normative revelation is given today.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against doctrinal error.
    - "We must always test the spirits by the written Word, for it is our only infallible rule." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Cessation and Continuity of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Frame recognizes the cessation of **apostolic** and **revelatory gifts** (e.g., tongues, prophecy) as normative in Reformed theology.
    - He allows for the possibility of non-normative, non-canonical spiritual gifts today.
    - Emphasizes discernment and order in the exercise of any gifts.
    - Warns against equating spiritual maturity with possession of extraordinary gifts.
    - "The Spirit is sovereign in distributing gifts, and we must not demand from him what he has not promised." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **The Holy Spirit’s Ongoing Work**
    - The Spirit continues to **sanctify**, **illuminate**, and empower believers.
    - Spiritual vitality is essential, but must be grounded in biblical truth.
    - Encourages openness to the Spirit’s work within Reformed boundaries.
    - Critiques both rationalistic deadness and uncritical emotionalism.
    - "We must seek the fullness of the Spirit, but always in submission to Scripture." (Worship in Spirit and Truth)

4. **Regulative Principle of Worship**
    - Worship must be governed by what God has commanded in Scripture.
    - Rejects innovations in worship not warranted by the Word.
    - Critiques Pentecostal worship practices that lack biblical warrant.
    - Upholds reverence, order, and theological depth in worship.
    - "Worship must be regulated by God’s revealed will, not by our preferences or experiences." (Worship in Spirit and Truth)

5. **Critical Engagement with Pentecostalism**
    - Frame urges charitable critique rather than outright dismissal of Pentecostalism.
    - Recognizes the movement’s emphasis on experiential Christianity as a needed corrective to cold formalism.
    - Warns against doctrinal excesses and subjective authority.
    - Calls for Reformed believers to pursue both truth and spiritual vitality.
    - "We should learn from Pentecostals’ zeal, but always reform it by the Word." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has provided a nuanced **Reformed response** to Pentecostalism, balancing a high view of **Scripture** with openness to the Spirit’s ongoing work. His writings have encouraged Reformed churches to pursue genuine spiritual vitality without compromising doctrinal fidelity. Frame’s approach has fostered more constructive dialogue between Reformed and Pentecostal traditions, shaping contemporary discussions on the role of the Holy Spirit and spiritual gifts in the church.
