# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer engaged **Pentecostalism** from a Reformed perspective, critically assessing its views on **revelation**, **Spirit baptism**, and **charismatic gifts**. He emphasized the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the centrality of **justification by faith**, while urging discernment regarding claims of new revelation and extraordinary experiences of the **Holy Spirit**.

- "The Reformed confession has always emphasized that the work of the Spirit is inseparably bound to the Word." (The Work of the Holy Spirit, p. 19)

## Key Works

- The Work of the Holy Spirit (1967)
- Holy Scripture (1966)
- Faith and Justification (1954)
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- The Person of Christ (1954)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Sufficient and Final Revelation**
    - Scripture is the complete and normative revelation for the church.
    - Claims of new revelation or prophecy are to be tested by the Word.
    - The canon is closed; ongoing revelation undermines the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The Holy Spirit’s illumination never adds to or supersedes Scripture.
    - "The Spirit does not bring a new message, but opens the heart to the message already given." (The Work of the Holy Spirit, p. 22)

2. **Spirit Baptism and Union with Christ**
    - Spirit baptism is not a second blessing but coincides with regeneration and faith.
    - All believers receive the Holy Spirit at conversion.
    - The Pentecostal distinction between ordinary and Spirit-filled Christians is rejected.
    - Union with Christ is the foundation for all spiritual blessings.
    - "There is no biblical ground for a two-stage Christianity." (The Work of the Holy Spirit, p. 113)

3. **Discernment of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Spiritual gifts are given for the edification of the church, not for personal status.
    - Extraordinary gifts (tongues, prophecy) are not normative for every era.
    - The Reformed tradition values ordinary means of grace over spectacular manifestations.
    - Claims of charismatic gifts must be evaluated by Scripture and the church.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are always subordinate to the fruit of the Spirit." (The Work of the Holy Spirit, p. 156)

4. **Centrality of Justification by Faith**
    - Justification by faith is the heart of the gospel and the Christian life.
    - Any emphasis on experience or works that eclipses justification is a theological danger.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not on subjective spiritual experiences.
    - The Pentecostal focus on experience can obscure the objective ground of salvation.
    - "The certainty of faith rests not in our experience, but in the promise of God." (Faith and Justification, p. 87)

5. **The Spirit’s Work in the Ordinary Life of the Church**
    - The Spirit works primarily through the ordinary means of grace: Word and sacrament.
    - The church is the context for the Spirit’s ongoing ministry.
    - Extraordinary experiences are not necessary for authentic Christian life.
    - The Reformed tradition emphasizes the Spirit’s quiet, sanctifying work.
    - "The Spirit’s work is not always dramatic, but it is always essential." (The Work of the Holy Spirit, p. 201)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s careful engagement with **Pentecostalism** shaped the Reformed response to charismatic movements in the twentieth century. His insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the centrality of **justification by faith** provided a robust theological framework for evaluating claims of new revelation and spiritual experience. Berkouwer’s work continues to inform Reformed dialogue with Pentecostal and charismatic traditions, emphasizing discernment, biblical fidelity, and the ordinary means of grace.
