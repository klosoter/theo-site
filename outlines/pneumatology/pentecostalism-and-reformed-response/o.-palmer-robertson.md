# O. Palmer Robertson (1937–)

O. Palmer Robertson, a leading figure in **Reformed theology**, has been a vocal critic of **Pentecostalism**, especially its views on **continuing revelation** and the **gifts of the Spirit**. He argues that the **apostolic era** was unique and that the **extraordinary gifts** ceased with the close of the **canon of Scripture**, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **biblical revelation** for the church today.

- "The Pentecostal movement, by its very nature, undermines the finality of the biblical canon and the sufficiency of Scripture." (The Final Word)

## Key Works

- The Final Word: A Biblical Response to the Case for Tongues and Prophecy Today
- The Christ of the Covenants
- The Holy Spirit: His Person and Work (various essays and lectures)
- "Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?" (contributor to edited volumes)
- The Israel of God: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were tied to the **apostolic foundation** of the church.
    - These gifts authenticated the message and messengers of the **New Testament era**.
    - With the completion of the **canon**, their purpose was fulfilled and they ceased.
    - Ongoing claims to such gifts threaten the **sufficiency of Scripture**.
    - "The gifts of tongues and prophecy served a foundational role and are no longer normative for the church." (The Final Word)

2. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - The **Bible** is the complete and final revelation of God to humanity.
    - No further **revelation** is necessary or expected after the apostolic age.
    - Any claim to new revelation undermines the authority of **Scripture alone**.
    - The church is called to test all things by the **Word of God**.
    - "The canon of Scripture is closed, and with it, the era of new revelation has ended." (The Final Word)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Continuity**
    - The **covenant structure** of Scripture shows a progression from promise to fulfillment in Christ.
    - The **extraordinary gifts** were part of the redemptive-historical transition.
    - The church now lives in the era of fulfillment, relying on the **Spirit’s ordinary work**.
    - The focus is on Christ and his completed work, not ongoing signs and wonders.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit must be understood in their redemptive-historical context." (The Christ of the Covenants)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** continues to work powerfully through the ordinary means of grace.
    - His primary role is to apply the benefits of Christ’s redemption to believers.
    - The Spirit’s work is not dependent on visible or miraculous manifestations.
    - Emphasis is placed on sanctification, assurance, and illumination through the Word.
    - "The Spirit’s greatest work is to bring men and women to Christ and conform them to his image." (The Holy Spirit: His Person and Work)

5. **Pastoral Caution Regarding Pentecostalism**
    - Pentecostalism’s emphasis on experience can distract from **biblical truth**.
    - The movement risks fostering division and spiritual elitism within the church.
    - Reformed pastors are urged to shepherd their flocks with discernment and clarity.
    - True spiritual vitality is found in the ordinary means of grace, not in extraordinary gifts.
    - "The church must guard against any teaching that detracts from the sufficiency of Christ and his Word." (The Final Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Robertson’s critique of **Pentecostalism** has shaped the Reformed response to the charismatic movement, reinforcing the doctrine of **sola Scriptura** and the cessation of extraordinary gifts. His work has provided clarity for pastors and theologians navigating the challenges posed by claims of continuing revelation. By emphasizing the **redemptive-historical** context of the Spirit’s work, Robertson has helped the Reformed tradition articulate a robust, biblically grounded alternative to Pentecostal theology.
