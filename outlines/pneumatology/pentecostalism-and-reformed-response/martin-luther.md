# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s stance toward movements like **Pentecostalism** is best understood through his views on the **work of the Holy Spirit**, **Scripture’s sufficiency**, and the **means of grace**. While Luther affirmed the ongoing presence of the Spirit, he was deeply critical of any claim to **new revelation** or **ecstatic experience** that bypassed or contradicted the **Word and sacraments**. His response to early charismatic movements, such as the **Schwärmer** (enthusiasts), set a precedent for later **Reformed critiques** of Pentecostalism.

- "Whatever is attributed to the Spirit apart from the Word and sacraments is of the devil." (Luther, Against the Heavenly Prophets)

## Key Works

- Against the Heavenly Prophets (1525)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)
- Preface to the New Testament (1522)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 40: Church and Ministry II

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit Works Through the Word**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is inseparably bound to the external **Word of God**.
    - Claims to direct revelation apart from Scripture are rejected.
    - The Spirit’s role is to illumine and apply the Word, not to add to it.
    - True spiritual experience is always anchored in the preached Word.
    - "For God gives no one His Spirit or grace except through or with the external Word." (Large Catechism)

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - **Scripture** is the final and sufficient authority for faith and practice.
    - Extra-biblical revelations are viewed with suspicion and often condemned.
    - The canon is closed; new prophecy is unnecessary and dangerous.
    - All spiritual phenomena must be tested by the written Word.
    - "We must firmly hold that God will not reveal anything to us that is contrary to His Word." (Against the Heavenly Prophets)

3. **Means of Grace as Ordinary Channels**
    - The Spirit ordinarily works through **preaching**, **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - Sacraments are visible words, not empty rituals or mere symbols.
    - Spiritual gifts are subordinate to the means of grace.
    - Ecstatic experiences are not necessary for genuine Christian life.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given to no one without the outward Word and sign instituted by God." (Smalcald Articles)

4. **Critique of Enthusiasm (Schwärmerei)**
    - Enthusiasts claim direct inspiration apart from Scripture and sacraments.
    - Such claims undermine the objectivity of the gospel.
    - Luther associates enthusiasm with spiritual pride and deception.
    - The Reformation stands against all forms of spiritual subjectivism.
    - "All who wish to separate the Spirit from the Word and sacraments are fanatics." (Against the Heavenly Prophets)

5. **Discernment of Spirits**
    - Not all spiritual manifestations are from the Holy Spirit.
    - The church must exercise discernment, testing all things by Scripture.
    - Spiritual gifts must serve the edification of the body, not individual exaltation.
    - True signs of the Spirit are faith, love, and obedience to the gospel.
    - "Whatever does not teach Christ is not from the Holy Spirit." (Preface to the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust defense of the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **means of grace** shaped the Reformed response to later charismatic and Pentecostal movements. His polemic against **enthusiasm** provided theological categories for critiquing claims of new revelation and ecstatic experience. While Luther affirmed the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, his insistence on the Spirit’s attachment to the Word remains a foundational principle for confessional Protestantism. This legacy continues to inform Reformed engagement with Pentecostalism, emphasizing discernment and fidelity to the gospel.
