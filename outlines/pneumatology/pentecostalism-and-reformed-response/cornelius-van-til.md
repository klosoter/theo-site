# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til, as a leading figure in **Reformed apologetics** and **systematic theology**, critiqued **Pentecostalism** from the standpoint of **Reformed confessionalism** and the sufficiency of **Scripture**. He emphasized the finality of **special revelation** and the regulative principle of worship, arguing that Pentecostal claims to ongoing **revelation** and **extraordinary gifts** undermine the authority and clarity of the biblical canon.

- "If the Scriptures are sufficient, then no further revelation is needed or to be expected." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture (in The Infallible Word, co-authored)
- Essays in Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
   - Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
   - The canon is closed; no new revelation is to be expected.
   - All claims to ongoing revelation must be tested by Scripture.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is foundational to Reformed theology.
   - "The Bible is itself the final court of appeal in all matters of faith and life." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
   - The extraordinary gifts (e.g., tongues, prophecy) served a foundational role in redemptive history.
   - These gifts authenticated the apostolic message and ceased with the completion of the canon.
   - Ongoing claims to such gifts risk undermining the unique authority of the apostolic witness.
   - Reformed theology maintains a distinction between the extraordinary and ordinary operations of the Spirit.
   - "The gifts of the Spirit were given for the establishment of the church and are not normative for every age." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Regulative Principle of Worship**
   - Worship must be governed by what God has commanded in Scripture.
   - Innovations in worship, including charismatic practices, are viewed with suspicion.
   - The regulative principle guards against subjectivism and unauthorized practices.
   - Pentecostal worship forms are critiqued as lacking biblical warrant.
   - "We must worship God as he has commanded, not as we imagine." (Essays in Christian Education)

4. **Objectivity of Revelation**
   - Revelation is objective, propositional, and completed in Scripture.
   - Subjective experiences must not be equated with divine revelation.
   - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are central to knowing God’s will.
   - Pentecostal emphasis on experience is seen as a threat to doctrinal stability.
   - "God’s revelation is not to be found in the shifting sands of human experience but in the solid rock of his Word." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis Between Reformed and Pentecostal Epistemology**
   - Reformed theology insists on a principial antithesis between biblical and non-biblical worldviews.
   - Pentecostal epistemology is critiqued for its openness to extra-biblical sources of knowledge.
   - The Reformed approach grounds knowledge of God in Scripture alone.
   - Any appeal to ongoing revelation is seen as compromising the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture.
   - "There is no neutrality; either one stands on the Word of God or on the word of man." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s critique of **Pentecostalism** shaped the Reformed response to charismatic movements, reinforcing the centrality of **Scripture** and the cessationist position within confessional Reformed circles. His insistence on the **antithesis** between Reformed and Pentecostal epistemologies influenced subsequent generations of Reformed theologians and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the sufficiency and finality of biblical revelation against claims of ongoing prophecy and miraculous gifts.
