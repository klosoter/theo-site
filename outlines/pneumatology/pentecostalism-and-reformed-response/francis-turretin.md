# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust defense of the **cessation of extraordinary gifts** and the sufficiency of **Scripture**. In response to movements akin to later **Pentecostalism**, Turretin emphasized the **closed canon** and the enduring authority of **ordinary means of grace** over claims to new revelation or miraculous gifts.

- "The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were given for the founding of the church and ceased with the apostles." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected Questions on the Doctrine of Scripture (various loci in Institutes)
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) served to authenticate the apostolic message.
    - These gifts were **temporary** and ceased with the completion of the **New Testament canon**.
    - The church is now governed by the **ordinary ministry of Word and Sacrament**.
    - Claims to new revelation undermine the sufficiency and finality of Scripture.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were not intended to be perpetual, but to cease with the completion of the canon." (Institutes)

2. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - **Scripture** contains all things necessary for faith and practice.
    - No further revelation is needed or expected after the apostolic age.
    - The **Holy Spirit** now works through the Word, not new prophecy.
    - Any claim to ongoing revelation is to be tested and rejected if it contradicts Scripture.
    - "The Scriptures are the only and perfect rule of faith, to which nothing is to be added." (Institutes)

3. **Ordinary Means of Grace**
    - God ordinarily works through **preaching, sacraments, and prayer**.
    - The focus is on the **means instituted by Christ**, not on extraordinary manifestations.
    - The Spirit’s work is inward, effectual, and tied to the Word.
    - Reliance on extraordinary gifts distracts from the sufficiency of the ordinary means.
    - "The ordinary means are sufficient for the edification and preservation of the church." (Institutes)

4. **Discernment and Authority in the Church**
    - The church must exercise discernment regarding claims of spiritual gifts.
    - **Ecclesiastical authority** is grounded in Scripture, not private revelations.
    - The **regulative principle** governs worship and doctrine.
    - Any new claims must be measured by the established rule of faith.
    - "Nothing is to be received in the church which does not have the warrant of Scripture." (Institutes)

5. **Providence and the Spirit’s Work**
    - The **Holy Spirit** continues to work providentially in the church.
    - The Spirit’s ordinary work is to illumine, sanctify, and apply redemption.
    - Miracles are not necessary for the Spirit’s ongoing ministry.
    - The **sovereignty of God** ensures the church’s preservation without extraordinary signs.
    - "The Spirit’s ordinary operations are sufficient for the building up of the church." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s arguments for the **cessation of extraordinary gifts** became foundational for later **Reformed responses** to Pentecostal and charismatic movements. His insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the **ordinary means of grace** shaped confessional Reformed theology and provided a framework for evaluating claims to new revelation. Turretin’s influence endures in contemporary debates over spiritual gifts, ensuring that Reformed churches remain anchored in the authority of the Word.
