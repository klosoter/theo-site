# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Pentecostalism** and the broader question of **miraculous gifts** through his program of **demythologization**, seeking to reinterpret New Testament phenomena in existential terms. He was critical of any literal acceptance of **supernatural events**, emphasizing the need to translate biblical language into categories meaningful for modern people, which placed him at odds with both **Pentecostal** emphases on charismatic experience and traditional **Reformed** supernaturalism.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Essays Philosophical and Theological (1955)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Sought to reinterpret biblical accounts of miracles, including Pentecostal phenomena, as existential truths rather than historical events.
   - Viewed the language of **spirit** and **miracles** as mythological, requiring translation for modern understanding.
   - Rejected the literal continuation of **charismatic gifts** as described in the New Testament.
   - Emphasized the existential encounter with God over supernatural manifestations.
   - "The mythical eschatology is untenable for modern man." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Faith**
   - Defined faith as an existential response to the **kerygma**, not as assent to supernatural events.
   - Saw the Holy Spirit’s work as inward transformation, not outward signs or wonders.
   - Critiqued Pentecostalism for focusing on external experiences rather than existential decision.
   - Prioritized authentic existence over charismatic phenomena.
   - "Faith is the abandonment of oneself to God who is present in the word." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Historical Skepticism Toward Miracles**
   - Questioned the historical reliability of New Testament miracle accounts, including Pentecost.
   - Asserted that modern scientific worldview precludes belief in supernatural interventions.
   - Considered miracle stories as expressions of early Christian faith, not historical reports.
   - Challenged both Pentecostal and Reformed supernaturalism on historical-critical grounds.
   - "We cannot use electric light and believe in the spirit world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Kerygma as Central**
   - Located the core of Christian proclamation in the **kerygma**, not in miraculous signs.
   - Saw the message of Christ as transformative apart from charismatic gifts.
   - Criticized traditions that made supernatural experiences central to faith.
   - Urged the church to focus on the existential call of the gospel.
   - "The real meaning of the resurrection is the proclamation of the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Theological Critique of Religious Experience**
   - Treated religious experiences, including Pentecostal phenomena, as secondary to existential faith.
   - Warned against equating the Holy Spirit with emotional or ecstatic states.
   - Emphasized the need for critical reflection on all claims of supernatural experience.
   - Saw authentic faith as grounded in decision, not in signs or wonders.
   - "The Spirit is not a magical power but the power of new life." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **demythologization** shaped much of twentieth-century theology’s response to supernatural claims, including those of Pentecostalism. His existential reinterpretation challenged both **Reformed** and Pentecostal traditions to reconsider the role of miracles and charismatic gifts in Christian faith. While often criticized for his radical skepticism, Bultmann’s work remains a touchstone in debates over the relationship between modernity and biblical faith, especially regarding the interpretation of the **Holy Spirit** and the nature of Christian experience.
