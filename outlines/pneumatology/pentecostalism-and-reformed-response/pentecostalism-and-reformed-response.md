### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Section Heading**
Pentecostalism names a family of movements that foreground the **baptism in the Holy Spirit**, often treated as subsequent to conversion and signaled by **tongues as initial evidence**, while calling the church into empowered witness through **charismata**. The Reformed response tightens the bond between **Word and Spirit**, reinforces the ordinary **means of grace**, and often argues that certain extraordinary gifts were tied to the **apostolic era**. The dogmatic location is Pneumatology, though the question bleeds into Bibliology through **canon sufficiency**, Ecclesiology through the **regulative principle of worship**, and Soteriology through the ordo salutis.

The center of the tension is whether the eschatological abundance of the Spirit in these last days, promised in Joel and celebrated at Pentecost, entails the ongoing normativity of **miraculous gifts**, or whether the new covenant plenitude now concentrates its effects through the **preached Word and sacraments**. Pentecostals stress the narrative arc of Luke to Acts as a pattern for discipleship and mission, while Reformed theology accents the **redemptive-historical uniqueness** of foundational epochs for **revelation and attestation**.

#### 2.**Section Heading**
The biblical data are rich and must be weighed in canonical proportion. In Acts 2, the Spirit falls at Pentecost with *glossolalia* and *dynamis*, fulfilling Joel 2.28 to 32, and inaugurating mission to the nations under **Jesus lordship**. Acts 8, 10, and 19 show varied sequences of belief, baptism, laying on of hands, and **manifest signs**, which Pentecostals construe as patterns of **subsequence**, while Reformed interpreters argue that Luke describes **salvation-historical transitions** rather than permanent rubrics.

Paul develops the theology of gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 to 14, where *charismata* are for the common good, prophecy is to be weighed, and tongues require interpretation for **edification of the body**. Key terms include *pneuma* as the agent of distribution, *propheteia* as intelligible speech that strengthens, and *glossa* as tongue speech that must yield to **edification and order**. First Corinthians 13.8 to 12 anticipates a time when partial will give way to the perfect, which cessationists read as the **maturity of the canon or church**, while continuationists reserve the consummation for the **beatific fullness** at Christ's return.

John 14 to 16 presents the Spirit as *Parakletos* who teaches, reminds, and glorifies the Son, suggesting an ordered **Trinitarian missions** pattern that aligns with preaching Christ through the Spirit. Ephesians 2.20 says the church is built on the foundation of **apostles and prophets**, with Christ as cornerstone, which underwrites a Reformed claim that foundational revelatory offices are nonrepeatable. Hebrews 2.3 to 4 speaks of God bearing witness by **signs and wonders**, a text some take to locate miracles at the inception of the gospel, while others see it as descriptive rather than delimiting.

Romans 8 articulates the core ministry of the Spirit in **regeneration and adoption**, groaning intercession, and sanctification, emphasizing the Spirit as arrabon, the down payment, rather than only as a giver of **spectacular gifts**. Ephesians 5.18 commands all believers to be filled with the Spirit, a present imperative that supports ongoing dependence without deciding the question of **subsequence or initial evidence**.

#### 3.**Section Heading**
Historically, the church has wrestled with claims of heightened pneumatic activity. In the second century, **Montanism** emphasized new prophecy and rigorist ethics, which the great church resisted as undermining **catholic order** and the **closed rule of faith**. Augustine in the early fifth century, especially in City of God and Homilies on John, acknowledged miracles but tended to treat **apostolic signs** as confirmatory for the foundational era, while also recording healings within his own time, which complicates a strict **cessationist** reading of Augustine.

Medieval theology elaborated distinctions of **gratia gratis data** and **virtutes** in Aquinas, locating prophecy and miracles within providence and the **sacramental economy**, while subordinating them to the unity of doctrine. The Reformation tied the Spirit to **Scripture sufficiency** and to the **preached Word**, with Luther warning against **Schwarmerei** in the Smalcald Articles and Calvin emphasizing the inward testimony of the Spirit, the **testimonium internum**, as the ground of Scriptural authority rather than any continuing **new revelations**.

The modern Holiness movement in the nineteenth century prepared the way for Pentecostalism with a doctrine of **entire sanctification** and expectation of power for mission. In 1901 at Topeka, Charles Parham taught tongues as **initial evidence**, and in 1906 to 1909, William J. Seymour led the Azusa Street revival with interracial worship and global impact, giving classic Pentecostalism its **missionary thrust**. Denominational consolidation followed, including the **Assemblies of God** in 1914 and Oneness Pentecostal controversies in 1916, while healing ministries and testimonies spread new expectations of **charismatic gifts**.

The mid twentieth century saw the Charismatic renewal, beginning in 1960 with Dennis Bennett in an Episcopalian parish and in 1967 at Duquesne University among Roman Catholics, producing a transdenominational ethos of **charismatic piety**. The 1980s Third Wave associated with **John Wimber** emphasized power evangelism without insisting on tongues as **initial evidence**, reframing gifts as tools for mission under an already and not yet **kingdom theology**. By century's end, Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians had become a major share of global Christianity, especially in the **Global South**, forcing all traditions to reckon with their claims and fruits.

#### 4.**Section Heading**
The Reformed response has been variegated. Old Princeton embodied a principled **cessationism**, with **B. B. Warfield** arguing in Counterfeit Miracles in 1918 that miracles clustered at redemptive-historical hinges and ceased with the **apostolic office**. Charles Hodge tied miracles to authentication of revelation, reasoning from **canon closure** and Ephesians 2.20 that the church does not continue to build the foundation. This line identifies prophetic revelation as **inerrant and binding**, which, if claimed today, threatens the **sufficiency and finality of Scripture**.

The Westminster tradition, codified in the **Westminster Confession 1646 to 1648**, guards this logic by asserting that Scripture is sufficient and that former ways of God revealing his will have **ceased**, locating guidance in the **ordinary means of grace**. Vos and Murray conjoined cessation with a **redemptive-historical** framework, while **Richard Gaffin** argued in Perspectives on Pentecost in 1979 that the baptism in the Spirit is coextensive with union to the risen Christ, hence not a **second blessing** but the soteriological polar opposite of the cross. Sinclair Ferguson in The Holy Spirit in 1996 synthesized classic Reformed teaching on the **Spirit and Christ** with pastoral sobriety.

Dutch Neo-Calvinism complicated the picture. **Abraham Kuyper** deepened attention to the Spirit in culture via **common grace**, and **Herman Bavinck** elaborated a robust Pneumatology while still affirming **canon closure** and the primacy of Word and sacrament. A minority stream exemplified by **D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones** posited a post-conversion enduement of power for preaching and mission, distinguishing it from regeneration while refusing the **initial evidence** doctrine. Reformed-charismatic voices like **Wayne Grudem**, **Sam Storms**, and **John Piper** remain Calvinistic in **soteriology** while allowing fallible congregational prophecy and contemporary **healing**, though strict confessionalists contest their alignment with Westminster boundaries.

#### 5.**Section Heading**
Alternative accounts range widely. Roman Catholic theology frames gifts within **sacramental realism**, reading Lumen Gentium 12 in 1964 as endorsing charisms for the renewal of the body under episcopal discernment, integrating the **Catholic Charismatic Renewal** into the life of parishes and communities. The hierarchy retains doctrinal control while welcoming **nonfoundational charisms**, distinguishing prophecy as exhortation from public revelation that ended with the **apostolic age**.

Lutheran confessionalism highlights the **means of grace** as supreme and warns against **Enthusiasm**, that is, expectation of the Spirit apart from the external Word. The result is a cautious stance toward **modern prophets**, even where pastoral prayer for healing is welcomed under James 5 with the **anointing of the sick**. In both Roman Catholic and Lutheran streams, any claims to binding revelation meet the brake of **Scripture and confession**.

Modern Pentecostal theology has matured. **Amos Yong** develops a **pneumatological inclusivism** and exploratory epistemology, reading the world as a Spirit-infused field of signs. **Frank Macchia**, in Baptized in the Spirit in 2006, deepens **Spirit baptism** as a soteriological and ecclesial metaphor centered on love and mission, rather than a narrow experiential sequence. The Third Wave under **John Wimber** framed gifts as part of **kingdom eschatology**, while analytic and historical studies like **Craig Keener on Miracles** in 2011 argue for the plausibility and global prevalence of credible healing testimony.

#### 6.**Section Heading**
Current debates gather around definitional and pastoral fronts. The **initial evidence** claim faces exegetical scrutiny, since not all narrative accounts in Acts link tongues to Spirit baptism, and 1 Corinthians makes tongues derivative to **edification and love**. The subsequence thesis confronts **Ephesians 1.13 to 14**, which ties sealing with the Spirit to faith, and **Romans 8**, which treats the Spirit as coextensive with belonging to Christ, leaving room only for repeated **fillings** and vocational empowerments.

Prophecy is contested. Reformed cessationists identify New Testament prophecy with **inerrant revelation**, so they reject any fallible prophetic speech as misnamed and dangerous to **Scripture sufficiency**. Reformed continuationists, following **Wayne Grudem**, propose a category of congregational prophecy that is **noncanonical and fallible**, to be weighed per 1 Thessalonians 5.19 to 22, without rivaling Scripture. Critics respond that the New Testament lexicon lacks a clear two-tier model, and that **Ephesians 2.20** ties prophets to the foundation.

Healing and deliverance practices raise concerns about **prosperity theology** and **spiritual abuse**, though many Pentecostals oppose the prosperity gospel and commend **suffering discipleship**. Questions about ongoing apostleship meet the Reformed insistence that apostolic marks included **resurrection eyewitness** and foundational authority, which are nonrepeatable. The prudential question remains how to pray for the sick, test the spirits per **1 John 4**, and pursue the good of the body while guarding against disorder that violates **1 Corinthians 14**.

#### 7.**Section Heading**
Systematically, the issue ties to the Trinity, Christology, Anthropological vocation, Ecclesiology, and Eschatology. The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, the **filioque**, and is the gift of the exalted Christ, which grounds the **Christocentric missio Spiritus**. Christology presents Jesus as the Spirit-anointed Messiah, Luke 4 and Acts 10.38, shaping a pattern of **Spirit-empowered ministry** for the church that imitates, not replicates, the **unique mediatorship** of the Son.

In Soteriology, the Spirit effects **regeneration, union with Christ, adoption, and sanctification**, which are ordinary and universal to believers, while vocational empowerments vary as **charismata** distributed as he wills. Ecclesiology must align gifts with **offices**, tending the difference between **foundation and superstructure**, and place all exercise of gifts under the **regulative principle** that guards public worship by Scripture. Bibliology insists that the **canon is closed**, so any alleged revelation is subordinate, tested, and nonbinding, since the Spirit who inspired the Word does not undermine **Scripture sufficiency**.

Eschatology reads gifts as **firstfruits and arrabon**, anticipating the consummation and energizing mission, while resisting an over-realized eschatology that expects glory without the cross. Anthropology and vocation benefit from a democratizing vision of the **priesthood of all believers**, yet retain creational limits and ordered ministries, ensuring that zeal for gifts does not eclipse the primacy of **love and holiness** in the Spirit's fruit.

#### 8.**Section Heading**
Pastorally and liturgically, Reformed churches can practice a principled **open but ordered** posture or a principled **cessationism**, each with concrete disciplines. In both cases, preach **Christ in the power of the Spirit**, pray for illumination, and expect the Spirit to convict, convert, and sanctify through the **ordinary means of grace**. Elders can pray for the sick in obedience to James 5, anoint with oil, and testify to God's mercy, while refusing to monetize healing or manipulate the vulnerable through **spectacle spirituality**.

Where continuationist practice is permitted, leaders must catechize on the nature of **prophecy as noncanonical**, require weighing by Scripture, and keep the accent on **edification and order**. Corporate prayer can make space for intercession and testimony, while public worship follows the **regulative principle**, avoiding the elevation of any gift above the **preached Word and sacraments**. Where cessationism is taught, pastors should still cultivate expectancy for God to answer prayer and do exceptional providences, while articulating why they distinguish **miracle reports** from **apostolic signs**.

Ecumenically, Reformed and Pentecostal believers can partner in evangelism, mercy, and justice while acknowledging differences about **revelation and worship**. In global mission, prudence suggests humility about Western assumptions, careful discernment of **testimony and fruit**, and robust training in biblical theology so that zeal is tethered to **sound doctrine**. In all cases, church discipline must address abuses, especially in prosperity schemes and authoritarian leadership, by re-centering on **Christ crucified and risen** as the heart of spiritual power.

#### 9.**Section Heading**
The church best honors the Spirit when it magnifies **Christ by Scripture**, seeks edification in love, and prays for wisdom to welcome his gifts while guarding the apostolic foundation once for all delivered to the saints.
