# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck engaged the rise of **Pentecostalism** from within a robust **Reformed theological framework**, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** and the normative role of the **ordinary means of grace**. He critiqued Pentecostal emphases on **extraordinary spiritual gifts** and ongoing **revelation**, insisting that the **Holy Spirit** works primarily through the established ministry of the Word and sacraments in the church.

- "The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit served a temporary purpose in the founding of the church and have ceased with the completion of the canon." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- The Philosophy of Revelation
- Our Reasonable Faith
- Essays on Religion, Science, and Society (esp. essays on modern religious movements)
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
   - The **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were foundational for the apostolic era.
   - These gifts authenticated the apostles and the initial spread of the gospel.
   - With the **completion of Scripture**, such gifts are no longer normative.
   - The church now relies on the **ordinary ministry** of Word and sacrament.
   - "The special gifts were for the church’s childhood; now the church is called to maturity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
   - **Scripture** is the complete and sufficient revelation of God’s will.
   - Claims to new revelation undermine the **authority of the canon**.
   - The Holy Spirit illuminates the Word, not supplementing it with new truths.
   - The Reformed tradition guards against **subjectivism** in spiritual experience.
   - "The Word of God is the only norm and source for faith and life." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Ordinary Means of Grace**
   - The Spirit works primarily through **preaching, sacraments, and prayer**.
   - Emphasis on the **institutional church** as the locus of the Spirit’s activity.
   - Extraordinary experiences are not necessary for genuine Christian life.
   - The means of grace are sufficient for **sanctification** and assurance.
   - "The Spirit binds himself to the Word and sacraments in the church." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Discernment of Spiritual Experience**
   - Not all spiritual phenomena are from the **Holy Spirit**.
   - Experiences must be tested by **Scripture** and the confessions.
   - The Reformed tradition is cautious about **enthusiasm** and emotionalism.
   - True spiritual life is marked by **faith, repentance, and obedience**.
   - "The Reformed faith seeks the Spirit not in ecstasy but in the quiet power of the Word." (Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)

5. **Unity and Catholicity of the Church**
   - The church’s unity is grounded in **shared doctrine and sacraments**.
   - Movements that emphasize private revelation risk **fragmentation**.
   - The Reformed vision is for a **catholic** (universal) and ordered church.
   - The Spirit builds up the church through **orderly ministry**, not disorder.
   - "The church is catholic because it is built on the one foundation of Christ and his Word." ("The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church")

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s response to **Pentecostalism** shaped subsequent **Reformed critiques** of charismatic movements, reinforcing the centrality of the **ordinary means of grace** and the sufficiency of Scripture. His careful articulation of the cessation of extraordinary gifts became a standard reference in Reformed dogmatics. Bavinck’s nuanced approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the work of the Holy Spirit, ensuring that Reformed theology maintains both doctrinal fidelity and spiritual vitality.
