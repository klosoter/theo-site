# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas, writing centuries before the rise of **Pentecostalism**, developed a comprehensive theology of the **Holy Spirit** within the framework of **sacramental grace** and **ecclesiology**. While Aquinas did not address Pentecostalism directly, his emphasis on the **ordinary means of grace**, the **nature of miracles**, and the **order of charisms** provides a foundational contrast to later Reformed responses to Pentecostal claims of ongoing charismatic gifts.

- "The working of miracles, and the like, are not necessary for the confirmation of faith, now that the faith of Christ is established throughout the world." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.178, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially II-II, Questions 171–178 (on prophecy, miracles, and charismatic gifts)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (on the sacraments and the work of the Holy Spirit)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV (on the sacraments and spiritual gifts)
- Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (for his views on inspiration and prophecy)
- The Oxford Handbook of Thomas Aquinas (secondary reference for contextualizing Aquinas on charisms)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Charisms as Extraordinary and Subordinate**
   - Charismatic gifts (e.g., tongues, prophecy) are extraordinary, not normative for the Christian life.
   - Such gifts serve the **building up of the Church** and are subordinate to the **virtues** and **sacraments**.
   - The ordinary means of grace are prioritized over extraordinary manifestations.
   - Miraculous gifts were especially prominent in the **apostolic era** for the confirmation of the Gospel.
   - "Miracles are not necessary now, when the faith has been confirmed." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.178, a.1)

2. **The Holy Spirit and the Order of Grace**
   - The Holy Spirit works primarily through the **sacraments** and the **infusion of virtues**.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is the source of sanctification, not necessarily of visible signs.
   - The gifts of the Spirit are ordered toward the perfection of charity and the common good.
   - The Spirit’s work is discerned in the fruit of holiness, not in ecstatic experiences.
   - "The gifts of the Holy Ghost are ordained for the perfection of the virtues." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.68, a.1)

3. **Miracles and the Economy of Salvation**
   - Miracles are signs that confirm divine revelation, especially in foundational periods.
   - The frequency of miracles decreases as the Church is established.
   - Miracles are always subject to divine sovereignty and not at human disposal.
   - The ordinary Christian life is not dependent on miraculous phenomena.
   - "Miracles are wrought for the confirmation of faith." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.178, a.1)

4. **Scripture and the Cessation of Revelation**
   - Public revelation is closed with the apostolic age; Scripture is sufficient for faith and practice.
   - Prophecy in the strict sense is no longer given for new doctrine.
   - The Church interprets and applies Scripture, guided by the Spirit, but does not receive new revelation.
   - Claims to ongoing prophecy must be tested against the sufficiency of Scripture.
   - "Nothing new is to be added to the faith, which is already delivered to the saints." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.174, a.6)

5. **Ecclesial Discernment and Order**
   - The discernment of spiritual gifts is the responsibility of the Church, not individuals alone.
   - Charismatic phenomena must be evaluated for their conformity to doctrine and order.
   - The unity and peace of the Church are prioritized over private spiritual experiences.
   - Disorderly or divisive manifestations are to be corrected by ecclesial authority.
   - "The Church must judge of revelations and miracles." (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q.172, a.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology established a framework in which **charismatic gifts** are understood as extraordinary and subordinate to the ordinary means of grace, shaping later **Reformed critiques** of Pentecostalism. His emphasis on the sufficiency of **Scripture**, the closure of public revelation, and the centrality of the **sacraments** provided enduring categories for evaluating claims of ongoing miracles and prophecy. Aquinas’s influence persists in both Roman Catholic and Reformed responses to Pentecostalism, especially regarding the discernment and order of spiritual gifts within the Church.
