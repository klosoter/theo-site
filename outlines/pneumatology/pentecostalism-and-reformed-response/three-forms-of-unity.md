# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the classic **Reformed confessional stance** on the work of the **Holy Spirit**, **Scripture**, and the **means of grace**. In response to **Pentecostalism**, these documents emphasize the sufficiency of **Scripture**, the centrality of the **preached Word** and **sacraments**, and a cessationist understanding of **extraordinary gifts**. The Reformed tradition, as expressed in these confessions, maintains that the **Spirit** works primarily through ordinary means rather than ongoing miraculous signs.

- "We believe that this Holy Scripture fully contains the will of God and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 3–7, 22–24, 29
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 21, 53, 65–68
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV, Articles 11–17
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Sufficient and Final Authority**
   - The Three Forms assert that **Holy Scripture** is complete and fully sufficient for faith and life.
   - All doctrines and practices must be tested by the **Word of God**.
   - No new revelations or ongoing prophecy are necessary or expected after the apostolic era.
   - The **Spirit** works through the Word, not apart from it.
   - "We reject all that does not agree with this infallible rule." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

2. **The Spirit’s Work is Ordinarily through Means of Grace**
   - The **Holy Spirit** operates primarily through the **preaching of the Word** and the **sacraments**.
   - Faith is worked in the heart by the Spirit through these ordinary means.
   - The confessions do not anticipate a normative role for extraordinary gifts in the church’s ongoing life.
   - The focus is on the Spirit’s inward work of regeneration and sanctification.
   - "The Holy Ghost works faith in our hearts by the preaching of the holy gospel, and confirms it by the use of the holy sacraments." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 65)

3. **Cessation of Apostolic and Extraordinary Gifts**
   - The confessions imply that **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were for the foundation of the church.
   - These gifts are not expected as ordinary in the post-apostolic church.
   - The church is directed to seek the Spirit’s work in the ordinary means, not in signs and wonders.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture is emphasized over ongoing revelation.
   - "We believe that the ceremonies and figures of the law ceased at the coming of Christ." (Belgic Confession, Article 25)

4. **Discernment and Order in Worship**
   - Worship is to be regulated by the **Word of God** and not by subjective spiritual experiences.
   - The confessions warn against innovations not commanded in Scripture.
   - The church is to test all things by the rule of Scripture.
   - The Spirit brings unity and order, not confusion or disorder.
   - "We believe that we ought diligently and circumspectly to discern from the Word of God what is to be done." (Belgic Confession, Article 32)

5. **Assurance and Experience Rooted in Christ and the Gospel**
   - Assurance of faith is grounded in the promises of the gospel, not in extraordinary experiences.
   - The Spirit testifies to believers’ adoption through the Word and sacraments.
   - True spiritual experience is Christ-centered and church-centered.
   - The confessions direct believers to Christ’s finished work, not to subjective signs.
   - "True faith is not only a certain knowledge... but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 21)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided the Reformed churches with a robust theological framework for evaluating movements like **Pentecostalism**. Their emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture**, the ordinary means of grace, and the cessation of extraordinary gifts has shaped Reformed responses to claims of ongoing prophecy and miracles. These confessions continue to serve as a bulwark for Reformed identity, offering clarity and stability in the face of contemporary charismatic movements. Their influence endures in global Reformed communities, shaping both doctrine and practice regarding the work of the Holy Spirit.
