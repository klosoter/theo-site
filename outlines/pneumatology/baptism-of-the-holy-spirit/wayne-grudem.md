# Wayne Grudem (1948–)

Wayne Grudem approaches the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as an event that occurs at **conversion**, marking the believer’s incorporation into **Christ’s body** and the reception of the **indwelling Spirit**. He distinguishes this from subsequent experiences of **filling** or **empowerment** for ministry, emphasizing the unity of the Spirit’s work in all believers while critiquing **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** views that separate Spirit baptism from conversion.

- "The New Testament epistles never command believers to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, nor do they describe this as an experience to be sought after conversion." (Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.)

- Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (contributor)
- Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Holy Spirit Occurs at Conversion**
    - The **baptism of the Spirit** is synonymous with becoming a Christian.
    - All believers receive the Spirit at the moment of faith in Christ.
    - There is no biblical basis for a post-conversion Spirit baptism.
    - This view is grounded in passages like 1 Corinthians 12:13 and Romans 8:9.
    - "All who become Christians have been baptized in the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Distinction Between Baptism and Filling**
    - The **filling of the Spirit** is a repeated experience for empowerment.
    - Baptism is a one-time event; filling is ongoing and variable.
    - Filling relates to sanctification and boldness for ministry.
    - Believers are commanded to seek continual filling, not repeated baptism.
    - "The New Testament commands us to be filled with the Spirit, not to be baptized in the Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Critique of Pentecostal/Charismatic Distinctions**
    - Grudem rejects the idea of a "second blessing" or post-conversion baptism.
    - He affirms the validity of spiritual gifts but not their linkage to Spirit baptism.
    - Speaking in tongues is not the necessary evidence of Spirit baptism.
    - The Pentecost event is unique and not normative for all believers.
    - "The idea that baptism in the Holy Spirit is a second experience after conversion is not supported by the epistles." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Unity of the Body of Christ**
    - Spirit baptism unites all believers into one body.
    - There is no division between "Spirit-baptized" and "non-Spirit-baptized" Christians.
    - This unity is foundational for Christian identity and fellowship.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is universal among true believers.
    - "For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Openness to Spiritual Gifts Without Doctrinal Division**
    - Grudem is open to the continuation of **spiritual gifts** (continuationism).
    - He separates the discussion of gifts from the doctrine of Spirit baptism.
    - Encourages pursuit of gifts within biblical parameters.
    - Warns against doctrinal division over the timing or evidence of Spirit baptism.
    - "We should not divide the church over the issue of the baptism in the Holy Spirit." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Wayne Grudem’s articulation of **Spirit baptism** at conversion has shaped evangelical and Reformed responses to **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** theology, providing a biblically grounded alternative to the "second blessing" paradigm. His distinction between **baptism** and **filling** of the Spirit has become a standard framework in systematic theology texts and pastoral teaching. Grudem’s influence extends through his widely used textbooks, shaping generations of pastors and theologians in their understanding of the Holy Spirit’s work.
