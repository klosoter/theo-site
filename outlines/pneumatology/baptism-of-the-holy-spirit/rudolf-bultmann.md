# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. For Bultmann, the New Testament language about the Spirit points not to supernatural events but to the **existential transformation** that occurs in authentic faith, where the believer encounters the **kerygma** and is called into new life.

- "The gift of the Spirit is not a magical power but the possibility of a new existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting (1956)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Spirit Language**
    - The New Testament's references to the **Holy Spirit** are mythological expressions of existential realities.
    - Bultmann seeks to reinterpret these texts to uncover their existential significance for modern people.
    - The "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" is not a supernatural event but a metaphor for transformation.
    - The focus is on the meaning of the text for the individual's self-understanding before God.
    - "Mythological language must be interpreted so that its existential meaning becomes clear." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with the Kerygma**
    - The **kerygma** is the proclamation that confronts the hearer with a decision.
    - The Spirit's work is the existential awakening to authentic existence through faith.
    - Baptism of the Spirit is realized in the individual's response to the kerygma.
    - The Spirit is not a substance or force but the event of faith itself.
    - "The Spirit is present where the kerygma is believed." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Supernaturalism**
    - Bultmann rejects the idea of supernatural interventions in history, including charismatic experiences.
    - The miraculous is reinterpreted as symbolic of existential realities.
    - The Spirit's baptism is not an empirical event but a new mode of being.
    - Faith is not assent to supernatural facts but openness to existential transformation.
    - "Faith is not assent to doctrines but decision and existence." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Eschatological Existence**
    - The Spirit inaugurates a new eschatological existence in the present.
    - Baptism of the Spirit marks the transition from the old age to the new.
    - This is not a future event but a present existential reality for the believer.
    - The Spirit's presence is the actualization of eschatological life now.
    - "The eschatological gift of the Spirit is the possibility of new life here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Community and Authentic Existence**
    - The Spirit creates authentic community among believers.
    - Baptism of the Spirit is not individualistic but forms the basis of the church's existence.
    - The church is the community of those called into authentic existence by the kerygma.
    - The Spirit's work is seen in the ethical and relational transformation of the community.
    - "The church is the place where the Spirit is at work, calling men to authentic existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** by shifting the focus from supernatural events to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** has influenced both liberal and existentialist readings of Scripture, challenging traditional views of the Spirit’s work. While controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the meaning of Spirit language and the nature of Christian experience.
