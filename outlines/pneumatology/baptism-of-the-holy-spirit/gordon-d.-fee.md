# Gordon D. Fee (1934–2022)

Gordon D. Fee approached the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as an integral aspect of **conversion-initiation**, emphasizing its inseparability from **regeneration** and **union with Christ**. He critiqued the classical Pentecostal doctrine of a post-conversion "second blessing," arguing that the New Testament presents **Spirit baptism** as the normative experience for all believers at the point of faith.

- "The coming of the Spirit is the coming of the eschatological presence and power of God into the lives of his people." ("God’s Empowering Presence")

## Key Works

- Gospel and Spirit: Issues in New Testament Hermeneutics
- Listening to the Spirit in the Text
- "Baptism in the Holy Spirit: The Issue of Separability and Subsequence" (in Pneuma, 1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit Baptism as Conversion-Initiation**
    - Argues that **baptism in the Spirit** is synonymous with becoming a Christian.
    - Rejects the idea of a normative, post-conversion "second blessing."
    - Sees **Spirit baptism** as the means by which believers are incorporated into the body of Christ.
    - Emphasizes the unity of **regeneration**, **justification**, and **Spirit baptism**.
    - "For Paul, the reception of the Spirit is the essential evidence of belonging to Christ." (Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God)

2. **Critique of Subsequence and Separability**
    - Challenges Pentecostal views that separate **Spirit baptism** from conversion.
    - Argues that New Testament texts do not support a two-stage experience.
    - Emphasizes the **normativity** of receiving the Spirit at faith.
    - Points to the exceptional nature of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19, rather than their prescriptive value.
    - "The New Testament simply does not know of Christians who are not Spirit people." (God’s Empowering Presence)

3. **Eschatological Presence of the Spirit**
    - Views the **Holy Spirit** as the sign of the **inaugurated eschatology**.
    - The Spirit’s coming marks the beginning of the **new age** in Christ.
    - Believers experience the **already/not yet** tension through the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - The Spirit empowers ethical living and mission as a foretaste of the age to come.
    - "The Spirit is both the evidence and the means of the new eschatological life." (God’s Empowering Presence)

4. **Experiential and Empowering Role of the Spirit**
    - Affirms the ongoing, experiential reality of the Spirit’s work in believers.
    - Emphasizes the Spirit’s role in **sanctification**, **gifting**, and **empowerment for mission**.
    - Encourages openness to the Spirit’s manifestations, but within biblical parameters.
    - Distinguishes between the initial reception of the Spirit and subsequent fillings or empowerments.
    - "The empowering presence of the Spirit is for life in the present age." (Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God)

5. **Hermeneutical Approach to Acts and Paul**
    - Stresses the need to interpret **Acts** and **Pauline letters** in their literary and theological contexts.
    - Warns against deriving normative doctrine from narrative exceptions.
    - Advocates for a **canonical** and **theologically integrative** reading of the Spirit’s work.
    - Sees Paul’s theology as foundational for understanding **Spirit baptism**.
    - "Paul’s understanding of the Spirit is the key to Christian existence." (Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Fee’s scholarship has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions on the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**, especially within Pentecostal and evangelical circles. His insistence on the **inseparability of Spirit baptism from conversion** has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to pneumatology. By rooting his arguments in rigorous exegesis and a robust **biblical-theological framework**, Fee has contributed to a more unified understanding of the Spirit’s role in the life of the believer. His work continues to serve as a bridge between charismatic experience and Reformed theological categories.
