# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge understood the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as the Spirit’s work of uniting believers to Christ and incorporating them into the **body of Christ**. He distinguished this from later charismatic interpretations, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the formation of the **church** rather than as a separate post-conversion experience. For Hodge, the baptism of the Spirit is inseparable from the application of **redemption** and the ordinary means of grace.

- "The baptism of the Holy Ghost is that act of Christ by which the Holy Spirit is given to the people of God as the source of all inward spiritual life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. 3, chapters on the Holy Spirit and the Church)
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians (discussion of spiritual gifts and the Spirit’s work)
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on the Holy Spirit)
- The Way of Life (sections on regeneration and the Spirit)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit as Union with Christ**
    - The baptism of the Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ and to one another.
    - It is not a second blessing but coincides with **regeneration** and **effectual calling**.
    - All true believers receive the Spirit at conversion.
    - This union forms the **body of Christ**, the church.
    - "By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Rejection of Subsequent Charismatic Experiences**
    - Hodge denies a distinct, post-conversion baptism of the Spirit as taught in some traditions.
    - He interprets Pentecost as a unique, unrepeatable event inaugurating the new covenant era.
    - The gifts of the Spirit are distributed according to God’s sovereign will, not as a second experience.
    - The ordinary work of the Spirit is sufficient for Christian life and ministry.
    - "There is no intimation in Scripture that the baptism of the Spirit is to be sought as something distinct from regeneration." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

3. **Spirit’s Role in Regeneration and Sanctification**
    - The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause of **regeneration**.
    - Sanctification is the ongoing work of the Spirit in the believer.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the source of spiritual life and growth.
    - Baptism of the Spirit is thus foundational to all Christian experience.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the source of all spiritual life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Means of Grace and the Spirit**
    - The Spirit works through the ordinary means of grace: Word, sacraments, and prayer.
    - There is no separation between the Spirit’s baptism and these means.
    - The church is the sphere where the Spirit ordinarily operates.
    - The sacraments, especially baptism and the Lord’s Supper, signify and seal the Spirit’s work.
    - "The Spirit never works independently of the truth." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Ecclesiological Implications**
    - The baptism of the Spirit creates the **unity of the church**.
    - All believers, regardless of background, are incorporated into one body.
    - Spiritual gifts are given for the edification of the whole church.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the mark of the true church.
    - "The unity of the church is the result of the indwelling of the one Spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s understanding of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** shaped mainstream Reformed and Presbyterian theology, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in **regeneration**, **union with Christ**, and the unity of the church. His rejection of post-conversion charismatic experiences influenced later critiques of Pentecostalism. Hodge’s careful exegesis and systematic approach continue to inform discussions on the work of the Holy Spirit within the context of the ordinary means of grace.
