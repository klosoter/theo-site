- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, John Wesley, William J. Seymour, B. B. Warfield, Richard B. Gaffin.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic sacramental theology, Reformation and Reformed scholasticism, Wesleyan holiness, early Pentecostalism, Princeton and Westminster Reformed theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed disputes over **cessationism**, sacramental efficacy, and how **historia salutis** relates to **ordo salutis**.
  - External: Wesleyan and Pentecostal **subsequence**, Roman Catholic **sacramental realism** and confirmation, evangelical disputes over Luke versus Paul.
  - Contemporary: Global charismatic practice, claims of “initial evidence,” pastoral discernment of experiences, and the ecclesial shape of **means of grace**.

### ESSAY
The phrase “baptism of the Holy Spirit” compresses a biblical horizon that stretches from the promise of the Father to the church’s present communion with Christ. The core conceptual claim is simple to state and difficult to hold without distortion: Spirit-baptism is the climactic gift of the risen Christ who, having received the Spirit for his messianic reign, pours him out upon his people, thereby effecting their **union with Christ** and corporate **ecclesial incorporation**. As such, it is a once-for-all event within **historia salutis** at Pentecost that is applied personally in the **ordo salutis** at conversion. It is not a second tier of Christian existence nor a sacramental mechanism operating ex opere operato. This definition must be defended by integrating Luke and Paul, situating the doctrine within the church’s tradition, and confronting the modern reframings that identified Spirit-baptism with a subsequent empowerment or with sacramental rites. The figures who most decisively shape these trajectories are Augustine, John Calvin, John Wesley, William J. Seymour, B. B. Warfield, and Richard B. Gaffin.

Augustine formulated conceptual rails that steered the West’s reflection on Spirit and baptism. In the Donatist controversy he distinguished between the sacramentum and the res, insisting there is one baptism into Christ, whose efficacy resides not in the minister’s worth but in Christ who gives the Spirit. He located the Spirit’s work within the church’s **means of grace** and argued for the inseparability of the sign and the thing signified without collapsing them into identity. The Spirit is not a detachable religious power but the love of God poured into hearts, uniting to Christ and his body. Augustine’s anti-Donatist stance affirmed the objective stability of baptism and so resisted attempts to measure the Spirit by the fluctuating states of ministers or congregants. What he left less clarified is the redemptive-historical relation between Pentecost and individual regeneration, a gap unsurprising before modern biblical theology. Still, his insistence that the Spirit’s gift is ecclesial and Christomorphic remains salutary. In modern disputes, Augustine’s legacy restrains privatized claims to Spirit-baptism detached from the church’s one baptism and preserves the **inseparable operations** of Father, Son, and Spirit. Examiners may press whether this creates a sacramental captivity of the Spirit. The answer is that Augustine’s sacramental realism is not a mechanism. It grounds assurance in Christ’s promise while allowing that the Spirit’s vivifying presence may come temporally before, during, or after the rite without erasing the sign’s covenantal pledge.

John Calvin recast Augustine’s ecclesial and sacramental insights within a reformational grammar that centers **union with Christ**. The Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself. Baptism with water is a **means of grace** that seals, but the Spirit’s regenerating and uniting work is sovereignly free and not tied to the moment of administration. Calvin refused to multiply gradations of Christians by carving post-conversion tiers. He also sharpened the relation between Pentecost and personal salvation by emphasizing the once-for-allness of Christ’s accomplishment and the Spirit’s application. Christ is given to us by the Spirit and the Spirit is given to us by Christ, so Spirit-baptism refers not to a later surge of power but to the Christ-gift at the heart of conversion, faith, and adoption. Calvin did not treat “baptism in the Spirit” as a technical term opposed to “water baptism,” yet his total theology implies that to be in Christ is to have been baptized in the Spirit’s reality, whether or not the term is used. Critics may argue Calvin reduces the experiential vibrancy of Acts to quiet inwardness. This misreads his stress on **means of grace**. For Calvin, the Spirit’s activity is rich, vocal, and communal in the ministry of Word and sacrament, but it remains tethered to Christ’s once-accomplished work and the church’s order so that claims of post-conversion hierarchies cannot destabilize assurance.

John Wesley redirected the discussion by placing the language of Spirit-baptism into an **ordo salutis** that included a distinct second work. Within Anglican renewal he sought heart-holiness, and in a Plain Account of Christian Perfection he articulated a doctrine of entire sanctification. Though Wesley’s own language was cautious, his heirs increasingly framed entire sanctification as “baptism with the Holy Ghost,” a second blessing subsequent to justification. The use of Acts as a map of personal progression fueled the sense that the church should expect a Pentecostal aftermath for individual believers: first conversion, then Spirit-baptism for holiness and power. Wesley’s pastoral genius recognized experiential deficits in believers and refused to accept nominalism; the theological cost was opening a conceptual gap between justification and Spirit-baptism that threatened the unity of **union with Christ**. By moving Spirit-baptism forward in the **ordo salutis**, the ecclesial and Christological objectivity of Pentecost receded and the marker of normal Christian life became a post-conversion crisis experience. Wesley’s drive for holiness is commendable, but his model became combustible when conjoined with a more radical reading of Acts in the next generation.

William J. Seymour’s leadership of the Azusa Street revival catalyzed the global Pentecostal movement by operationalizing a doctrine of Spirit-baptism as subsequence with a uniform sign. Influenced by Charles Parham’s identification of tongues as the “initial evidence,” Seymour taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a post-conversion enduement of power for service, normatively marked by glossolalia. The Apostolic Faith newspaper spread the message that what Acts records is normative pattern, and that a baptized believer lacking tongues had not yet received the Pentecostal baptism. Seymour moderated Parham’s racial exclusivism and formalism, but the initial evidence doctrine took hold. The movement’s inner logic was missional and apocalyptic: empowered by the Spirit, the last-days church proclaims the gospel to the nations. Seymour thus reframed the center of the topic. Spirit-baptism no longer named incorporation into Christ and his body, mediated through **means of grace**, but rather a subsequent empowerment identifiable by a discrete sign. Sociologically, this democratized religious authority and bypassed the clergy. Theologically, it fused Luke’s epochal narrative into a normative sequence for individual **ordo salutis**. The tension would eventually produce splits between Wesleyan Pentecostals who held a three-stage pattern of conversion, entire sanctification, and Spirit-baptism, and Finished Work Pentecostals who collapsed sanctification and initial conversion but retained subsequence and initial evidence. The global influence of Seymour’s framing means any defense of a Reformed account must reckon with it directly.

B. B. Warfield supplied the most influential Reformed counter in the early twentieth century. In Counterfeit Miracles he argued that miraculous gifts were signs of revelation and so belonged to the apostolic foundation of the church. Once that foundation was laid and the canon closed, such revelatory signs ceased. Warfield’s thesis was not simply sociological but theological: the economy of revelation is tied to redemptive epochs. He did not deny God’s power to heal or to act, but denied that gifts like tongues and prophecy continue as ordinary endowments. Applying this to Spirit-baptism, Warfield resisted identifying post-conversion experiences with Pentecost and insisted that the Spirit’s baptism is coextensive with becoming a Christian. Critics have accused Warfield of rationalistic reductionism and an underdeveloped biblical theology. Yet his impulse to tie signs to **apostolicity** and revelation guards the sufficiency of Scripture and the finality of Christ. Warfield’s line is a prophylactic against any view that makes tongues the evidence of the Spirit, thereby denying the presence of the Spirit to multitudes of godly saints.

Richard B. Gaffin provided the mature Reformed account by differentiating levels of discourse and integrating Luke and Paul. In Perspectives on Pentecost he established the crucial distinction between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**. Pentecost is an unrepeatable redemptive-historical event in which the exalted Christ inaugurates the age of the Spirit. In the ordo, Spirit-baptism is the once-for-all application of that event when a person is united to Christ, justified, and adopted. Gaffin’s integration of Acts and Paul refuses a false dichotomy. Acts records transitional episodes as the gospel crosses covenantal frontiers from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. The delay of the Spirit with Samaritans in Acts 8 signals ecclesial unity under apostolic oversight as the new covenant reaches a former rival community. The Gentile Pentecost at Cornelius in Acts 10 demonstrates the same gift to Gentiles apart from circumcision. The Ephesians in Acts 19 receive the Spirit upon hearing the apostolic gospel, having known only John’s baptism. These are not templates for a post-conversion second blessing but milestones in the church’s once-for-all reception of the Spirit across groups. Paul’s dictum in 1 Corinthians 12:13 that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body defines the ongoing reality. To be a Christian is to have been baptized with the Spirit. Gaffin grants that Christians experience repeated **fillings** and empowerments, may receive gifts of various sorts, and are commanded to be filled with the Spirit. But he denies that these experiences are the baptism of the Spirit. He also, following Warfield’s instincts and Ephesians 2:20, locates revelatory gifts with the apostolic foundation, arguing for their cessation with the close of that foundation.

With these figures in place, the definition sharpened at the outset can be defended exegetically and theologically. The Gospels promise that Christ will baptize with the Holy Spirit, contrasting him with John who baptizes with water. Acts 1:5 identifies Pentecost as the fulfillment of that promise. Acts 2 narrates the once-for-all outpouring upon the apostolic community. The later episodes serve to show that the same Spirit is given to Samaritans, Gentiles, and disciples of John as each is incorporated by the apostolic gospel. These events can be atypically sequenced without undermining the underlying unity, because Luke’s concern is salvation history, not charting a universal ordo. Paul, writing to churches in settled circumstances, speaks of the Spirit’s baptism as the universal initiation of the Christian life. He ties it to adoption, sealing, and indwelling. There is no Christian without the Spirit. Therefore the ordinary expectation is that Spirit-baptism coincides with conversion and water baptism as the sign and seal, though the Spirit’s work is not exhaustively measured by the moment of the latter.

Two principal external alternatives frame the debate. The Wesleyan-Pentecostal model makes subsequence the norm and often binds it to a uniform sign. This suffers from three failures. First, it misreads Acts by conflating epochal extension across redemptive frontiers with individual progress. Second, it fractures **union with Christ** into stages, introducing a spiritual aristocracy contrary to Romans 8, which defines the Spirit as the distinguishing mark of belonging to Christ. Third, it risks detaching the Spirit from the church’s ordinary **means of grace**, turning baptism and the Lord’s Supper into pre-Spirit preliminaries rather than Spirit-wrought communion. The Roman Catholic alternative binds the fullness of the Spirit to confirmation and locates Spirit-baptism within the sacramental economy as an augmenting of baptismal grace. While this rightly protects the ecclesial shape of the Spirit’s gift, it leans toward **sacramental realism** that can obscure the sovereignty of the Spirit and the primacy of Christ’s once-for-all Pentecostal gift. The Reformed account corrects both: it refuses subsequence as normative and eschews sacramental mechanism, while insisting that Spirit-baptism incorporates us into Christ and is ordinarily sealed in water baptism.

Internal Reformed debates require clear lines. The first concerns **cessationism**. Does grounding revelatory gifts in the apostolic foundation entail a denial of any miraculous work of the Spirit today. The prudent answer is no. The cessationist thesis is narrowly targeted: tongues and prophecy, as revelatory signs tied to the foundation, cease as ordinary gifts when that foundation is complete. This does not deny extraordinary providences, healing in answer to prayer, or striking providential guidance, though these should not be assigned the status of gifts in the apostolic sense. The second concerns sacramental efficacy. Within Reformed orthodoxy, the Spirit is the one who makes the sacraments effectual, so there is a real nexus between Spirit-baptism and the rite of baptism at the level of sign and thing signified. Yet the tie is federal and covenantal rather than temporal and mechanical. The third concerns assurance and experience. The Reformed account must not be heard as denying experientially potent encounters with God. Rather, it privileges the stable paradigm that the Spirit’s baptism is not an elusive future blessing but the present ground of prayer, sanctification, gifts, and mission. It then encourages pursuit of continual **filling** under the Word.

Examiner objections often seek pressure points at the Luke versus Paul interface. Does our approach force Paul to correct Luke. The answer is that a distinction of perspectives prevents this. Luke narrates the movement of the one Pentecostal gift into new covenant populations. Paul discursively articulates the settled state of believers who live post-Pentecost. Another objection concerns tongues as initial evidence. Why do tongues occur at key events. The reply is that tongues function as an audible sign of new covenant inclusion, particularly in contexts of Jew–Samaritan–Gentile relations. To transform a sign of epochal inclusion into a criterion of individual spirituality strains the narrative and contradicts Paul’s insistence that not all speak in tongues. A further objection concerns Old Testament believers. If the Spirit’s baptism is new, were they saved. Yes, because the Spirit has always vivified faith. The difference lies in eschatological fullness. John’s promise that the Spirit had not yet been given refers to the not yet of messianic effulgence tied to Christ’s glorification. The Spirit’s presence before Pentecost is real but anticipatory, toward which the full new covenant gift is oriented. Another objection concerns pastoral experience. Many testify to a subsequent experience of power. Reformed theology can affirm intense post-conversion **fillings** and breakthroughs without reclassifying them as the baptism of the Spirit. The command to be filled with the Spirit presupposes the indwelling Spirit. We do not deny the reality of experiences; we reassign their biblical category.

The doctrine must also be located within the broader loci. In trinitarian theology, **divine simplicity** and the **inseparable operations** rule out picturing the Spirit as an independent agent apart from the Son. Christ baptizes in the Spirit. In Christology, the Spirit is the anointing of the Messiah, and believers receive the Spirit as the anointing of the anointed one, forming the church as his body. In soteriology, Spirit-baptism coincides with effectual calling, regeneration, faith, and adoption. In ecclesiology, it is the basis for the one body, one Spirit, one baptism. In sacramentology, Spirit-baptism is signified and sealed by water baptism, without identity or ex opere operato conflation. In mission, Spirit-baptism grounds witness as participation in the risen Christ’s mission; it does not create a two-tier clergy of the gifted.

Contemporary pressures require disciplined charity. The global charismatic movement has drawn millions into lively prayer and evangelism. A Reformed account should neither quench zeal nor cede biblical categories. Where “baptism in the Spirit” is used as renewal language among Catholics or evangelicals, the pastoral work is to catechize toward the apostolic categories of **baptism** as sign and seal, **filling** as ongoing imperative, and gifts as for edification. The New Apostolic Reformation’s claims to restored apostles and prophets should be rejected on the basis of the once-for-all apostolic foundation. Practices that tether assurance to tongues or a crisis experience must be confronted as pastorally corrosive. At the same time, dry, functional deism masquerading as Reformed piety must be resisted. The Spirit is sovereignly free, the Word is living, prayer is effectual, and God grants seasons of unusual enlargement. The test is not novelty but submission to Scripture and edification of the body.

Finally, we must render a concise defense. Spirit-baptism is the eschatological gift of Christ at Pentecost. As such, it is unique in salvation history. The ordinary application of this gift to individuals coincides with their incorporation into Christ by faith, signified and sealed in water baptism. Luke’s narrative shows the once-for-all gift crossing covenantal frontiers, occasionally with delay for ecclesial reasons. Paul’s teaching provides the stable baseline: all Christians have been baptized in one Spirit into one body. There is no class of Christian lacking this baptism. Gifts for edification vary. Tongues and prophecy functioned as revelatory signs within the apostolic foundation and are not normative today. Believers should earnestly seek to be filled with the Spirit continually through the **means of grace**, prayer, and obedience. Any account that posits subsequence as normative or tongues as necessary evidence dislocates the doctrine from **union with Christ** and the church’s one baptism. Any account that turns baptism into a sacramental machine binds the Spirit to the calendar. The Reformed account, drawing on Augustine’s ecclesial realism, Calvin’s union with Christ, Warfield’s apostolic foundation, and Gaffin’s redemptive-historical integration, preserves the unity of the gospel, the sufficiency of Scripture, and the holiness of the church.
