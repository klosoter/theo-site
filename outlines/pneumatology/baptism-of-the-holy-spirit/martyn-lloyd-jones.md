# Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899–1981)

Martyn Lloyd-Jones emphasized the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as a distinct and experiential reality subsequent to **regeneration**, vital for **empowerment in Christian witness**. He critiqued the reduction of the Spirit’s work to mere conversion, insisting on a dynamic, post-conversion experience that brings assurance and boldness, while remaining within a broadly **Reformed** framework.

- "The baptism with the Spirit is not the same as regeneration, it is something that happens to one who is already a believer." ("Joy Unspeakable")

## Key Works

- Joy Unspeakable: The Baptism and Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Prove All Things: The Sovereignty of God in the Baptism and Filling of the Holy Spirit (sermons)
- The Christian Warfare (Ephesians 6)
- The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors (addresses historical views)
- Revival

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit is Distinct from Regeneration**
    - Argues that **regeneration** and **Spirit baptism** are separate acts in the believer’s life.
    - Emphasizes that many Christians lack the fullness of the Spirit despite genuine faith.
    - Cites biblical examples (e.g., Acts 8, Acts 19) where believers receive the Spirit after conversion.
    - Warns against equating the Spirit’s baptism with initial faith or water baptism.
    - "The baptism with the Spirit is always something that comes after faith." (Joy Unspeakable)

2. **Experiential and Evidential Nature**
    - Stresses that **Spirit baptism** is a conscious, often overwhelming experience.
    - Associates it with deep assurance, joy, and boldness in witness.
    - Rejects purely intellectual or sacramental understandings of the Spirit’s work.
    - Encourages seeking this experience through prayer and expectancy.
    - "It is experiential, it is something which happens to you, and you know it." (Joy Unspeakable)

3. **Empowerment for Witness and Service**
    - Connects the baptism of the Spirit with **power for ministry** and effective evangelism.
    - Points to Pentecost as the paradigm for ongoing Christian experience.
    - Argues that the church’s weakness stems from neglecting this empowering work.
    - Sees the Spirit’s baptism as essential for revival and mission.
    - "The baptism with the Spirit is always related to witness, to service, to power." (Joy Unspeakable)

4. **Continuity with Reformed and Puritan Tradition**
    - Claims that historic **Reformed** and **Puritan** figures experienced similar post-conversion encounters.
    - Critiques cessationist readings that limit the Spirit’s work to the apostolic era.
    - Appeals to Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and others as precedents.
    - Maintains a high view of Scripture and the sovereignty of God in these experiences.
    - "The Puritans were men who knew the power of the Spirit in their lives." (The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors)

5. **Discernment and Dangers of Excess**
    - Warns against fanaticism, emotionalism, and unscriptural manifestations.
    - Insists that true **Spirit baptism** leads to Christ-centeredness and holiness.
    - Urges testing of experiences by Scripture and the fruit of the Spirit.
    - Distinguishes between genuine revival and mere excitement or disorder.
    - "We must always test the spirits, whether they are of God." (Joy Unspeakable)

## Legacy and Impact

Lloyd-Jones’s teaching on the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has profoundly shaped evangelical and Reformed discussions of the Spirit’s work, especially among those seeking renewal without abandoning doctrinal orthodoxy. His insistence on a post-conversion, empowering experience influenced the British and global charismatic movements, while also provoking debate within traditional **Reformed** circles. Lloyd-Jones remains a pivotal figure for those navigating the relationship between **Word and Spirit** in contemporary ministry.
