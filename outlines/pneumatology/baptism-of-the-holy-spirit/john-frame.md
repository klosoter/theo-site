# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** within the broader context of **Reformed pneumatology**, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in **regeneration**, **union with Christ**, and the ongoing work of **sanctification**. He critiques the Pentecostal/charismatic distinction between Spirit baptism and conversion, arguing that all believers receive the **fullness of the Spirit** at conversion, while also affirming the Spirit’s ongoing empowerment for ministry.

- "The New Testament does not present the baptism of the Spirit as a second blessing, but as the initial work of the Spirit in bringing us to Christ." ("Systematic Theology")

- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit Baptism Coincides with Conversion**
    - Argues that **baptism of the Holy Spirit** is synonymous with **regeneration** and entry into union with Christ.
    - Rejects the idea of a post-conversion "second blessing" as normative for Christian experience.
    - Emphasizes that all believers are baptized in the Spirit at the moment of faith.
    - Grounds this view in passages such as 1 Corinthians 12:13 and Romans 8:9.
    - "All who are united to Christ by faith have received the Spirit in full measure." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Ongoing Empowerment by the Spirit**
    - Affirms that the Spirit continues to fill and empower believers for service after conversion.
    - Distinguishes between the once-for-all baptism and repeated "fillings" of the Spirit.
    - Encourages prayer and dependence on the Spirit for boldness and fruitfulness.
    - Sees these empowerments as part of **sanctification**, not a separate category of blessing.
    - "The Spirit’s ongoing work is to empower us for obedience and witness." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Critique of Pentecostal/Charismatic Distinctions**
    - Questions the exegetical basis for separating Spirit baptism from conversion.
    - Argues that Acts is descriptive, not prescriptive, regarding unique outpourings of the Spirit.
    - Warns against creating a two-tiered Christianity based on spiritual experiences.
    - Upholds the sufficiency of Christ and the Spirit’s work in all believers.
    - "We should not seek a second blessing, but rather trust that God has given us all things in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Integration with Covenant Theology**
    - Places Spirit baptism within the framework of **covenant blessings** promised in the New Covenant.
    - Connects the outpouring of the Spirit to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy (e.g., Joel 2).
    - Emphasizes the corporate dimension: the Spirit unites all believers into one body.
    - Sees water baptism as a sign and seal of the Spirit’s inward work.
    - "The Spirit’s coming marks the inauguration of the new covenant community." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Trinitarian Emphasis in Pneumatology**
    - Frames the Spirit’s work in relation to the Father’s plan and the Son’s accomplishment.
    - Highlights the Spirit as the agent who applies redemption to the elect.
    - Insists that the Spirit’s ministry never detracts from the centrality of Christ.
    - Maintains that true experiences of the Spirit are always consistent with **Scripture**.
    - "The Spirit glorifies Christ and brings us into fellowship with the triune God." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has reinforced a robustly Reformed and Trinitarian approach to **pneumatology** within contemporary evangelical theology. His careful critique of charismatic distinctives and his insistence on the Spirit’s work at conversion have shaped discussions on spiritual experience and assurance. Frame’s integration of biblical, systematic, and covenantal perspectives continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking clarity on the Spirit’s role in the Christian life.
