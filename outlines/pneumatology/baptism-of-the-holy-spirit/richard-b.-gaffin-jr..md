# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose understanding of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** is rooted in the once-for-all, redemptive-historical work of Christ and the application of salvation by the Spirit. He rejects any post-conversion, second-blessing experience, emphasizing that **Spirit baptism** is inseparable from **union with Christ** and is received by all believers at regeneration. Gaffin’s approach is marked by a strong commitment to **biblical-theological method** and the centrality of **Pentecost** in the history of redemption.

- "The baptism of the Holy Spirit is not a post-conversion experience but coincides with becoming a Christian." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 26)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit Baptism as Redemptive-Historical Event**
    - Pentecost marks the definitive, once-for-all outpouring of the Spirit.
    - The event is tied to Christ’s exaltation and the inauguration of the **new covenant**.
    - All subsequent believers participate in this event through union with Christ.
    - Spirit baptism is not a repeatable or subsequent experience.
    - "Pentecost is not a model for individual Christian experience but a unique, unrepeatable event in salvation history." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 20)

2. **Union with Christ and Spirit Baptism**
    - Spirit baptism is inseparable from union with Christ in his death and resurrection.
    - Every believer receives the Spirit at conversion, not at a later stage.
    - There is no biblical basis for a two-stage Christian experience.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the mark of belonging to Christ.
    - "To be baptized with the Spirit is to be united to Christ and to share in all his benefits." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 27)

3. **Cessation of Apostolic Gifts**
    - The miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) were foundational and temporary.
    - These gifts authenticated the apostolic witness and the foundation of the church.
    - With the close of the apostolic era, such gifts ceased.
    - The ongoing work of the Spirit is now primarily through the Word.
    - "The New Testament does not encourage us to expect the continuation of apostolic gifts." (Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?, p. 37)

4. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of revelation in redemptive history.
    - Interprets the work of the Spirit in light of the completed work of Christ.
    - Avoids atomistic or purely experiential readings of Acts.
    - Stresses the importance of context and epochal shifts in biblical theology.
    - "We must interpret the experience of the Spirit in Acts in light of the whole scope of redemptive history." (Perspectives on Pentecost, p. 15)

5. **Soteriological Centrality of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to believers.
    - Regeneration, justification, and sanctification are all Spirit-wrought.
    - There is no salvation apart from the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - The Spirit’s work is comprehensive, not compartmentalized.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and his people." (Resurrection and Redemption, p. 135)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **Spirit baptism** has shaped contemporary Reformed and Presbyterian theology, especially in response to Pentecostal and charismatic movements. His insistence on the redemptive-historical uniqueness of Pentecost and the inseparability of the Spirit’s work from union with Christ has provided a robust theological alternative to second-blessing doctrines. Gaffin’s influence endures through his students, writings, and his role in shaping the Westminster tradition’s approach to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
