# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson approaches the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** from a classic **Reformed** and **biblical-theological** perspective, emphasizing its inseparability from **union with Christ** and the application of **salvation**. He rejects any post-conversion "second blessing" experience, instead identifying the baptism of the Spirit with the believer’s incorporation into the body of Christ at regeneration. Ferguson’s teaching underscores the **once-for-all nature** of Spirit baptism and its centrality in the believer’s sanctification and assurance.

- "The baptism of the Spirit is not a subsequent experience to conversion, but is integral to the event of becoming a Christian." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 97)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit Baptism as Union with Christ**
    - Spirit baptism occurs at conversion, uniting the believer to Christ.
    - It is not a separate or subsequent event after faith.
    - This union is foundational for all other benefits of salvation.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the mark of true Christian identity.
    - "To be baptized with the Spirit is to be united to Christ and to share in all the blessings of salvation." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 98)

2. **Rejection of a Second Blessing**
    - Ferguson opposes the Pentecostal/Charismatic view of a post-conversion Spirit baptism.
    - He argues that all believers receive the Spirit fully at regeneration.
    - Subsequent experiences are to be understood as fillings, not new baptisms.
    - This guards against a two-tiered Christianity.
    - "There is no biblical warrant for seeking a second, post-conversion baptism of the Spirit." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 99)

3. **Baptism of the Spirit and the Ordo Salutis**
    - Spirit baptism is integrally linked to justification, adoption, and sanctification.
    - It is simultaneous with the application of redemption.
    - The Spirit’s work is comprehensive, not fragmented.
    - Assurance flows from recognizing the Spirit’s presence from the outset of faith.
    - "The Spirit’s baptism is not an optional extra, but the very means by which we are brought into Christ." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 100)

4. **Corporate and Ecclesial Dimensions**
    - Spirit baptism incorporates believers into the one body of Christ, the church.
    - It is not merely an individualistic experience.
    - The unity of the church is grounded in the one baptism of the Spirit.
    - This undergirds the catholicity and fellowship of the saints.
    - "By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—this is the basis of our unity." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 101)

5. **Sanctification and Ongoing Filling**
    - While Spirit baptism is once-for-all, believers are exhorted to seek ongoing filling.
    - The Spirit’s fullness empowers sanctification and service.
    - Ongoing filling is distinct from the initial baptism.
    - This dynamic is essential for growth and vitality in the Christian life.
    - "The New Testament distinguishes between the once-for-all baptism and the repeated fillings of the Spirit." ("The Holy Spirit," p. 102)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s robustly **Reformed** articulation of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has shaped contemporary evangelical and Presbyterian understandings, especially in contrast to Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. His work has provided clarity on the relationship between the Spirit’s work and **union with Christ**, reinforcing the sufficiency of Christ’s redemptive work applied by the Spirit. Ferguson’s influence endures in systematic theology, pastoral ministry, and the global Reformed community.
