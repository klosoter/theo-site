# John Stott (1921–2011)

John Stott maintained that the **baptism of the Holy Spirit** is not a post-conversion experience but is synonymous with **regeneration** and **incorporation into Christ**. He emphasized the unity of the **body of Christ** and argued that all believers receive the Spirit at conversion, rejecting the idea of a subsequent, distinct **Spirit baptism** as taught in some Pentecostal and Charismatic circles.

- "The New Testament does not encourage us to look for any experience subsequent to conversion in which we are baptized with the Spirit." (Baptism and Fullness)

## Key Works

- Baptism and Fullness: The Work of the Holy Spirit Today
- The Message of Acts (The Bible Speaks Today series)
- The Cross of Christ
- Evangelical Truth: A Personal Plea for Unity, Integrity and Faithfulness

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit Occurs at Conversion**
    - The **baptism of the Holy Spirit** is the initial work of the Spirit in uniting believers to Christ.
    - Stott sees no biblical basis for a two-stage Christian experience regarding the Spirit.
    - All who are in Christ have been baptized by the Spirit, regardless of subsequent experiences.
    - He interprets passages like 1 Corinthians 12:13 as referring to all believers.
    - "We cannot be Christians without the Spirit; we cannot belong to Christ without the Spirit; we cannot be united to Christ without the Spirit." (Baptism and Fullness)

2. **Distinction Between Baptism and Filling**
    - Stott distinguishes between the one-time **baptism** and the repeated **filling** of the Spirit.
    - Baptism is about incorporation into the body of Christ; filling is about empowerment for service and sanctification.
    - The filling of the Spirit is an ongoing need and command for believers.
    - He warns against confusing the two, which leads to doctrinal error and division.
    - "The baptism of the Spirit is a once-for-all initiatory experience, whereas the filling of the Spirit is a continuous and repeated experience." (Baptism and Fullness)

3. **Unity of the Body of Christ**
    - Stott stresses that all believers share equally in the Spirit, fostering **unity**.
    - He opposes any doctrine that creates a two-tiered Christianity based on spiritual experience.
    - The Spirit’s work is to unite, not divide, the church.
    - The New Testament presents no class of Christians who lack the Spirit.
    - "To teach that there are two kinds of Christians, those who have and those who have not received the Spirit, is to contradict the New Testament." (Baptism and Fullness)

4. **Biblical Authority and Exegesis**
    - Stott grounds his doctrine in careful exegesis of **Acts** and **Pauline epistles**.
    - He argues that narrative descriptions in Acts are not normative for doctrine.
    - Stott prioritizes clear apostolic teaching over historical precedent.
    - He calls for doctrinal formulations to be rooted in the whole counsel of Scripture.
    - "We must not base doctrine on isolated incidents, but on the consistent teaching of the apostles." (Baptism and Fullness)

5. **Cautious Engagement with Charismatic Claims**
    - Stott acknowledges the reality of spiritual experience but insists on biblical boundaries.
    - He encourages discernment regarding claims of **Spirit baptism** as a second blessing.
    - Stott affirms the ongoing work of the Spirit in sanctification and gifting.
    - He calls for humility and charity in dialogue with Charismatic Christians.
    - "We must not despise the experiences of others, but we must test all things by Scripture." (Baptism and Fullness)

## Legacy and Impact

Stott’s teaching on the **baptism of the Holy Spirit** has shaped evangelical understanding, especially among those wary of Charismatic theology. His insistence on the unity of the church and the sufficiency of the Spirit’s work at conversion has provided a robust alternative to two-stage pneumatology. Stott’s careful exegesis and irenic tone have made his works enduring resources for those seeking clarity on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. His influence continues to be felt in global evangelicalism, particularly in discussions of **Spirit baptism** and Christian unity.
