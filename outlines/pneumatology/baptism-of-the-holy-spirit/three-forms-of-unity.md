# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity present a classic **Reformed doctrine of the Holy Spirit**, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in **regeneration**, **faith**, and the application of **Christ’s benefits** to the elect. These confessions teach that all believers receive the **Holy Spirit** through union with Christ, signified and sealed in **water baptism**, and that the Spirit’s indwelling is inseparable from the ordinary means of grace within the covenant community.

- "For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 54, citing 1 Cor. 12:13)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit’s Work is Covenantal and Christocentric**
    - The Holy Spirit is given to all who are united to Christ by faith.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemption to the elect.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is not a second blessing but part of **salvation**.
    - The Spirit’s presence is assured through the promises of the **gospel**.
    "What do you believe concerning the Holy Spirit? First, that he is, together with the Father and the Son, true and eternal God. Second, that he is also given to me..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 53)

2. **Baptism Signifies and Seals the Spirit’s Work**
    - **Water baptism** is a sign and seal of the Spirit’s inward renewal.
    - Baptism points to the washing away of sins by the Spirit and blood of Christ.
    - The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of administration.
    - The Spirit’s work is sovereign and not mechanically conferred by the sacrament.
    "To be washed with the Holy Spirit means that the Spirit has renewed and sanctified us to be members of Christ..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 70)

3. **No Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Spirit Baptism**
    - All believers receive the Spirit in **regeneration** and faith.
    - There is no expectation of a post-conversion "baptism of the Holy Spirit" as a separate event.
    - The Spirit’s gifts are distributed according to God’s will, not as a second tier of Christian experience.
    - The confessions oppose any doctrine that divides Christians into Spirit-baptized and non-Spirit-baptized.
    "By this washing, the children of God are sealed and set apart from the children of unbelievers." (Belgic Confession, Article 34)

4. **Spirit’s Presence is Tied to the Means of Grace**
    - The Spirit works through the **Word** and **sacraments** to create and strengthen faith.
    - The Spirit’s presence is not dependent on ecstatic experiences or signs.
    - Assurance of the Spirit is grounded in the promises of the **gospel**.
    - The ordinary means are sufficient for the Spirit’s ongoing work in the believer.
    "The sacraments are visible signs and seals of an inward and invisible thing, by means whereof God works in us by the power of the Holy Ghost." (Belgic Confession, Article 33)

5. **Rejection of Enthusiasm and Sacramentalism**
    - The confessions reject both mystical enthusiasm and mechanical views of the sacraments.
    - The Spirit’s work is neither independent of the **Word** nor bound to the outward sign.
    - True faith receives the Spirit’s benefits as promised in the **gospel**.
    - The confessions warn against seeking the Spirit apart from Christ and his instituted means.
    "We detest all the errors of all men who reject the sacraments as not being sufficient." (Belgic Confession, Article 35)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have decisively shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in the continental Reformed tradition. Their teaching on the Spirit’s work in **baptism** and **regeneration** stands in contrast to later Pentecostal and charismatic interpretations of "Spirit baptism." By rooting the believer’s reception of the Holy Spirit in union with Christ and the means of grace, these confessions have provided a robust theological framework for understanding the Spirit’s role in the life of the church. Their influence endures in **Reformed churches** worldwide, emphasizing the unity of the Spirit’s work with the gospel and the sacraments.
