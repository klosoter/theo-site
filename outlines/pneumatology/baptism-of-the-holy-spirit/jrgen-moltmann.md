    - The Spirit’s baptism initiates liberation from oppressive structures.
    - Moltmann connects the Spirit’s work to movements for **justice** and **freedom**.
    - The Spirit empowers communities to resist dehumanization and seek reconciliation.

    - "The Spirit is the pledge of the world’s future in God." ("The Spirit of Life")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s pneumatology has significantly influenced contemporary discussions of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**, especially by linking it to **eschatology**, liberation, and communal renewal. His emphasis on the Spirit’s role in both personal transformation and social change has shaped ecumenical and liberationist theologies worldwide. By rooting the Spirit’s baptism in the context of the **Triune God** and the hope of new creation, Moltmann has broadened the scope of pneumatological reflection beyond traditional boundaries.
