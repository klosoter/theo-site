# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **baptism of the Holy Spirit** as an aspect of the believer’s union with Christ, emphasizing its inseparability from **regeneration** and **effectual calling**. He rejected any post-conversion "second blessing," insisting that all believers receive the fullness of the Spirit at conversion as part of their incorporation into the **body of Christ**.

- "There is no New Testament warrant for identifying the baptism of the Spirit with any post-conversion experience." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit is Initiatory**
    - Occurs at the inception of the Christian life, not as a subsequent event.
    - Coincides with **regeneration** and **effectual calling**.
    - Marks incorporation into the **body of Christ**.
    - Is not a repeatable or subsequent experience.
    - "The baptism of the Spirit is the action by which we are united to Christ and made members of his body." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **No Distinction Between Baptism and Filling**
    - Distinguishes between the once-for-all baptism and the repeated fillings of the Spirit.
    - Baptism is universal for all believers; filling is variable and ongoing.
    - Filling relates to empowerment for service, not to incorporation into Christ.
    - Avoids confusion with charismatic or Pentecostal interpretations.
    - "The filling of the Spirit is not to be identified with the baptism of the Spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Union with Christ as Central**
    - Baptism of the Spirit is fundamentally about union with Christ.
    - All the benefits of redemption flow from this union, including the gift of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is inseparable from being in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the corporate dimension: believers are joined to one another in the body.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Rejection of Second Blessing Theology**
    - Denies any post-conversion "second blessing" or crisis experience.
    - Critiques Pentecostal and Wesleyan views as lacking biblical foundation.
    - Argues that all believers possess the Spirit fully from the moment of faith.
    - Sees the quest for a second experience as pastorally and theologically problematic.
    - "There is no scriptural basis for a two-stage reception of the Holy Spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Covenantal and Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - Interprets the baptism of the Spirit in light of the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Pentecost marks the once-for-all outpouring of the Spirit on the church.
    - The Spirit’s baptism is a new covenant reality, not an individual mystical event.
    - Connects the doctrine to the fulfillment of Old Testament promises.
    - "Pentecost was epochal in the history of redemption, not merely experiential for individuals." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robustly **Reformed** approach to the baptism of the Holy Spirit shaped generations of confessional theologians, especially in distinguishing the doctrine from charismatic and Pentecostal interpretations. His insistence on the unity of the ordo salutis and the centrality of **union with Christ** provided clarity for Reformed churches navigating 20th-century debates. Murray’s careful exegesis and covenantal framework continue to influence systematic theology and pastoral practice regarding the work of the Holy Spirit.
