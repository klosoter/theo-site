# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** within the broader context of **Reformed soteriology** and **ecclesiology**, emphasizing the Spirit’s work in applying **union with Christ** and the benefits of redemption. He rejected any post-conversion, second-blessing understanding, insisting that the **Holy Spirit’s baptism** is inseparable from regeneration and incorporation into the **covenant community**.

- "The work of the Holy Spirit is not to supplement what Christ has done, but to apply it to the hearts of those who are in Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit is Identical with Regeneration**
    - The **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** occurs at the moment of regeneration, not as a subsequent experience.
    - It is the Spirit’s act of uniting the believer to Christ and the benefits of redemption.
    - There is no biblical warrant for a two-stage Christian experience.
    - All who are in Christ have received the fullness of the Spirit’s baptism.
    - "The Spirit’s work is not to add to Christ’s work, but to make us partakers of it." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal and Corporate Emphasis**
    - The Spirit’s baptism incorporates believers into the **covenant community**, the church.
    - It is not a private or individualistic experience, but one that binds believers together in Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work is always tied to the objective promises of the covenant.
    - The church is the locus of the Spirit’s presence and activity.
    - "The Holy Spirit binds us to Christ and to one another in the covenant people." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Anti-Experientialist Polemic**
    - Van Til opposed Pentecostal and charismatic interpretations of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as a post-conversion experience.
    - He insisted that all spiritual blessings are received in Christ at conversion.
    - Subjective experiences must be tested by the objective standard of Scripture.
    - The Spirit’s work is not to be confused with emotional or ecstatic phenomena.
    - "We must not seek for something beyond Christ and his finished work." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Trinitarian Application of Redemption**
    - The Spirit applies what the Father planned and the Son accomplished.
    - The **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** is a Trinitarian act, not isolated from the work of the Father and Son.
    - The Spirit’s role is to unite believers to Christ, not to draw attention to Himself.
    - The unity of the Trinity ensures the unity of the believer’s experience of salvation.
    - "The Holy Spirit never works independently of the Father and the Son." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Objective Grounding in Redemptive History**
    - The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost is a once-for-all, redemptive-historical event.
    - The benefits of Pentecost are applied to every believer through union with Christ.
    - The **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in ongoing new revelations.
    - The church lives in the age of the Spirit, inaugurated at Pentecost and continuing until Christ’s return.
    - "Pentecost marks the beginning of the Spirit’s universal application of redemption." (The Holy Spirit, Encyclopedia of Christianity)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** reinforced the classic **Reformed doctrine of salvation**, countering charismatic and Pentecostal trends within twentieth-century evangelicalism. His covenantal and Trinitarian emphases shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially in their understanding of the Spirit’s work in the church. By rooting the Spirit’s baptism in union with Christ and the objective promises of the covenant, Van Til provided a robust theological framework that continues to influence Reformed ecclesiology and pneumatology.
