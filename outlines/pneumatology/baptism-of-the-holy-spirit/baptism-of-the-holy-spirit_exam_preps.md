### TITLE
Baptism in the Holy Spirit: Pentecost, Union with Christ, and the Contest over a Second Blessing

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether **baptism in the Holy Spirit** is a once-for-all redemptive-historical and soteriological reality identified with union with Christ and initiation into the church, or a post-conversion, repeatable empowerment distinct from conversion and ordinary sanctification.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, John Wesley, Charles Fox Parham, Martyn Lloyd-Jones, John Stott, Gordon Fee.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed and broader magisterial Protestantism, Wesleyan and Holiness theology, classical Pentecostalism, later neo-Pentecostal and charismatic movements.
- Debates:
  - Internal: among Reformed and evangelical theologians on the relation of Spirit baptism to regeneration, assurance, and subsequent “fillings”; among Pentecostals on subsequence and initial evidence.
  - External: Pentecostal–Reformed dispute over whether Spirit baptism is subsequence and evidenced by tongues; Wesleyan–Reformed dispute over second-blessing perfectionism; sacramental vs non-sacramental construals of Spirit baptism.
  - Contemporary: charismatic renewal in Reformed churches, global Pentecostalism, ecumenical pressure to accommodate “second blessing” language, and the pastoral handling of experiential claims.
- Defended position: **Baptism in the Holy Spirit** is the once-for-all, unrepeatable work of the exalted Christ at Pentecost by which he constitutes the eschatological people of God, and for individuals it coincides with incorporation into Christ and his body at conversion, distinguished from but normatively followed by ongoing **filling of the Spirit** and diverse experiences of empowerment not tied to any one gift.

### ESSAY
Any adequate account of **baptism in the Holy Spirit** must first distinguish carefully between events in the history of redemption and experiences in the life of the believer. Oral examiners will press immediately on whether one has confused the unique, once-for-all Pentecostal outpouring with repeatable experiences of power. I will argue that biblically, the phrase “baptized in the Spirit” names the definitive eschatological act of the risen Christ by which he immerses his people into the new age of the Spirit and incorporates them into his body, and that for individuals this corresponds to conversion and union with Christ, not to a post-conversion “second blessing.” The failure to maintain this distinction lies at the root of much modern confusion.

John Calvin is the decisive early Protestant figure because he links the Spirit’s work in a robust way with union with Christ and with the ordo salutis, yet without the language of a second baptism. While the specific phrase “baptism in the Holy Spirit” is not central in his writings, his framework governs later Reformed rejection of second-blessing schemes. Operating within a strong **Trinitarian** and **covenantal** theology, Calvin insists that all saving benefits are in Christ and received through the Spirit by faith. The Spirit is the bond of union with Christ, and this union is not partial or layered. The believer is either in Adam or in Christ; there is no middle estate. For Calvin, where the Spirit is, there is regeneration, justification, adoption, and sanctification in seed. This does not deny degrees of assurance, growth, or fresh endowments of power, but it undercuts the idea that there is a qualitatively distinct state of Christian existence available only to some through a subsequent crisis. Examiners may ask whether Calvin’s view can account for the dramatic change in the disciples between the Gospels and Acts. The answer, consistent with Calvin’s own reading, is that Pentecost is not merely individual experience but the transition between old covenant and new covenant economies, so we must not universalize its chronology as a norm for post-Pentecost ordo salutis.

John Wesley, by contrast, is decisive for introducing into Protestant piety a stable “second blessing” schema that later becomes a seedbed for Pentecostal doctrine. Wesley never taught classical Pentecostal Spirit baptism with tongues, but he did develop the notion of **entire sanctification** or Christian perfection as a post-conversion crisis. For Wesley, justification and the new birth initiate the Christian life but do not eradicate inbred sin; entire sanctification, received through a distinct work of grace often years after conversion, brings the heart into perfect love. This is not sinless perfection in the sense of absolute incapacity for error, but he does construe it as a new state. Functionally, this operated as a two-tier spirituality: “ordinary believers” and the “entirely sanctified.” Even if Wesley intended this as available to all, it created space for a two-stage soteriology. Historically, the **Holiness movement** in the nineteenth century radicalized this insight, detaching it partially from Wesley’s sacramental and ecclesial commitments and rebranding the second work as “baptism with the Holy Spirit” understood primarily as cleansing from inbred sin. Wesley’s own sermons and journals show that he wrestled with episodic experiences of assurance and love that he interpreted in light of this construct. Oral examiners will often press whether Wesley’s reading of Scripture, especially 1 Thessalonians 5 and 1 John, justifies such a bifurcation. A Reformed answer is that Wesley confuses the definitive breach with sin’s dominion at conversion with the progressive mortification of residual corruption, and that the New Testament calls all believers holy in Christ while exhorting them to ever-increasing growth rather than promising a second crisis that removes sin’s presence.

The Holiness reinterpretation of Wesley sets the stage for Charles Fox Parham, the theological architect of classical Pentecostalism. Parham operated in a late nineteenth-century American environment saturated with Holiness theology, expectation of the latter rain of the Spirit, and premillennial eschatology. In his Bible school in Topeka Kansas at the turn of the century, he posed the question: what is the biblical evidence that one has received the **baptism in the Holy Spirit**? His reading of Acts led him to the thesis that tongues are the uniform initial evidence. When his student Agnes Ozman spoke in tongues on 1 January 1901 after prayer for the baptism, Parham concluded that the Holiness “baptism of fire” and the Lukan baptism in the Spirit are the same event, subsequent to conversion, always accompanied by glossolalia. For Parham, Spirit baptism is not primarily about sanctification but empowerment for mission and the restoration of apostolic signs. This is a conceptual reframing: he fuses Wesleyan second blessing structure with a Lukan narrative of power and then adds the marker of tongues. The Azusa Street revival under William Seymour spreads this framework globally.

Here the external debate with Reformed theology becomes sharp. Pentecostals following Parham argue that Luke presents a normative pattern: believers are converted, then at some later point receive the baptism in the Spirit evidenced by tongues. They string together Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 as confirming this subsequence. They distinguish between regeneration by the Spirit and baptism in the Spirit, the former being soteriological and the latter doxological and missional. Reformed critics insist that this fractures the unity of the Spirit’s work and risks a two-class ecclesiology. The key exegetical issue is whether Luke’s unique transitional narratives describe normative ordo salutis for all ages. A robust Reformed position, building on Calvin’s **redemptive-historical** instincts, maintains that Acts narrates the expansion of the one Pentecostal gift to new groups Samaritan, Gentile, disciples of John as the gospel advances, and that the temporal gaps highlight the unity of Jew and Gentile in the one body under apostolic control, not a pattern for every believer’s experience. The supposed subsequence in Acts functions to tie new groups visibly and apostolically to the Jerusalem church, not to offer a second tier of post-conversion spirituality.

Later evangelical discussion is dominated by a debate between Martyn Lloyd-Jones and John Stott, both operating self-consciously within a Reformed and evangelical frame yet divided on this very question. Lloyd-Jones, though not Pentecostal, is deeply influenced by experiential Puritanism and by revivalist piety. In his sermons on Ephesians and on the Holy Spirit, he contends that “sealing” and “baptism with the Spirit” often occur as distinct, climactic experiences after conversion, bringing overwhelming assurance and power. He is open to spiritual gifts, though cautious about tongues as a necessary sign. Lloyd-Jones’s method is strongly inductive from experience: he looks at historical revivals, Puritan testimonies, and the dramatic change in the apostles after Pentecost, then seeks biblical categories to describe these. He insists that all believers have the Spirit, but not all have been “baptized” in the Pentecostal sense. For examiners, this raises the internal debate within Reformed circles: can one affirm the fullness of the Spirit in all believers while still teaching a post-conversion baptism as a distinct work? The danger is that this blurs the line between the objective grace of union with Christ and the subjective intensification of that grace in revival or assurance.

John Stott, in contrast, mounts a systematic exegetical defense of identifying Spirit baptism with conversion. In works like “Baptism and Fullness,” he argues rigorously from texts like 1 Corinthians 12:13 that “in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body” refers to the initiatory work of the Spirit by which we are incorporated into Christ and the church. He notes that in Paul, there is no class of Christians who are not Spirit-baptized; all who belong to Christ have his Spirit. Stott distinguishes carefully between being baptized in the Spirit, which is once-for-all and non-repeatable, and being filled with the Spirit, which is commanded repeatedly in Ephesians 5:18. The latter admits of degree and recurrence; the former does not. He reads Acts in light of this Pauline anchor, classifying Pentecost and related events as unique historical expansions of the same reality, not a template for a second stage. Stott’s method is canonical and synthetical rather than experiential; he treats Acts as descriptive and Pauline epistles as interpretive. Stott’s position, widely received in evangelical Anglican and Reformed circles, becomes the standard alternative to Pentecostal second blessing theology.

Gordon Fee, a Pentecostal New Testament scholar, complicates the picture by challenging some classical Pentecostal exegetical moves from within. Fee insists that the New Testament does not rigidly separate regeneration and Spirit baptism. In his commentaries and his book “God’s Empowering Presence,” he argues that Paul presupposes all believers as having experienced the Spirit in a rich, multifaceted way that includes both soteriological and charismatic dimensions. Fee remains committed to a strong expectation of charismatic gifts, but he rejects subsequence as a necessary structure. He points out that Luke’s narrative emphasis falls on the Spirit as the sign of the new age and the inclusion of the marginal, not on establishing a universal two-stage ordo salutis. Fee is decisive because he shows that even within Pentecostal tradition, there is serious revision of Parham’s scheme. This internal Pentecostal debate mirrors the Reformed internal debate between more Lloyd-Jonesian experientialism and more Stottian canonical exegesis.

Against this background, the position I defend is as follows. Conceptually, **baptism in the Holy Spirit** must be anchored in the once-for-all event of Pentecost as an act of the exalted Christ. It is the eschatological counterpart of Christ’s death and resurrection: as his cross and empty tomb accomplish salvation objectively, so Pentecost is the objective, communal bestowal of the Spirit on the church. When Paul speaks of believers being baptized in or with one Spirit into one body, he is describing the application of this Pentecostal reality to individuals in union with Christ. To be Spirit-baptized, in Pauline idiom, is to have been transferred from the old age into the new, from Adam into Christ, from outside the church into the body. This is identical in time with effectual calling and faith, though logically we may distinguish aspects.

This means there is no biblical warrant to locate Spirit baptism as a second stage of the ordo salutis beyond conversion. The Reformed concern for the unity of the **ordo salutis** under **union with Christ** is precisely right. All are either outside Christ and without the Spirit or inside Christ, baptized in the Spirit, indwelt and sealed. However, this does not reduce the Christian life to a flat, static possession. Scripture also speaks of **filling with the Spirit**, of greater or lesser degrees of power, of fresh outpourings and revivals. These are not additional baptisms but intensifications of the one baptism. The same Spirit who unites to Christ continues to distribute gifts, to fill, to embolden, and to manifest himself diversely in the body. Thus, we affirm ongoing, sometimes dramatic experiences of renewal as part of ordinary sanctification and **charismatic** ministry without granting them sacramental status.

A likely examiner challenge is whether this position domestically reads Acts into a Reformed ordo and thereby evades the plain sense of narrative subsequence. Several replies are necessary. First, Acts 2 is unrepeatable in redemptive history; the disciples are in a unique covenantal position. Second, the Samaritan episode in Acts 8 is best read in light of the concern to maintain unity between Samaria and Jerusalem; the delay in the Spirit functions to draw apostolic witnesses to authenticate their inclusion. In Acts 10, the Gentile Cornelius receives the Spirit synchronously with faith, apparently overturning any fixed subsequence pattern. Acts 19 concerns disciples of John, not paradigmatic post-Pentecost Christians. The variety of patterns itself undermines a rigid second stage schema. Third, Paul’s letters, which expound the normative structure of Christian life, know of only one transfer from flesh to Spirit. The examiner might press: does this not risk downplaying the role of power in witness? The answer must be that identifying baptism with conversion does not undercut the necessity of power; rather, it grounds all power in the once-for-all incorporation into Christ and treats subsequent fillings as the Spirit’s outworking of that one foundation.

Internal debates within Reformed and evangelical circles remain. Some wish to preserve a vocabulary of “baptism in the Spirit” as a post-conversion experience for pragmatic or pastoral reasons, even while denying tongues as necessary evidence. The problem is that this obscures the **sacramental** and ecclesial dimensions of the term as used in Scripture. 1 Corinthians 12 locates Spirit baptism within the reality symbolized by water baptism: incorporation into the one body. To separate this from conversion is to introduce a quasi-sacrament of experience. Better to reserve “baptism” language for conversion and use “filling,” “empowerment,” or “anointing” for later experiences. This protects the unity of **ecclesiology** and **soteriology**: there are not first-class and second-class Christians; all are baptized in the Spirit, though not all are equally mature or equally gifted.

At the same time, external debates with sacramental traditions must be handled carefully. Roman Catholic and some Anglican theologies link “baptism in the Holy Spirit” to water baptism, especially in postconciliar charismatic renewal movements. Some interpret the renewed experience of the Spirit as a release of the grace of baptism and confirmation. A Reformed position distinguishes the sign from the thing signified but maintains their appointed connection under ordinary circumstances. Spirit baptism in the New Testament refers not to the water rite but to the Spirit’s act of uniting to Christ. The sacrament of baptism, rightly administered and received by faith, is the visible word that corresponds to this invisible reality. To conflate the two leads either to baptismal regeneration or to magical interpretations of sacramental efficacy. Here again Calvin is paradigmatic: he affirms that the Spirit ordinarily works through the sacraments but reserves sovereign freedom.

Contemporary debates place this doctrine under new pressure. Global Pentecostalism, now a massive presence in world Christianity, often defines itself practically by the offer of a post-conversion baptism in the Spirit with tongues. Charismatic renewal has entered Reformed churches, and many believers testify to post-conversion experiences of overwhelming joy, assurance, tongues, or other manifestations. Ecumenical bodies sometimes deploy a lowest common denominator language that treats “baptism in the Spirit” as a broad experiential intensification, untethered from precise biblical usage. The pastoral temptation for Reformed churches is either to suppress all talk of experience as dangerous enthusiasm or to capitulate to second-blessing formulas in order to affirm those experiences.

A better way, consistent with the position argued here, is to affirm the reality and goodness of powerful post-conversion experiences as **fillings of the Spirit**, to test them by Scripture and fruit, to refuse to absolutize any particular sign such as tongues, and to teach believers that from the moment they are united to Christ they are already baptized in the Spirit, fully belonging to the eschatological people of God. This maintains assurance for the weak believer who has never spoken in tongues or had dramatic experiences, while encouraging all to seek deeper **communion with God** and greater gifting for ministry.

Finally, this doctrine must cohere with other loci. With respect to **Christology**, Spirit baptism is the risen Christ’s royal gift; to separate the Spirit’s baptism from Christ’s mediatorial work is to drift into pneumatic enthusiasm. With respect to **Trinitarian theology**, the Spirit is the personal bond of fellowship with the Father and the Son, not an impersonal force administered in stages. With respect to **eschatology**, Pentecost is the down payment of the age to come; to require a second Pentecost in each believer’s life misunderstands the already and not yet tension. With respect to **sanctification**, the same Spirit who definitively breaks sin’s dominion at conversion progressively mortifies remaining sin; no second crisis removes the need for ongoing repentance and mortification.

In oral examination, clarity on these interconnections will be probed. One must be able to state succinctly: Spirit baptism in Scripture is redemptive-historical, Christocentric, ecclesial, and initiatory. It is not a post-conversion, elitist experience; yet genuine post-conversion fillings and empowerments remain essential to vibrant Christian life and mission. Recognizing this preserves both the objective unity of salvation and the subjective richness of life in the Spirit.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Baptism in the Holy Spirit** is the once-for-all redemptive-historical act of the exalted Christ at Pentecost, applied to individuals at conversion as their incorporation into Christ and his body, distinct from but normally followed by repeated **fillings of the Spirit**.
- Decisive figures:
  - John Calvin: unites all saving benefits under **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s work at conversion, leaving no space for a second essential blessing.
  - John Wesley: introduces a structured second work of grace, **entire sanctification**, later reinterpreted as Spirit baptism and shaping Holiness and Pentecostal trajectories.
  - Charles Fox Parham: fuses Wesleyan second blessing with a Lukan empowerment motif and teaches subsequence with tongues as initial evidence, defining classical Pentecostalism.
  - Martyn Lloyd-Jones: evangelical-Reformed advocate of post-conversion baptism in the Spirit as experiential power and assurance, while denying necessary tongues.
  - John Stott: exegetically grounds Spirit baptism in conversion and ecclesial incorporation, sharply distinguishing it from ongoing **filling**.
  - Gordon Fee: Pentecostal scholar who critiques rigid subsequence and argues for an integrated, soteriological-charismatic understanding of the Spirit in all believers.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Reformed dispute over whether to allow a post-conversion “baptism” category Lloyd-Jones versus Stott; Pentecostal rethinking of subsequence and initial evidence Fee versus Parham tradition.
  - External: Pentecostal-Holiness second blessing versus Reformed single-stage Spirit baptism; sacramental identification of Spirit baptism with water baptism versus Reformed sign–thing distinction.
  - Contemporary: charismatic experiences and tongues claims, global Pentecostal identity, pastoral handling of experiential disparity, ecumenical pressure to broaden “Spirit baptism” language.
- Defended position: Spirit baptism is identical, for individuals, with conversional union with Christ and incorporation into his body, and so is not a second-stage experience; later empowerments are rightly called **fillings of the Spirit**, not new baptisms, and no particular gift is necessary evidence of Spirit baptism.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is Spirit baptism subsequent to conversion?  
    No, in normative post-Pentecost experience it coincides with conversional union with Christ and entry into the church.
  - How do you interpret tongues in relation to Spirit baptism?  
    Tongues are one genuine gift among many, not the necessary or universal evidence of Spirit baptism.
  - How do Acts and Paul cohere on this doctrine?  
    Acts narrates the once-for-all Pentecostal outpouring’s expansion to new groups, while Paul interprets this as the common initiatory reality of all believers.
  - Can you affirm post-conversion experiences of power?  
    Yes, as repeated **fillings of the Spirit** and intensifications of grace, not as a distinct ontological tier of Christian existence.
  - How does this protect assurance?  
    It locates full possession of the Spirit in every true believer from conversion, so lack of dramatic experience does not imply a lower-class status in Christ.
