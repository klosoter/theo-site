# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, addressed the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** within the broader context of **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**. He distinguished between the extraordinary, apostolic outpouring of the Spirit and the ordinary, ongoing work of **regeneration** and **sanctification** in believers, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of the Spirit’s baptism at conversion. Turretin rejected later charismatic interpretations, insisting that the **gifts of the Spirit** in Acts were unique to the foundation of the church.

- "The baptism of the Spirit was extraordinary and peculiar to the apostolic age, not to be expected as a separate grace after conversion." 

## Key Works

- Institutio Theologiae Elencticae (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos (Commentary on Romans)
- Selected Questions on the Holy Spirit (various loci in the Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (as compiled and translated in modern editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit is Not a Second Blessing**
    - The **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** is not a subsequent experience after conversion, but coincides with **regeneration**.
    - Turretin opposes the idea of a two-stage Christian life, where some receive a higher spiritual status.
    - He grounds the baptism of the Spirit in the once-for-all work of Christ and the Spirit’s application of redemption.
    - The extraordinary manifestations in Acts are not normative for the post-apostolic church.
    - "We deny that the baptism of the Spirit is to be sought today as a separate and distinct grace from regeneration." (Institutes, XVII.xvii.4)

2. **Extraordinary Gifts Were Temporary**
    - The miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy) were signs authenticating the apostolic message.
    - These gifts ceased with the close of the **apostolic era** and the completion of **Scripture**.
    - The ordinary work of the Spirit now centers on **sanctification** and **illumination**.
    - Turretin warns against seeking new revelations or signs as evidence of the Spirit’s presence.
    - "Those extraordinary gifts were given for the founding of the church, not for its ordinary edification." (Institutes, XVIII.xi.8)

3. **Union with Christ by the Spirit**
    - The Spirit’s baptism unites believers to **Christ** and incorporates them into the **body of Christ**.
    - This union is spiritual, invisible, and effected by faith through the Spirit’s inward work.
    - Water baptism signifies and seals this spiritual reality, but does not confer it ex opere operato.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the common privilege of all true believers.
    - "By one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, which is the mystical union of the church with Christ." (Institutes, XVIII.xi.9)

4. **Regeneration and Sanctification as the Spirit’s Ordinary Work**
    - The Spirit’s primary ongoing ministry is to regenerate, sanctify, and preserve believers.
    - Turretin emphasizes the Spirit’s role in applying the benefits of **redemption**.
    - The fruits of the Spirit, not miraculous gifts, are the marks of true Christian life.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are the Spirit’s ordinary evidences.
    - "The Spirit’s work is chiefly seen in the renewal of the heart and the production of spiritual fruit." (Institutes, XV.ix.6)

5. **Scripture as the Sufficient Rule**
    - The **canon of Scripture** is closed; new revelations or Spirit-baptisms are unnecessary and dangerous.
    - The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from it, to bring about faith and obedience.
    - Turretin upholds the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture for all matters of faith and practice.
    - Claims to new Spirit-baptisms undermine the finality of the apostolic witness.
    - "The Spirit does not lead us beyond the Word, but always in and with the Word." (Institutes, II.xvii.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinctions regarding the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** shaped later **Reformed confessional theology**, especially in its polemic against Pentecostal and charismatic movements. His insistence on the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the cessation of extraordinary gifts became foundational for subsequent Reformed orthodoxy. Turretin’s influence endures in debates about the nature of the Spirit’s work, the marks of true Christian experience, and the boundaries of **normative ecclesiology**.
