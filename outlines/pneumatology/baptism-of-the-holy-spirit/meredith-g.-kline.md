# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** within the broader framework of **covenant theology** and **redemptive history**, emphasizing its role in inaugurating the **new covenant** and empowering the church for mission. He understood the baptism of the Spirit as a definitive, eschatological event tied to **Pentecost**, marking the transition from the old to the new age and the outpouring of the Spirit upon all God's people. Kline rejected any notion of a two-stage Christian experience, instead rooting the baptism of the Spirit in the once-for-all accomplishment of Christ.

- "The Pentecostal outpouring of the Spirit was the definitive, covenantal baptism that inaugurated the new age of the Spirit." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Baptism of the Spirit as Eschatological Event**
    - The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a redemptive-historical event, not a repeated individual experience.
    - It marks the inauguration of the **new covenant** and the arrival of the **age of the Spirit**.
    - Pentecost is the climactic fulfillment of Old Testament promises regarding the outpouring of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s baptism is corporate, embracing the whole covenant community.
    - "Pentecost was the once-for-all, epochal baptism of the Spirit, not a pattern for subsequent individual experience." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Context of Spirit Baptism**
    - Spirit baptism is inseparable from the establishment of the new covenant.
    - The outpouring of the Spirit fulfills the covenant promises made to Abraham and the prophets.
    - Baptism of the Spirit is the sign of the transition from the old to the new administration of God’s kingdom.
    - It signifies the full realization of God’s presence among his people.
    - "The Spirit’s coming at Pentecost was the ratification of the new covenant order." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Rejection of a Two-Tiered Christian Experience**
    - Kline opposes the idea that Spirit baptism is a post-conversion, second blessing.
    - All believers participate in the baptism of the Spirit by virtue of union with Christ.
    - There is no biblical warrant for dividing Christians into those with or without the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is a definitive gift, not a subsequent attainment.
    - "The New Testament knows nothing of a Christian who has not received the Spirit." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment in Redemptive History**
    - Old Testament types (e.g., the cloud, anointing oil) prefigure the outpouring of the Spirit.
    - Pentecost fulfills these typological anticipations in a climactic, once-for-all manner.
    - The Spirit’s baptism is the antitype, bringing the reality foreshadowed in Israel’s history.
    - Kline’s typological method highlights the unity of Scripture’s redemptive message.
    - "The typological symbols of the Spirit find their fulfillment in the Pentecostal event." (Images of the Spirit)

5. **Sacramental Implications**
    - Water baptism signifies and seals the benefits of Spirit baptism, but does not effect it.
    - The outward sign points to the inward reality accomplished by Christ and applied by the Spirit.
    - The sacraments are covenantal oaths, not magical rites.
    - Spirit baptism is the substance, while water baptism is the sign.
    - "Baptism with water is the sign of the Spirit’s covenantal baptism, not its cause." (By Oath Consigned)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s articulation of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has shaped Reformed understanding of Pentecost and the new covenant, emphasizing the unity of redemptive history and the corporate nature of the Spirit’s work. His rejection of a two-stage experience has influenced Reformed critiques of Pentecostal and charismatic theology. Kline’s covenantal and typological approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between **sacrament** and **Spirit**, and his work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate biblical theology with systematic reflection.
