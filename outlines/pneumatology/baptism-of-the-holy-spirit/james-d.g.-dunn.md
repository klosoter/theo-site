# James D.G. Dunn (1939–2020)

James D.G. Dunn is renowned for his influential re-examination of the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** within the context of early Christian experience. Dunn argued that **Spirit-baptism** in the New Testament is not a "second blessing" after conversion, but rather is synonymous with **Christian initiation**—the reception of the **Holy Spirit** at conversion, marking entry into the **body of Christ**.

- "Baptism in the Spirit is not an extra or second blessing, but the essential Christian experience." ("Baptism in the Holy Spirit")

## Key Works

- Baptism in the Holy Spirit (1970)
- Jesus and the Spirit (1975)
- The Theology of Paul the Apostle (1998)
- Unity and Diversity in the New Testament (1977)
- The Acts of the Apostles (Epworth Commentaries, 1996)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit-Baptism as Initiation**
    - Argues that **baptism in the Holy Spirit** is the defining act of becoming a Christian.
    - Rejects the Pentecostal/Charismatic view of Spirit-baptism as a post-conversion experience.
    - Emphasizes the unity of **conversion, water baptism, and Spirit reception** in the New Testament.
    - Sees Spirit-baptism as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises of the **new covenant**.
    - "The gift of the Spirit is the mark of the Christian from the beginning." (Baptism in the Holy Spirit)

2. **Experiential Dimension of Conversion**
    - Stresses that **receiving the Spirit** is an experiential reality, not merely a doctrinal affirmation.
    - Highlights the transformative and empowering aspects of the Spirit in early Christian life.
    - Connects **Spirit-baptism** with assurance, boldness, and new ethical orientation.
    - Argues that early Christians expected tangible evidence of the Spirit’s presence.
    - "The experience of the Spirit was the decisive factor in Christian self-understanding." (Baptism in the Holy Spirit)

3. **Critique of Subsequent Blessing Theology**
    - Challenges the idea of a normative gap between conversion and **Spirit-baptism**.
    - Asserts that New Testament narratives do not support a two-stage pattern.
    - Examines passages in Acts and Paul to show **Spirit reception** is integral to conversion.
    - Warns against doctrinal formulations that create unnecessary divisions among Christians.
    - "There is no evidence that the New Testament church knew of Christians who had not received the Spirit." (Baptism in the Holy Spirit)

4. **Integration of Pauline and Lukan Perspectives**
    - Seeks to harmonize **Pauline** and **Lukan** accounts of the Spirit’s work.
    - Argues both traditions present **Spirit-baptism** as central to Christian identity.
    - Notes differences in literary emphasis but insists on underlying theological unity.
    - Uses careful exegesis to bridge perceived gaps between Acts and the Epistles.
    - "Paul and Luke are at one in regarding the gift of the Spirit as the essential element in becoming a Christian." (Baptism in the Holy Spirit)

5. **Eschatological and Ecclesial Significance**
    - Interprets **Spirit-baptism** as the inauguration of the **eschatological age**.
    - Connects the gift of the Spirit to the formation of the **new covenant community**.
    - Sees the Spirit as both the sign and means of participation in the **body of Christ**.
    - Emphasizes the communal and missional dimensions of Spirit-empowered life.
    - "The Spirit is the bond which unites the believer to Christ and to the community of the new age." (Jesus and the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Dunn’s work on the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** has profoundly shaped modern scholarship on the doctrine of the Spirit, especially in relation to **conversion** and **Christian initiation**. His arguments have challenged both Pentecostal and traditional Reformed paradigms, prompting renewed attention to the biblical data. Dunn’s careful exegesis and ecumenical sensitivity have made his views a standard reference point in debates about the role of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the church.
