# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos affirmed the full **personhood** and **deity** of the Holy Spirit within the framework of **Trinitarian theology**. He emphasized the Spirit’s distinct **personal subsistence**, co-equality with the Father and the Son, and active role in **revelation** and **redemption** throughout redemptive history.

- "The Holy Spirit is not a mere power or influence, but a personal agent, coequal with the Father and the Son." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Holy Spirit (article)
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus (relevant sections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit as True Person**
    - The Spirit possesses intellect, will, and affections, distinguishing Him from impersonal forces.
    - Scripture attributes personal acts (teaching, guiding, interceding) to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is addressed and responds as a person in biblical revelation.
    - Vos rejects any reduction of the Spirit to an impersonal divine energy.
    - "The Holy Spirit is everywhere represented as a person in the highest sense of the word." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Full Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit shares all divine attributes with the Father and the Son.
    - He is involved in creation, providence, and redemption as God.
    - Worship and glory are ascribed to the Spirit alongside the other divine persons.
    - Vos upholds the Nicene formulation of the Spirit’s deity.
    - "The Spirit is not a creature, but truly God, proceeding from the Father and the Son." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Distinct Personal Subsistence**
    - The Spirit is not simply a mode or manifestation of God, but a distinct hypostasis.
    - Vos affirms the Spirit’s eternal procession from the Father and the Son (**Filioque**).
    - The Spirit’s personal properties are distinguished from those of the Father and the Son.
    - He maintains the unity of essence while distinguishing the persons.
    - "The distinction of persons in the Trinity is real and not merely nominal." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Role in Revelation and Redemption**
    - The Spirit inspires **Scripture** and enables its proper interpretation.
    - He applies the work of Christ to believers, effecting **regeneration** and **sanctification**.
    - The Spirit is active in both Old and New Testament economies.
    - Vos highlights the Spirit’s role in the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - "The Spirit is the great agent of revelation and redemption in all ages." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Pneumatology within Redemptive History**
    - Vos situates the doctrine of the Spirit within the progressive revelation of God’s plan.
    - He traces the increasing clarity of the Spirit’s person and work from Old to New Testament.
    - The outpouring at Pentecost marks a climactic stage in the Spirit’s redemptive activity.
    - Vos connects the Spirit’s work to the eschatological fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The history of redemption is, in a real sense, the history of the Spirit’s work." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of **Trinitarian theology**. His biblical-theological method highlighted the Spirit’s role across the unfolding of redemptive history, influencing generations of scholars at Westminster and beyond. Vos’s careful distinction of the Spirit’s personhood and deity remains a standard in systematic and biblical theology.
