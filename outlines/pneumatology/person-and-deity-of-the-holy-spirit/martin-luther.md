# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **full deity and personhood of the Holy Spirit** within the **Trinitarian** framework, emphasizing the Spirit's role in **justification**, **sanctification**, and the application of Christ's work to believers. He insisted that the Holy Spirit is not a mere force or influence but a true divine person, coequal with the **Father and the Son**, who works through the **Word** and **sacraments** to create and sustain faith.

- "We must think of the Holy Spirit as true God, consubstantial and coeternal with the Father and the Son." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- The Large Catechism (especially the section on the Third Article of the Creed)
- The Small Catechism
- Lectures on Galatians
- Sermons on John 14–16
- The Bondage of the Will

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is True God**
    - The Holy Spirit is fully divine, sharing the same **essence** as the Father and the Son.
    - Luther rejects any subordinationism or denial of the Spirit's deity.
    - The Spirit is worshiped and glorified together with the other persons of the Trinity.
    - The Spirit's divine works—such as creation, sanctification, and giving life—demonstrate His deity.
    - "He is of one divine essence with the Father and the Son." (Large Catechism)

2. **The Holy Spirit is a Distinct Person**
    - The Spirit is not an impersonal force but a personal agent within the Godhead.
    - The Spirit speaks, teaches, calls, and sanctifies, displaying personal attributes.
    - Luther emphasizes the Spirit's distinct role in the **economy of salvation**.
    - The Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son, yet remains fully God.
    - "He is called a person who sanctifies us through the Word." (Large Catechism)

3. **The Spirit’s Role in Justification and Faith**
    - The Spirit creates faith in the hearts of believers through the proclamation of the **Gospel**.
    - Justification is impossible without the Spirit’s regenerating work.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to individuals.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s testimony.
    - "I believe that by my own reason or strength I cannot believe in Jesus Christ... but the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel." (Small Catechism)

4. **The Spirit Works Through Means**
    - The Spirit operates through the **Word** and **sacraments** as His chosen instruments.
    - Luther opposes enthusiasm (Schwärmerei) that seeks the Spirit apart from external means.
    - The Spirit’s presence is promised where the Gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments administered.
    - The Spirit’s work is always tied to Christ and His promises.
    - "For where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Spirit who creates, calls, and gathers the Christian church." (Large Catechism)

5. **The Spirit’s Role in Sanctification and the Church**
    - The Spirit sanctifies believers, enabling them to live in obedience and love.
    - The Spirit gathers and preserves the **communion of saints**.
    - Growth in holiness is attributed to the ongoing work of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and to one another in the church.
    - "The Holy Spirit effects our sanctification by the Christian church, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** shaped Protestant understandings of the Trinity and the Spirit’s role in salvation. His insistence on the Spirit’s work through the **Word and sacraments** countered both medieval sacramentalism and radical spiritualism. Luther’s teaching continues to influence Lutheran and broader Protestant theology, especially regarding the Spirit’s role in **justification**, **sanctification**, and the life of the church.
