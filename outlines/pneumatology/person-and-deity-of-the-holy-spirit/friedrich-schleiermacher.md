# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** through the lens of **religious experience** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**. He reinterpreted traditional **Trinitarian** categories, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in mediating the communal life of the **church** and the ongoing presence of **God-consciousness** rather than focusing on the Spirit’s distinct personal subsistence or ontological deity.

- "The Spirit is the common spirit of the Christian community, the spirit of Christ Himself, present and active in the Church." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Works

- "The Christian Faith" (Der christliche Glaube)
- "Brief Outline of the Study of Theology"
- "On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers"
- "Christmas Eve: Dialogue on the Incarnation"
- Albrecht Ritschl, "A Critical History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation" (secondary, for context on Schleiermacher’s pneumatology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit as the Principle of Christian Community**
    - The Holy Spirit is primarily understood as the unifying principle within the **church**.
    - The Spirit actualizes the **God-consciousness** in believers collectively.
    - Schleiermacher downplays the Spirit’s distinct **personhood** in favor of communal presence.
    - The Spirit is inseparable from the life and experience of the Christian community.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the spirit of the community, in so far as it is determined by the common God-consciousness." ("The Christian Faith")

2. **Rejection of Classical Trinitarian Personhood**
    - Schleiermacher challenges the traditional notion of the Spirit as a distinct **hypostasis**.
    - He views the Trinity as a symbolic expression of religious experience rather than ontological reality.
    - The Spirit is not a separate person but the mode of God’s presence in the church.
    - This approach leads to a functional rather than ontological understanding of the Spirit.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is not an immediate utterance of the Christian self-consciousness." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Spirit’s Deity as Functional, Not Ontological**
    - Schleiermacher affirms the **deity** of the Spirit in terms of divine activity, not essence.
    - The Spirit is divine insofar as it mediates the presence of God in the community.
    - He avoids metaphysical speculation about the Spirit’s being.
    - The Spirit’s divinity is experienced rather than defined.
    - "The divine essence is not divided, but the Spirit is the Godhead as operative in the Church." ("The Christian Faith")

4. **Mediation of God-Consciousness**
    - The Spirit is the means by which **God-consciousness** is awakened and sustained.
    - This mediation is central to Schleiermacher’s understanding of **salvation** and religious life.
    - The Spirit’s work is primarily inward and experiential.
    - The Spirit enables the believer’s participation in Christ’s relationship to God.
    - "The Spirit is the communication of the God-consciousness which was in Christ to the community." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Christocentric Pneumatology**
    - The Holy Spirit is inseparable from the **person and work of Christ**.
    - The Spirit is described as the "Spirit of Christ" rather than an independent agent.
    - The Spirit’s activity is to reproduce Christ’s God-consciousness in believers.
    - The Spirit’s role is subordinate to and dependent on Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "The Holy Spirit is nothing other than the influence of the exalted Christ, continuing in the Church." ("The Christian Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** marked a decisive shift toward a **subjective, experiential, and communal** understanding of pneumatology. His reinterpretation of the Trinity and the Spirit’s personhood influenced modern liberal theology, diminishing the emphasis on ontological distinctions within the Godhead. While his views have been critiqued for undermining classical **Trinitarian doctrine**, they have also shaped ongoing discussions about the Spirit’s role in religious experience and the life of the church.
