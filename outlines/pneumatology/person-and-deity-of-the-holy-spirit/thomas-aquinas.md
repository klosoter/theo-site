# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas robustly affirms the **personhood** and **deity** of the Holy Spirit within the framework of **Trinitarian theology**. He argues that the Holy Spirit is truly **God**, consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and proceeds from both as a distinct **divine person** whose proper name is "Love" or "Gift."

- "The Holy Ghost is true God, and of one substance with the Father and the Son." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Part I, Questions 36–38
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 16–24
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I, Distinctions 10–19
- De potentia Dei, Questions 9–10

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is a Distinct Divine Person**
    - The Holy Spirit is not merely a force or attribute but a true person within the **Trinity**.
    - Personhood is established by the Spirit’s unique mode of **origin** (spiration).
    - The Spirit is distinguished from the Father and the Son by relation, not by essence.
    - The Spirit’s personal property is to proceed as **Love** from both the Father and the Son.
    - "The Holy Ghost is distinguished from the other Persons by His procession as Love." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.2)

2. **The Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit possesses the **divine essence** fully and equally with the Father and the Son.
    - Scriptural testimony and creedal tradition affirm the Spirit’s full **Godhead**.
    - The Spirit is the principle of **sanctification** and life, acts proper only to God.
    - The Spirit is to be worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son.
    - "The Holy Ghost is true God, and of one substance with the Father and the Son." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.1)

3. **Procession of the Holy Spirit (Filioque)**
    - The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from a single principle.
    - This procession is termed **spiration**, distinct from generation.
    - The Filioque is defended as consistent with the unity of the divine essence.
    - The Spirit’s procession is the foundation for His personal distinction.
    - "The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from one principle." (Summa Theologiae I, q.36, a.4)

4. **The Holy Spirit as Love and Gift**
    - The Spirit’s proper name is **Love**, signifying His role in the divine life.
    - The Spirit is also called **Gift**, as He is given to believers and perfects them in charity.
    - The Spirit’s mission is to unite the Church and indwell believers.
    - The Spirit’s work is the outpouring of divine love in the economy of salvation.
    - "The Holy Ghost is called Love, and Gift, because He proceeds by way of love." (Summa Theologiae I, q.38, a.1)

5. **Economic and Immanent Missions of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit’s **immanent procession** grounds His economic mission in history.
    - The Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son to sanctify and indwell the faithful.
    - The economic mission reveals the Spirit’s personhood and deity in the world.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the principle of unity and holiness in the Church.
    - "The invisible mission consists in the new manner in which God is in the creature." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** became foundational for Western **Trinitarian theology**, especially in the Roman Catholic tradition. His defense of the **Filioque** and the Spirit’s consubstantiality with the Father and Son shaped later doctrinal formulations and ecumenical dialogues. Aquinas’s synthesis of patristic sources and philosophical reasoning continues to influence systematic theology, particularly in discussions of **Trinitarian relations** and pneumatology.
