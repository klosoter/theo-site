## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s robust articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has reinforced classical Reformed Trinitarianism for contemporary audiences. His integration of the Spirit’s work in **revelation**, **redemption**, and **hermeneutics** has influenced evangelical theology and biblical interpretation. By emphasizing the Spirit’s personal and divine agency, Poythress has contributed to a deeper appreciation of the Spirit’s role in the life of the church and the believer.
