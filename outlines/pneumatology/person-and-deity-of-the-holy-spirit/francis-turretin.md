# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin robustly defended the **personhood** and **deity of the Holy Spirit** within the framework of **classical Reformed orthodoxy**. He argued that the Holy Spirit is fully **God**, consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and a distinct **person** in the **Trinity**, opposing both Socinian and Pneumatomachian denials. Turretin’s careful distinctions and exegetical rigor shaped later Reformed treatments of the Spirit’s divinity and personal subsistence.

- "The Holy Spirit is proved to be a true person, not a mere power or quality, and truly God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.29.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Third Topic, Questions 29–31)
- Compendium Theologiae Didacticae
- Selected disputations on the Trinity and the Holy Spirit
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is a Distinct Person**
    - The Spirit possesses personal properties, such as will, understanding, and action.
    - Scripture attributes personal acts (teaching, sending, interceding) to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is distinguished from the Father and the Son in the economy of salvation.
    - Turretin rejects any reduction of the Spirit to an impersonal force or attribute.
    - "The Spirit is not a mere energy or quality, but a subsisting person in the Godhead." (Institutes 3.29.2)

2. **The Holy Spirit is True God**
    - The Spirit shares the same **essence** as the Father and the Son.
    - Divine names and attributes are ascribed to the Spirit in Scripture.
    - The Spirit is involved in divine works (creation, regeneration, sanctification).
    - Worship and glory are due to the Spirit equally with the other persons.
    - "The Spirit is proved to be God from the divine works and worship ascribed to him." (Institutes 3.29.5)

3. **Procession of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (**Filioque**), not by creation or mission, but by eternal procession.
    - Turretin upholds the Western doctrine of the double procession against Eastern objections.
    - This procession is a mode of subsistence, not a temporal act.
    - The Spirit’s procession is foundational for distinguishing the persons within the Trinity.
    - "The Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, as from one principle." (Institutes 3.29.8)

4. **Opposition to Heresies**
    - Turretin refutes **Socinian** and **Pneumatomachian** denials of the Spirit’s deity and personhood.
    - He marshals biblical and patristic evidence to counter these errors.
    - The denial of the Spirit’s deity undermines the doctrine of the Trinity and the work of redemption.
    - He insists on the necessity of the Spirit’s divinity for the efficacy of sanctification.
    - "The Socinians err grievously in making the Spirit a mere power of God." (Institutes 3.29.4)

5. **Role of the Spirit in Salvation**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **redemption** to believers.
    - Regeneration, sanctification, and assurance are works uniquely attributed to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s divine personhood ensures the efficacy and certainty of these works.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the seal and guarantee of union with Christ.
    - "The Spirit is the author of regeneration and sanctification, which are divine works." (Institutes 3.29.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** became a standard in Reformed scholastic theology, shaping confessional statements and later systematic works. His careful distinctions and polemical clarity provided resources for combating anti-Trinitarian movements. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of the **Trinity** and the Spirit’s role in salvation, especially within confessional Reformed traditions.
