# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray upheld the full **personhood** and **deity of the Holy Spirit** as essential to orthodox **Trinitarian theology**. He emphasized the Spirit’s distinct personal subsistence within the **Godhead**, affirming both the Spirit’s role in **redemption** and His equality with the Father and the Son.

- "The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal energy or influence but a distinct person in the Godhead, coequal with the Father and the Son." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Christian Baptism"
- "The Holy Spirit" (article in The Evangelical Quarterly)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person**
    - The Spirit possesses all attributes of **personhood**: intellect, will, and emotion.
    - Scripture ascribes personal actions and relationships to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is not a mere force or emanation from God.
    - The Spirit is addressed and acts as "He," not "it."
    - "The Holy Spirit is a person, not a mere influence or power." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Full Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit shares the same **divine essence** as the Father and the Son.
    - Biblical texts attribute divine works (creation, regeneration) to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is worshipped and glorified alongside the other persons of the Trinity.
    - Denial of the Spirit’s deity undermines the doctrine of the **Trinity**.
    - "The Holy Spirit is truly and eternally God, of one substance with the Father and the Son." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

3. **Distinct Personal Subsistence**
    - The Spirit is distinguished by His unique mode of subsistence: **procession** from the Father and the Son.
    - The Spirit’s personal properties are not interchangeable with those of the Father or the Son.
    - The Spirit’s work in **redemption** is distinct yet inseparable from the other persons.
    - The Spirit’s personal identity is maintained in all intra-Trinitarian relations.
    - "The Holy Spirit is eternally distinct as the third person of the Godhead." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

4. **The Spirit’s Role in Redemption**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **Christ’s work** to believers.
    - Regeneration, sanctification, and assurance are all works of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit indwells and empowers the church and individual believers.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for the realization of salvation.
    - "Without the Holy Spirit, the redemption accomplished by Christ would never be applied." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Biblical Foundation for Pneumatology**
    - Murray grounds his doctrine of the Spirit in careful exegesis of Scripture.
    - He highlights both Old and New Testament witness to the Spirit’s person and deity.
    - He rejects speculative or philosophical approaches not rooted in biblical revelation.
    - The Spirit’s identity and work are discerned from the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - "Our doctrine of the Holy Spirit must be derived from the witness of Scripture alone." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of **Trinitarian theology**. His careful exegesis and insistence on biblical foundations have influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Murray’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a clear, orthodox articulation of the Spirit’s identity and role within the Godhead.
