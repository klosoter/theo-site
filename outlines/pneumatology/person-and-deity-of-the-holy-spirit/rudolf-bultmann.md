# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He did not emphasize the traditional **Trinitarian** or **ontological** categories but rather understood the Holy Spirit as the mode of God's self-disclosure in the **kerygma** and in the existential encounter of faith.

- "The Spirit is not a substance but the power of God at work in the proclamation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (especially Vol. 1)
- New Testament and Mythology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Essays Philosophical and Theological
- Faith and Understanding

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Spirit Language**
    - The Holy Spirit is not a distinct metaphysical person but a symbol for God's presence.
    - Spirit language in the New Testament must be interpreted existentially, not ontologically.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical terms.
    - The Spirit is the mode in which God addresses the individual through the proclamation.
    - "The Spirit is not a supernatural being but the power of the kerygma." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Encounter over Ontology**
    - The reality of the Holy Spirit is experienced in the individual's response to the gospel.
    - Bultmann rejects metaphysical speculation about the Spirit's personhood or deity.
    - The Spirit is the event of faith, not a hypostasis within the Godhead.
    - The focus is on the transformation of existence, not on Trinitarian relations.
    - "The Spirit is the power that makes the proclamation effective for faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Kerygma as the Locus of the Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is present wherever the kerygma is proclaimed and received.
    - The Spirit's work is inseparable from the Word preached.
    - The Spirit is not an independent agent but the dynamic of God's address in the gospel.
    - Faith is awakened by the Spirit through the existential call of the kerygma.
    - "Where the word is proclaimed, there is the Spirit." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Classical Trinitarian Formulations**
    - Bultmann does not affirm the traditional doctrine of the Trinity as ontological reality.
    - Trinitarian language is seen as mythological and in need of existential reinterpretation.
    - The Spirit is not a 'person' in the Nicene sense but a mode of God's action.
    - The unity of God is preserved by avoiding hypostatic distinctions.
    - "The New Testament does not know the dogma of the Trinity in the later sense." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Spirit as Eschatological Power**
    - The Holy Spirit is the power of the new age breaking into human existence.
    - The Spirit signifies the eschatological reality made present in faith.
    - The Spirit's deity is not a metaphysical status but the manifestation of God's eschatological act.
    - The Spirit brings about the new life and freedom anticipated in the gospel.
    - "The Spirit is the power of the eschatological event in the present." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to the **Holy Spirit** profoundly shaped modern theological discussions by shifting focus from metaphysical speculation to existential interpretation. His demythologizing method challenged traditional **Trinitarian** and **pneumatological** formulations, influencing both New Testament scholarship and systematic theology. While many have critiqued his reduction of the Spirit to existential experience, his work remains a pivotal reference point for debates on the interpretation of biblical language about the Spirit.
