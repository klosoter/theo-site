## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s robust articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has shaped modern Reformed dogmatics, especially in the areas of **Trinitarian theology** and pneumatology. His careful engagement with both biblical exegesis and historical theology provided a mediating voice between traditional orthodoxy and contemporary challenges. Berkouwer’s influence endures in ongoing discussions about the Spirit’s role in revelation, salvation, and the life of the church. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded and theologically nuanced understanding of the Holy Spirit.
