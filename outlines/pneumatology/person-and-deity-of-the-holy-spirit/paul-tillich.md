# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** through his distinctive method of **correlation**, interpreting the Spirit as the divine presence that actualizes the **New Being** within the existential situation of humanity. Rather than emphasizing the traditional **Trinitarian personhood** of the Spirit, Tillich saw the Holy Spirit as the dynamic power of **God’s self-manifestation**, mediating the unity of the divine life with the world and the community of the church.

- "The Spirit is the presence of God here and now, creating the community in which the New Being is manifest." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- "The Protestant Era"
- "The Courage to Be"
- "A History of Christian Thought"
- "Dynamics of Faith"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit as Divine Presence**
   - The Holy Spirit is not a separate hypostasis but the presence of God actualized in history.
   - The Spirit is experienced as the power of **New Being** within the existential situation.
   - The Spirit mediates the relationship between God and the world, especially in the context of the church.
   - The Spirit is the dynamic ground of unity and community.
   - "The Spirit is God present to us, creating the community of the New Being." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

2. **Rejection of Substantial Personhood**
   - Tillich critiques the classical notion of the Spirit as a distinct "person" in the **Trinitarian** sense.
   - He interprets "person" symbolically, as a mode of divine self-manifestation.
   - The Spirit is not an individual subject but the divine power manifest in life and history.
   - This approach avoids tritheism and emphasizes the unity of God.
   - "The term 'person' must be understood symbolically when applied to the Spirit." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Spirit and the New Being**
   - The Holy Spirit is the power that actualizes the **New Being** in Christ within individuals and communities.
   - The Spirit transforms existence by overcoming estrangement and enabling participation in divine life.
   - The Spirit is the agent of reconciliation and healing.
   - The Spirit’s work is most evident in the creation of the church as the community of the New Being.
   - "The Spirit is the power of the New Being, actualizing itself in history." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

4. **Spirit as the Principle of Life and Unity**
   - The Spirit is the principle of life, creativity, and unity in all reality.
   - The Spirit unites the divine and human, the sacred and secular, the individual and community.
   - The Spirit is the ground of all spiritual experience and the source of ecstasy and inspiration.
   - The Spirit’s presence is universal, not limited to the church.
   - "The Spirit is the creative and uniting power in all life." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

5. **Symbolic and Existential Interpretation**
   - Tillich insists that all language about the Spirit is **symbolic** and points beyond itself.
   - The Spirit is encountered existentially, not as an object of doctrinal definition.
   - The reality of the Spirit is grasped in the experience of transformation, community, and courage.
   - The doctrine of the Spirit must be correlated with the existential questions of meaning and being.
   - "All statements about the Spirit are symbolic expressions of the experience of God’s presence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of the **Holy Spirit** challenged traditional Trinitarian formulations by emphasizing existential experience and symbolic language over metaphysical definitions. His approach influenced later **liberal theology**, ecumenical discussions, and philosophical theology, particularly in how the Spirit is understood as the dynamic presence of God in history and community. While his views have been critiqued for undermining the personal distinctiveness of the Spirit, Tillich’s work remains a significant resource for those seeking to relate classical doctrine to modern existential concerns.
