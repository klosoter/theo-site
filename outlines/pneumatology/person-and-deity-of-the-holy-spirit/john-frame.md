# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the full **personhood** and **deity** of the **Holy Spirit** within the framework of **Trinitarian orthodoxy**. He emphasizes the Spirit’s role as a distinct **divine person** who is coequal with the **Father** and **Son**, and who actively applies **redemption** to believers.

- "The Spirit is not merely a force or influence, but a person who is fully God, sharing all the attributes of deity." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person**
    - The Spirit possesses personal attributes such as will, intellect, and emotion.
    - Scripture refers to the Spirit with personal pronouns and relational language.
    - The Spirit acts in ways only a person can: teaching, guiding, interceding.
    - The Spirit is distinguished from the Father and the Son, yet united in essence.
    - "The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal power, but a person who relates to us and to the other persons of the Trinity." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Full Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit is included in the baptismal formula alongside the Father and Son.
    - Divine attributes—such as omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence—are ascribed to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is involved in creation, providence, and redemption.
    - Worship and prayer are offered to the Spirit, indicating His divinity.
    - "The Spirit is fully God, not a lesser being or a created entity." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - The Spirit’s role in the economy of salvation is distinct but inseparable from the Father and Son.
    - Frame affirms the classic distinction between the ontological (immanent) and economic Trinity.
    - The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, in line with Western Trinitarian theology.
    - The unity of the Godhead is preserved without collapsing the persons.
    - "The Spirit’s work in redemption reflects his eternal relationship within the Trinity." (The Doctrine of God)

4. **The Spirit’s Role in Revelation and Redemption**
    - The Spirit inspires Scripture and illumines its meaning to believers.
    - Regeneration, sanctification, and assurance are works of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - The Spirit empowers the church for mission and service.
    - "Without the Spirit, there is no application of redemption to the believer." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal Lordship and the Spirit**
    - Frame’s tri-perspectivalism sees the Spirit as essential to God’s lordship: authority, control, and presence.
    - The Spirit manifests God’s presence among His people.
    - The Spirit’s work is covenantal, binding believers to Christ and to one another.
    - The Spirit’s lordship is both transcendent and immanent in the life of the church.
    - "The Spirit is the presence of God himself, covenantally binding us to him." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his integration of **tri-perspectivalism** and covenantal categories. His work has helped clarify the Spirit’s personal and divine status against both reductionist and modalist tendencies. Frame’s accessible yet rigorous approach has shaped seminary curricula and provided pastors with a clear framework for teaching on the Holy Spirit.
