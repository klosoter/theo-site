# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen robustly defended the **personhood** and **deity of the Holy Spirit** within the framework of **Trinitarian orthodoxy**. He argued that the Spirit is not a mere power or influence but a distinct **divine person**, fully sharing in the **essence of God** and actively involved in all aspects of **redemption** and **sanctification**.

- "The Holy Spirit is not a quality, not an emanation, not an energy, not an attribute, but a holy, intelligent, voluntary, subsistent person." ("The Works of John Owen," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- "The Work of the Holy Spirit" (Volume 3 of The Works of John Owen)
- "A Discourse Concerning the Holy Spirit"
- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed"
- "Theologoumena Pantodapa" (Biblical Theology)
- Sinclair Ferguson, "John Owen on the Christian Life: Living for the Glory of God in Christ" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit as a Distinct Divine Person**
    - The Spirit possesses **intellect, will, and affections**, demonstrating true personality.
    - Scripture attributes personal actions (teaching, guiding, comforting) to the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is distinguished from the Father and the Son, yet fully God.
    - Denial of the Spirit’s personhood undermines the doctrine of the Trinity.
    - "He to whom all personal properties, attributes, adjuncts, acts, and operations are ascribed, is a person, and so is the Holy Ghost." ("The Work of the Holy Spirit")

2. **Full Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit shares the **same divine essence** as the Father and the Son.
    - Divine names and titles are ascribed to the Spirit in Scripture.
    - The Spirit performs works that only God can do (creation, regeneration, sanctification).
    - Worship and prayer are properly directed to the Spirit as God.
    - "The Holy Spirit is called God, and all divine perfections are ascribed unto him." ("The Work of the Holy Spirit")

3. **Role of the Spirit in Revelation and Inspiration**
    - The Spirit is the primary agent in the **inspiration of Scripture**.
    - Prophets and apostles spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Spirit enables understanding and illumination of divine truth.
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in the Spirit’s authorship.
    - "The Holy Ghost is the immediate author of all divine revelation." ("The Work of the Holy Spirit")

4. **The Spirit’s Work in Redemption and Sanctification**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **Christ’s redemption** to believers.
    - Regeneration, faith, and sanctification are wrought by the Spirit’s power.
    - The Spirit indwells and transforms the believer into Christ’s likeness.
    - Assurance and perseverance are maintained by the Spirit’s presence.
    - "All the gracious actings of God towards us, and all communion with him, are by the Holy Ghost." ("The Work of the Holy Spirit")

5. **Opposition to Socinian and Pneumatomachian Errors**
    - Owen refuted denials of the Spirit’s deity and personhood as heretical.
    - He engaged contemporary challenges to orthodox **Trinitarianism**.
    - Emphasized the necessity of the Spirit’s deity for the efficacy of salvation.
    - Warned that undermining the Spirit leads to a collapse of Christian doctrine.
    - "Where the Holy Spirit is denied, there neither Father nor Son is rightly believed." ("The Work of the Holy Spirit")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s defense of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** became a cornerstone for later Reformed and evangelical pneumatology. His exhaustive biblical and theological arguments shaped the confessional standards of the **Westminster Assembly** and influenced generations of theologians. Owen’s work remains a primary resource for understanding the **Trinitarian** doctrine of the Spirit, especially in response to anti-Trinitarian movements. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the Spirit’s full divinity and personal agency within the life of the church.
