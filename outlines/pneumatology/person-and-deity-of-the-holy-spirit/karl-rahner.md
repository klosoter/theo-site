# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner emphasized the **full personhood and deity of the Holy Spirit** within the **Trinitarian mystery**, insisting that the Spirit is not merely a force but truly God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son. He developed a nuanced understanding of the Spirit’s role in **salvation history** and the **immanent Trinity**, integrating the Spirit’s presence in both the Church and the world through his doctrine of the **economic and immanent Trinity**.

- "The Holy Spirit is not merely a divine gift, but God himself, personally present and active in the world." (The Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (Die Trinität)
- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Theological Investigations, Vol. IV: More Recent Writings
- Theological Investigations, Vol. I: God, Christ, Mary and Grace
- Spirit in the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit as True Person**
    - The Holy Spirit is a distinct **hypostasis** within the Trinity, not an impersonal force.
    - Rahner rejects any subordination of the Spirit to the Father or Son.
    - The Spirit possesses full **divine attributes** and is co-equal with the other persons.
    - The Spirit’s personhood is essential for genuine **Trinitarian communion**.
    - "The Holy Spirit is, in the strictest sense, a person in the unity of the divine essence." (The Trinity)

2. **Consubstantiality and Deity of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit shares the same **divine essence** as the Father and the Son.
    - Rahner affirms the **Nicene Creed**’s teaching on the Spirit’s deity.
    - The Spirit is fully God, not a created being or lesser divinity.
    - The Spirit’s deity is revealed in both **salvation history** and the inner life of God.
    - "The Holy Spirit is God in the same sense as the Father and the Son are God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Rahner’s Rule: the **economic Trinity** is the **immanent Trinity**, and vice versa.
    - The Spirit’s actions in history reveal the Spirit’s eternal identity.
    - The Spirit’s presence in the world is a true self-communication of God.
    - The distinction between the Spirit’s mission and eternal procession is maintained, but not separated.
    - "The immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity and the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity." (The Trinity)

4. **Spirit’s Role in Salvation and Revelation**
    - The Spirit is the agent of **grace** and the subjective appropriation of salvation.
    - The Spirit enables human beings to encounter God’s self-communication.
    - The Spirit is active in the Church, sacraments, and the world.
    - The Spirit’s presence is universal, not confined to explicit Christian experience.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the mode in which God’s self-communication becomes real in the world." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Pneumatology and Anthropology**
    - The Spirit grounds the possibility of **transcendental experience** of God.
    - Human openness to God is itself the work of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the basis for Rahner’s concept of the **anonymous Christian**.
    - The Spirit unites humanity to Christ and the Father in the mystery of salvation.
    - "Every experience of grace is an experience of the Holy Spirit." (Theological Investigations IV)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s robust affirmation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has deeply influenced modern Catholic and ecumenical theology, especially in discussions of the **Trinity** and **pneumatology**. His articulation of the relationship between the **economic and immanent Trinity** has become a standard reference point in contemporary Trinitarian thought. Rahner’s work continues to shape theological reflection on the Spirit’s role in revelation, grace, and the Church’s life.
