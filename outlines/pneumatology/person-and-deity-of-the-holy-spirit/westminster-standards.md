# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards affirm the **full deity** and **distinct personhood** of the Holy Spirit within the **Trinity**, emphasizing His role in **inspiration**, **sanctification**, and the application of **redemption**. The Standards uphold the Spirit’s equality with the Father and the Son, insisting on His eternal procession and divine attributes as essential to orthodox **Reformed theology**.

- "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 2 ("Of God, and of the Holy Trinity") and 8 ("Of Christ the Mediator")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 8–11, 36, 42, 58, 59
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 4–6, 24, 29, 31
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on invocation and prayer)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on the application of redemption)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit is True God**
    - The Standards explicitly confess the Holy Spirit as of the same **substance** and **eternity** as the Father and the Son.
    - He possesses all **divine attributes**: omnipotence, omniscience, and immutability.
    - The Spirit is to be worshiped and glorified equally with the other persons of the Trinity.
    - Denial of the Spirit’s deity is considered a fundamental error against the Christian faith.
    - "The Holy Ghost, eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son." (WCF 2.3)

2. **Distinct Personhood of the Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is not merely a force or attribute but a distinct **person** within the Godhead.
    - He is identified by personal actions: speaking, sending, sanctifying, and interceding.
    - The Spirit’s personal subsistence is affirmed in relation to the Father and the Son.
    - The Standards reject modalism and any confusion of the persons.
    - "There be three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory." (WSC Q6)

3. **Eternal Procession of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit is said to **proceed** from the Father and the Son, not made or begotten.
    - This procession is eternal, distinguishing the Spirit’s mode of subsistence.
    - The doctrine safeguards the unity and distinction within the Trinity.
    - The Standards align with the Western (filioque) tradition on procession.
    - "The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WLC Q11)

4. **Role in Inspiration and Revelation**
    - The Holy Spirit is the divine agent of **inspiration** for Scripture.
    - He enables the prophets and apostles to speak and write God’s Word infallibly.
    - The Spirit illuminates the minds of believers to understand the Scriptures.
    - The Standards ground the authority of Scripture in the Spirit’s work.
    - "The Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture." (WCF 1.10)

5. **Application of Redemption**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of **redemption** purchased by Christ to the elect.
    - He regenerates, calls, justifies, sanctifies, and preserves believers.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and indwells them as a seal and guarantee.
    - The Standards emphasize the Spirit’s ongoing work in the life of the church.
    - "The Holy Spirit applieth to us the redemption purchased by Christ." (WSC Q30)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed Trinitarian theology**, providing a robust and enduring articulation of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit**. Their precise formulations have served as doctrinal benchmarks for Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide. By grounding the Spirit’s deity, personhood, and work in Scripture, the Standards continue to inform contemporary discussions on pneumatology and the doctrine of the Trinity.
