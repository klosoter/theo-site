# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til affirmed the full **personhood** and **deity** of the Holy Spirit as essential to the **Trinitarian** doctrine of the **Reformed faith**. He insisted that the Spirit is not a mere force or impersonal power, but the third **person** of the **Godhead**, coequal and coeternal with the Father and the Son, and integral to the **ontological Trinity** and the **economic Trinity**.

- "The Holy Spirit is not a mere influence but a person, coequal with the Father and the Son in the ontological Trinity." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Holy Spirit as True Person**
    - The Spirit possesses self-consciousness, will, and relationality within the Trinity.
    - Van Til rejects any reduction of the Spirit to an impersonal force or abstract principle.
    - The Spirit acts as a distinct agent in **revelation**, **redemption**, and **sanctification**.
    - The Spirit’s personhood is necessary for the coherence of **Trinitarian** theology.
    - "The Holy Spirit is as truly personal as are the Father and the Son." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Full Deity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit shares all divine attributes with the Father and the Son.
    - Van Til upholds the Spirit’s role in creation, providence, and redemption as evidence of deity.
    - The Spirit is to be worshiped and glorified together with the other persons of the Trinity.
    - Denial of the Spirit’s deity undermines the unity and equality of the Godhead.
    - "The Spirit is not less God than the Father or the Son." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Ontological and Economic Trinity**
    - Van Til distinguishes but never separates the **ontological Trinity** (God as He is in Himself) from the **economic Trinity** (God as He reveals Himself).
    - The Spirit’s personhood and deity are equally affirmed in both ontological and economic relations.
    - The Spirit’s work in history reflects His eternal relation within the Godhead.
    - The unity and diversity of the Trinity are foundational for all Christian doctrine.
    - "The ontological Trinity is the presupposition of all meaning and coherence." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Spirit’s Role in Revelation and Redemption**
    - The Spirit is the primary agent in the inspiration and illumination of Scripture.
    - The Spirit applies the work of Christ to believers, effecting regeneration and sanctification.
    - The Spirit’s personal agency ensures the efficacy of revelation and redemption.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the work of the Father and the Son.
    - "Without the Spirit, there would be no revelation, no redemption, no application of salvation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis to Non-Trinitarian Views**
    - Van Til critiques all forms of **Unitarianism**, **modalism**, and **subordinationism** as inconsistent with biblical revelation.
    - He insists that only the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, including the full personhood and deity of the Spirit, provides a sufficient foundation for Christian faith and apologetics.
    - The denial of the Spirit’s deity leads to a collapse of the Christian worldview.
    - The Spirit’s personhood is essential for the relational and covenantal nature of God.
    - "Any view that denies the full deity and personhood of the Spirit is fundamentally anti-Christian." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit** has shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, especially in emphasizing the necessity of a fully **Trinitarian** worldview. His insistence on the Spirit’s role in **revelation** and **redemption** continues to influence contemporary discussions on the doctrine of God. Van Til’s polemics against non-Trinitarian theologies have reinforced the centrality of the Spirit’s personhood and deity in confessional Reformed thought.
