# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity affirm the full **personhood** and **deity** of the Holy Spirit as essential to the doctrine of the **Trinity**. They uphold the Spirit’s co-equality and co-eternity with the **Father** and the **Son**, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the application of **salvation**. The confessions reject any subordination of the Spirit, insisting on His full participation in the divine essence.

- "We believe, in accordance with this truth and the Word of God, in one God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties—namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

    - The Spirit is worshiped and glorified together with the Father and the Son.
    - Any denial of the Spirit’s deity is condemned as heresy.
    "We believe also, and confess, that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son—neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding from the two of them." (Belgic Confession, Art. 11)

2. **The Holy Spirit is a Distinct Person**
    - The Spirit is not merely a force or power, but a personal subsistence within the **Trinity**.
    - The Spirit possesses incommunicable properties distinguishing Him from the Father and the Son.
    - The confessions use personal pronouns and describe personal actions of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s personhood is essential for the application of **redemption**.
    "In this divine being there are three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit." (Belgic Confession, Art. 8)

4. **The Spirit’s Inspiration of Scripture**
    - The confessions affirm that the Holy Spirit is the author of **Holy Scripture**.
    - The Spirit’s inspiration guarantees the authority and infallibility of the biblical text.
    - The Spirit illumines believers to rightly understand and apply Scripture.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is grounded in the Spirit’s work.

    - The unity and communion of saints are attributed to the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - The Spirit equips the church with gifts for edification and mission.
    - The church’s holiness and perseverance are sustained by the Spirit.

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed Trinitarian theology**, providing a clear and robust confession of the **person and deity of the Holy Spirit**. Their articulation of the Spirit’s role in **salvation**, **Scripture**, and the **church** remains foundational for Reformed doctrine and worship. These confessions continue to serve as authoritative standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring doctrinal fidelity regarding the Holy Spirit’s full divinity and personal agency.
