# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. For Bultmann, the **Holy Spirit** is not a supernatural agent acting in history but the mode by which the **kerygma** becomes existentially real to the believer, especially in the proclamation of the **resurrected Christ**. The Spirit’s significance is found in the transformative encounter with the preached Word, rather than in historical or metaphysical events.

- "The resurrection is not an event of past history, but an event of the proclamation in which the risen Lord encounters us." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Kerygma and Myth (1941, with responses)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit is not a supernatural force acting in history but a mythological expression of existential reality.
    - Biblical language about the Spirit must be interpreted existentially, not ontologically.
    - The Spirit’s work is the encounter of the individual with the kerygma.
    - The focus is on the meaning of the Spirit for authentic existence.
    - "It is not the Spirit as a cosmic power, but the Spirit as the power of the Word that matters." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Encounter in Christ’s Ministry**
    - Christ’s ministry is significant as the proclamation of the possibility of authentic existence.
    - The Spirit’s role is to awaken faith through the existential call of Jesus’ message.
    - Miracles and charismatic phenomena are secondary to the existential decision.
    - The Spirit mediates the call to decision, not supernatural acts.
    - "Faith is the gift of the Spirit, which is given in the Word." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Kerygmatic Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is not a historical event but the existential reality of the risen Christ in proclamation.
    - The Spirit actualizes the resurrection in the present encounter with the kerygma.
    - The believer experiences resurrection life through the Spirit’s work in faith.
    - The resurrection is meaningful only as it transforms existence now.
    - "The resurrection is not a miracle but the proclamation of the new possibility of existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Spirit and Eschatological Existence**
    - The Spirit inaugurates eschatological existence in the present.
    - The believer participates in the new age through the Spirit’s call to authentic life.
    - Eschatology is existential, not temporal or cosmic.
    - The Spirit’s role is to make the eschatological reality present in faith.
    - "Eternal life is not a future event but a present reality in the Spirit." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Rejection of Objective Pneumatology**
    - Bultmann denies the Spirit as an objective, metaphysical entity.
    - The Spirit is the mode of God’s self-communication in existential encounter.
    - All talk of the Spirit must be translated into existential categories.
    - The Spirit’s reality is found in the transformation of the self, not in supernatural phenomena.
    - "The Spirit is not an object among other objects, but the power of new existence." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential interpretation of the **Spirit’s role** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection profoundly shaped twentieth-century **New Testament theology** and liberal Protestant thought. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional doctrines and shifted focus to the existential significance of the Spirit for faith and proclamation. While controversial, his approach forced later theologians to grapple with the meaning of the Spirit in a modern, post-Enlightenment context. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between history, faith, and the work of the Spirit.
