# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a robustly **Trinitarian** understanding of the **Spirit’s role** in the person and work of Christ. While not offering an extended dogmatic treatment, these confessions affirm that the **Holy Spirit** is integral to Christ’s **incarnation**, **anointing as Mediator**, and **resurrection**, emphasizing the Spirit’s agency in both Christ’s earthly ministry and the application of redemption.

- "Why is He called 'Christ,' that is, Anointed? Because He is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Ghost, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **Spirit’s role** in the person and work of Christ, particularly in relation to **incarnation**, **anointing**, and **resurrection**. Their concise yet profound statements have provided a confessional anchor for subsequent doctrinal reflection on the Spirit’s agency in Christ’s ministry and in the salvation of believers. These confessions continue to inform Reformed liturgy, catechesis, and theological discourse, ensuring the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in Christology and soteriology.
