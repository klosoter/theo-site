# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos emphasized the integral role of the **Holy Spirit** in the life, ministry, and resurrection of **Christ**, situating this within the broader framework of **redemptive history**. For Vos, the Spirit’s empowering presence is essential for understanding both the **incarnation** and the **eschatological** significance of Christ’s resurrection, as the Spirit mediates the new creation inaugurated in Christ.

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust biblical-theological approach to the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has profoundly shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of **redemptive history**. His insights into the **eschatological** work of the Spirit continue to influence contemporary discussions on union with Christ and the application of redemption. Vos’s integration of exegesis and dogmatics set a standard for theological method, making his work foundational for modern biblical theology.
