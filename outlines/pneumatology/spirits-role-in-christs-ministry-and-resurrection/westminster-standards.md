# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **Holy Spirit**’s work in the **person and work of Christ**, emphasizing the Spirit’s role in the **incarnation**, **anointing**, and **resurrection** of Jesus. The Standards affirm that Christ’s human nature was endowed with the Spirit “without measure,” and that the Spirit’s power was essential both in Christ’s earthly ministry and in raising Him from the dead, securing the benefits of **redemption** for the elect.

- "Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature." (Westminster Confession of Faith, 8.7)

(WCF 8.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** regarding the Holy Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection, establishing a framework that integrates **Christology** and **Pneumatology**. Their careful articulation of the Spirit’s work in the person and mission of Christ has influenced confessional documents, preaching, and theological education across the Reformed tradition. The Standards’ emphasis on the Spirit’s agency in both Christ’s resurrection and the believer’s union with Christ continues to inform contemporary discussions on the application of redemption.
