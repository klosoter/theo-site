# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** through the lens of **Reformed Trinitarianism** and **redemptive history**. He emphasized the inseparable operations of the **Trinity**, highlighting how the **Holy Spirit** empowered Christ’s incarnate obedience and effected his resurrection, all within the framework of **covenantal revelation** and **presuppositional apologetics**.

- "The Holy Spirit, as the third person of the Trinity, is active in every aspect of redemption, including the resurrection of Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- The Doctrine of Scripture
- Reformed Dogmatics (lecture notes and unpublished writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Unity in Redemptive Acts**
    - The **Father, Son, and Spirit** act inseparably in all works ad extra, including Christ’s ministry and resurrection.
    - The Spirit’s work is never isolated from the Son or the Father, maintaining ontological and economic unity.
    - Christ’s empowerment by the Spirit is a manifestation of the eternal covenant within the Godhead.
    - The resurrection is a Trinitarian act, with the Spirit as the agent of new life.
    - "The resurrection is not the act of the Son alone, but of the triune God, with the Spirit as the executor." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Spirit’s Empowerment of Christ’s Earthly Ministry**
    - Christ’s obedience and miracles are performed in the power of the Spirit, not by autonomous divine prerogative.
    - The Spirit’s anointing at baptism inaugurates Christ’s public ministry.
    - The Spirit mediates the presence of the Father to the incarnate Son.
    - The Spirit’s work in Christ models the pattern of dependence for believers.
    - "The Spirit’s presence with Christ is the guarantee of the success of his messianic mission." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Spirit’s Role in the Resurrection**
    - The Spirit is the agent who raises Christ from the dead, fulfilling Old Testament promise.
    - Resurrection is the vindication of Christ’s obedience by the Spirit’s power.
    - The Spirit’s resurrection work inaugurates the new creation.
    - The same Spirit who raised Christ now indwells believers, uniting them to the risen Lord.
    - "It is by the Spirit that Christ is raised, and by the same Spirit believers are made alive." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Covenantal Revelation and the Spirit**
    - The Spirit reveals and applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - Christ’s ministry is the climactic revelation of the covenant, made effectual by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures the continuity of God’s covenant promises from Old to New Testament.
    - The Spirit’s role in Christ’s resurrection is the foundation for the church’s life and mission.
    - "The Spirit is the revealer and applier of the covenant accomplished by Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Apologetics and the Spirit’s Testimony**
    - Knowledge of Christ’s resurrection is possible only through the Spirit’s illumination.
    - The Spirit testifies to the truth of Christ’s person and work in the hearts of believers.
    - Apologetic encounter depends on the Spirit’s sovereign work in regeneration.
    - The Spirit’s role in Christ’s resurrection grounds the certainty of Christian faith.
    - "Without the Spirit’s testimony, the resurrection would remain a fact without saving significance." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust **Trinitarian theology** and emphasis on the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection have shaped Reformed approaches to **redemptive history** and **apologetics**. His insistence on the inseparability of the persons of the Trinity in the economy of salvation has influenced generations of theologians, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s integration of the Spirit’s work with covenantal revelation and presuppositional apologetics continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of **revelation** and the application of redemption.
