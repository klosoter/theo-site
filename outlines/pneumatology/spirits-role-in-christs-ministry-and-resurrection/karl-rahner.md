# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner emphasized the **inseparable unity of the Trinity** in the economy of salvation, highlighting the **Holy Spirit’s active presence** in both the earthly ministry and resurrection of Christ. For Rahner, the **Spirit** is not merely an impersonal force but the very **self-communication of God**, intimately involved in the incarnation, mission, and glorification of Jesus.

- "The Spirit is the mode in which God is present and operative in the world and in the resurrection of Jesus." ("The Trinity")

## Key Works

- The Trinity
- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Theological Investigations (especially volumes on Christology and pneumatology)
- "The Resurrection of the Body" (in Theological Investigations, Vol. 17)
- Hearer of the Word

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Economic and Immanent Trinity are One**
   - The **Holy Spirit’s role** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection reflects the unity of God’s inner life and outward action.
   - The Spirit’s sending in the economy reveals the eternal processions within God.
   - The resurrection is a Trinitarian event, not isolated to the Son alone.
   - The Spirit’s work in Christ is the self-communication of the triune God to humanity.
   - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity." (The Trinity)

2. **Spirit as God’s Self-Communication**
   - The Spirit mediates God’s presence in the humanity of Jesus.
   - Christ’s ministry is empowered and guided by the Spirit as God’s gift.
   - The resurrection is the culmination of God’s self-giving in the Spirit.
   - The Spirit actualizes the new life of the risen Christ in believers.
   - "God’s self-communication in grace is the Spirit’s presence in the world." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Pneumatological Christology**
   - Jesus is the one uniquely receptive to the Spirit, the "Spirit-filled" human.
   - The Spirit’s anointing marks both Christ’s mission and his resurrection.
   - The resurrection is the final act of the Spirit’s transformative power in Jesus.
   - Christ’s glorification is inseparable from the Spirit’s activity.
   - "The Spirit is the principle of Jesus’ resurrection and exaltation." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 17)

4. **Resurrection as Trinitarian Event**
   - The Father raises Jesus through the power of the Spirit.
   - The Spirit is the bond of love and life between Father and Son, manifest in the resurrection.
   - The resurrection inaugurates the eschatological outpouring of the Spirit.
   - The risen Christ becomes the giver of the Spirit to the Church.
   - "The resurrection is the work of the triune God, realized in the Spirit." (The Trinity)

5. **Spirit and Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - The Spirit’s role in Christ’s resurrection anticipates the future resurrection of believers.
   - The Spirit is the pledge and foretaste of eschatological life.
   - The resurrection is the beginning of the Spirit’s universalizing mission.
   - The Spirit unites the risen Christ with the Church and the world.
   - "The Spirit is the anticipation of the final resurrection and the fulfillment of all things." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s integration of **Trinitarian theology** and **pneumatology** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical thought on the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection. His insistence on the unity of the **economic and immanent Trinity** challenged traditional separations and encouraged a more dynamic understanding of God’s action in history. Rahner’s work continues to influence contemporary discussions on the Spirit’s presence in Christology, soteriology, and the life of the Church.
