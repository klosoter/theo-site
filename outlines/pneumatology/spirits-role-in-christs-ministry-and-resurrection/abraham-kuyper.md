# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper emphasized the pervasive work of the **Holy Spirit** in both the **incarnation** and the ongoing **ministry of Christ**, highlighting the Spirit’s role in empowering Jesus’ earthly mission and effecting his **resurrection**. Kuyper viewed the Spirit as the divine agent who not only anointed Christ for his messianic office but also raised him from the dead, thus inaugurating the new creation and guaranteeing the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection life.

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust pneumatology shaped later **Reformed theology** by emphasizing the comprehensive role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s person and work. His insights on the Spirit’s agency in both the **incarnation** and **resurrection** influenced neo-Calvinist thought and contributed to a renewed appreciation for the Spirit’s work in redemptive history. Kuyper’s integration of **Trinitarian** categories continues to inform discussions on the relationship between Christ and the Spirit in contemporary theology.
