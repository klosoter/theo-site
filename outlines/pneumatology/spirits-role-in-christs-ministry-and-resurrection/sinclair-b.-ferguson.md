# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson emphasizes the **inseparable work of the Holy Spirit and Christ** throughout the entirety of Jesus’s earthly ministry, from **incarnation** to **resurrection**. He stresses that the Spirit is not merely an adjunct to Christ’s work but is essential in empowering, guiding, and vindicating the Son, particularly in the **resurrection**, which he sees as the climactic act of the Spirit’s ministry in redemptive history.
