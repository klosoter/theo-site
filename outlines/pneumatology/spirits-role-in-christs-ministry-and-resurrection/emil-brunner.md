# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the **Holy Spirit** as the dynamic agent in both the **incarnation** and the ongoing ministry of Christ, highlighting the Spirit’s role in actualizing the presence and work of the **Word**. For Brunner, the **resurrection** of Christ is not merely a historical event but the manifestation of the Spirit’s power, inaugurating the new creation and enabling faith. The Spirit thus mediates both the reality of Christ’s ministry and the believer’s participation in the risen life.

- "The resurrection is the act of God’s Spirit, who brings the dead Jesus to new life and thus inaugurates the new aeon." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

    - The Holy Spirit initiates the incarnation, making the eternal Word present in Jesus.
    - Brunner rejects a purely naturalistic or mythological view of the virgin birth, emphasizing the Spirit’s creative action.
    - The Spirit ensures that Christ’s humanity is truly united with divinity.
    - The incarnation is a unique event of divine self-revelation through the Spirit.
    - "The Spirit is the power by which the Word becomes flesh." (The Mediator)

    - Christ’s earthly ministry is empowered and guided by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Spirit is the source of Jesus’ authority, miracles, and proclamation of the Kingdom.
    - Brunner sees the Spirit as the bond of communion between the Father and the Son.
    - The Spirit’s presence in Christ is paradigmatic for the Church’s own empowerment.
    - "The Spirit is the divine power in which Jesus lives and acts." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Spirit and the Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is fundamentally an act of the Spirit, not a mere resuscitation.
    - The Spirit transforms death into new life, inaugurating the eschatological age.
    - Brunner stresses the existential encounter with the risen Christ through the Spirit.
    - The resurrection is both a historical and supra-historical event, made real by the Spirit.
    - "It is the Spirit who raises Jesus from the dead and opens the new future." (The Mediator)

4. **Spirit as Mediator of Salvation**
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to believers.
    - Faith itself is a gift of the Spirit, who enables personal encounter with the risen Lord.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them participants in his resurrection life.
    - Brunner emphasizes the existential dimension of salvation as Spirit-mediated encounter.
    - "Salvation is the work of the Spirit who brings Christ to us and us to Christ." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Spirit and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The Spirit is the guarantee and foretaste of final redemption.
    - Brunner connects the Spirit’s work in Christ’s resurrection to the hope of cosmic renewal.
    - The Spirit sustains the Church in anticipation of the consummation.
    - The resurrection is the firstfruits of the Spirit’s eschatological work in all creation.
    - "The Spirit is the pledge of the coming Kingdom, already present in the resurrection." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of the **Holy Spirit** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection contributed to a renewed appreciation of the Spirit’s centrality in **Christology** and **soteriology** within 20th-century Protestant thought. His existential and relational approach influenced later discussions on the Spirit’s role in revelation and faith. While sometimes overshadowed by contemporaries like Barth, Brunner’s emphasis on the Spirit as the living bond between Christ and believers remains significant for modern theology.
