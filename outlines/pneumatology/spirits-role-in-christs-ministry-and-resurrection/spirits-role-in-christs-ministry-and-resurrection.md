### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The church confesses that the Son became incarnate and, as the Christ, was anointed by the **Holy Spirit for his messianic office**, and that by that same Spirit the Father raised him from the dead. This thesis sits where **Pneumatology and Christology** interlock: the Son’s personal mission is coordinated with the Spirit’s mission, such that the Spirit is the eschatological unction empowering Christ’s obedience and the **life-giving agent** of his resurrection. The challenge is articulating this without diluting **inseparable operations** or lapsing into adoptive or subordinating schemes.

Classically, the divine missions are the temporal expressions of eternal **processions**. The Spirit’s mission to and through Jesus is the hypostatic Spirit’s work corresponding to his eternal procession from the Father and the Son, securing **Rahners Rule** that the economic Trinity reveals, though does not exhaust, the immanent Trinity. In Christology, the human nature is enhypostasized in the Son; within that assumption, the Spirit furnishes the **anointing of the Mediator** who, according to his humanity, lives, ministers, suffers, and is raised in the power of the Spirit. Thus the Spirit’s role is the mode of the incarnate Son’s acting as second Adam, while **Calvins autotheos** safeguards the Son’s full deity.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
The prophetic horizon of Isaiah frames the Spirit’s messianic role: Isa 11:1–2 promises the Spirit of wisdom and fear resting upon the Davidic shoot; Isa 42:1 presents the Servant upheld with God’s Spirit; Isa 61:1 announces, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. These texts fix the expectation of a **Spirit-anointed Messiah** whose mission is restorative justice. Luke-Acts fulfills this: at the Annunciation the Spirit comes upon Mary and the power of the Most High overshadows her (Luke 1:35), indicating a **pneumatological sanctification** of the assumed flesh without confusion of persons.

Jesus’s baptism reveals the triune economy. The Spirit descends like a dove and remains (John 1:32–33), anticipating John 3:34 that God gives the Spirit without measure to the Son. Luke 4:1–21 gathers the theme: Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, is led by the Spirit, returns in the power of the Spirit, and reads Isa 61 as his charter. In Matt 12:28, casting out demons by the Spirit of God signals the **inbreaking kingdom** by the Spirit through the Son. These lines display that Jesus’s miracles are not theatrics of bare divine omnipotence, but the messianic exercise of power as **Spirit-empowered obedience**.

Heb 9:14 declares that Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit. This text grounds the cross in **trinitarian agency**, where the Son’s self-offering is borne along by the eternal Spirit’s power, consistent with **inseparable operations**. Rom 1:3–4 speaks of the Son descended from David according to the flesh and designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead. The genitive in kata pneuma hagiosynes plausibly reads as the **Holy Spirit’s domain**, so that the resurrection marks the Son’s new phase as life-giving Lord in the Spirit’s power. Rom 8:11 makes it explicit: if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he will give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. The Spirit is the **agent of vivification**, both for Christ and for believers.

First Peter 3:18 says that Christ was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the Spirit. Whether Spirit refers to Christ’s own human spirit or the **Holy Spirit**, the larger Petrine and Pauline witness aligns resurrection life with the Spirit’s enlivening work. John 20:22 has Jesus breathe the Spirit, echoing Gen 2:7, as the risen Lord communicates the **eschatological Spirit**. This economy is coherent: the Father raises the Son by the Spirit, the Son, exalted, pours out the Spirit (Acts 2:33), and believers share the risen life by the indwelling **Spirit of Christ**.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Early fathers tethered the Spirit’s work in Christ to salvation’s recapitulation. **Irenaeus** described the Son and the Spirit as the two hands of the Father, by whom humanity is recreated in the incarnate Son and **Spirit’s sanctification**. **Athanasius** defended the Spirit’s deity in the 350s letters to Serapion, so that the Spirit’s anointing of Christ is not created assistance but the **divine bestowal** befitting God’s work of new creation.

The **Cappadocians** articulated the Spirit’s mission as an extension of eternal procession, grounding doxology and baptismal practice after 381. **Augustine** in De Trinitate (c. 399–419) framed missions as visible and invisible sendings; for him, the Spirit’s descent as a dove is a visible sign of an invisible **mission of love**, and Christ’s obedience is the human enactment of the Son’s eternal relation, not a diminishment of deity. Chalcedon (451) preserved the **two natures** without confusion; later, the dyothelite definition (Third Council of Constantinople, 680–681) insists on two wills harmonized in the one person, opening space for a mature account of **Spirit-enabled human obedience** in Christ.

Medieval theology parsed grace in Christ. **Aquinas** (Summa Theologiae III, qq. 7–8) taught that Christ, as man, possessed the fullness of **created habitual grace** and all gifts of the Spirit, organically expressing his hypostatic union. This secures a robust Spirit-anointed humanity without undermining the **communication of idioms**. Franciscan trajectories such as **Scotus** pressed different metaphysical accents but retained Christ’s plenitude of grace. The filioque, inserted at Toledo in 589 and received in the West, was defended by **Augustinian** and later scholastic arguments to ensure the Son’s role in the Spirit’s procession, with implications for reading the Son as **donor of the Spirit** post-resurrection.

The Reformation re-centered the economy. **Luther** emphasized the Spirit’s witness to Christ through the Word and the **genus maiestaticum** of the communicatio. **Calvin** developed a Spirit Christology in Institutes II.14–16 and the 1559 edition throughout: Christ’s prophetic, priestly, and royal offices are exercised by **the anointing of the Spirit**, and the Spirit unites us to the risen Christ in duplex gratia. Post-Reformation scholastics like **Turretin** and **Owen** enriched pneumatology; Owen’s Pneumatologia (1674–1677) contains a dedicated treatise on the **Spirit’s work in the human nature of Christ**, portraying the Son’s entire mediatorial obedience as Spirit-empowered.

Modern ressourcement included **Kuyper’s** The Work of the Holy Spirit (1888) and **Bavinck’s** Reformed Dogmatics (1895–1901), which synchronized biblical theology with **eschatological Spirit** emphases. Twentieth-century figures such as **Pannenberg** (Jesus, God and Man, 1968) and **Moltmann** (The Spirit of Life, 1992) highlighted the Spirit’s role in Jesus’s resurrection as proleptic of the future, while Catholic theologians like **Congar** (Je crois en l'Esprit Saint, 1979–1980) and **John Paul II** (Dominum et Vivificantem, 1986) deepened a pneumatological Christology within **missions/processions**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Reformed teaching integrates the Spirit into Christ’s mediatorial office while maintaining **inseparable operations**. For **Westminster**, the Mediator was anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure (WCF 8.3, 1646–1647; Larger Catechism Q42), which grounds his **prophet-priest-king** ministry. The confession simultaneously guards the Son’s **consubstantiality** and asserts that according to his humanity he relied upon the Spirit, a doctrinal synthesis epitomizing the Reformed stress on the **two states and three offices**.

Old Princeton furthered this by biblical-theological tracing. **Warfield** and **Hodge** underlined the continuity between the **Spirit in the Old Testament** and the New, culminating in Christ’s anointing and the church’s Pentecostal life, even as Warfield’s cessationism about extraordinary gifts did not weaken his insistence on the Spirit’s role in the **resurrection life**. **Vos** in Biblical Theology (1948) showed how the Spirit’s eschatological gifts cluster around the resurrected Christ, who becomes, in Pauline idiom, **life-giving Spirit** without collapsing persons.

Dutch Neo-Calvinism added a unified creation-redemption horizon. **Kuyper** emphasized the Spirit’s work in Christ and church as a single divine **re-creative energy**, while **Bavinck** treated the Spirit’s mission as the communication of the resurrection world into history, joining **union with Christ** to the Spirit’s indwelling. This trajectory leverages **Calvins autotheos** to insist the Son needs no help as God, yet wills to accomplish his mediatorial work as true man in Spirit-dependent obedience.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology, especially **Aquinas**, distinguishes the uncreated grace of the hypostatic union from the **created habitual grace** filling Christ’s human soul. This lets one say Christ, as man, receives the Spirit’s gifts in plenitude, forming a template for his **wisdom and charity**. Postconciliar theology, as in **Congar** and Dominum et Vivificantem (1986), stresses that missions follow **processions**, so the Spirit’s role in resurrection is the temporal deployment of his eternal relation to the Father and the Son, preserving **Filioque** while valuing Eastern intuitions.

Lutherans, with the **genus maiestaticum**, see Christ’s human nature sharing in the divine majesty by personal union, which nuances how Spirit empowerment is construed. The Spirit binds Christ’s saving presence to Word and Sacrament, so the risen Lord’s body’s **ubiquity** is Spirit-enabled for eucharistic presence. This differs from Reformed **extra Calvinisticum**, yet both ascribe Christ’s ministry to Spirit agency without erasing the integrity of either nature.

Modern and Eastern accounts often retrieve a distinct **Spirit Christology**. **Pannenberg** locates Christ’s identity proleptically in the resurrection by the Spirit as God’s eschatological vindication, while **Moltmann** argues for a history of God in which the Spirit as the power of new life raises the crucified Son, resisting any **patripassian** collapse. Eastern Orthodox theologians like **Lossky** and **Zizioulas** center the monarchy of the Father: the Father raises the Son in the **Spirit’s deifying energy**, and the risen Christ, as head of the new humanity, breathes the Spirit from the Father upon the church. Analytic theology has explored whether a **two-minds Christology** positions the Spirit as the bond enabling the human mind of Jesus to participate impeccably in the Logos’s volitions, safeguarding **dyothelitism** while explaining growth in wisdom.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A perennial concern is avoiding **Adoptionism**. If Jesus’s obedience and miracles are Spirit-empowered, is he a mere Spirit-filled man? The answer, anchored in **enhypostasia**, is that the human nature is the Son’s own; thus Spirit empowerment is the ordained mode by which the Son acts according to his humanity. **Inseparable operations** ensure that the Spirit never works apart from the Son and the Father.

Another concern is hidden **subordinationism**. If the Son receives power from the Spirit, is the Spirit superior? Classical accounts invert that reading: as God the Son, he is autotheos; as man, he receives the Spirit for us and our salvation, echoing **Cyrillian** themes that what is not assumed is not healed. Here the **extra Calvinisticum** protects the Son’s plenitude even as the economy manifests a real relational order.

Exegetically, Rom 1:4 and 1 Pet 3:18 are contested. Some argue that en pneumati in 1 Pet 3:18 means in the spiritual realm, not the **Holy Spirit**. However, the Pauline pattern in Rom 8:11 and the broader narrative in Luke-Acts support a robust **resurrection pneumatology**. Another debate asks whether Jesus raised himself. John 10:17–18 depicts the Son’s authority to lay down and take up his life, while Acts 2:24 and Rom 8:11 ascribe resurrection to the **Father through the Spirit**. The resolution is triune causality: the Father raises the Son in the Spirit; the Son, consubstantial, participates as the risen Lord who gives the Spirit.

Practical concerns include whether emphasizing the Spirit’s empowerment of Jesus undermines his **impeccability**. Dyothelite accounts respond that the human will of Christ, impeccably ordered by the person of the Son, is perfected by the Spirit, not in competition but in **perichoretic harmony**. Contemporary ecclesial debates about cessationism and charismatic gifts, especially within Reformed circles post-1918, also ask whether the **Spirit who raised Jesus** continues to distribute extraordinary signs; the deeper point remains that sanctification and mission derive from the same **resurrection life**.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Trinitarianly, the Spirit’s agency in Jesus’s ministry and resurrection displays **missions/processions** and **inseparable operations**. The economic taxis, with the Father sending the Son and the Spirit, reveals the eternal order while maintaining divine **simplicity**. The Son’s anointing and risen donation of the Spirit instantiate **Rahners Rule** without collapsing the immanent relations.

In Christology, the Spirit’s role explicates **dyothelitism and enhypostasia**. Christ’s human mind and will genuinely learn and obey, not by intrinsic deficiency of the Logos, but by the fitting mode of a **Spirit-filled humanity**. The cross, offered through the eternal Spirit, and the resurrection, enacted by the Spirit’s vivifying power, complete the Son’s **two states** of humiliation and exaltation.

Anthropologically and soteriologically, Jesus is the **second Adam** whose Spirit-empowered obedience becomes ours by **union with Christ**. The same Spirit who raised Jesus indwells believers, effecting regeneration and adoption, and applying the **duplex gratia** of justification and sanctification. Ecclesiologically, the exalted Christ pours out the Spirit to constitute the church as his **body and temple**, and sacramentally the Spirit unites us to Christ in baptism and the Supper through a robust **epiclesis**.

Eschatologically, the Spirit is the arrabon, the **firstfruits** of the resurrection. The pattern is Christological: as the Father raised Jesus by the Spirit, so he will raise us; present sanctification is the **eschatological Spirit** at work, conforming us to the image of the risen Son.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, preaching can highlight that Jesus’s ministry was **Spirit-anointed**, so our discipleship is not heroic moralism but participation in his Spirit-empowered life. Prayer becomes a practice of sharing the **Son’s filial posture** through the Spirit of adoption, especially in trials where the Spirit helps our weakness with groanings, the same Spirit who **raised Jesus**.

Liturgically, the calendar narrates this economy: at Advent and Annunciation the Spirit overshadows; at the Baptism of the Lord the **anointing** is revealed; at Holy Week the cross is offered through the **eternal Spirit**; at Easter the Father raises the Son; at Pentecost the exalted Christ sends the **Spirit of promise**. Strong epicleses in Word and Table services align worship with the **triune missions**, reinforcing that ministry flows from the Spirit who empowered Christ.

Ethically and missionally, the Spirit’s role in Jesus’s boundary-crossing mercy grounds the church’s **missional courage**. The same Spirit who raised the crucified justifies the church’s costly love and sustains witness. In counseling, believers are invited to trust that sanctification is not self-salvation; it is the **resurrection Spirit** mortifying sin and vivifying obedience as in the Son’s own life.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
The Father, by the Spirit, anointed and raised the Son so that in him and by that same **life-giving Spirit** the church shares the obedience, victory, and hope of the risen Christ.
