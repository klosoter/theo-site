# N.T. Wright (1948–)

N.T. Wright emphasizes the **Spirit’s integral role** in both the life and ministry of Jesus and in his **resurrection**, situating these within the broader narrative of **God’s covenant faithfulness** and **new creation**. Wright argues that the **Holy Spirit** empowered Jesus’ messianic mission, fulfilled Israel’s hopes, and inaugurated the **eschatological age** through the resurrection, which he sees as the ultimate vindication of Jesus by the Spirit.

- "The resurrection was the moment when the one true God appointed Jesus as the world’s true Lord, by the power of the Spirit." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)
