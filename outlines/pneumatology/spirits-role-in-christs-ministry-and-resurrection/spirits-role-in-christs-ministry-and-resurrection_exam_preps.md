### TITLE
The Spirit of Christ: Enhypostatic Anointing and Resurrection Power in Trinitarian and Federal Perspective

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How to articulate the **Spirit’s role** in Christ’s incarnate ministry and resurrection in a way that preserves **Trinitarian processions**, **hypostatic union**, and a robust **Reformed Christology**, while avoiding kenotic or functional subordinationist distortions.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Richard Gaffin, and Thomas F. Torrance.
- Relevant traditions: Nicene and post-Nicene patristic theology, Chalcedonian Christology, Reformed scholastic and federal theology, with modern Reformed and ecumenical retrievals.
- Debates:
  - Internal: disagreements within orthodox theology over the extent and mode of Christ’s dependence on the Spirit, the meaning of his **kenosis**, and the nature of **pneumatological Christology**.
  - External: kenotic theories, adoptionism, functional subordinationism, and modern Spirit-Christologies that weaken **divine simplicity** or Nicene processions.
  - Contemporary: the “Spirit Christology” movement, charismatic–cessationist tensions over Jesus’ gifts and miracles, and the Spirit’s role in union with Christ and eschatology.
- Defended position: The incarnate Son, remaining fully and personally the consubstantial Logos, lives, ministers, and is raised in genuine, covenantal dependence on the Holy Spirit according to his human nature, such that the Spirit’s anointing is enhypostatic in the Son and paradigmatic for the Spirit’s application of redemption to the church.

### ESSAY
To defend the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection under rigorous examination, one must unify four axes: the **immanent Trinity** and its processions, the **hypostatic union**, the **economic missions** of Son and Spirit, and the **federal** and eschatological structure of Christ’s work. The core claim to be defended is that the incarnate Son, as the one hypostasis of the Word, lives and acts in his mediatorial office in real, creaturely dependence on the Holy Spirit according to his human nature, without any diminution of his divine fullness, and that this Spirit-wrought life and resurrection constitute both the ground and pattern of the church’s salvation and glorification.

The starting point for this claim, and the first decisive figure, is Athanasius of Alexandria. In works such as On the Incarnation and his anti-Arian orations, Athanasius does not yet offer a full-blown “Spirit Christology” in modern terms, but he lays the essential grammar. For Athanasius, only the consubstantial Son, eternally begotten of the Father, can unite us to God. Yet the mode in which this occurs is fundamentally pneumatological. The Son takes our humanity to himself, and in that humanity he receives and bestows the Spirit. Athanasius’ baptismal exegesis is crucial: at the Jordan, the Spirit descends upon the incarnate Son as the pledge and beginning of the sanctification of our nature. He insists that the Spirit does not descend because the Logos lacks the Spirit in his divinity, but because our humanity, assumed by the Logos, must be anointed, healed, and perfected by the Spirit. This anticipates a central distinction you must hold under questioning: as God, the Son possesses the Spirit in the unity of the **simple** divine essence; as incarnate mediator, he receives the Spirit according to his human nature for his vicarious obedience and for us and for our salvation.

Examiners may press here: if the Son already has the Spirit as God, is the descent of the Spirit on Jesus merely symbolic? Athanasius’ logic provides the answer. The Spirit’s descent is not a bare sign, but an ontological and historical act in the realm of the assumed humanity. The human nature of Christ, anhypostatic in itself and enhypostatic in the Word, is genuinely capacitated, filled, and led by the Spirit. Athanasius’ insistence that the incarnate one “sanctifies himself” for our sake is unintelligible unless the humanity is the sphere in which the Spirit works. Here the pattern of later Reformed appeals to Christ’s **Spirit-wrought obedience** already appears: the gift of the Spirit to the humanity of Christ secures that his human life is the Spirit-empowered fulfillment of the human vocation in Adam’s stead.

The second decisive figure, who sharpens this in explicitly Christological disputes, is Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril’s conflict with Nestorius over the unity of Christ undergirds any credible doctrine of the Spirit’s role. Cyril argues relentlessly for the unity of the subject acting and suffering in the incarnate life: the one who is born of Mary, who hungers, who is anointed by the Spirit, and who dies is none other than the eternal Son. Against Nestorianizing tendencies to split the human Jesus from the divine Logos, Cyril appeals to the communicatio idiomatum and to the unity of person. This matters because some modern Spirit Christologies flirt with a Nestorian pattern: the Spirit fills “the man Jesus” as a distinct agent alongside or beneath the Logos. Cyril blocks this move. For him, the Spirit’s anointing and empowering of Christ must be read as the Spirit’s anointing of the Son in his incarnate state. The person is the Logos; the nature that receives the Spirit is the assumed humanity; the subject who acts in dependence on the Spirit is the one divine Son.

Cyril’s exegesis of texts like Isaiah 11 and Luke 4 is illuminating. The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding: for Cyril, this describes the human mind and will of Christ being enriched and moved by the Spirit of the Logos. The Logos does not need wisdom as God, but by assuming a rational human soul, he places that soul into the economy of the Spirit’s operations, so that his human acts of knowledge, compassion, and obedience are authentically human and Spirit-formed. Here we see a core conceptual anchor: **enhypostatic anointing**. The anointing is not of an independent human person, but of the human nature whose personal subsistence is in the Logos. Under cross-examination, this allows you to maintain both that Christ’s ministry is truly Spirit-empowered and that there is no fourth hypostasis or human personal center alongside the Son.

John Calvin, our third decisive figure and the first Reformed voice, dynamically retrieves this patristic pattern and integrates it into a fully Trinitarian and covenantal frame. In the Institutes, particularly book 2, Calvin emphasizes that Christ is anointed with the Spirit not only in name but in fact, so that he might be our prophet, priest, and king. He stresses that the title “Christ” derives from this anointing. Crucially, Calvin repeatedly speaks of Christ’s human nature being furnished, endowed, and sustained by the Spirit. In his commentary on the baptism of Jesus, Calvin insists that the visible descent of the Spirit signified the secret power by which Christ would accomplish his office. At the same time, he jealously guards the Son’s divine fullness: the Son as God is never without the Spirit, yet as mediator he is “enriched” with those gifts by which he fulfills our salvation in our flesh.

Calvin is also decisive in tying the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry to **union with Christ** and the ordo salutis. He argues that all the benefits of Christ come to us by the secret power of the Spirit, who is the bond of union between Christ and believers. But the Spirit we receive is not abstract; it is the Spirit of Christ, the very Spirit by which the incarnate Son lived, obeyed, and was raised. Calvin’s double emphasis prevents a common examiner’s objection: does stressing the Spirit in Christ’s life risk making Christ merely an exemplar Spirit-filled man, leaving the Spirit to be the real source of saving power? Calvin’s answer, which should be yours, is no. The Spirit’s ministry is Christocentric. The Spirit does not bypass Christ but communicates to us the power, righteousness, and life accomplished in Christ’s human obedience and resurrection. The Spirit is the bond, not the substitute, of union with the Son.

The role of the Spirit in Christ’s resurrection brings the doctrine into sharper focus. Calvin reads Romans 1 and 8 and 1 Peter 3 to affirm that Christ was designated Son of God in power by the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, and that he was made alive in the Spirit. Here one must avoid any suggestion that Christ became the Son at the resurrection. Rather, as Calvin and later Reformed theologians argue, the resurrection marks a new **eschatological state** of the incarnate Son, in which, by the Spirit, his humanity is glorified and becomes life-giving. The Spirit, who sustained Christ in weakness and suffering, now transforms his flesh into the mode of heavenly, pneumatic existence, such that the last Adam becomes a life-giving Spirit, that is, the one who, by his Spirit, imparts resurrection life to his people.

Herman Bavinck extends and systematizes this Reformed line, making him a fourth decisive figure. In his Reformed Dogmatics, Bavinck binds together **divine simplicity**, Trinitarian processions, and the economic missions. The Spirit, he insists, is the personal terminus of all divine outgoing activity ad extra; yet this does not render the Son idle. Rather, the Father works through the Son in the Spirit. This taxis is crucial for Christology. For Bavinck, the incarnation itself is a work of the Triune God, yet one in which the Spirit is particularly active in forming the human nature of Christ in the womb of the Virgin. Throughout Christ’s earthly life, Bavinck speaks of the Spirit as the mediator of the Father’s will through the Son’s humanity. Christ’s knowledge grows, his obedience is tested, his miracles and exorcisms are performed, in and through the Spirit’s presence. Bavinck therefore affirms in robust fashion that Christ’s human life is genuinely Spirit-empowered, while simultaneously grounding that empowerment in the eternal relation of Spirit to Son in the Godhead.

Bavinck addresses an internal debate that examiners will likely raise: in what sense can the human nature of Christ be dependent on the Spirit if the Son is personally united to that nature? Is there a competing principle of activity, one divine through the Logos and one created through the Spirit? Bavinck’s answer is to invoke the doctrine of **inseparable operations** ordered by personal taxis. All external works of God are undivided; yet they are appropriated according to the relations of origin. The incarnation and mediatorial ministry are works of the Triune God. The Father sends, the Son assumes and acts as mediator, and the Spirit equips and perfects the human nature and mediatorial work. There are not two centers of action in Christ, but one person acting through two natures in the power of the Spirit. The Spirit is not a rival agent inside Christ, but the divine person who perfects the assumed human nature according to the will of the Father and the person of the Son.

Central to the present topic is Bavinck’s handling of the resurrection. He insists that Christ’s resurrection is a Trinitarian act: the Father raises the Son through the Spirit, and the Son takes up his life again in the Spirit’s power. The glorification of Christ’s humanity is a Spirit-act. This has two consequences. First, it secures the continuity between Christ’s humiliation and exaltation: the same Spirit who overshadowed Mary and drove Jesus into the wilderness now transforms his mortal flesh into **spiritual** yet still bodily, incorruptible life. Second, it grounds the church’s hope. The same Spirit who raised Jesus will raise us and already unites us to his resurrection life. Thus the Spirit’s role in Christ’s resurrection is both unique and exemplary, establishing the pattern for the eschatological Spirit-work in believers.

Richard Gaffin, a modern Reformed figure, concentrates and develops these themes for Westminster’s theological context, making him a fifth decisive figure directly relevant to exam preparation. In works such as Resurrection and Redemption, Gaffin argues that Christ’s resurrection is the decisive eschatological event, the justification and adoption of the last Adam, accomplished in the realm of the Spirit. Reading Paul, especially Romans and 1 Corinthians 15, Gaffin emphasizes that Christ enters a new mode of existence as the pneumatic, life-giving last Adam. This is not a change in his deity, but a change in the state of his glorified humanity. The Spirit is, as it were, the environment of the risen Christ’s human life. Gaffin presses the point that ordo salutis must be subordinated to historia salutis: what happens to Christ in resurrection is constitutive for what happens to believers by the Spirit.

Gaffin’s pneumatological Christology also addresses contemporary internal debates over “Spirit Christology” and over cessationist–charismatic disagreements about Jesus’ miracles. He strongly affirms that Christ’s miracles, exorcisms, and prophetic ministry are conducted in the power of the Spirit. Yet he cautions against reading this in a way that makes Jesus a mere paradigm for a continuationist model of gifts. The Spirit’s empowering of Christ is bound to his unique **Messianic office** as the last Adam and head of the new creation. Believers participate in his gifts only as they are united to him by the same Spirit. Under examination, this allows one to affirm the Spirit’s central role in Christ’s ministry without collapsing his unique efficacy into a general pattern of charismatic experience.

The final decisive figure, Thomas F. Torrance, represents a different yet instructive trajectory that must be critically assessed rather than simply adopted. Torrance develops a strongly Spirit-focused Christology in which the Son, having assumed our fallen humanity, is sanctified and redeemed in that humanity through the Spirit’s lifelong ministry, especially in Gethsemane and at the cross. Torrance powerfully articulates the vicarious nature of Christ’s faith and obedience: Jesus believes, trusts, repents, and obeys in our place in the Spirit, such that our response is included in his. This vision has the strength of foregrounding the Spirit’s active role in every stage of Christ’s life and death, and in insisting that there is no gap between Christ’s saving work and its application, since the Spirit brings us into the humanity of Christ where that work is already complete.

However, Torrance’s theology also reveals some landmines. To secure the depth of Christ’s solidarity, he emphasizes that Christ assumes fallen human nature and that it is progressively sanctified through the Spirit. Examiners may press whether this implies internal moral defect in Christ or a quasi-Adoptionist progression. In response, one must distinguish between assuming the liabilities and infirmities of fallen condition, without sin, and assuming internal concupiscence. A Westminster-sound position, following Bavinck and Gaffin more than Torrance, insists that Christ’s human nature is impeccable, though subjected to the effects of the fall externally and physically. The Spirit’s work in Christ, therefore, is not to eradicate internal sin but to strengthen, guide, and perfect his sinless human faculties in their conflict with a fallen world and with satanic opposition. Torrance’s insistence on vicarious repentance can be affirmed in a qualified manner as Christ’s perfect confession of God’s righteousness and his bearing of our guilt, but not as implying any personal need for repentance in the Son.

With these six figures in place, one can now articulate and defend a coherent, Reformed, and catholic position. The Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry is that of the divine person who, in the economy, perfects and empowers the incarnate Son’s human nature for its mediatorial tasks. From conception to resurrection, from Nazareth to Golgotha and the empty tomb, the humanity of Christ is the arena of the Spirit’s sanctifying and strengthening activity. The Son, who as God eternally spirates the Spirit with the Father, as man receives and lives by the Spirit. This is not metaphorical but ontological: his human mind, will, affections, and bodily life are formed, upheld, and directed by the Spirit in obedience to the Father. The result is that Jesus’ human obedience is authentically creaturely, genuinely tested, and yet impeccably rendered, precisely because the Spirit unites his human faculties infallibly to the person of the Son and energizes them for perfect love and trust.

In his public ministry, the Spirit’s role appears in Jesus’ preaching, miracles, and exorcisms. He proclaims the kingdom in the power of the Spirit. He drives out demons by the Spirit of God, signaling that the eschatological age of the Spirit has arrived in his person. These acts are not raw displays of divine power bypassing his humanity. They are the acts of the incarnate Son, deploying divine power through the instrumentality of his Spirit-filled human nature in obedience to his Father’s will. This guards against external criticisms that see the Gospels as depicting a charismatic wonder-worker whose divine identity is a later overlay. The deeper truth is that the visible charismatic life of Jesus reveals the invisible Trinitarian life: the Father sending, the Son obeying, the Spirit empowering.

The Spirit’s role climaxes in Christ’s death and resurrection. At the cross, Hebrews speaks of Christ offering himself without blemish to God through the eternal Spirit. The best reading, in line with Athanasius, Cyril, Calvin, and Bavinck, takes this as indicating that the Spirit is the divine agent who sustains Christ in faithful obedience and self-offering amid dereliction. The Son offers himself to the Father in the Spirit. In the resurrection, the Father vindicates the Son and raises him through the Spirit. The Son, whose human life was sown in weakness and dishonor, is raised in power and glory by the Spirit’s transformative act. This does not mean that the Spirit is now the “subject” of Christ’s risen life; rather, the Spirit is the element, so to speak, in which the glorified humanity of Christ now exists. In his exaltation, Christ receives the promised Spirit from the Father and pours him out on the church. The one who lived and was raised by the Spirit now becomes, as exalted mediator, the giver of the Spirit to his body.

Examiner objections must be faced head-on. Does stressing Christ’s dependence on the Spirit entail a kenotic Christology in which the Son divests himself of divine attributes and relies on the Spirit as a replacement? The answer, following Bavinck and Gaffin, is no, provided we maintain that the Son’s dependence is according to his human nature and in the mode of the one person’s free condescension, not as a loss of divine fullness. The Son never ceases to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent as God. His ignorance, weakness, and growth in knowledge pertain to his humanity, which is genuinely finite and is exercised in the power of the Spirit. The Spirit does not “stand in” for absent divine attributes, but enables the humanity to function as the fitting instrument of the Logos.

Another objection is that robust Spirit Christology risks functional subordinationism: the Son appears as a Spirit-led agent rather than Lord. Here one must insist on the different planes of discussion. In the immanent Trinity, the Son and Spirit are consubstantial, equal in glory, distinguished only by relations of origin, with the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son. In the economy, the Spirit is sent by the Son and yet also empowers the incarnate Son. This is not circular dependence but ordered reciprocity grounded in eternal relations. The Son sends the Spirit as Lord; as incarnate servant he receives the Spirit in his human life. This is the outworking of **Trinitarian taxis**, not of ontological subordination.

Finally, contemporary Spirit Christology often proposes to “start from below” with Jesus as the Spirit-filled man and then see divinity as the Spirit’s presence. This external framework must be resisted as incompatible with Nicaea and Chalcedon. The divinity of Christ does not consist in or depend upon the Spirit’s indwelling; rather, the Spirit’s indwelling of Christ’s humanity presupposes that the person indwelt is the eternal Son. Here Athanasius and Cyril remain the controlling voices. We can and must affirm that every aspect of Jesus’ human life is Spirit-formed, while refusing any account that makes the Spirit’s presence the constitutive ground of his divine status.

The payoff for soteriology and ecclesiology is profound. Because Christ’s entire incarnate ministry and his resurrection are Spirit-wrought, our salvation is not the bare application of external merits, but participation in his Spirit-filled humanity. In **union with Christ**, believers share in the same Spirit who anointed, empowered, and raised him. Our regeneration, sanctification, perseverance, and final resurrection are the extension of that same Spirit’s work from Christ to his members. The Spirit is not an optional add-on but the one who reproduces in us, according to our measure and place, the pattern of Christ’s incarnate obedience and resurrection glory. The **federal** shape of this is evident: as the last Adam, Christ, in the Spirit, fulfills the covenant of obedience and secures the blessings of the covenant of grace for his offspring. The Spirit, who is both the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, is the eschatological gift promised in the new covenant, poured out on all flesh by the risen Christ.

Thus the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection, properly construed, secures rather than undermines classical theism and Reformed Christology. It shows that in the economy the Son truly lives as man before God, in the Spirit, for us, and that his resurrection in the Spirit is the beginning of the new creation into which the same Spirit now brings the church. Any oral defense of this locus must keep in tight, confident coordination the doctrines of **Trinity**, **incarnation**, **pneumatology**, **soteriology**, and **eschatology**, and must be prepared to show that a thick account of the Spirit in Christ’s life is not a modern novelty but the flowering of Nicene, Chalcedonian, and Reformed conviction.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection is that the Holy Spirit, as the third person of the Trinity, empowers, sanctifies, and perfects the incarnate Son’s human nature for his mediatorial obedience and raises and glorifies that humanity, so that Christ’s Spirit-wrought life and resurrection become the ground and pattern of the church’s salvation.
- Decisive figures:
  - Athanasius: the Logos assumes humanity and receives the Spirit in that humanity for our sanctification; the baptismal anointing is ontologically real in the human sphere.
  - Cyril of Alexandria: one-person Christology; the Spirit anoints the incarnate Logos in his human nature, ensuring a non-Nestorian **enhypostatic anointing**.
  - John Calvin: Christ’s threefold office grounded in his anointing by the Spirit; the Spirit as bond of **union with Christ** and communicator of his resurrection life.
  - Herman Bavinck: integration of **divine simplicity**, inseparable operations, and economic missions; the Spirit as perfecter of Christ’s humanity and agent of his resurrection glory.
  - Richard Gaffin: resurrection as eschatological, pneumatic transition of Christ’s humanity; historia salutis governs ordo salutis through the Spirit of Christ.
  - Thomas F. Torrance: strong emphasis on Spirit’s role in Christ’s vicarious faith and obedience; helpful stress on continuity of work and application, but needs correction regarding fallen nature and vicarious repentance.
- Debates:
  - Internal: extent and mode of Christ’s dependence on the Spirit; how to construe **kenosis** without loss of divine attributes; relation between Spirit Christology and classical Logos Christology.
  - External: kenotic theories that posit a divestment of divine attributes; adoptionist or subordinationist readings of Jesus as merely Spirit-filled; “from below” Spirit Christologies that ground divinity in Spirit-presence rather than eternal generation.
  - Contemporary: charismatic–cessationist use of Jesus’ miracles; whether Jesus’ Spirit-empowered life is paradigmatic or unique; how the Spirit in Christ shapes views on union with Christ, justification, and eschatology.
- Defended position: The incarnate Son, eternally consubstantial with Father and Spirit, lives, ministers, dies, and is raised in genuine, covenantal dependence on the Holy Spirit according to his human nature; this **enhypostatic anointing** grounds his mediatorial obedience and resurrection, and by the same Spirit believers are united to Christ and conformed to his Spirit-filled humanity unto final resurrection.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How can Christ be both omnipotent God and dependent on the Spirit?  
    Answer: His dependence is according to his human nature, while as God he eternally possesses the Spirit in the unity of the simple essence.
  - Does Spirit Christology threaten the uniqueness of Christ’s mediatorial office?  
    Answer: No, because the Spirit’s empowering is tied to Christ’s unique identity as the incarnate Son and last Adam, not to a generic charismatic pattern.
  - How is the Spirit involved in Christ’s resurrection without implying that the Son is passive?  
    Answer: The resurrection is a Trinitarian act in which the Father raises the Son through the Spirit and the Son takes up his life again, all as one undivided work ordered by personal taxis.
  - Does saying Christ assumed fallen humanity undermine his sinlessness?  
    Answer: Properly qualified, he assumes fallen condition with its infirmities and liabilities but without internal sin, and the Spirit strengthens his impeccable human faculties in that conflict.
  - How does the Spirit’s role in Christ relate to union with Christ and the ordo salutis?  
    Answer: The very Spirit who anointed, sustained, and raised Christ now unites believers to him, so that the benefits of his Spirit-wrought obedience and resurrection are communicated to them.
