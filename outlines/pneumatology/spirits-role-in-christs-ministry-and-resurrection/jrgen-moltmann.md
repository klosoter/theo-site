# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann places the **Holy Spirit** at the center of Christ’s ministry and resurrection, arguing that the **Trinitarian relationship** is most fully revealed in these events. For Moltmann, the Spirit is not only the power by which Christ acts and is raised, but also the One who inaugurates the **eschatological new creation**, making the Spirit central to both **Christology** and **soteriology**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is not only the raising of the dead Jesus, but the revelation of the Spirit as the power of life." (The Spirit of Life)

## Key Works

- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation
- The Crucified God
- Theology of Hope
- The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s robust **pneumatological and Trinitarian theology** has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection. His integration of **eschatology**, **creation**, and **redemption** through the lens of the Spirit has influenced both academic theology and ecumenical dialogue. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians to explore the cosmic and communal dimensions of the Spirit’s activity in the life of Christ and the church.
