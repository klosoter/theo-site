# James D.G. Dunn (1939–2020)

James D.G. Dunn emphasized the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in both the life and ministry of Jesus and the event of the **resurrection**. He argued that the Spirit was not only the agent of Jesus’ empowerment but also the means by which the **resurrection** was effected, marking Jesus as the **Messiah** and inaugurating the **eschatological age**.

- "The Spirit is the mode of Jesus’ resurrection existence and the means by which he continues to be present and active among his followers." (Jesus and the Spirit)

## Key Works

- Jesus and the Spirit (1975)
- The Christ and the Spirit, Vol. 1: Christology (1998)
- The Theology of Paul the Apostle (1998)
- Did the First Christians Worship Jesus? (2010)
- The Acts of the Apostles (1996, Epworth Commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit as Empowerment in Jesus’ Ministry**
    - Jesus’ ministry is inaugurated and sustained by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - The Spirit’s descent at Jesus’ baptism signifies his messianic identity.
    - Miracles and exorcisms are interpreted as manifestations of the Spirit’s power.
    - Jesus’ relationship to God is mediated through the Spirit.
    - "Jesus’ experience of the Spirit was the source and secret of his own sense of divine sonship." (Jesus and the Spirit)

2. **Spirit as Agent of Resurrection**
    - The resurrection is fundamentally a **pneumatological** event.
    - Paul’s language in Romans 1:4 and 8:11 highlights the Spirit’s role in raising Jesus.
    - The Spirit transforms Jesus’ earthly body into a **spiritual body**.
    - The resurrection marks Jesus as the **Son of God in power** through the Spirit.
    - "It was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead and transformed him into the life-giving Spirit." (The Theology of Paul the Apostle)

3. **Eschatological Significance of the Spirit**
    - The Spirit’s activity in Jesus signals the arrival of the **eschatological age**.
    - Jesus’ resurrection inaugurates the new creation by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit is the firstfruits of the final resurrection for believers.
    - The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost is linked to Jesus’ resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the beginning of the end, the first act of the eschatological drama, made possible by the Spirit." (Jesus and the Spirit)

4. **Continuity of Jesus’ Presence through the Spirit**
    - The risen Christ is present to the church by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit mediates the ongoing ministry of Jesus post-resurrection.
    - Believers’ experience of the Spirit is participation in the risen life of Christ.
    - The Spirit is the bond uniting Christ and his people.
    - "The Spirit is the mode of Christ’s continued presence and activity among his followers." (The Christ and the Spirit)

5. **Spirit-Christology as Key to Early Christian Faith**
    - Early Christian confession centered on Jesus as the bearer and giver of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s role in Jesus’ life shaped the church’s understanding of his identity.
    - Spirit-Christology provides a bridge between **Jewish monotheism** and Christian worship of Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work grounds the church’s proclamation of Jesus as Lord.
    - "The earliest Christology was a Spirit-Christology, rooted in the conviction that God had acted uniquely in and through Jesus by the Spirit." (Did the First Christians Worship Jesus?)

## Legacy and Impact

Dunn’s work on the **Spirit’s role** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection has profoundly shaped contemporary **New Testament theology** and the study of early Christian pneumatology. His emphasis on **Spirit-Christology** has influenced both historical Jesus research and systematic theology, encouraging renewed attention to the pneumatological dimensions of Christ’s person and work. Dunn’s scholarship continues to inform debates on the relationship between **Christology** and the doctrine of the **Holy Spirit** in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
