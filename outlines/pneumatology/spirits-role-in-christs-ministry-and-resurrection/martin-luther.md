# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther taught that the **Holy Spirit** was central to the life and ministry of **Jesus Christ**, empowering Him from the **incarnation** through His **resurrection**. For Luther, the Spirit’s work in Christ is foundational for understanding both **redemption** and the Spirit’s ongoing ministry in the **church**.

- "He was made alive by the Spirit, that is, by the divine power, and thus overcame sin, death, and the devil for us." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Large Catechism
- Sermons on the Gospel of John
- Commentary on Romans
- The Small Catechism

    - The Spirit empowered Christ’s teaching, miracles, and obedience to the Father.
    - Luther saw the Spirit as the agent who set Christ apart for His **messianic mission**.
    - The Spirit’s presence in Christ is a model for the believer’s own reception of the Spirit.
    "The Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form, and thus He began His ministry." (Sermons on the Gospel of John)

2. **Spirit and the Incarnation**
    - The conception of Christ in the Virgin Mary was a work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - Luther stressed that the Spirit’s work ensured Christ’s true humanity and sinlessness.
    - The Spirit’s role in the **incarnation** is foundational for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The union of divine and human natures in Christ is effected and maintained by the Spirit.
    "Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, so that He might be both God and man." (Small Catechism)

3. **Spirit’s Empowerment in Christ’s Ministry**
    - Christ’s miracles and acts of mercy were performed through the power of the **Spirit**.
    - Luther emphasized that Christ relied on the Spirit, not on His own divine prerogatives.
    - The Spirit’s guidance was evident in Christ’s preaching and fulfillment of prophecy.
    - The Spirit’s empowerment is the pattern for **Christian ministry** and life.
    "He did all His works, not by His own power alone, but by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Spirit’s Role in Christ’s Resurrection**
    - Luther taught that the resurrection was accomplished by the **Spirit’s power**.
    - The Spirit vindicated Christ, declaring Him to be the Son of God in power.
    - The resurrection is both a work of the Father and the Spirit, demonstrating the unity of the Godhead.
    - The Spirit’s resurrection power is the basis for the believer’s hope of new life.

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust account of the **Holy Spirit’s role** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection shaped subsequent Protestant theology, emphasizing the Spirit’s indispensability in both Christ’s work and the believer’s experience. His teaching reinforced the inseparability of **Christology** and **Pneumatology** in the drama of redemption. Luther’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on the Spirit’s work in the life of Christ and the church, especially within Reformation and evangelical traditions.
