# Michael Horton (1964– )

Michael Horton emphasizes the **Spirit’s essential role** in the life and ministry of Christ, highlighting the **Spirit’s anointing** at Jesus’ baptism, empowerment throughout his earthly mission, and agency in the **resurrection**. Horton situates the Spirit’s work within a robustly **Trinitarian framework**, stressing the unity and distinction of the **economic Trinity** in the accomplishment of **redemption**.

- "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ is united to us and we to him, just as he was the bond of union between the incarnate Son and the Father throughout the Son’s earthly ministry." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit’s Anointing of Christ**
    - The **Holy Spirit** anoints Jesus at his baptism, marking the inauguration of his public ministry.
    - This anointing fulfills Old Testament messianic expectations regarding the **Spirit-endowed Messiah**.
    - The Spirit’s presence affirms Jesus’ unique identity as the **Son of God** and Servant.
    - Christ’s miracles and proclamation are performed in the power of the Spirit.
    - "Jesus is the Spirit-anointed Messiah, empowered for his mission by the Spirit from conception to resurrection." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Trinitarian Economy in Redemption**
    - Horton insists on the **inseparable operations** of the Father, Son, and Spirit in the work of redemption.
    - The Spirit’s role is distinct yet never independent from the Son and the Father.
    - The **economic Trinity** is revealed in Christ’s dependence on the Spirit throughout his ministry.
    - The resurrection is a Trinitarian act: the Father raises the Son by the power of the Spirit.
    - "The Spirit is not an impersonal force but the third person of the Trinity, working inseparably with the Father and the Son." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Spirit’s Role in Christ’s Resurrection**
    - Horton teaches that the **Spirit** is the agent of Christ’s resurrection, as attested in Romans 8:11.
    - The resurrection vindicates Christ’s person and work, demonstrating the Spirit’s power over death.
    - The Spirit’s resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of believers’ own resurrection.
    - This event inaugurates the new creation and the outpouring of the Spirit on the church.
    - "The resurrection is the climactic act of the Spirit, raising Christ as the firstborn from the dead." (Rediscovering the Holy Spirit)

4. **Union with Christ by the Spirit**
    - The same Spirit who empowered Christ now unites believers to him.
    - **Union with Christ** is effected by the Spirit, who applies the benefits of Christ’s work.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is patterned after his presence in the incarnate Son.
    - Believers participate in Christ’s resurrection life through the Spirit.
    - "The Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead now dwells in us, uniting us to the risen Christ." (Covenant and Salvation)

5. **Spirit’s Eschatological Role**
    - The Spirit’s work in Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the **eschatological age**.
    - The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost is grounded in the risen Christ’s exaltation.
    - The Spirit is the down payment of the final resurrection and new creation.
    - Horton connects the Spirit’s resurrection power to the ongoing renewal of the church and world.
    - "The Spirit’s resurrection of Christ is the pledge and power of the coming new creation." (Rediscovering the Holy Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton’s articulation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the **Trinitarian shape of redemption** within contemporary Reformed theology. His work has influenced pastors, scholars, and students to recover the centrality of the Spirit in both Christology and soteriology. Horton’s emphasis on the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity and the Spirit’s eschatological work continues to shape systematic theology and the church’s understanding of union with Christ.
