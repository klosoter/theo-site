# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in the life, ministry, and resurrection of **Jesus Christ**, arguing that Christ’s messianic work is inseparable from the Spirit’s empowering presence. He contends that the **resurrection** marks a climactic moment of **eschatological** transformation, where the Spirit’s role is both constitutive and revelatory for Christ’s person and work, and foundational for the **application of redemption** to believers.

- "The resurrection is the climactic event in Christ’s messianic experience of the Spirit." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Messianic Ministry is Spirit-Dependent**
    - Christ’s incarnation and public ministry are marked by the Spirit’s anointing.
    - The Spirit empowers Jesus for obedience, miracles, and proclamation.
    - The Spirit’s presence identifies Jesus as the promised Messiah.
    - Christ’s dependence on the Spirit models the pattern for believers.
    - "The Spirit is the indispensable agent in the accomplishment of Christ’s messianic task." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Resurrection as Eschatological Event of the Spirit**
    - The resurrection is the definitive act of the Spirit in Christ’s life.
    - Christ is raised as the "life-giving Spirit," inaugurating the new creation.
    - The Spirit’s work in resurrection fulfills Old Testament eschatological hope.
    - Resurrection marks Christ’s transition to a new mode of existence by the Spirit.
    - "The resurrection is the supreme manifestation of the Spirit’s eschatological activity." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Spirit-Christology: The Spirit’s Constitutive Role**
    - The Spirit is not merely an adjunct but essential to Christ’s person and work.
    - Jesus’ identity and mission are inseparable from the Spirit’s presence.
    - The Spirit’s role is both ontological (who Christ is) and functional (what Christ does).
    - Spirit-Christology guards against reductionistic views of Christ’s humanity or divinity.
    - "The Spirit is constitutive for the person and work of Christ as the second Adam." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Application of Redemption is Spirit-Union with the Risen Christ**
    - Believers’ union with Christ is effected by the same Spirit who raised Jesus.
    - The Spirit mediates all the benefits of Christ’s resurrection to the church.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are grounded in Spirit-union.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the eschatological gift secured by Christ’s resurrection.
    - "The Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and his people." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis on the Spirit’s Role**
    - The Spirit’s work is understood within the unfolding drama of redemption.
    - Pentecost is the outworking of the Spirit’s resurrection activity.
    - The Spirit’s role in Christ is paradigmatic for the church’s mission and life.
    - The Spirit’s eschatological presence defines the entire new covenant era.
    - "The Spirit’s coming at Pentecost is the historical realization of Christ’s resurrection power." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s resurrection** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **union with Christ** and **eschatology**. His work has deepened appreciation for the redemptive-historical framework and the inseparability of the Spirit’s work from Christ’s person and mission. Gaffin’s insights continue to influence discussions on **Spirit-Christology** and the application of redemption within the church.
