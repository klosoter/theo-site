# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck emphasized the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** in the life and ministry of **Jesus Christ**, highlighting the Spirit’s role in the **incarnation**, **anointing**, and **resurrection** of the Son. For Bavinck, the Spirit not only empowered Christ’s earthly ministry but also effected his resurrection, inaugurating the new creation and ensuring the application of **redemption** to believers.

    - Bavinck stresses that Christ’s human nature was sanctified and prepared by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit’s involvement in the incarnation is foundational for Christ’s entire redemptive work.
    - "The conception of Christ by the Holy Spirit is the beginning of the new creation." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

2. **Anointing and Empowerment for Ministry**

    - Bavinck emphasizes the Spirit’s enabling presence in Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - The Spirit strengthens Christ to endure temptation and fulfill all righteousness.
    - Christ’s suffering is not apart from the Spirit, but in full dependence upon him.
    - "The Holy Spirit was the bond between the Father and the Son throughout the work of redemption." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 3)

    - Bavinck links the Spirit’s resurrection work to the beginning of the **new creation**.
    - The Spirit vindicates Christ’s person and work by raising him from the dead.
    - The resurrection is the prototype of the Spirit’s future work in believers.
    - "By the Spirit, Christ was raised from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 4)

    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s resurrection, uniting believers to the risen Lord.
    - Bavinck sees the Spirit as the agent of **regeneration** and **sanctification**.
    - The Spirit’s resurrection power guarantees the future bodily resurrection of the saints.

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust account of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the inseparable operations of the Trinity in redemption. His integration of **pneumatology** with **Christology** provides a comprehensive vision of salvation that highlights the Spirit’s ongoing work in the church and the world. Bavinck’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between the work of Christ and the Spirit, especially in the context of new creation and eschatology.
