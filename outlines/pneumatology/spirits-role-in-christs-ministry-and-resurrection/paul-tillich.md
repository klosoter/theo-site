# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** through his framework of **symbolic theology** and **theology of correlation**. For Tillich, the **Spirit** is the dynamic presence of the **New Being** actualized in Jesus as the **Christ**, mediating the power of **God’s self-revelation** and the transformation of existence, especially visible in the resurrection event.

- "The Spirit is the power of the New Being, present in Jesus as the Christ and manifest in the community which participates in his resurrection." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Dynamics of Faith
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- The New Being

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit as Manifestation of the New Being**
    - The **Spirit** is not a separate agent but the dynamic presence of the **New Being** in Christ.
    - Christ’s ministry is the historical manifestation of the **New Being** breaking into existence.
    - The Spirit actualizes the reconciliation between God and humanity in Christ.
    - The resurrection is the ultimate demonstration of the Spirit’s transformative power.
    - "The Spirit is the presence of the New Being in the community and in the individual." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Symbolic Mediation of the Spirit**
    - The **Spirit** is understood through symbols that point beyond themselves to the divine reality.
    - Christ’s resurrection is a symbol of the victory of the **New Being** over existential estrangement.
    - The Spirit mediates the experience of God’s power in the existential situation of the believer.
    - The language of Spirit and resurrection is existentially and theologically significant, not literalistic.
    - "All religious language, including that about the Spirit, is symbolic." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Spirit and the Community of the New Being**
    - The **Spirit** is present in the community that participates in the reality of the **New Being**.
    - The church is the bearer of the Spirit, manifesting the resurrection life in history.
    - The Spirit unites individuals into the **Spiritual Community** grounded in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The ongoing ministry of Christ is actualized through the Spirit in the life of the community.
    - "The Spiritual Community is the creation of the Spirit who actualizes the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Resurrection as Existential Event**
    - The resurrection is not a physical event but an existential transformation brought by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit raises the believer into participation in the **New Being**.
    - The resurrection signifies the victory over the powers of estrangement and death.
    - The Spirit’s work is to make the resurrection a present reality for the community and the individual.
    - "Resurrection means the manifestation of the New Being under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Correlation of Spirit and Human Experience**
    - The **Spirit’s** role is understood in correlation with the existential questions of human life.
    - The experience of the Spirit in Christ’s ministry and resurrection addresses the depth of human estrangement.
    - The Spirit’s presence is discerned in the transformation of existence, not in supernatural interventions.
    - The resurrection is meaningful as it correlates divine power with human renewal.
    - "The correlation of question and answer is the method by which the meaning of the Spirit is disclosed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has shaped modern **systematic theology** by emphasizing the existential and symbolic dimensions of Christian doctrine. His approach influenced later theologians to reconsider the meaning of resurrection and the Spirit beyond literal or purely historical categories. Tillich’s legacy endures in discussions of **theology of culture**, the nature of religious language, and the ongoing relevance of the **New Being** for contemporary faith.
