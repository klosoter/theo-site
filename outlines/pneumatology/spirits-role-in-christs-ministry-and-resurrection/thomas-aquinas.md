# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates the **Spirit’s role** in Christ’s ministry and resurrection within the framework of **Trinitarian theology** and **Christology**. He emphasizes that the **Holy Spirit** is both the sanctifier of Christ’s humanity and the divine agent empowering Christ’s works, culminating in the **resurrection**. Aquinas situates the Spirit’s activity as inseparable from the Son’s mission, highlighting the unity and distinction within the **divine economy**.

- "Christ was raised up to immortal life by the Holy Ghost." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 34, a. 3, ad 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, qq. 7–8, 34, 49, 53
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- Commentary on the Gospel of John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Spirit sanctifies Christ’s humanity**
   - The **Holy Spirit** is given to Christ in fullness from the moment of conception.
   - This sanctification is unique, as Christ’s humanity is united to the Word.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is the cause of all grace in Christ’s human nature.
   - Christ, as man, is the primary recipient and mediator of the Spirit.
   - "The Holy Ghost was in Christ not as tending to His own justification, but as bringing about the justification of others." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 7, a. 13)

2. **The Spirit empowers Christ’s ministry**
   - Christ’s miracles and public ministry are performed in the power of the Spirit.
   - The Spirit is the principle of Christ’s prophetic and priestly office.
   - The Spirit’s gifts are present in Christ in their highest perfection.
   - Christ communicates the Spirit to the Church through his ministry.
   - "Christ as man received the Holy Ghost fully, and by Him He worked miracles." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 34, a. 1)

3. **The Spirit’s role in the resurrection**
   - The resurrection is attributed to the whole Trinity, but especially to the Spirit as the giver of life.
   - Aquinas identifies the Spirit as the efficient cause of Christ’s resurrection.
   - The Spirit raises Christ’s body to a glorified, immortal state.
   - The resurrection is both a vindication and the beginning of new creation through the Spirit.
   - "Christ was raised up to immortal life by the Holy Ghost." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 34, a. 3, ad 1)

4. **Trinitarian unity in Christ’s mission**
   - The missions of the Son and Spirit are inseparable but distinct.
   - The Spirit’s work in Christ is always in harmony with the Father and the Son.
   - The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and is sent to Christ’s humanity in time.
   - The economic missions reflect the eternal processions within the Trinity.
   - "The Son was sent by the Father, and the Holy Ghost by both." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 43, a. 8)

5. **Christ as the source of the Spirit for believers**
   - Through his resurrection and ascension, Christ becomes the dispenser of the Spirit to the Church.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling in believers is patterned after his presence in Christ.
   - Christ’s glorified humanity is the instrument for the outpouring of the Spirit.
   - The Spirit unites believers to Christ and communicates his resurrection life.
   - "He gives the Holy Ghost to the faithful as to His members." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 49, a. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **Trinitarian theology** and **Christology** profoundly shaped Western understanding of the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection. His careful distinction of the Spirit’s sanctifying and empowering presence in Christ’s humanity influenced both medieval and later scholastic thought. Aquinas’s articulation of the Spirit as the efficient cause of the resurrection remains a touchstone for subsequent Roman Catholic and ecumenical theology. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions of the **divine missions** and the relationship between Christ and the Spirit.
