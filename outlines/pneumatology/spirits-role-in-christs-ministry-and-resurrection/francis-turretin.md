# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of the **Holy Spirit’s role** in the person and work of Christ. He emphasized the Spirit’s involvement in the **incarnation**, **anointing**, and **resurrection** of Christ, highlighting the Spirit’s essential function in empowering Christ’s human nature for His mediatorial work and in raising Him from the dead. Turretin’s treatment underscores the Spirit’s inseparable operation within the **Trinitarian economy**.

- "The Holy Spirit was given to Christ not only for his own sanctification, but also for the execution of his mediatorial office." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 2.13.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics XIII–XIV)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on the person and work of Christ
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit’s Role in the Incarnation**
    - The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause of the conception of Christ’s human nature.
    - The Spirit sanctifies Christ’s humanity, preserving it from original sin.
    - Turretin affirms the Spirit’s unique operation in the hypostatic union.
    - The Spirit’s work ensures Christ’s fitness as the sinless Mediator.
    - "The Holy Spirit was the immediate agent in the formation and sanctification of Christ’s human nature." (Institutes, 2.13.4)

2. **Anointing of Christ by the Spirit**
    - Christ receives the Spirit without measure at His baptism.
    - The Spirit equips Christ for His prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices.
    - The anointing signifies Christ’s public inauguration as Mediator.
    - The Spirit’s gifts are essential for Christ’s ministry and miracles.
    - "He was anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure for the discharge of his office." (Institutes, 2.14.2)

3. **Spirit’s Empowerment in Christ’s Earthly Ministry**
    - Christ’s miracles are performed by the power of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit sustains Christ in obedience and suffering.
    - Turretin maintains the Spirit’s continual presence with Christ’s humanity.
    - The Spirit’s guidance is integral to Christ’s fulfillment of the law.
    - "The Spirit was present with Christ in all his actions and sufferings." (Institutes, 2.14.3)

4. **Spirit’s Role in the Resurrection**
    - Turretin attributes Christ’s resurrection to the joint operation of the Trinity, with the Spirit as a principal agent.
    - The Spirit imparts life to Christ’s dead body, effecting resurrection.
    - The resurrection is a demonstration of the Spirit’s power and vindication of Christ’s work.
    - The Spirit’s action in resurrection is a pattern for believers’ future resurrection.
    - "Christ was raised by the power of the Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of holiness." (Institutes, 2.14.4)

5. **Trinitarian Economy and the Spirit’s Distinct Work**
    - Turretin distinguishes the personal properties and operations within the Trinity.
    - The Spirit’s role is coordinated with, but distinct from, the Father and the Son.
    - The Spirit’s work in Christ’s ministry and resurrection reflects the unity and diversity of the Godhead.
    - This distinction safeguards both the unity of divine action and the propriety of each Person’s role.
    - "The works of the Trinity ad extra are undivided, yet the mode of operation is appropriated to each Person." (Institutes, 1.3.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** shaped later Reformed dogmatics, providing a framework for understanding the Spirit’s inseparable yet distinct operations within the **Trinitarian economy**. His influence is evident in the confessional standards and in the works of subsequent theologians such as Charles Hodge and Herman Bavinck. Turretin’s scholastic precision continues to inform contemporary discussions on Christology and pneumatology within the Reformed tradition.
