## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has reinforced a robustly Trinitarian and redemptive-historical approach within Reformed theology. His emphasis on the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity and the Spirit’s empowering presence has shaped contemporary discussions on Christology and pneumatology.
