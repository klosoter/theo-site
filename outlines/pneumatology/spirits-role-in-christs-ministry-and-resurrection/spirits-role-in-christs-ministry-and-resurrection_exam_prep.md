- Decisive figures: Irenaeus of Lyons, Cyril of Alexandria, Thomas Aquinas, John Owen, Richard B. Gaffin.
- Traditions: Patristic Christology and pneumatology, medieval scholastic accounts of Christ’s grace, Reformed orthodox theology, contemporary Reformed biblical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Did Christ’s miracles and obedience proceed according to his human nature empowered by the Spirit or by immediate exercise of his divine power; reading of Romans 1.4 and 1 Peter 3.18; scope of Christ’s habitual grace; implications for **communicatio idiomatum** and **dyothelitism**.
  - External: Adoptionist or kenotic Spirit Christologies; modern historicist accounts that construe resurrection as communal experience rather than **eschatological vindication**; pneumatic identity theses.
  - Contemporary: Charismatic claims about Jesus as merely a Spirit-filled exemplar; analytic proposals on wills in Christ; trinitarian agency in the resurrection amid calls to decenter **inseparable operations**.
- Position: The Spirit sanctifies, anoints, and empowers the human nature of the Son for obedient ministry and sacrificial death, and the resurrection is a triune act appropriated to the Spirit as the perfecting cause, constituting Christ’s exalted, life-giving lordship and grounding the church’s participation by **union with Christ**.

### ESSAY
The Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection is a test case for whether one can hold together classical trinitarian and Chalcedonian commitments while doing justice to Scripture’s pervasive pneumatological pattern. The central claim is this: the incarnate Son lives, obeys, suffers, dies, and is raised as the Spirit-anointed last Adam, so that the triune God perfects the economy of redemption in a way that preserves **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and the integrity of the **hypostatic union**. This claim harnesses three anchors. First, the external works of the Trinity are undivided and thus the Father, Son, and Spirit act inseparably in Christ’s ministry and resurrection, with a fitting **pneumatological appropriation** of perfecting acts. Second, the Son is the single acting subject of all that the Mediator does, yet he acts according to both natures such that the Spirit’s work terminates on his human nature. Third, the Spirit’s anointing of the incarnate Son is not remedial of moral lack but constitutive of messianic office, empowering human obedience and confirming eschatological glory. Each anchor must be exegetically warranted, historically located, and defended against rival frameworks.

Scripture locates Jesus’ ministry within a Spirit-saturated horizon from conception to resurrection. In the annunciation the angel declares that the Holy Spirit will come upon Mary, sanctifying the conception of the human nature the Son assumes. At the Jordan the Spirit descends and the Father declares the beloved Son, and immediately the Spirit drives Jesus into the wilderness for obedient testing. In the synagogue at Nazareth Jesus reads Isaiah 61 to interpret his mission: the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim and to heal. Peter summarizes Jesus’ ministry as God anointing him with the Holy Spirit and power, who then went about doing good and healing, for God was with him. Hebrews says he offered himself to God through the eternal Spirit. Paul states that the Son was designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead, and that the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to our mortal bodies. Peter writes that he was put to death in the flesh and made alive in the Spirit. The thread is coherent: in the economy the Spirit is the sanctifying and perfecting cause of the incarnate mission, culminating in the resurrection as **eschatological vindication**.

Irenaeus of Lyons supplies an early template for integrating Christ and Spirit. Writing in a polemical context against Gnostic denials of the goodness of creation, Irenaeus frames salvation as recapitulation in the last Adam who refashions humanity by passing through every stage of life in obedience. He famously calls the Son and the Spirit the two hands of the Father. The two-hands motif is not a loose metaphor but an account of **inseparable operations** with a distinct fittingness pattern: the Father creates and saves by his hands, the Word and the Spirit, who act inseparably and yet with order. The Spirit’s role is the vivifying and perfecting one, both in the original creation and in the new creation summoned in Christ. This yields an early Spirit Christology that avoids adoptionism, because the personal subject is the eternal Word who assumes human nature, while all the Spirit’s operations terminate on that assumed nature for its sanctification and empowerment. Irenaeus’ recapitulation has a resurrection horizon. The Spirit who hovered over the waters now vivifies the crucified flesh of Christ and, by union with him, the church. Irenaeus thus sets the pattern: the incarnate mission is triune, the personal subject is the Son, and the Spirit is the vivifying hand who makes Christ’s human obedience fruitful unto resurrection and communion.

Cyril of Alexandria deepens this pattern under pressure from the Nestorian controversy. His insistence that one and the same is the Word who suffered in the flesh guards the unity of person in the incarnate Christ. Cyril’s central theological move is to attribute to the Word what is experienced in and through the assumed humanity without collapsing the natures. This allows him to speak robustly of the anointing without adoptionism. When Scripture says the Spirit rests on Christ, Cyril argues that it is the Word according to the flesh who is anointed, so that the anointing is not a supplement to a deficient Son but the sanctification and empowerment of his human nature for messianic office. This coheres with **enhypostasia**, the teaching that Christ’s human nature has its personal subsistence in the Word. Because the human nature subsists in the Word, the Spirit’s operations in Jesus terminate on that humanity in a way that belongs to the one person of the Word. Cyril’s Christology thus legitimates Luke’s and John’s pervasive theme that Jesus’ speech and works proceed in Spirit-enabled obedience. It also clarifies the gift character of Pentecost: the Spirit will not be given in eschatological fullness until Jesus is glorified, because from the Father, through the Son as incarnate and now exalted, the Spirit is poured out for the church’s union and mission. In Cyril’s hands, the anointing of Christ is the hinge by which the economy is summed up in the person of the Mediator, avoiding both Nestorian partition and adoptionist elevation of a mere man by a Spirit-power.

Thomas Aquinas consolidates the patristic inheritance into a precise account of the Spirit’s role in Christ by deploying the grammar of grace. Two features are decisive. First, Thomas teaches that Christ’s human soul received the fullness of created grace, both habitual and actual. This is the grace of headship, gratia capitis, by which Christ has the Spirit not only for his own human perfection but as the instrumental cause of grace for others. Second, Thomas interprets the fittingness of the Spirit’s acts in terms of the missions. The Son’s visible mission as incarnate is accompanied by the invisible mission of the Spirit to Christ’s human soul, producing the fullness of charity and wisdom and enabling his human operations. Christ’s obedience and miracles are thus according to his human nature in the power of the Spirit, the divine nature remaining impassible and immutable. This avoids any implication that the Son’s divine nature was the proximate principle of his miraculous acts in a way that would bypass his humanity. Miracles in the Gospel are signs wrought by the divine power through the instrumentality of Christ’s human faculties, elevated by the Spirit’s gifts. Aquinas’s account also shapes how to speak of the resurrection. The resurrection is an undivided act of the Trinity, yet with a fitting appropriation to the Spirit as the one who perfects and gives life. At the same time, Thomas affirms the Son’s self-resurrection, not as a rival cause but as one and the same undivided act considering the Son as principle. In sum, Aquinas supplies tools, **pneumatological appropriation**, gratia capitis, and instrumental causality, for saying that Jesus is the Spirit-anointed man whose human operations are perfected by the Spirit while remaining the acting subject as the Word.

John Owen, in the Reformed orthodox era, extends this line with an unprecedented focus on the Spirit’s work in Christ’s person and mediatorial office. Against the backdrop of confessional commitments to the **hypostatic union**, **dyothelitism**, and **federal headship**, Owen argues that all the saving work of Christ as Mediator was performed in the power of the Holy Spirit. He articulates a trifold work of the Spirit in Christ’s human nature: sanctification at conception, habitual grace constituting the fullness of his human capacities, and actual assistance in particular acts of obedience, suffering, miracles, and teaching. For Owen, Luke’s witness that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature indicates true human development under the Spirit’s guidance. When Acts says God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and power, Owen reads it as programmatic: Jesus’ miracles are not exercises of his divine nature bypassing his humanity but are wrought by the Spirit through the human nature of the Son. This is not a concession to modern kenosis but a deployment of Chalcedon and **communicatio idiomatum**. The personal subject is the Word, but the works are truly human and truly empowered by the Spirit. Owen is equally insistent on the Spirit’s role in the cross and resurrection. Hebrews 9.14 is not a vague reference to Christ’s own divine spirit but a concrete claim that the Holy Spirit sustained the Mediator’s human obedience unto death. The resurrection is a triune act appropriated to the Spirit. Owen thus integrates Christology with **federal theology**: as the last Adam, Jesus lives and dies in Spirit-dependent obedience, and is raised in the Spirit as the firstfruits of the new creation, so that he might pour out that same Spirit upon his body. Owen’s emphasis guards against two common errors that examiners will probe. First, the charge that such a Spirit-Christology subordinates the Son is answered by clarifying that the Spirit’s aid terminates on Christ’s humanity and that the missions display rather than erase the eternal relations. Second, the worry that miracles must be immediate acts of the divine nature is answered by reiterating instrumental causality and the integrity of Christ’s human faculties.

Richard B. Gaffin forges the resurrection nexus within a biblical-theological framework that has shaped contemporary Reformed exegesis. Notably, he reads Romans 1.3–4 and 1 Corinthians 15 within a two-age structure to show that the resurrection is the definitive turning of the ages and that the Spirit is the eschatological gift tied to the risen Christ’s lordship. “Declared Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection” is not an elevation from nondivine to divine status but the historical installment of the eternal Son into a new phase of messianic power, the Spirit characterizing the new mode of his incarnate existence. Similarly, “the last Adam became life-giving Spirit” does not identify the Son with the Spirit but asserts that the risen Christ is the life-giver by the Spirit. Gaffin thereby gives a hermeneutical key: the resurrection is appropriated to the Spirit as the moment when the Son, now the exalted Messiah, becomes the dispenser of the Spirit to the church. Gaffin also insists that Pentecost is not a separate blessing but the outflow of the resurrection and ascension, a single eschatological event complex. This has immediate soteriological consequences. Union with Christ is union with the resurrected and Spirit-anointed Lord, and the ordo salutis is reshaped around participation in his death and life by the Spirit. Such emphasis is not a novelty but a contemporary retrieval of the biblical lines already drawn by Irenaeus, Cyril, Aquinas, and Owen.

With these figures in place, three layers of debate can be prosecuted. Internally, the chief question concerns the causal register of Jesus’ earthly acts and the precise reading of key texts. Did Christ perform miracles by immediate divine fiat or in Spirit-enabled human obedience. A Chalcedonian and Reformed answer, following Aquinas and Owen, is that the divine power is the principle cause of miracles, yet the human nature is the instrument properly disposed and empowered by the Spirit. This answers Luke’s and Acts’ emphasis that God was with him and that he was anointed with power. It also honors **dyothelitism**. Christ’s human will is not bypassed by the Logos but brought to perfect obedience in the Spirit. Examiners may press the claim that such a model implies ontological lack in the Son. The response is to distinguish nature and person. The Son as person lacks nothing; his human nature, assumed without sin, is perfected by created grace to execute the messianic office. The Spirit’s giving in Christ is fitting to the economy, not a remedy for divine deficiency. Another internal debate focuses on Romans 1.4 and 1 Peter 3.18. Is the “Spirit of holiness” the Holy Spirit or Christ’s human spirit. The better reading is the Holy Spirit. Paul’s parallelism contrasts two modes: according to the flesh, Davidic descent; according to the Spirit, resurrection power. Similarly, in 1 Peter 3.18 the dative “in the Spirit” parallels “in the flesh,” contrasting modes rather than substances, and coheres with Paul’s “made alive” usage elsewhere that is clearly the Spirit’s work. A final internal point concerns the habitual grace of Christ. Aquinas’s robust affirmation of the beatific vision from conception has been contested in the Reformed tradition, with some fearing it compromises genuine growth. The substance remains: Christ possessed the fullness necessary to his office and grew in the exercise of human faculties under the Spirit. One may affirm with Owen an unparalleled plenitude of grace without committing to every scholastic detail, provided the point stands that the Spirit constituted and actuated Christ’s human obedience.

Externally, modern Spirit Christologies often shift the center in ways that sever the connection to classical trinitarianism. Adoptionist tendencies make the Spirit’s descent constitutive of Jesus’ identity as God’s Son and thereby turn the baptism into deification of a mere man. Kenotic proposals claim that the Son divested himself of attributes and lived only as a Spirit-filled man. Historicist treatments of the resurrection reduce it to the community’s experience of ongoing life rather than a concrete divine act of raising by the Spirit. The response must be threefold. First, the Son remains the eternal Son; the baptismal anointing is not what makes him Son but what consecrates his humanity for messianic work. Cyril’s enhypostatic account blocks adoptionism. Second, kenosis is rejected because the divine nature is impassible and immutable; the Son assumes without divesting. The Spirit’s empowerment of Christ’s human obedience does the work kenotics hoped for without sacrificing **divine simplicity**. Third, the resurrection is historical, bodily, and triune. The Spirit is no mere communal memory but the agent who raises and transforms the crucified Jesus and is then poured out by the exalted Christ. While Paul can say the Spirit of Christ dwells in believers, this is not identity but economy and mission. Gaffin’s two-age framework and 1 Corinthians 15 clarify that the Son becomes life-giving by the Spirit in his risen state, not by being the Spirit.

Contemporarily, several stress tests recur. Some charismatic theologies claim that Jesus is simply the paradigm of a Spirit-filled man, thereby flattening the unique once-for-all role of the Mediator. The answer is to insist on **federal headship** and uniqueness. As last Adam, Jesus receives the Spirit without measure so that he may be the source of the Spirit for the church. Believers share in his anointing only by **union with Christ**. Similarly, analytic discussions of wills in Christ can tempt one to partition the acting subject. The antidote is to maintain that the one person acts in both natures, the Spirit enabling the human will’s free and impeccable obedience. A further contemporary challenge is the denial of **inseparable operations** under the guise of giving each person a distinct sphere. But trinitarian unity entails undivided works with fitting appropriations. The Father sends, the Son is sent and assumes, the Spirit perfects and gives life. In the resurrection, Scripture attributes the act variously to the Father, to the Son, and to the Spirit. This is not a contradiction but a hermeneutic of inseparability with missions.

A coherent position can now be defended. The Spirit sanctifies the human nature of Christ at conception, dwells in him without measure, and empowers his messianic ministry. Jesus’ preaching, miracles, and exorcisms are genuinely human acts, executed by the Son according to the human nature and empowered by the Spirit, displaying the presence of the kingdom. His obedient life culminates in the cross, where he offers himself to God through the eternal Spirit, a priestly act suffused with the Spirit’s sustaining and purifying power. The resurrection is a triune act appropriated to the Spirit as giving life. In raising Jesus, the Spirit inaugurates his new, powerful mode of incarnate existence, so that the Son becomes the dispensation point of the Spirit to the church. Pentecost thus flows from Easter as the bestowal of the messianic anointing on the body. This structure unifies Christology, Trinity, and soteriology. It secures that the Son remains fully divine and the personal subject of all that the Mediator does. It secures that the Spirit’s role is not decorative but constitutive of the economy. And it secures that the church’s life in the Spirit is nothing other than participation in the resurrected Christ.

Examiners will press whether this position implies subordination. It does not. The Spirit’s agency is an economic mission ordered to the assumption of human nature by the Son. The Spirit’s operations do not correct a divine lack but perfect the human nature assumed. Examiners will ask whether the Son raises himself. Yes, inseparable operations entail that the Father raises the Son, the Son has authority to take up his life, and the Spirit gives life. These are three true statements of one undivided act. Examiners may ask if this reduces miracles to a merely human level. The answer is that miracles are divine acts wrought through the human faculties of the incarnate Son, empowered by the Spirit. Examiners will query the sense of Romans 1.4. The response is that Paul contrasts two modes of existence of the same Son, humiliation and exaltation, in which the Spirit characterizes the latter as the power of the age to come. Examiners may raise 1 Peter 3.18. The response is that “made alive in the Spirit” is the Spirit’s vivifying act, paralleling Pauline teaching.

Under this account, adjacent loci fall into a coherent pattern. In the doctrine of Scripture, the Spirit’s inspiration of the prophets anticipates the Spirit’s anointing of Christ, who fulfills the prophetic office and then grants the Spirit to his apostles. In soteriology, justification and sanctification occur in union with the risen Christ by the Spirit, so that the believer’s new life is an outworking of the same power that raised Jesus from the dead. Ecclesiology follows: the church is the body of the anointed Christ, indwelt by the Spirit of the Son, animated for mission that continues his own. Eschatology is framed by the apostolic promise that the Spirit who raised Jesus will raise us also, so that individual resurrection hope is inseparable from the corporate outpouring at Pentecost. Even the Lord’s Supper can be seen as a pneumatic communion with the risen Christ, where the Spirit lifts believers to feed on him.

The doctrine also guards the reality of Christ’s temptations and sufferings. The Spirit who rests on him drives him into testing and attends him in the wilderness. His prayers with loud cries are the human piety of the Son acted in the Spirit, whose anointing never eliminates genuine struggle but equips unerring obedience. This answers an oft-heard examiner’s objection: does the fullness of the Spirit in Christ eliminate the possibility of temptation. No, impeccability belongs to the person of the Son, but the temptations were real according to the human nature and the Spirit’s presence secured victory rather than evacuating conflict.

Lastly, the resurrection’s pneumatic cast is the interpretive key to the church’s mission. The gospel is the proclamation that God has raised Jesus by the Spirit, constituting him Lord and Christ, and that the Spirit is now poured out on all flesh. The church proclaims and suffers in that same Spirit, with the promise that the Spirit who raised Christ will raise us. This is more than a theological flourish. It is the backbone of prayer, preaching, sacraments, and sanctification. The Christian life is not an independent imitation of a Spirit-filled exemplar but Spirit-enabled participation in the resurrected and anointed Lord.

In conclusion, the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection is not a peripheral theme. It is the architecture of the economy. From Irenaeus’s two hands through Cyril’s enhypostatic anointing, from Aquinas’s gratia capitis to Owen’s Spirit-enabled Mediator, to Gaffin’s resurrectional two-age framework, the doctrine locates Jesus’ ministry and resurrection as triune acts with a fitting **pneumatological appropriation**. The Son is not subordinated but displayed as the obedient and exalted Lord. The Spirit is not sidelined but recognized as the sanctifying, empowering, and life-giving agent whose mission climaxes in Easter and Pentecost. And the church, by **union with Christ**, receives the same Spirit, living now in the power of the age to come as it awaits the final resurrection.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Spirit sanctifies, anoints, and empowers the human nature of the incarnate Son for obedient ministry and sacrificial death, and the resurrection is a triune act appropriated to the Spirit as life-giver, constituting Christ’s **eschatological vindication** and pouring out the Spirit on the church.
- Decisive figures:
  - Irenaeus: two hands model of **inseparable operations**, Spirit as vivifying perfection in recapitulation.
  - Cyril of Alexandria: enhypostatic anointing of the Word according to the flesh, guarding unity of person and the messianic **anointing**.
  - Thomas Aquinas: gratia capitis, fullness of habitual and actual grace, Spirit’s perfecting of Christ’s human acts, resurrection as **pneumatological appropriation** within undivided triune action.
  - John Owen: comprehensive account of the Spirit’s work in Christ’s conception, ministry, obedience, death through the Spirit, and resurrection; miracles as Spirit-wrought through Christ’s humanity.
  - Richard B. Gaffin: resurrection as turning of the ages, Romans 1.4 and 1 Corinthians 15 read as Spirit-characterized exaltation, Pentecost as outflow of resurrection.
- Debates:
  - Internal: mode of Christ’s miracles and obedience; exegesis of Rom 1.4 and 1 Pet 3.18; scope of Christ’s habitual grace; coherence with **dyothelitism** and **communicatio idiomatum**.
  - External: adoptionist and kenotic Spirit Christologies; historicist reductions of resurrection; “life-giving Spirit” identity claims.
  - Contemporary: Jesus as mere Spirit-filled exemplar; pressures against **inseparable operations**; analytic partition of wills.
- Defended position: The Spirit perfects Christ’s human obedience and ministry and is the appropriated agent of the resurrection, with all acts undivided and ordered by the missions; this grounds believers’ **union with Christ** and reception of the Spirit.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Spirit-empowerment subordinate the Son? No, the Spirit’s operations terminate on Christ’s humanity and manifest ordered missions within undivided trinitarian action.
  - Who raised Jesus? The Father, the Son, and the Spirit inseparably; Scripture’s attributions are harmonious appropriations.
  - Did Jesus do miracles by his divine nature? They are divine acts wrought through his human faculties empowered by the Spirit.
  - Rom 1.4: Holy Spirit or human spirit? Holy Spirit, marking the Son’s resurrection-installation in power.
  - 1 Pet 3.18: Made alive in the Spirit who is the agent of vivification, contrasting “in the flesh.”
  - Does fullness of grace cancel real temptation? No, impeccability belongs to the person, and the Spirit enabled real human obedience and victory.
