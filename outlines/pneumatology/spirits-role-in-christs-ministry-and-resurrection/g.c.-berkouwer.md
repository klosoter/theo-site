# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer emphasized the **integral role of the Holy Spirit** in the life, ministry, and resurrection of Christ, situating the Spirit’s work within the broader framework of **redemptive history** and **Christology**. He argued that the Spirit not only empowered Jesus’ earthly ministry but was also essential in the **resurrection**, highlighting the unity of the **Trinitarian economy** in salvation.

- "The resurrection is not an isolated miracle, but is bound up with the work of the Spirit in the totality of redemption." (The Work of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced articulation of the **Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and resurrection** has shaped Reformed discussions on **Trinitarian theology** and **redemptive history**. His insistence on the unity of the Spirit’s work with Christ’s mission provided a corrective to both reductionist Christologies and abstract pneumatologies. Berkouwer’s influence endures in contemporary debates on the relationship between **Christology** and **pneumatology**, especially within the Reformed tradition.
