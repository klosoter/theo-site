# Gordon Fee (1934–2022)

Gordon Fee emphasized the **Holy Spirit’s centrality** in the life, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, arguing that the Spirit is not merely an impersonal force but the empowering presence of God. He highlighted the **Spirit-Christology** of the New Testament, especially in Paul and Luke-Acts, showing that Jesus’ ministry was Spirit-empowered and that the **resurrection** was a Trinitarian event involving the Spirit’s power.

- "Jesus is the one uniquely anointed with the Spirit, and it is by the Spirit that he both does his mighty works and is raised from the dead." ("God’s Empowering Presence")

## Key Works

- God’s Empowering Presence: The Holy Spirit in the Letters of Paul

- Jesus the Lord according to Paul the Apostle
- "The Holy Spirit and the Life of Jesus" (in The Holy Spirit and Christian Origins, ed. Graham N. Stanton et al.)
- New Testament Exegesis (for methodological insights)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit-Christology as Central to New Testament Theology**
   - The **Holy Spirit** is integral to understanding Jesus’ identity and mission.
   - The Spirit’s anointing marks Jesus as the Messiah and empowers his ministry.
   - Fee stresses the continuity between Jesus’ Spirit-empowered life and the Spirit’s work in the church.
   - The Spirit is not subordinate but fully participates in the divine mission.
   - "The Spirit is the essential ingredient in the whole of Christ’s earthly existence." (God’s Empowering Presence)

2. **The Spirit’s Empowerment in Jesus’ Ministry**
   - Jesus’ miracles, teaching, and exorcisms are performed in the power of the Spirit.
   - The Spirit’s presence fulfills Old Testament expectations of the Messiah.
   - Fee highlights Luke-Acts as paradigmatic for understanding the Spirit’s role in Jesus’ mission.
   - The Spirit’s empowerment is both unique to Christ and paradigmatic for believers.
   - "Jesus is the prototype of the Spirit-filled person." (Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God)

3. **The Spirit’s Role in the Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is a **Trinitarian event**: the Father raises Jesus by the Spirit.
   - Romans 8:11 is central: the Spirit who raised Jesus will also give life to believers.
   - The Spirit’s resurrection power inaugurates the new creation.
   - Fee connects the resurrection to the Spirit’s ongoing work in the church.
   - "The resurrection is the ultimate demonstration of the Spirit’s power." (God’s Empowering Presence)

4. **The Spirit as God’s Empowering Presence**
   - The Spirit is the personal presence of God, not an impersonal force.
   - Fee insists on the relational and experiential dimensions of the Spirit’s work.
   - The Spirit mediates the presence of the risen Christ to believers.
   - The Spirit’s presence is eschatological, marking the inbreaking of the new age.
   - "The Spirit is God’s way of being present with his people." (God’s Empowering Presence)

5. **Continuity Between Christ’s Spirit-Empowered Life and the Church**
   - The same Spirit who empowered Jesus now indwells and empowers believers.
   - The church’s mission is a continuation of Jesus’ Spirit-empowered ministry.
   - Fee emphasizes the ethical and communal implications of the Spirit’s presence.
   - The Spirit’s resurrection power is available to the church for sanctification and mission.
   - "The church is the community of the Spirit, living out the life of the risen Christ." (Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Fee’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **Spirit-Christology** and the role of the Holy Spirit in both Christ’s ministry and resurrection. His exegesis has influenced Pentecostal, charismatic, and evangelical scholarship, emphasizing the Spirit’s personal and empowering presence. By rooting the Spirit’s work in the life of Jesus and the resurrection, Fee has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the **Trinitarian dynamics** of salvation and the ongoing vitality of the Spirit in the church.
