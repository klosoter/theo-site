# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas grounds **union with Christ** in the work of the **Holy Spirit**, emphasizing that believers participate in Christ’s life through **grace** and the **sacraments**. For Aquinas, the Spirit is the bond of love uniting the faithful to Christ, effecting **justification** and **sanctification** as believers are incorporated into the mystical body of Christ.

- "By the gift of the Holy Spirit, we are united to Christ as to our head, and become members of His mystical body." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, q. 8–q. 56
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV
- Theological syntheses in Aquinas on Doctrine: A Critical Introduction (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is effected by grace**
    - Grace is the created participation in the divine nature, enabling union with Christ.
    - The Spirit infuses grace, making believers capable of supernatural communion.
    - This union is both ontological (real) and relational, not merely moral or external.
    - Grace is received primarily through the sacraments, especially baptism and the Eucharist.
    - "Grace, which is a participation in the divine nature, unites us to Christ as members to the head." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 62, a. 1)

2. **The Holy Spirit as the bond of union**
    - The Spirit is the love proceeding from the Father and the Son, uniting believers to Christ.
    - The Spirit indwells the faithful, making them temples of God.
    - Through the Spirit, believers receive the gifts and fruits necessary for union.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the principle of ecclesial and individual unity with Christ.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given to us so that we may be united to Christ through love." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 43, a. 3)

3. **Sacramental mediation of union**
    - The sacraments are instrumental causes of grace, effecting real union with Christ.
    - Baptism incorporates believers into Christ’s body; the Eucharist nourishes and deepens this union.
    - The Spirit operates through the sacraments to communicate Christ’s benefits.
    - Sacramental participation is necessary for the fullness of union with Christ in this life.
    - "The effect of the sacraments is to unite us to Christ, especially through the Eucharist." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 73, a. 3)

4. **Justification and sanctification as Spirit-wrought union**
    - Justification is the initial movement of the soul toward God, effected by the Spirit.
    - Sanctification is the ongoing process of being conformed to Christ’s image.
    - Both are rooted in the Spirit’s indwelling and the infusion of grace.
    - Union with Christ is both an event (justification) and a process (sanctification).
    - "The Holy Spirit justifies by inwardly transforming us and uniting us to Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 7)

5. **Mystical body of Christ as the locus of union**
    - The Church is the mystical body, with Christ as head and believers as members.
    - The Spirit animates and unites the body, making ecclesial union possible.
    - Membership in the Church is both visible (sacramental) and invisible (spiritual).
    - Full union with Christ is realized eschatologically in the communion of saints.
    - "All the faithful are one body in Christ, united by the Holy Spirit." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **Spirit-wrought union with Christ** through grace and the sacraments profoundly shaped Western theology, especially in Roman Catholic and ecumenical contexts. His articulation of the Spirit as the bond of love and the centrality of the mystical body of Christ influenced later discussions on ecclesiology and soteriology. Aquinas’s careful integration of **justification**, **sanctification**, and sacramental theology remains foundational for understanding the dynamics of union with Christ in the broader Christian tradition.
