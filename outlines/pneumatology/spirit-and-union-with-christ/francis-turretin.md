# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** as the foundation for all benefits of salvation, emphasizing the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit**. For Turretin, the Spirit is the efficient cause who unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of his righteousness and life, while preserving the distinction between **justification** and **sanctification** within this union.

- "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 15.13.4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Mystical and Spiritual**
    - The union is not physical or essential, but a **spiritual bond** wrought by the Spirit.
    - It is the foundation for all other benefits, including **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - The union is real and vital, not merely notional or legal.
    - It is initiated and maintained by the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - "This mystical union is effected by the Spirit of Christ, who is the bond of union between Christ and his members." (Institutes, 15.13.4)

2. **The Spirit as the Efficient Cause of Union**
    - The Holy Spirit is the principal agent who unites the elect to Christ.
    - The Spirit applies Christ and his benefits to believers.
    - The Spirit indwells believers, making them living members of Christ.
    - Without the Spirit, there is no true participation in Christ.
    - "The Spirit is the bond of union, by whom Christ effectually unites us to himself." (Institutes, 15.13.4)

3. **Faith as the Instrumental Cause**
    - Faith is the means by which believers are united to Christ.
    - This faith is itself a gift of the Spirit, not a human achievement.
    - Through faith, believers receive Christ and all his benefits.
    - Faith unites the soul to Christ, but the Spirit is the one who creates faith.
    - "Faith is the bond on our part, but the Spirit is the bond on Christ’s part." (Institutes, 15.13.4)

4. **Distinction and Order of Benefits**
    - **Justification** and **sanctification** flow from union with Christ, but must be distinguished.
    - Union is logically prior to both justification and sanctification.
    - The Spirit applies both benefits, but in a distinct order and manner.
    - This preserves the integrity of **imputed righteousness** and **progressive renewal**.
    - "Union precedes justification and sanctification as the foundation from which they flow." (Institutes, 16.3.7)

5. **Covenantal and Federal Context**
    - Union with Christ is rooted in the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Spirit’s work is covenantal, applying the benefits secured by Christ the Mediator.
    - The federal headship of Christ is actualized in believers by the Spirit.
    - This union is both individual and corporate, encompassing the whole church.
    - "By the Spirit, we are made one with Christ, our federal Head, and so partake of all his benefits." (Institutes, 15.13.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s role became foundational for later Reformed theology, influencing both confessional standards and systematic treatments. His distinctions between the **instrumental** and **efficient** causes of union helped clarify the relationship between faith, the Spirit, and the benefits of salvation. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the Spirit’s work in uniting believers to Christ and mediating all redemptive blessings.
