# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** as the foundation of salvation, emphasizing the indispensable role of the **Holy Spirit** in effecting this union. Through the Spirit’s work, believers are united to Christ by **faith**, receiving all his benefits, including **justification**, **sanctification**, and perseverance. This union is covenantal, rooted in the promises of God, and is central to the Reformed understanding of the ordo salutis.

- "What is your only comfort in life and in death? That I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 1)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 1, 20, 53, 76, 79
- The Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 22–24
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads II and III/IV
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism (secondary)
- Joel R. Beeke & Sinclair B. Ferguson, Reformed Confessions Harmonized (reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Source of Salvation**
   - Union with Christ is the basis for receiving all benefits of redemption.
   - This union is established by the Spirit through faith.
   - Justification, sanctification, and adoption flow from this union.
   - The Catechism and Confessions repeatedly stress belonging to Christ as comfort and assurance.
   - "We believe that, to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery, the Holy Ghost kindles in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces Jesus Christ with all His merits, makes Him our own, and no longer looks for anything apart from Him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

2. **The Holy Spirit as the Bond of Union**
   - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of his life.
   - Faith itself is a gift of the Spirit, not a human achievement.
   - The Spirit applies Christ’s work to individuals, effecting regeneration and renewal.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling assures believers of their union and inheritance.
   - "By the Holy Spirit, Christ pours out his gifts from heaven upon us his members." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 51)

3. **Faith as the Instrument of Union**
   - Faith is the means by which the Spirit unites believers to Christ.
   - This faith is not mere assent but a living trust worked by the Spirit.
   - The confessions reject any notion of human merit in faith.
   - Faith receives Christ and all his benefits, not just justification.
   - "True faith is not only a sure knowledge... it is also a wholehearted trust, which the Holy Spirit creates in me by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 21)

4. **Sacramental Communion as Expression of Union**
   - The sacraments, especially the Lord’s Supper, signify and seal union with Christ.
   - Participation in the Supper is a spiritual feeding on Christ by faith.
   - The Spirit uses the sacraments to strengthen believers’ union with Christ.
   - The confessions emphasize the real, spiritual presence of Christ in the Supper.
   - "As certainly as I see with my eyes... so certainly his body was offered and broken for me and his blood poured out for me." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 75)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance in Union**
   - Union with Christ guarantees the perseverance of the saints.
   - The Spirit preserves believers in faith and communion with Christ.
   - Assurance is grounded in belonging to Christ, not in subjective experience.
   - The Canons of Dort stress the unbreakable bond established by the Spirit.
   - "God, who is rich in mercy, according to His unchangeable purpose of election, does not take His Holy Spirit from His own completely, even in their deplorable falls." (Canons of Dort V.6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, making the doctrine of **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** central to the understanding of salvation. Their confessional formulations have influenced generations of theologians and remain foundational in Reformed churches worldwide. By rooting assurance, perseverance, and sacramental life in the Spirit-wrought union with Christ, these confessions continue to provide a rich theological framework for Christian identity and comfort.
