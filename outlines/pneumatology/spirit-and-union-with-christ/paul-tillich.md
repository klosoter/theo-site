# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Spirit** and **union with Christ** through his distinctive method of **correlation**, interpreting these doctrines existentially rather than ontologically. For Tillich, the **Spirit** is the mediating power of the **New Being** revealed in Christ, effecting existential participation in divine life rather than a metaphysical union; **union with Christ** is thus understood as the transformation of human existence through participation in the **New Creation**.

- "The Spiritual Presence is the power of the New Being which is manifest in Jesus as the Christ." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on Christology and the Spirit)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 3 (especially sections on the Church and the Spiritual Presence)
- The Dynamics of Faith
- The Protestant Era
- The Shaking of the Foundations

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spirit as the Spiritual Presence**
    - The **Spirit** is not a separate hypostasis but the dynamic presence of God actualizing the **New Being**.
    - The Spirit mediates the power of Christ to the community and the individual.
    - The **Spiritual Presence** is experienced in history, especially in the church as the bearer of the New Being.
    - The Spirit is the source of faith, love, and hope, transforming existential estrangement.
    - "The Spiritual Presence is the power of the New Being which is manifest in Jesus as the Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Union with Christ as Existential Participation**
    - Union is not a mystical absorption but an existential participation in the **New Being**.
    - This participation is effected by the Spirit, who actualizes the Christ-event in the believer.
    - The union is characterized by transformation of existence, not ontological fusion.
    - Faith is the mode of participation, not sacramental or metaphysical incorporation.
    - "Participation in the New Being is the meaning of justification and sanctification." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christ as the Bearer of the New Being**
    - Christ is the manifestation of the **New Being** that overcomes existential estrangement.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ by making the New Being present to them.
    - The union is universal in potential but actualized in personal response.
    - The **New Creation** is inaugurated in Christ and mediated by the Spirit.
    - "Jesus as the Christ is the bearer of the New Being, and the Spiritual Presence is his power in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Church as the Community of the Spiritual Presence**
    - The church is the place where the **Spiritual Presence** is manifest and the New Being is mediated.
    - The church is not identical with the kingdom but is its provisional realization.
    - The Spirit creates the community of faith, hope, and love, uniting it to Christ existentially.
    - Sacraments are symbols of the Spiritual Presence, not vehicles of metaphysical grace.
    - "The church is the community in which the Spiritual Presence is manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Rejection of Substantialist Ontology**
    - Tillich rejects classical substance metaphysics in favor of existential-ontological categories.
    - Union with Christ is not a change in substance but a transformation of existential state.
    - The Spirit is not a substance but the dynamic ground of new existence.
    - The language of participation is symbolic, pointing to existential transformation.
    - "The concept of participation must be understood in an existential, not a substantial, sense." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **Spirit** and **union with Christ** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and philosophy. His emphasis on **existential participation** and the **Spiritual Presence** challenged traditional metaphysical formulations and opened new avenues for understanding Christian experience in a secular age. While his approach has been critiqued for its abstraction, it remains a significant resource for those seeking to relate classical doctrines to contemporary existential concerns.
