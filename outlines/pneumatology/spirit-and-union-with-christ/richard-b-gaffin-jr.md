# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **union with Christ** and the role of the **Holy Spirit** in salvation. Gaffin emphasizes that all the benefits of **redemption**—including **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption**—are inseparably tied to the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ, effected by the Spirit. His theology stresses the **eschatological** and **pneumatological** dimensions of union, making the Spirit’s work central to the believer’s participation in Christ.

- "The work of Christ for us cannot be separated from the work of the Spirit in us." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Union with Christ: Some Biblical and Theological Reflections" (in Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Center of Soteriology**
    - All aspects of **salvation** flow from the believer’s union with the risen Christ.
    - **Justification** and **sanctification** are distinct but inseparable benefits of union.
    - Union is both **judicial** and **transformative**, encompassing the whole of the ordo salutis.
    - The believer’s life is defined by participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    "Union with the exalted Christ by the Spirit is the central soteriological reality." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Pneumatological Realization of Union**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent who unites believers to Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work is not an addendum but essential to experiencing redemption.
    - Pentecost marks the eschatological outpouring of the Spirit, inaugurating the new age.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the believer in real time.
    "The Spirit is the bond of our union with Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Eschatological Structure of Salvation**
    - Salvation is fundamentally **eschatological**, grounded in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the firstfruits of the final resurrection.
    - Believers live in the tension of the “already” and “not yet” of redemption.
    - Union with Christ anticipates the consummation of all things.
    "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the history of redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Justification and Sanctification United in Union**
    - Both **justification** and **sanctification** are received through union with Christ.
    - There is no temporal or existential gap between these benefits in the believer.
    - The forensic and transformative aspects of salvation are inseparable.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are rooted in the same union.
    "Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Emphasizes the importance of **redemptive-historical** exegesis.
    - Seeks to integrate biblical theology with systematic theology.
    - Prioritizes the unfolding of salvation in the history of revelation.
    - Stresses the unity of Scripture in its testimony to Christ and the Spirit.
    "Biblical theology is indispensable for systematic theology." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has decisively shaped modern Reformed discussions of **union with Christ** and the role of the **Holy Spirit** in salvation. His integration of **biblical theology** and systematic theology has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, especially within the Westminster tradition. By centering soteriology on union with the resurrected Christ, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for understanding the believer’s identity and assurance in Christ. His legacy endures in the ongoing retrieval of a Spirit-centered, Christocentric approach to Reformed theology.
