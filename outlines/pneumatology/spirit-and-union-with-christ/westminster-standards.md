# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **union with Christ** as the foundation of all saving benefits, emphasizing the role of the **Holy Spirit** in effecting this union. Through the Spirit’s work, believers are mystically yet truly united to Christ, receiving all the benefits of **justification**, **adoption**, and **sanctification**. This union is central to the believer’s participation in Christ’s life and is mediated by faith, which itself is a gift of the Spirit.

- "The principal acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace." (Westminster Confession of Faith 14.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 11–13)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 65–69, 72, 74, 77)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 29–32)
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Theology by Robert Letham
- The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context by Robert Letham

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Spiritual and Mystical**
   - The union is effected by the **Holy Spirit** and is not merely legal or external.
   - It is described as a real, vital, and mystical union, not a fusion of essences.
   - This union undergirds all other benefits of redemption.
   - It is inseparable from the application of salvation.
   - "They who are effectually called and regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them." (WCF 13.1)

2. **The Spirit as the Bond of Union**
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the efficient cause who unites believers to Christ.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemption to the elect.
   - This union is initiated and sustained by the Spirit’s indwelling presence.
   - The Spirit enables believers to exercise faith, the instrumental means of union.
   - "The Holy Spirit is the only efficient agent in the application of redemption." (WLC 58)

3. **Faith as the Instrumental Means**
   - **Faith** is the means by which believers are united to Christ.
   - Faith itself is a gift of the Spirit, not a human achievement.
   - Through faith, believers receive and rest upon Christ for salvation.
   - Faith unites the believer to Christ in all His offices and benefits.
   - "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." (WCF 11.2)

4. **Union with Christ Grounds All Benefits of Salvation**
   - **Justification**, **adoption**, and **sanctification** flow from union with Christ.
   - All saving graces are communicated through this union.
   - The order of salvation (ordo salutis) is rooted in the believer’s union with Christ.
   - Union with Christ is both the source and context of all redemptive blessings.
   - "All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption." (WCF 12.1)

5. **Union is Covenantally Mediated**
   - The union is established within the framework of the **covenant of grace**.
   - Christ is the federal head, and believers are united to Him covenantally.
   - The Spirit’s work is always in accordance with God’s covenant promises.
   - The sacraments are signs and seals of this union.
   - "The sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace, immediately instituted by God, to represent Christ and His benefits, and to confirm our interest in Him." (WCF 27.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the relationship between the **Holy Spirit** and **union with Christ**, providing a systematic and confessional articulation that remains foundational for Presbyterian and Reformed churches. Their emphasis on the Spirit’s role in effecting union and mediating all saving benefits through Christ has influenced generations of theologians and pastors. The Standards’ covenantal and Trinitarian framework continues to inform contemporary discussions on soteriology and ecclesiology.
