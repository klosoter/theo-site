# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s approach to **Spirit and union with Christ** is rooted in his commitment to the **Reformed doctrine of the Trinity**, the **covenantal structure of revelation**, and the **inseparability of Christ and the Spirit** in the application of redemption. Van Til emphasized that **union with Christ** is effected by the **Holy Spirit**, who brings believers into vital communion with the risen Lord, grounding all knowledge and life in the triune God. This union is not merely mystical but covenantal, epistemological, and redemptive, shaping the believer’s entire existence.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Trinitarian**
   - Union with Christ is grounded in the eternal counsel of the **triune God**.
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent who unites believers to Christ, not as an abstract force but as the third person of the Trinity.
   - This union reflects the **covenantal relationship** established by God with his people.
   - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the work of the Father and the Son.
   - "The work of the Spirit is never independent of the work of the Son and the Father." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Structure of Union**
   - Union with Christ is mediated through the **covenant of grace**.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s redemptive work within the context of God’s covenantal dealings.
   - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification).
   - The covenant ensures that union is corporate as well as individual.
   - "The covenant is the framework within which the Spirit unites us to Christ." (Christian-Theistic Ethics)

3. **Epistemological Implications of Union**
   - True knowledge is possible only through union with Christ by the Spirit.
   - The **noetic effects of sin** are overcome as the Spirit renews the mind in Christ.
   - The believer’s epistemology is covenantal and analogical, rooted in participation in Christ.
   - The Spirit enables believers to interpret reality rightly, in submission to God’s revelation.
   - "All knowledge is ultimately a matter of covenantal relationship to God in Christ by the Spirit." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Application**
   - The Spirit unites believers to the resurrected and ascended Christ, applying the benefits of his work.
   - Union with Christ is the basis for all aspects of **salvation**: justification, sanctification, and glorification.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is eschatological, pointing to the consummation of union in glory.
   - The application of redemption is always Christocentric and pneumatological.
   - "Redemption is applied by the Spirit, who brings us into living union with the risen Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis and Participation**
   - Union with Christ by the Spirit establishes an **antithesis** between the believer and the world.
   - Participation in Christ is exclusive, setting believers apart from autonomous thought and life.
   - The Spirit’s work in union is transformative, reorienting all of life to God’s glory.
   - This union is the foundation for Christian ethics and worldview.
   - "There is no neutral ground; union with Christ by the Spirit means participation in the antithesis." (Christian-Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **union with Christ** and the **Spirit’s role** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the relationship between epistemology, soteriology, and covenant. His insistence on the **inseparability of Christ and the Spirit** in the application of redemption has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, especially in the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s covenantal and Trinitarian framework continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of Christian identity, knowledge, and sanctification.
