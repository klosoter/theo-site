# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the topic of **Spirit** and **union with Christ** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. For Bultmann, the **Holy Spirit** is not a supernatural force but the mode by which the **kerygma** confronts individuals, calling them into authentic existence and faith-union with Christ. He reinterprets **union with Christ** as an existential participation in Christ’s death and resurrection, realized in the believer’s response of faith.

- "The gift of the Spirit is the gift of new existence, which is effected by the proclamation of the word." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Existence and Faith (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Spirit**
    - The **Spirit** is not a supernatural entity but a symbol for the existential transformation brought by the kerygma.
    - Biblical language about the Spirit must be interpreted in existential terms, not as metaphysical reality.
    - The Spirit’s work is the awakening of authentic self-understanding before God.
    - The Spirit is inseparable from the proclamation of the Word.
    - "The Spirit is not a magical power but the power of the Word as it addresses man in his existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Union with Christ**
    - **Union with Christ** is not mystical incorporation but existential participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - This union is realized in the believer’s decision of faith, not in ontological change.
    - The believer’s life is shaped by the encounter with the risen Christ in the kerygma.
    - The relationship is personal and ethical, not metaphysical.
    - "To be in Christ means to exist in the new possibility opened up by the event of Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Faith as the Mode of Participation**
    - Faith is the existential response to the proclamation, creating union with Christ.
    - There is no union apart from the act of faith; it is not sacramental or automatic.
    - Faith is trust in the Word, not assent to doctrinal propositions.
    - The Spirit enables faith, which is the only means of participation in Christ.
    - "Faith is the act in which man surrenders himself to the event of Christ." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Kerygma as the Vehicle of the Spirit**
    - The **kerygma** is the means by which the Spirit is present and active.
    - The proclamation confronts individuals with the demand for decision.
    - The Spirit does not operate apart from the Word.
    - The church is the community gathered by the kerygma, not by mystical experience.
    - "The Spirit is given with the Word, and only with the Word." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Rejection of Mystical and Sacramental Union**
    - Bultmann rejects mystical or sacramental understandings of union with Christ.
    - The New Testament’s language is existential, not metaphysical.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are symbolic acts of faith, not means of mystical union.
    - The focus is on ethical transformation and new existence, not ontological change.
    - "The sacraments are signs of the new existence, not vehicles of supernatural grace." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Spirit** and **union with Christ** profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** by insisting on existential interpretation and rejecting supernaturalism. His work challenged traditional doctrines, prompting both sharp criticism and significant engagement, especially in debates over the nature of faith and the meaning of Christian existence. While controversial, his emphasis on the **kerygma** and existential decision continues to influence contemporary theology and biblical hermeneutics.
