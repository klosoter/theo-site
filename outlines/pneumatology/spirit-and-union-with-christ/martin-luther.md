# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther emphasized that **union with Christ** is effected by the **Holy Spirit** through **faith**, making believers participants in Christ’s righteousness and life. For Luther, the **Spirit** is the bond by which Christ and the believer are united, resulting in both justification and sanctification as gifts received from outside oneself (**extra nos**).

- "Through faith in Christ, therefore, Christ’s righteousness becomes our righteousness and all that he has becomes ours; rather, he himself becomes ours." (Two Kinds of Righteousness)

## Key Works

- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Two Kinds of Righteousness (1519)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is by faith alone**
   - Faith is the means by which the believer is united to Christ.
   - This union is not achieved by works or human effort.
   - Faith itself is a gift of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - Through faith, the believer receives all the benefits of Christ.
   - "Faith unites the soul with Christ as a bride is united with her bridegroom." (The Freedom of a Christian)

2. **The Holy Spirit as the bond of union**
   - The **Spirit** creates and sustains faith in the heart.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling makes Christ present to the believer.
   - The Spirit applies Christ’s work to individuals personally.
   - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the Word.
   - "The Holy Spirit is given and received, not by works, but by faith alone." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Justification and sanctification flow from union**
   - Justification is the imputation of Christ’s righteousness through union.
   - Sanctification follows as the believer is renewed by the Spirit.
   - Both are gifts received in union with Christ, not separate acts.
   - The believer is simultaneously righteous and sinner (**simul iustus et peccator**).
   - "He who is in Christ is a new creature; not by the law, but by the Spirit." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Christ’s benefits are shared through union**
   - All that belongs to Christ—righteousness, life, victory over death—is shared with the believer.
   - This is described as a “joyful exchange” or “marriage” between Christ and the soul.
   - The believer’s sin is imputed to Christ, and Christ’s righteousness to the believer.
   - The union is deeply personal and transformative.
   - "Whatever Christ has is ours; whatever we have is his." (Two Kinds of Righteousness)

5. **The external Word and sacraments mediate the Spirit**
   - The **Spirit** works through the preached Word to create faith.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means by which union is enacted and assured.
   - The external means are necessary for the Spirit’s inward work.
   - The Spirit never works apart from the Word.
   - "God does not want to deal with us otherwise than through the spoken Word and the Sacraments." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **union with Christ** and the role of the **Holy Spirit** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of salvation, emphasizing the centrality of faith and the Spirit’s work. His insistence on the **extra nos** character of righteousness and the Spirit’s mediation through Word and sacrament became foundational for later Reformation theology. Luther’s approach continues to influence discussions on justification, sanctification, and the believer’s mystical union with Christ.
