# Anthony C. Thiselton (1937–2023)

He emphasizes the dynamic, relational work of the **Holy Spirit** in mediating believers’ participation in Christ, highlighting both the existential and communal dimensions of union. Thiselton’s account is marked by a careful integration of biblical exegesis, theological tradition, and the transformative effects of the Spirit’s presence.
