# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the doctrine of **union with Christ** and the work of the **Holy Spirit** through his distinctive **triperspectival** lens, emphasizing the inseparability of the believer’s union with Christ from the Spirit’s application of redemption. He stresses that the **Spirit unites believers to Christ** in a way that is both covenantal and existential, grounding all aspects of the Christian life in this vital connection. For Frame, the Spirit’s work is not merely an addendum to salvation but the very means by which believers participate in the benefits of **justification, sanctification, and adoption**.

- "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ unites us to himself and communicates to us all his benefits." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ is Central to Salvation**
    - Union with Christ is the foundation for all aspects of salvation, including **justification, sanctification, and glorification**.
    - This union is established by the Spirit and is both legal and vital.
    - Frame sees union as encompassing both the objective work of Christ and the subjective experience of the believer.
    - The benefits of redemption flow from this union, mediated by the Spirit.
    - "All the blessings of salvation come to us only in union with Christ." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **The Spirit as the Bond of Union**
    - The Holy Spirit is the personal agent who unites believers to Christ.
    - This union is not merely mystical but covenantal and real.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the means by which Christ’s presence is experienced.
    - The Spirit applies the work of Christ to the believer, making union effective.
    - "The Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and his people." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Triperspectival Approach to Union and Spirit**
    - Frame interprets union with Christ and the Spirit’s work through his **normative, situational, and existential** perspectives.
    - The normative perspective emphasizes the biblical and doctrinal foundation of union.
    - The situational perspective considers the historical and redemptive context of the Spirit’s work.
    - The existential perspective highlights the believer’s personal experience of union with Christ.
    - "We must see union with Christ from the perspectives of God’s command, the world’s situation, and the believer’s heart." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
    - Union with Christ is framed within the context of God’s **covenant of grace**.
    - The Spirit’s work is covenantal, binding believers to Christ as their federal head.
    - The benefits of union are distributed according to the promises of the covenant.
    - The Spirit ensures the perseverance and security of those united to Christ.
    - "The Spirit’s work is covenantal, securing our relationship to Christ as promised in the gospel." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

5. **Application of Redemption by the Spirit**
    - The Spirit applies the finished work of Christ to individual believers.
    - This application includes regeneration, faith, repentance, and ongoing sanctification.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling empowers believers to live out their union with Christ.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are fruits of the Spirit’s ongoing work.
    - "The application of redemption is the Spirit’s work, making Christ’s benefits ours in experience." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s role has shaped contemporary Reformed theology by integrating doctrinal precision with practical application. His **triperspectivalism** offers a holistic approach that connects biblical, historical, and experiential dimensions of salvation. Frame’s influence is evident in the way modern theologians and pastors approach the doctrines of the Spirit and union with Christ, emphasizing their centrality for both theology and Christian living.
