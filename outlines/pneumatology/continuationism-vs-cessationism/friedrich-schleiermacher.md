# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** through his emphasis on **religious experience** and the **immediacy of the Spirit** in the life of the church. He did not advocate for a strict cessationist view; rather, he saw the work of the **Holy Spirit** as ongoing, though he reinterpreted **miraculous gifts** in terms of the community’s consciousness of God rather than supernatural phenomena. For Schleiermacher, the vitality of Christian faith lay in the present experience of the divine, not in replicating the extraordinary gifts of the apostolic age.

- "The influence of the Spirit is not confined to a particular age, but is the common possession of the Christian Church." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - The essence of Christianity is found in the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Religious experience is the locus of revelation, not external miracles.
    - The ongoing presence of the Spirit is experienced inwardly by the community.
    - Miraculous gifts are reinterpreted as heightened spiritual awareness.
    - "Christian piety consists in the immediate self-consciousness of being absolutely dependent on God." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Universal Activity of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit is continuously active within the church.
    - Spiritual gifts are not limited to the apostolic era but persist in new forms.
    - The Spirit’s work is seen in the unity and vitality of the Christian community.
    - Emphasis is placed on the communal rather than individual manifestations.
    - "The Spirit is the principle of the Church’s life in every age." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Redefinition of Miraculous Gifts**
    - Miracles are not necessary for authentic faith.
    - The miraculous is understood as the transformation of consciousness.
    - Spiritual gifts are interpreted as capacities for service and edification.
    - The focus shifts from external signs to internal realities.
    - "The miraculous is not the foundation of faith, but faith itself is the true miracle." (On Religion)

4. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
    - Doctrines and practices develop as the Spirit leads the church through history.
    - The church’s understanding of spiritual gifts adapts over time.
    - No rigid distinction between apostolic and post-apostolic eras regarding the Spirit’s work.
    - Tradition is dynamic, shaped by ongoing spiritual experience.
    - "The development of doctrine is the work of the Spirit in the consciousness of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Critique of Supernaturalism and Rationalism**
    - Rejects both strict supernaturalism (miracles as proof) and rationalism (denial of the Spirit).
    - Seeks a mediating position grounded in lived experience.
    - The Spirit’s presence is not validated by extraordinary phenomena.
    - Faith is sustained by the inner witness of the Spirit, not by signs and wonders.
    - "The true ground of faith is not external authority, but the inward testimony of the Spirit." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **continuationism vs cessationism** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from external miracles to the **immediate experience of the Spirit** within the church. His reinterpretation of spiritual gifts influenced later liberal and experiential strands of Protestant thought, encouraging openness to the Spirit’s ongoing work while downplaying supernatural phenomena. While not a continuationist in the Pentecostal sense, his legacy endures in discussions about the nature of **revelation** and the dynamic presence of the Holy Spirit in Christian life.
