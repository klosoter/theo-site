# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** within the broader framework of **Reformed doctrine**, emphasizing the unique and foundational role of the **apostolic era** in the history of **revelation**. He maintained that the **extraordinary gifts** of the Spirit, such as prophecy and tongues, were primarily given for the establishment of the **church** and the **canon of Scripture**, and thus ceased with the close of the apostolic age. Bavinck’s approach is marked by a strong commitment to the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** as the norm for faith and practice.

- "The extraordinary gifts served to plant and establish the church, and when that purpose was achieved, they disappeared." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Historically Progressive**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds in distinct epochs, culminating in Christ and the apostolic witness.
    - The **apostolic era** is unique in its revelatory function for the foundation of the church.
    - Later generations receive and transmit, but do not add to, the original revelation.
    - The **canon of Scripture** is the normative record of this completed revelation.
    - "Revelation is not a permanent endowment of the church but a historical process completed in Christ and the apostles." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Extraordinary Gifts Are Foundational, Not Normative**
    - Gifts such as prophecy, tongues, and miracles served to authenticate the apostolic message.
    - These gifts were signs accompanying the initial spread of the gospel.
    - Their primary purpose was to establish the **church** and confirm the **apostolic witness**.
    - With the foundation laid, such gifts are no longer necessary for the church’s ongoing life.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were tied to the founding of the church and are not to be expected as normative for later ages." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

3. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - The **Scriptures** are the complete and sufficient revelation for faith and life.
    - No new public revelation is expected or needed after the apostolic age.
    - The church’s authority is ministerial, not magisterial, always subject to Scripture.
    - Claims to new revelation undermine the sufficiency of the biblical canon.
    - "With the completion of Scripture, the necessity for new revelations and signs ceased." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

4. **Ongoing Work of the Spirit Is Ordinary, Not Extraordinary**
    - The **Holy Spirit** continues to work in regeneration, sanctification, and illumination.
    - The Spirit’s ordinary operations are distinct from the miraculous gifts of the apostolic era.
    - The Spirit empowers the church through the means of grace, not new revelation.
    - The focus is on the inward renewal of believers and the upbuilding of the church.
    - "The Spirit’s work continues, but in the ordinary administration of grace, not in new miracles or revelations." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Discernment Against Enthusiasm and Subjectivism**
    - Bavinck warns against confusing subjective experiences with divine revelation.
    - He critiques **enthusiastic** movements that claim ongoing prophecy or miracles.
    - The church must test all claims by the objective standard of Scripture.
    - True spirituality is rooted in the Word, not in extraordinary phenomena.
    - "All enthusiasm that seeks new revelations is to be rejected in favor of the objective Word." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of **cessationism** has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to the question of spiritual gifts, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**. His careful distinction between the extraordinary and ordinary operations of the **Holy Spirit** continues to inform contemporary debates on charismatic gifts. Bavinck’s influence endures in both academic and ecclesial contexts, providing a robust theological framework for evaluating claims of ongoing revelation and miraculous gifts.
