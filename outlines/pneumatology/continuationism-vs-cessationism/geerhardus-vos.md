# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos, as a foundational figure in **Reformed biblical theology**, approached the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** through the lens of redemptive history. He emphasized the unique, unrepeatable character of **revelatory acts** and **miraculous gifts** in the apostolic era, arguing that such gifts served a specific function in the unfolding of **special revelation** and the establishment of the **canon**.

- "Revelation is not a continuous stream, but comes in epochs, each with its own significance in the history of redemption." ("Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 1: Theology Proper and Revelation)
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (article)
- Pauline Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Epochal and Redemptive-Historical**
    - Revelation unfolds in distinct epochs, each marked by unique acts and words from God.
    - The **apostolic era** is seen as climactic, with special revelatory gifts serving a foundational purpose.
    - Miraculous gifts are tied to periods of new revelation and covenantal advance.
    - The closure of the canon marks the end of new, normative revelation.
    - "Revelation is always historically conditioned, and its epochs are not to be repeated." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Miraculous Gifts as Signs of Canonical Revelation**
    - **Signs and wonders** authenticated new revelation and messengers in redemptive history.
    - The function of miracles is primarily to attest to the authority of God's spokesmen.
    - Once the **canon** is complete, the necessity for such attestation ceases.
    - The church's ongoing life is grounded in the completed revelation, not in continuing miraculous gifts.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were signs of the Spirit's presence in the epoch of revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **The Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - The **canon** is closed; Scripture is the sufficient and final rule for faith and life.
    - No new revelatory gifts are needed or expected after the apostolic age.
    - The church is called to rely on the inscripturated Word, not ongoing prophecy or tongues.
    - The Spirit's ordinary work is now through the means of grace, not new revelation.
    - "The completed canon is the abiding form of special revelation for the church." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Distinction Between Extraordinary and Ordinary Operations of the Spirit**
    - The **extraordinary gifts** (prophecy, tongues, miracles) are distinguished from the Spirit's ordinary work.
    - Ordinary operations include regeneration, sanctification, and illumination.
    - The cessation of extraordinary gifts does not imply the Spirit is inactive in the church.
    - The Spirit continues to apply redemption through ordinary means.
    - "The Spirit's ordinary work abides, though the extraordinary manifestations have ceased." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Purpose of Apostolic Gifts**
    - Apostolic gifts served a unique, unrepeatable role in the foundation of the church.
    - These gifts were tied to the once-for-all accomplishment of redemption in Christ.
    - The church's ongoing mission is to proclaim and apply this finished work.
    - The expectation of new apostolic gifts undermines the finality of Christ's redemptive work.
    - "The apostolic age stands unique in redemptive history, not to be reproduced." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s **redemptive-historical** approach has profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of **revelation** and the cessation of miraculous gifts. His arguments for the closure of the canon and the unique role of the apostolic era remain influential in contemporary debates over continuationism and cessationism. Vos’s work continues to inform the theological method and biblical interpretation of those who uphold the sufficiency of Scripture and the distinctiveness of redemptive epochs.
