# Wayne Grudem (1948–)

Wayne Grudem is a leading evangelical theologian who defends **continuationism**, the view that the **miraculous gifts of the Spirit**—such as prophecy, tongues, and healing—continue in the church today. He grounds his position in a careful reading of **Scripture** and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**, arguing that **cessationism** lacks strong biblical support.

- "The evidence of church history and the teaching of the New Testament both point to the continuation of all the gifts of the Holy Spirit until Christ returns." ("Systematic Theology," 2nd ed.)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (especially chapters on the Holy Spirit and spiritual gifts)
- The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today
- Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (contributor)
- 1 Corinthians: Tyndale New Testament Commentary

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuation of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Asserts that all **spiritual gifts** listed in the New Testament are available to the church today.
    - Argues that there is no clear biblical teaching that miraculous gifts would cease before Christ’s return.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing role of the **Holy Spirit** in empowering believers for ministry.
    - Distinguishes between the foundational role of apostles and the continuing operation of other gifts.
    "Nowhere does the New Testament say that these gifts will cease before Christ returns." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Prophecy as Non-Canonical Revelation**
    - Defines New Testament prophecy as a **fallible** human report of something God brings to mind, distinct from **Scripture**.
    - Maintains that prophecy does not add to the **canon** or undermine the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - Encourages the practice of prophecy within biblical guidelines and church order.
    - Stresses the need for discernment and testing of prophetic utterances.
    "Prophecy in the New Testament is telling something that God has spontaneously brought to mind." ("The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today")

3. **Distinction Between Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Gifts**
    - Holds that the office of **apostle** was unique and foundational, not to be repeated.
    - Argues that other gifts, such as tongues and healing, are not tied to the apostolic office.
    - Rejects the idea that the end of the apostolic era necessitated the cessation of all miraculous gifts.
    - Sees the **apostolic foundation** as compatible with ongoing charismatic activity.
    "The New Testament nowhere teaches that the gifts of the Spirit were limited to the apostles or their close associates." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Biblical Authority and the Gifts**
    - Affirms the **sufficiency and authority of Scripture** as the final rule for faith and practice.
    - Insists that all claims of spiritual gifts must be tested by Scripture.
    - Rejects any form of revelation that would compete with or override biblical teaching.
    - Encourages the use of gifts in ways that build up the church and honor Christ.
    "All claims to spiritual gifts must be subject to the authority of Scripture." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Pastoral Caution and Order**
    - Advocates for the orderly use of spiritual gifts in the local church.
    - Warns against excesses and abuses associated with charismatic practices.
    - Encourages humility, accountability, and submission to church leadership in the exercise of gifts.
    - Emphasizes the edification of the church as the primary purpose of the gifts.
    "Paul insists that all things should be done decently and in order." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Wayne Grudem has played a significant role in shaping the **evangelical** conversation on continuationism, offering a scholarly and biblically grounded defense of the ongoing validity of spiritual gifts. His work has influenced pastors, theologians, and lay leaders in both charismatic and non-charismatic circles. By distinguishing between the authority of **Scripture** and the fallibility of modern prophecy, Grudem has provided a framework for the responsible practice of spiritual gifts within the church. His contributions continue to inform debates on the work of the Holy Spirit in contemporary Christian life.
