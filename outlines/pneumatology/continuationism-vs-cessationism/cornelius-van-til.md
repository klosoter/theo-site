# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til did not write extensively on **continuationism vs cessationism** as a central topic, but his **presuppositional apologetics** and **doctrine of revelation** shape his approach to the question. Van Til emphasized the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique, once-for-all character of **special revelation**, which aligns him more closely with a **cessationist** perspective, though he did not engage in polemics on charismatic gifts. His theological method insists that all claims about ongoing revelation or miraculous gifts must be evaluated in light of the **self-attesting authority of Scripture**.

- "The Scriptures are the finished and complete revelation of God to man." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Introduction to Systematic Theology
- The Doctrine of Scripture (in The Protestant Doctrine of Scripture)
- Christian Apologetics
- Reformed Dogmatics (lecture notes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Attesting Revelation**
    - Scripture is the final and complete form of **special revelation**.
    - The authority of Scripture is not dependent on external validation or ongoing miraculous signs.
    - All claims to further revelation must be judged by the **self-authenticating Word**.
    - The canon is closed; new revelation is unnecessary for the church’s faith and practice.
    - "The Bible is itself the final court of appeal." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and godly living.
    - The clarity of Scripture means that no additional revelation is needed for understanding God’s will.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the believer’s mind, but does not add new doctrinal content.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against subjective or extra-biblical claims.
    - "The Scriptures are sufficient for the needs of the church in every age." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Finality of Christ**
    - Christ’s work is the climax of **redemptive history** and the fulfillment of prophecy.
    - Miraculous gifts served to attest to the unique, unrepeatable work of Christ and the apostles.
    - The apostolic era is foundational and non-repeatable in the history of revelation.
    - The church now lives in the age of the Spirit, grounded in the finished work of Christ.
    - "Revelation culminates in Christ and is inscripturated for the church’s use." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Presuppositional Evaluation of Experience**
    - All claims to supernatural gifts must be evaluated by the presuppositions of a **biblical worldview**.
    - Human experience is always interpreted through the lens of Scripture.
    - Claims of ongoing miracles or prophecy are subject to the authority of the biblical canon.
    - The church must guard against autonomous reasoning in evaluating spiritual phenomena.
    - "We must interpret all facts in the light of the revelation of God in Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination, Not Revelation**
    - The Holy Spirit’s primary role is to illumine the meaning of the completed Scriptures.
    - The Spirit does not provide new doctrinal revelation beyond the biblical text.
    - The Spirit applies the finished work of Christ to believers, not by new prophecy but by opening the Word.
    - Assurance and guidance come through the Spirit’s work with the Word, not apart from it.
    - "The Holy Spirit illumines the mind to understand what is already revealed." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **continuationism vs cessationism** has shaped Reformed and Presbyterian attitudes toward charismatic gifts, emphasizing the **sufficiency and finality of Scripture**. His insistence on the **self-attesting authority of the Bible** and the closed canon has provided a robust theological framework for cessationist arguments. While not directly polemical against continuationism, his presuppositional method has influenced generations of theologians and apologists to evaluate all claims of ongoing revelation by the standard of Scripture alone.
