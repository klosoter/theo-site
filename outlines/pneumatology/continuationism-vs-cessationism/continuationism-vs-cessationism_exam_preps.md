### ESSAY
Continuationism versus cessationism concerns whether certain extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, especially revelatory and sign gifts such as prophecy, tongues, and miraculous healings, were confined to the foundational apostolic era or are intended to continue as ordinary possibilities for the church throughout the age. Underneath this dispute lie several deeper issues that Westminster examiners will probe: the nature and closure of **canon**, the once-for-allness of **special revelation**, the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture, the structure of **redemptive history**, and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit as applied to sanctification, assurance, and mission. One must show how a committed confessional Reformed position can affirm the Spirit’s vivid, experiential presence while denying that post-apostolic phenomena are in substance the same as the apostolic gifts.

The most decisive architect of classical Reformed cessationism in the modern period is B. B. Warfield. His work “Counterfeit Miracles” (1918) systematically argued that the New Testament miracles and extraordinary gifts were divinely granted as a cluster of signs that authenticated the apostles and their foundational revelatory ministry, and therefore ceased when that foundation was laid. Warfield worked within a **redemptive-historical** framework: miracles are neither random nor evenly distributed through history, but are concentrated around epochs of new revelation, particularly Moses and the prophets, Christ and the apostles. He insisted that this pattern arises from Scripture itself, not from rationalistic prejudice. His exegesis of texts like 2 Corinthians 12 and Hebrews 2 linked “signs and wonders and various miracles” with “those who heard” the Lord, that is, the apostolic generation, who thereby received divine attestation. For Warfield, to expect the same kind of gifts today is not simply to have an expansive view of the Spirit’s freedom; it is to misunderstand where we sit in the history of redemption and to compromise the unique finality of apostolic Scripture.

Examiners will press whether Warfield’s cessationism is driven more by post-Enlightenment anti-supernaturalism than by exegesis. The answer must be a careful distinction. Warfield was certainly a post-Enlightenment scholar, but his theological method was self-consciously confessional and exegetical. He affirmed that God is free at any time to do miracles, in the sense of extraordinary, immediate divine acts beyond ordinary providence. What he denied was the ongoing presence of divinely bestowed miracle-working charismata and continuing revelation as gifts given to persons and offices in the same way as in the apostolic age. In other words, Warfield’s **cessationism** is not a denial of miracles but a historical-redemptive delimitation of the gifts associated with the inscripturation of revelation. The conceptual center for him is the finished character of the apostolic deposit: when the foundation is laid, the scaffolding is removed.

Historically, Warfield did not invent this pattern. John Calvin already provides key conceptual moves toward a cessationist position, though his language is not systematized in the modern terms. Calvin’s broader project in the Institutes and his commentaries treats Scripture as the complete and normative rule of faith and life, the product of the Spirit’s **self-authenticating** testimony. Though he never wrote a treatise on cessation, he repeatedly interprets miracle and prophecy as things attached to epochs of revelation. In his commentary on John, Calvin notes that miracles were given “for a time” to confirm the gospel, and that it “pleased the Lord” then to cease them lest we seek signs rather than the sufficiency of the Word. In his discussion of Ephesians 4, he views apostles, prophets, and evangelists as extraordinary offices for the church’s foundation, while pastors and teachers are the enduring ordinary offices.

Calvin’s approach to “prophecy” and “tongues” is particularly instructive for examiners. He reads New Testament prophecy fundamentally as revelation from God, distinct from ordinary preaching, and tongues as real intelligible languages, not private ecstatic speech. Both, for him, are ordered to the public edification of the church when interpreted. This reveals the key conceptual point: once one grants that prophecy is revelation and that apostolic revelation is now complete, the recognition that prophecy is no longer given in that sense is a corollary of one’s doctrine of **canon**. Calvin’s doctrinal commitments to **sola Scriptura**, **sufficient Word**, and **ordinary means of grace** thus anchor a cessationist trajectory, even if he did not deploy that label.

Jonathan Edwards complicates the picture. As a Puritan divine deeply committed to Reformed orthodoxy, he also served in the context of intense revival during the First Great Awakening. In works like “Religious Affections” and “Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival,” Edwards articulated perhaps the most precise classic Reformed criteria for discerning the Spirit’s work in intense religious experience. He did not operate with a worked-out cessationist doctrine like Warfield’s, yet he laid the conceptual groundwork that undercuts key continuationist claims. Edwards’s central principle is that the Spirit’s saving and sanctifying work is known not by external signs, bodily manifestations, or extraordinary phenomena, but by its effects in producing a new sense of the glory of Christ, deepening love to God and neighbor, and growth in holiness. Many of the unusual experiences in revival – visions, bodily tremblings, or intense impressions – are neither reliable evidence of the Spirit’s saving work nor necessarily demonic; they are “accidental” effects that may attend strong affections in finite creatures.

Examiners will ask how Edwards’s approach bears on present charismatic claims of modern prophecy or tongues. Here one must emphasize that for Edwards, the test of a supposed revelation is whether it accords with Scripture and whether it leads to humble, Christ-centered holiness. He is not naïve about counterfeit experiences; the devil can mimic external wonders and high flights of emotion. In this, Edwards aligns implicitly with a cessationist instinct about extraordinary revelation: any alleged message “from the Lord” that goes beyond or beside Scripture, even if not formally contradicting it, threatens **sola Scriptura**. Edwards does at times speak of “impressions” on the mind, but he resolutely refuses to treat these as normative channels of revelation or as guides apart from the written Word. His conceptual contribution for today’s debate is the insistence that the Spirit’s primary work post-canon is to illumine and apply Scripture and to transform hearts, not to supplement the biblical message with a second tier of ongoing revelation.

In the twentieth century, Martyn Lloyd-Jones represents a pivotal, controversial figure because he combines high Reformed doctrine with an unusually sympathetic openness to certain continuationist claims. Preaching in mid-century London at Westminster Chapel, he pressed the need for a lived experience of the Spirit’s power, often distinguishing sharply between regeneration and what he called the “baptism with the Spirit.” In his sermons on Ephesians and in posthumously compiled works on revival, Lloyd-Jones criticized what he saw as a rationalistic, merely formal evangelicalism and argued that the church needed a deeper experiential encounter with the Spirit, sometimes speaking as though phenomena akin to Acts could and should be expected.

Charismatic and continuationist theologians often appeal to Lloyd-Jones as an ally. They argue that he recognized the Spirit’s freedom to grant extraordinary experiences, and that his critique of a purely doctrinal Christianity supports the hunger for prophecy and tongues. A careful reading is essential here for an exam defense. First, Lloyd-Jones never clearly defined post-apostolic “prophecy” as new revelation; his concern was more about power in preaching, assurance, and revival. Second, he was explicit that Scripture is final and complete. The tension in his thought is between a strong affirmation of **sufficiency of Scripture** and a rhetoric about Spirit-baptism that easily leans into a two-tier Christianity. Reformed critics charge that by separating Spirit-baptism as a post-conversion experience, Lloyd-Jones created conceptual space for exactly the kind of charismatically driven spirituality he did not intend to endorse. A principled cessationist response would appropriate his concern for experiential Christianity while rejecting the implication that apostolic-like gifts are normative. One can affirm with Lloyd-Jones that the Spirit may exceptionally answer prayer in remarkable ways, while insisting with Warfield that the gifts given as organs of ongoing special revelation have ceased.

Turning to explicit continuationism, Wayne Grudem is decisive because he represents a learned, Reformed-friendly defense of charismatic gifts that attempts to avoid the more obviously heterodox excesses of some Pentecostal theology. In his Systematic Theology and his book “The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today,” Grudem offers a carefully constructed exegetical argument that New Testament congregational prophecy is different in nature from Old Testament canonical prophecy. His central thesis is that New Testament prophecy is a mixture of divine revelation and human fallibility, such that it can be mistaken in its details and need not carry divine authority in the way Scripture does. On this definition, modern “prophecy” can be embraced without compromising **sufficiency** or **inerrancy**, because these prophecies are not Scripture-level revelation. For Grudem, passages like Acts 21, where Agabus’s prediction does not match subsequent events exactly, show that prophecy can be partially in error. This allows him to argue that spiritual impressions and spontaneous insights may be called “prophecy,” subject to testing and correction by Scripture and the church.

An examiner will likely press two challenges. First, is Grudem’s definition exegetically warranted? The classic Reformed response is negative. In both Testaments, someone who says “Thus says the Lord” is claiming revelation, not fallible insight; Deuteronomy 18 treats false prophecy with utmost seriousness. The idea of “fallible prophecy” appears motivated not by exegesis but by a desire to legitimize contemporary phenomena without subjecting them to biblical standards that would expose their problems. Moreover, the whole pattern of Ephesians 2 and 3, which places “apostles and prophets” together as the foundation on which the church is built, points to a revelatory office whose output is authoritative. Second, even if one grants that some New Testament “prophecy” is less than canonical, the practice Grudem encourages tends in pastoral reality to undermine **sola Scriptura**. Congregations treat “prophecies” as divine guidance, functionally adding to the Bible, even while formally affirming its sufficiency. The cessationist position insists that the safest and most theologically coherent approach is to reserve the language of revelation and prophecy for Scripture and to describe all other subjective leading as the Spirit’s **illumination** and **providence**, not revelation.

On the more robustly cessationist side of contemporary evangelicalism, John MacArthur has played a major role in public controversy. His works “Charismatic Chaos” and the more recent “Strange Fire” mount a frontal attack on Pentecostal and charismatic movements, arguing that their doctrines of revelation and miraculous gifts introduce a second magisterium alongside Scripture, foster a culture vulnerable to manipulation and abuse, and often drift into prosperity teaching and quasi-gnostic elitism. MacArthur’s core thesis overlaps with Warfield: the apostolic age had unique gifts tied to revelation and the foundation of the church, which have ceased. But his distinctive contribution lies in his pastoral and missional critique: charismatism, in his view, not only misreads Scripture but also produces widespread spiritual harm.

Reformed examiners will appreciate MacArthur’s zeal for **sufficiency of Scripture** but will also probe weaknesses in his approach. His rhetoric can flatten distinctions among charismatics, painting careful continuationists like Grudem with the same brush as prosperity preachers. A nuanced cessationism should distinguish between errors that are formally heretical and those that are confused but within evangelical bounds. Moreover, MacArthur at times appears to collapse all claims of contemporary healing or unusual providence into delusion or fraud, which strains against a robust doctrine of God’s free **providence** and the possibility of extraordinary answers to prayer that are not new installments of the gift of healing. One must be able to affirm that God may, in his freedom, heal in striking ways today, while denying any ongoing office or charisma that functions like the New Testament gift.

Internal debates within the Reformed world complicate any neat division. There is a spectrum ranging from “hard cessationism,” which not only denies apostolic gifts but is skeptical of any talk of unusual providences, to “soft cessationism,” which affirms the possibility of striking answers to prayer and rare extraordinary events while maintaining that revelatory gifts and sign gifts as such have ceased. There are also debates about the nature of the gift of healing: is it a stable charisma given to particular persons, or is it the church’s collective privilege to pray for the sick? A solid defense should argue that James 5 prescribes prayer and anointing as acts of faith in God’s ordinary providence, not the exercise of a special office of healer. At the same time, it is wise to avoid binding God to a closed deistic system. The cessationist claim is not that God no longer works wonders but that the pattern of gifts described in 1 Corinthians 12 to 14, connected to new revelation and foundational signification of the gospel, ended with the apostles.

Externally, continuationism and Pentecostal-charismatic theology raise sharp questions for Reformed categories. Classical Pentecostalism often links tongues to a “baptism in the Spirit” experience subsequent to conversion, creating an explicit two-tier Christianity. Third-wave neocharismatics downplay tongues as initial evidence but still emphasize ongoing prophecy and signs as normal. These constructions challenge Reformed **pneumatology**, which locates Spirit-baptism at conversion and unites it to effectual calling and union with Christ. They also introduce pressures on the doctrines of **clarity of Scripture** and **finality of Christ’s work**, suggesting that full assurance or empowered ministry requires something beyond the gospel and sacraments ministered by the ordinary means of grace. The Reformed response must be to anchor every believer’s status and empowerment in union with Christ, received by faith, and to see the Spirit’s ongoing work as deepening participation in that once-given reality, not supplementing it with new revelatory streams.

Contemporary realities complicate the discussion yet further. The center of gravity of global Christianity is now in the global South, where Pentecostal and charismatic forms are dominant. Critics charge that cessationism is a Western, rationalist imposition unable to account for the vibrancy and growth of non-Western churches. In response, a principled cessationism rooted in **redemptive history** can affirm and even rejoice in vibrant, affective, supernaturalist Christianity, while arguing that what is often called “prophecy” or “healing ministry” can be better described as a mixture of strong subjective impressions, cultural patterns of spirituality, and God’s providential care, rather than as continuations of apostolic gifts. Furthermore, Reformed theology has its own strong supernaturalist strand, with doctrines of **effectual calling**, spiritual warfare, and the inner testimony of the Spirit.

Another contemporary concern is discernment and abuse. Continuationist structures that place high authority on leaders’ claimed revelations have sometimes incubated authoritarianism, financial exploitation, and moral failure. Even where doctrinal statements affirm testing prophecy by Scripture, the practical dynamics of “God told me” language can silence critique and relativize biblical commands. Cessationism, by contrast, structurally restricts normativity in the church to Scripture and its proper interpretation. This is not to deny abuse among cessationist churches, but it does close one dangerous avenue by refusing to grant any living person the authoritative mantle of prophet. Examiners might ask whether this is a pragmatic argument rather than a principled one. The response is that pragmatic observations illustrate, rather than ground, a conviction already demanded by principled commitments to **sola Scriptura** and the sufficiency of the apostolic deposit.

Where does this leave the positive doctrine of the Spirit’s work? A defensible cessationist position must not collapse into dry biblicism. It must insist that the Spirit is the living Lord who indwells the church, convicts of sin, illumines the Scriptures, distributes ordinary and extraordinary providences, and gives experiential assurance of adoption. It must do justice to texts like Romans 8 and Galatians 4 on the Spirit of adoption crying “Abba, Father,” without translating them into a constant stream of new locutions. The Spirit’s “witness” is not extra propositions, but a deepened, affective recognition of the truth already written. This is where Edwards’s theology of **religious affections** and Calvin’s doctrine of the **internal testimony of the Spirit** are essential: the Spirit makes the Word effective, rather than supplementing the Word with additional words.

Finally, the debate touches adjacent loci. In ecclesiology, recognizing that apostles and prophets were foundational and unrepeatable offices preserves the uniqueness of the apostolic church and guards against restorationist fantasies. In Christology, the sufficiency of Christ’s once-for-all work in his life, death, and resurrection cautions us against seeking esoteric experiences as if the public gospel were insufficient. In eschatology, texts often cited by continuationists, such as 1 Corinthians 13’s “when the perfect comes,” must be read in context: the “perfect” is the eschaton, not the canon. This means that the mere presence of partial knowledge in the present age does not prove that all gifts continue until the second coming. Instead, the redemptive-historical argument draws on the pattern of Scripture’s own testimony about “foundation” versus “superstructure.”

The position to defend, then, is a robust, redemptive-historical cessationism: the revelatory and sign gifts, by their very nature as organs of special revelation and apostolic attestation, belonged to the foundational era and have ceased as ordinary endowments of the church. God remains free to answer prayer in extraordinary ways, but he does not continue to grant prophecy, tongues, or healing as ongoing gifts analogous to those of the New Testament. This stance preserves the unique authority of the apostolic **canon**, honors the **sufficient Word**, maintains a strong doctrine of the Spirit’s present work in illumination and sanctification, and provides a safer ecclesial framework than systems that normalize ongoing revelation. Examiners will expect you not only to state this conclusion, but to move fluently among Warfield’s redemptive-historical concentration of miracles, Calvin’s foundation-ordinances and internal testimony, Edwards’s criteria for genuine spiritual experience, Lloyd-Jones’s challenge about experientialism and power, Grudem’s attempt to redefine prophecy, and MacArthur’s pastoral critique of charismatic excess, integrating each into a coherent defense rooted in Reformed confessional commitments.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Cessationism holds that extraordinary revelatory and sign gifts tied to the apostolic foundation have ceased; continuationism holds that such gifts continue as ordinary possibilities for the church.
- Decisive figures: Warfield – principled redemptive-historical **cessationism**; Calvin – Scripture-sufficient, foundation-epoch gifts; Edwards – criteria for authentic **religious affections**, skeptical of ongoing revelation; Lloyd-Jones – experiential Reformed preacher, rhetorically open to Acts-like power; Grudem – Reformed-friendly **continuationism** via “fallible prophecy”; MacArthur – pastorally aggressive cessationist critiquing charismatic movements.
- Debates: Internal – extent and form of cessationism, nature of healing, experience and assurance; External – Pentecostal-charismatic doctrines of prophecy, tongues, and Spirit-baptism versus **sola Scriptura**; Contemporary – global South charismatism, abuse and discernment, experiential hunger, and ecclesial authority.
- Defended position: A redemptive-historical, principled cessationism about revelatory and sign gifts, affirming God’s ongoing extraordinary providences and the Spirit’s experiential work through the **sufficient Word** and ordinary means of grace.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does cessationism deny miracles today? No, it denies ongoing miracle-working gifts and new revelation, not God’s freedom to act extraordinarily.
  - How does your view uphold sola Scriptura? By restricting all normative revelation to the closed **canon**, treating all post-apostolic “impressions” as non-revelatory and subordinate to Scripture.
  - What about 1 Corinthians 13 and “when the perfect comes”? The “perfect” is the eschaton, so this text alone does not decide the question; the cessation argument rests on the foundational nature of apostles and prophets.
  - How do you respond to careful continuationists like Grudem? His redefinition of prophecy as fallible revelation lacks solid exegetical warrant and practically undermines sufficiency, even if it intends to protect it.
  - Are you open to unusual events on the mission field? Yes, as possible extraordinary providences, while denying that they normatively reintroduce apostolic-style gifts or new revelation.
