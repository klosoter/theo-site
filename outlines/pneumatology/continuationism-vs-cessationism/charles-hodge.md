# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, was a staunch advocate of **cessationism**, holding that the **extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit**—such as prophecy, tongues, and miracles—ceased with the close of the **apostolic age**. He argued that these gifts were foundational for the establishment of the **New Testament church** and the completion of **Scripture**, after which they were no longer necessary.

- "The miraculous gifts of the Spirit were not designed to be permanent in the Church." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- Princeton Review articles on the Holy Spirit and miracles
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **miraculous gifts** (tongues, prophecy, healing) were given for a specific period in redemptive history.
    - These gifts authenticated the apostles and the initial spread of the **gospel**.
    - With the completion of the **New Testament canon**, their purpose was fulfilled.
    - The ordinary operations of the Spirit now continue in **sanctification** and **illumination**.
    "The design of these gifts was temporary, and when that design was accomplished, they were withdrawn." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - The **Bible** is the complete and final revelation of God for the church.
    - No new revelation or authoritative prophecy is needed after the apostolic era.
    - The church is to rely on the **written Word** for doctrine and practice.
    - Claims of ongoing revelation undermine the **authority of Scripture**.
    "The Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Operations**
    - Hodge distinguished between the **ordinary work of the Spirit** (regeneration, faith, sanctification) and the **extraordinary gifts**.
    - The ordinary work continues in every believer and is essential for salvation.
    - The extraordinary gifts were signs for a specific historical purpose.
    - The absence of miracles does not indicate the Spirit's absence from the church.
    "The Spirit still works in the Church, but not by miracles." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Historical Argument for Cessationism**
    - Hodge appealed to the testimony of **church history** regarding the cessation of miracles.
    - He noted the early church fathers' recognition that such gifts had ceased.
    - The lack of credible miracles after the apostolic age supports cessationism.
    - Claims of miracles in later history are viewed with skepticism.
    "It is a historical fact that the miraculous gifts disappeared with the apostles." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Guarding Against Enthusiasm and Error**
    - Hodge warned that belief in ongoing revelation opens the door to **fanaticism** and doctrinal error.
    - He saw the cessation of gifts as a safeguard for the church’s doctrinal stability.
    - The focus should remain on the **ordinary means of grace**.
    - Spiritual maturity is measured by faithfulness to the Word, not by miraculous experiences.
    "The Church is safe only so long as it abides by the written Word of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **cessationism** became foundational for much of conservative **Reformed theology** in America, especially within Presbyterian circles. His arguments for the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** continue to shape debates on the **continuation of spiritual gifts**. Hodge’s influence endures in the ongoing emphasis on the ordinary means of grace and the authority of the written Word over claims of new revelation.
