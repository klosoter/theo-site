# D.A. Carson (1946–)

D.A. Carson approaches the debate between **continuationism** and **cessationism** with careful exegetical analysis, arguing that the **New Testament gifts of the Spirit** are not explicitly said to have ceased, though he remains cautious about contemporary claims. He affirms the ongoing relevance of **spiritual gifts** while emphasizing the need for discernment and fidelity to **Scripture** as the ultimate authority. Carson’s position is often described as “open but cautious,” balancing openness to the **sovereign work of the Holy Spirit** with a strong commitment to biblical sufficiency.

- "Nowhere does the New Testament explicitly say that the charismata will cease before the parousia." ("Showing the Spirit")

## Key Works

- Showing the Spirit: A Theological Exposition of 1 Corinthians 12–14
- The Gagging of God: Christianity Confronts Pluralism (sections on the Holy Spirit)
- For the Love of God (devotional reflections on spiritual gifts)
- "The Purpose of Signs and Wonders in the New Testament" (Trinity Journal article)
- "Spiritual Gifts: A Contemporary Guide" (chapter in various edited volumes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
   - Upholds the **sufficiency and clarity of Scripture** in evaluating claims about spiritual gifts.
   - Warns against elevating experience above biblical teaching.
   - Insists that all spiritual phenomena must be tested by the Word.
   - Rejects any form of **revelation** that would rival or supplement Scripture.
   - "The ultimate test of all claims to spiritual experience must be the Word of God." (Showing the Spirit)

2. **Open but Cautious Continuationism**
   - Argues that the New Testament does not teach the cessation of gifts.
   - Remains cautious about the authenticity of many modern charismatic manifestations.
   - Encourages openness to the **Spirit’s sovereign activity** today.
   - Stresses the need for discernment and order in the exercise of gifts.
   - "I remain unconvinced by the exegetical arguments for cessationism." (Showing the Spirit)

3. **Purpose of Spiritual Gifts**
   - Emphasizes that gifts are given for the **edification of the church**.
   - Highlights the centrality of **love** in the exercise of all gifts.
   - Notes that gifts are distributed according to the Spirit’s will, not human demand.
   - Warns against pride or division based on the possession of gifts.
   - "The gifts are never ends in themselves, but serve the building up of the body." (Showing the Spirit)

4. **Caution Regarding Modern Claims**
   - Critiques excesses and abuses in some charismatic circles.
   - Calls for careful evaluation of purported miracles and prophecies.
   - Recognizes the possibility of psychological or sociological explanations for some phenomena.
   - Urges humility and repentance where gifts are misused.
   - "Not every claim to a miraculous gift is genuine, nor should every claim be dismissed out of hand." (Showing the Spirit)

5. **Eschatological Perspective on Gifts**
   - Teaches that the **gifts will cease** only at the return of Christ.
   - Interprets 1 Corinthians 13 as pointing to the gifts’ temporary nature until the **parousia**.
   - Affirms that the church remains dependent on the Spirit’s empowering presence.
   - Rejects the idea that the closing of the canon ended the gifts.
   - "The gifts will pass away when perfection comes, that is, at the parousia." (Showing the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Carson’s nuanced approach has significantly shaped evangelical discussions on **continuationism and cessationism**, especially among Reformed and conservative scholars. His exegetical rigor and commitment to **biblical authority** have encouraged a more balanced and discerning engagement with the charismatic movement. Carson’s “open but cautious” stance continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking to navigate the complexities of the Spirit’s work in the church today.
