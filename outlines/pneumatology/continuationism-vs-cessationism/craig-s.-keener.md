# Craig S. Keener (1960– )

Craig S. Keener is a leading advocate of **continuationism**, arguing that the **miraculous gifts of the Spirit** described in the New Testament remain operative in the church today. He challenges **cessationist** claims by appealing to both **biblical exegesis** and extensive **global documentation** of contemporary miracles, emphasizing the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the church.

- "The majority of Christians throughout history and in the world today have believed that miracles continue." ("Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts")

## Key Works

- Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts (2011)
- Gift & Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today (2001)
- Spirit Hermeneutics: Reading Scripture in Light of Pentecost (2016)
- Acts: An Exegetical Commentary (2012–2015)
- "The Spirit in the Gospels and Acts" in The Holy Spirit: In Biblical Teaching, through the Centuries, and Today (2013, ed. Anthony Thiselton)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuation of Miraculous Gifts**
    - Argues that **New Testament** evidence supports the ongoing presence of **miracles**, **prophecy**, and **healing**.
    - Emphasizes that no biblical text explicitly teaches the cessation of gifts.
    - Highlights the global and historical testimony of miraculous experiences among Christians.
    - Critiques **cessationism** as a position rooted more in post-biblical tradition than in Scripture.
    - "There is no clear biblical basis for the claim that miracles were to cease after the apostolic age." (Miracles)

2. **Global Perspective on the Holy Spirit**
    - Draws on reports of miracles from the **Majority World** to challenge Western skepticism.
    - Argues that contemporary experiences of the Spirit align with biblical patterns.
    - Suggests that Western cessationism is culturally conditioned.
    - Uses cross-cultural evidence to demonstrate the Spirit’s ongoing activity.
    - "Miracle claims are not rare in the world today; they are simply less common in the West." (Miracles)

3. **Biblical Hermeneutics and the Spirit**
    - Advocates for a **Spirit-empowered hermeneutic** that takes seriously the role of the Holy Spirit in interpretation.
    - Insists that the **book of Acts** is both descriptive and, in some respects, normative for the church.
    - Argues that the New Testament does not restrict spiritual gifts to the apostolic era.
    - Encourages openness to the Spirit’s work in both understanding and applying Scripture.
    - "The same Spirit who inspired Scripture continues to work among God’s people." (Spirit Hermeneutics)

4. **Critique of Cessationist Arguments**
    - Challenges the exegesis of key cessationist proof texts (e.g., 1 Corinthians 13:8–12).
    - Points out the lack of historical consensus on cessationism in the early church.
    - Argues that cessationist readings often reflect Enlightenment rationalism.
    - Emphasizes the need to let Scripture, not tradition or experience, set expectations for the Spirit’s work.
    - "Cessationism is not the historic position of the church, nor is it the clear teaching of Scripture." (Gift & Giver)

5. **Integration of Scholarship and Experience**
    - Combines rigorous **historical-critical scholarship** with openness to **charismatic experience**.
    - Maintains that academic credibility and belief in miracles are not mutually exclusive.
    - Encourages the church to test, but not quench, claims of the Spirit’s activity.
    - Sees the miraculous as a sign of the **kingdom of God** breaking into the present age.
    - "We should not let abuses or excesses rob us of biblical expectations for God’s power." (Gift & Giver)

## Legacy and Impact

Keener’s work has significantly shaped contemporary debates on **continuationism**, offering a robust scholarly defense of the ongoing reality of **miraculous gifts**. His global perspective and careful exegesis have challenged both academic and ecclesial communities to reconsider assumptions about the **Holy Spirit’s** activity. Keener’s influence is especially notable among evangelicals and Pentecostals seeking to integrate rigorous scholarship with charismatic experience. His writings continue to serve as a major resource for those advocating for the vitality of the Spirit in the life of the church today.
