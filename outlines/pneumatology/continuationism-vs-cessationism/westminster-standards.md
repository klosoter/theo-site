# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a **cessationist** position, teaching that the extraordinary gifts of the **Holy Spirit** (such as prophecy, tongues, and revelatory miracles) were given for the **foundational period** of the church and have ceased with the completion of **Scripture**. They emphasize the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the finality of **special revelation**, grounding the church’s authority in the written Word rather than ongoing supernatural manifestations.

- "Those former ways of God’s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1 and 21)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sufficiency and Finality of Scripture**
    - Scripture contains all things necessary for **faith and life**.
    - No new **revelation** is expected or needed beyond the biblical canon.
    - The church is not to look for further **inspired words** or prophecies.
    - The **Holy Spirit** now works through the written Word, not new revelations.
    - "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man’s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." (WCF 1.6)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - **Prophecy**, tongues, and miraculous gifts served to establish the church.
    - These gifts authenticated the **apostolic message** and era.
    - With the **completion of Scripture**, such gifts are no longer normative.
    - The ordinary means of grace now center on **Word and sacrament**.
    - "Those former ways of God’s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased." (WCF 1.1)

3. **Authority of Scripture Over Experience**
    - All claims of **spiritual experience** must be tested by Scripture.
    - The church is warned against **private revelations** or new prophecies.
    - **Scripture** alone is the rule of faith and practice.
    - The sufficiency of the Bible guards against **enthusiasm** and error.
    - "The Spirit speaking in the Scripture is the supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined." (WCF 1.10)

4. **Ordinary Means of Grace**
    - The **preaching of the Word**, sacraments, and prayer are the means God uses today.
    - The church is to expect spiritual growth through these ordinary means, not through new signs or wonders.
    - The focus is on **edification** and maturity in Christ.
    - Extraordinary gifts are not necessary for the **life of the church**.
    - "The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption are his ordinances, especially the Word, sacraments, and prayer." (WSC 88)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
    - The **Spirit** illumines and applies the Word to believers’ hearts.
    - The Spirit’s work is inward, sanctifying, and convicting, not revelatory in the apostolic sense.
    - Assurance and guidance come through the **Scriptures** and the Spirit’s inward testimony.
    - The Spirit does not add to the **canon** or give new doctrines.
    - "Our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts." (WCF 1.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed and Presbyterian theology**, establishing a robust cessationist framework that prioritizes the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the ordinary means of grace. Their influence continues in confessional churches, providing a bulwark against charismatic and continuationist movements. By grounding the church’s authority in the completed canon, the Standards have contributed to a stable and enduring doctrine of revelation within the broader Protestant tradition.
