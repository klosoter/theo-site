# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a leading advocate of **cessationism**, arguing that the **miraculous gifts of the Spirit** ceased with the close of the **apostolic age**. He grounded his position in a high view of **Scripture’s sufficiency** and the unique, unrepeatable role of **revelatory gifts** in the foundation of the **New Testament church**.

- "The miraculous gifts were part of the credentials of the Apostles as authoritative agents of God in founding the Church." ("Counterfeit Miracles")

## Key Works

- Counterfeit Miracles
- Revelation and Inspiration
- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on miracles and the Holy Spirit)
- Calvin and Augustine (for historical-theological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Miraculous Gifts Were Apostolic Signs**
    - Miraculous gifts authenticated the unique authority of the apostles.
    - These gifts were not intended as a permanent feature of church life.
    - The cessation of apostleship entailed the cessation of their signs.
    - The gifts served to establish the foundation of the church.
    - "These gifts were distinctively the authentication of the Apostles."

2. **Scripture’s Sufficiency and Finality**
    - The canon of Scripture is closed and fully sufficient for faith and life.
    - Ongoing revelation would undermine the finality of the biblical witness.
    - The church is to look to Scripture, not new revelations, for guidance.
    - The miraculous gifts were tied to the revelatory period of redemptive history.
    - "When the canon of Scripture was closed, the necessity for miraculous gifts ceased."

3. **Historical Discontinuity of Miracles**
    - Warfield argued that post-apostolic claims to miracles lack credible evidence.
    - He conducted historical analysis to show the decline of miracles after the first century.
    - The church fathers themselves acknowledged the cessation of such gifts.
    - Claims of later miracles are best explained by psychological or sociological factors.
    - "The working of miracles...passed away with its occasion."

4. **Miracles as Redemptive-Historical Markers**
    - Miracles cluster around key redemptive epochs (Moses, Elijah/Elisha, Christ/apostles).
    - They serve to authenticate new revelation and covenantal shifts.
    - The ordinary life of the church is not marked by ongoing miracles.
    - The expectation of miracles misunderstands their biblical function.
    - "Miracles do not appear on the pages of Scripture vagrantly, here, there, and elsewhere indifferently."

5. **Opposition to Continuationism**
    - Warfield critiqued contemporary claims of tongues, prophecy, and healing.
    - He saw such claims as undermining the authority of Scripture.
    - He warned against confusing psychological phenomena with genuine spiritual gifts.
    - Continuationism was viewed as a threat to Reformed orthodoxy.
    - "The Charismata...have long since disappeared from the Church."

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **cessationism** shaped the Reformed and evangelical response to Pentecostal and Charismatic movements throughout the twentieth century. His arguments for the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique role of the apostolic age remain foundational in many conservative theological circles. While his historical-critical approach has been challenged by some, Warfield’s work continues to be a touchstone in debates over the **continuation of spiritual gifts**.
