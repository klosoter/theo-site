# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms is a leading advocate of **continuationism**, arguing that the **miraculous gifts of the Spirit**—such as prophecy, tongues, and healing—continue to operate in the church today. He contends that **cessationism** lacks sufficient biblical warrant and that the **New Testament** provides a normative pattern for the ongoing presence of **charismatic gifts** within the life of the church.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuation of Spiritual Gifts**
    - The **gifts of the Spirit** described in the New Testament are intended for the entire church age.
    - There is no clear biblical evidence that miraculous gifts were limited to the apostolic era.
    - The purpose of spiritual gifts is to edify the church and glorify Christ.
    - The cessationist argument from church history is insufficient and not determinative.
    - "The burden of proof rests with those who claim that certain gifts have ceased." (The Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Gifts)

2. **Biblical Authority and Sola Scriptura**
    - All claims regarding spiritual gifts must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - Continuationism does not undermine the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - Prophecy and other gifts are always subject to biblical discernment and correction.
    - The **canon of Scripture** is closed, but the Spirit’s work continues.
    - "No spiritual gift, no matter how dramatic, can ever add to or supersede the authority of Scripture." (Practicing the Power)

3. **Distinction Between Canonical Revelation and Prophecy**
    - **Prophecy** in the New Testament is not equal to Scripture in authority.
    - Prophetic utterances are fallible and must be weighed and tested.
    - The gift of prophecy serves to encourage, edify, and comfort believers.
    - The closing of the canon does not necessitate the cessation of prophecy.
    - "Prophecy is always subordinate to and tested by the written Word of God." (Convergence)

4. **Charismatic Experience within Reformed Theology**
    - Continuationism is compatible with **Reformed soteriology** and theology.
    - The Holy Spirit’s gifts are for the building up of the body, not for self-exaltation.
    - Spiritual gifts should be exercised decently and in order, following Paul’s instructions.
    - The pursuit of spiritual gifts should be marked by humility and love.
    - "Charismatic experience and Reformed theology are not mutually exclusive." (Convergence)

5. **Pastoral Guidance and Discernment**
    - The exercise of spiritual gifts requires wise pastoral oversight.
    - Leaders must teach discernment and guard against excess or abuse.
    - The church should foster an environment open to the Spirit’s work, yet grounded in truth.
    - Encouragement of spiritual gifts must be balanced with biblical order and accountability.
    - "We must not quench the Spirit, but neither should we be gullible." (The Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Gifts)

## Legacy and Impact

Sam Storms has played a pivotal role in articulating a robust, biblically grounded case for **continuationism** within evangelical and Reformed circles. His writings have encouraged many to reconsider the ongoing role of the **gifts of the Spirit** and to pursue a balanced, scripturally faithful charismatic practice. Storms’ integration of charismatic experience with Reformed theology has influenced pastors, scholars, and lay leaders, helping to bridge gaps between traditionally cessationist and charismatic communities.
