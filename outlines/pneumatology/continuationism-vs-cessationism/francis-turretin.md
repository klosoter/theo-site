# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust defense of **cessationism**, arguing that the **extraordinary gifts of the Spirit**—such as prophecy, tongues, and miracles—were unique to the **apostolic era** and have ceased with the close of the **canon**. He maintained that these gifts served to authenticate the foundational revelation of Scripture and are no longer necessary in the ongoing life of the church.

- "The question is whether these extraordinary gifts of the Spirit are to be expected in the church today, or whether they have ceased. We affirm the latter." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.24.5)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - The **extraordinary gifts** (miracles, prophecy, tongues) were given for a specific, temporary purpose.
    - These gifts authenticated the **apostolic message** and the foundation of the church.
    - With the completion of the **New Testament canon**, their necessity ceased.
    - The ordinary means of grace now suffice for the church’s edification.
    - "They were necessary for the planting of the church, but not for its preservation." (Institutes, 3.24.6)

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - The **canon of Scripture** is now complete and fully sufficient for faith and practice.
    - No new revelation or confirming sign is needed beyond what is already given.
    - The church is to rely on the **Word and sacraments** as the primary means of grace.
    - Claims of ongoing revelation undermine the finality of the biblical witness.
    - "The Scriptures are perfect and complete, needing no addition of new revelations." (Institutes, 2.4.7)

3. **Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Operations**
    - Turretin distinguishes between **ordinary operations** (sanctification, illumination) and **extraordinary operations** (miracles, prophecy).
    - Ordinary operations continue in the church through the Spirit’s work.
    - Extraordinary operations were tied to the **apostolic office** and have ceased.
    - The Spirit’s ongoing work is now primarily through the ordinary means.
    - "The extraordinary gifts were tied to the extraordinary office of the apostles." (Institutes, 3.24.5)

4. **Purpose of Miracles and Signs**
    - Miracles served as **signs** to confirm the divine origin of the apostolic message.
    - Their primary function was to establish the credibility of the gospel in its initial proclamation.
    - Once the church was established and the canon closed, their function was fulfilled.
    - The expectation of ongoing miracles is unwarranted and potentially dangerous.
    - "Miracles were seals of the doctrine, not perpetual ornaments of the church." (Institutes, 3.24.7)

5. **Rejection of Modern Claims to Extraordinary Gifts**
    - Turretin critiques claims of ongoing prophecy, tongues, or miracles in his own era.
    - He views such claims as either delusional or deceptive, lacking biblical warrant.
    - The Reformed tradition must guard against **enthusiasm** and false revelations.
    - True spiritual vitality is found in the ordinary ministry of the Word.
    - "We must beware of those who, under pretense of the Spirit, introduce novelties contrary to Scripture." (Institutes, 3.24.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of **cessationism** became a cornerstone for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping confessional standards and theological education in the tradition. His careful distinctions and scriptural arguments continue to inform debates on the **continuation or cessation of spiritual gifts**. Turretin’s influence is especially evident in the Westminster tradition, where his views on the sufficiency of Scripture and the cessation of extraordinary gifts remain highly regarded.
