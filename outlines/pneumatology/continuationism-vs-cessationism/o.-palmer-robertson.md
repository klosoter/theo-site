# O. Palmer Robertson (1937– )

O. Palmer Robertson is a leading advocate of **cessationism**, arguing that the **extraordinary gifts of the Spirit** (such as prophecy, tongues, and miraculous healings) were unique to the **apostolic era** and have ceased with the close of the **canon**. He grounds his position in a **redemptive-historical** framework, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture** for the church’s life and ministry.

- "The completion of the canon of Scripture marks the close of the era of revelatory gifts." ("The Final Word: A Biblical Response to the Case for Tongues and Prophecy Today")

## Key Works

- The Final Word: A Biblical Response to the Case for Tongues and Prophecy Today
- The Christ of the Covenants
- The Holy Spirit: His Person and Work (various essays and lectures)
- "Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?" (contributor, edited by Wayne Grudem)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cessation of Revelatory Gifts**
    - Argues that **prophecy**, **tongues**, and **miraculous healings** were foundational for the early church.
    - These gifts authenticated the **apostolic message** and were tied to the formation of the **New Testament canon**.
    - With the completion of **Scripture**, the need for new revelation ceased.
    - The church is now governed by the **sufficiency of the written Word**.
    - "With the closing of the canon, the revelatory gifts have fulfilled their purpose." (The Final Word)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - Views the history of redemption as unfolding in distinct epochs, each marked by unique signs.
    - The **apostolic age** was a unique, unrepeatable period in salvation history.
    - Extraordinary gifts served as signs authenticating the new covenant revelation.
    - The ongoing work of the Spirit is now primarily through the **ordinary means of grace**.
    - "The miraculous gifts were never intended to be the norm for the ongoing life of the church." (The Final Word)

3. **Sufficiency and Authority of Scripture**
    - Emphasizes that **Scripture alone** is the final authority for faith and practice.
    - Additional revelation through prophecy or tongues would undermine the sufficiency of the Bible.
    - The **canon** is closed; no new normative revelation is expected.
    - The Spirit’s work is to illumine, not supplement, the Word.
    - "The church must look to the written Word as its only infallible rule." (The Final Word)

4. **Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Gifts**
    - Recognizes the ongoing presence of **ordinary gifts** (teaching, service, encouragement).
    - Extraordinary gifts were temporary and foundational.
    - The Spirit continues to empower believers for ministry through ordinary means.
    - The focus should be on edification through the ordinary gifts.
    - "The ordinary gifts of the Spirit are sufficient for the building up of the church today." (The Final Word)

5. **Pastoral Caution Against Modern Claims**
    - Warns against the dangers of seeking new revelation or miraculous experiences.
    - Stresses the importance of discernment and testing all claims by Scripture.
    - Encourages reliance on the **ordinary means of grace**: Word, sacraments, and prayer.
    - Sees the pursuit of extraordinary gifts as a distraction from biblical priorities.
    - "The quest for the miraculous often leads away from the sufficiency of Christ and his Word." (The Final Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Robertson’s robust defense of **cessationism** has shaped Reformed and Presbyterian responses to the charismatic movement, reinforcing the centrality of **Scripture** and the **ordinary means of grace**. His redemptive-historical approach has influenced generations of pastors and theologians to view the apostolic gifts as unique to the foundational era of the church. Robertson’s work continues to be a standard reference in debates over the continuation or cessation of miraculous gifts.
