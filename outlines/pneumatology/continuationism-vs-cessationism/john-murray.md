# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, approached the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** with careful exegetical and theological analysis. While he affirmed the foundational and unrepeatable nature of the **apostolic office** and **revelatory gifts**, Murray was cautious about dogmatically asserting the absolute cessation of all **extraordinary gifts** in the post-apostolic era, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**.

- "We must not suppose that Scripture warrants us in saying that the Holy Spirit may not, if he pleases, reproduce any of the phenomena of Pentecost." ("The Epistle to the Romans," Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959, 1965)

- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 1: "The Claims of Truth" (1976)
- "Principles of Conduct" (1957)

    - Held that new **revelation** is unnecessary after the completion of Scripture.
    - Saw the **apostolic witness** as unique and foundational for the church.
    - Warned against claims of ongoing revelation that undermine biblical authority.
    - "The canon of Scripture is closed and is the only infallible rule of faith and practice." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Apostolic Gifts as Foundational**
    - Identified certain **spiritual gifts** (e.g., prophecy, tongues) as tied to the apostolic era.
    - Taught that these gifts served to authenticate the **apostolic message**.
    - Believed their primary function ceased with the end of the apostolic age.
    - Distinguished between foundational and continuing gifts in the church.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit which were signs of apostleship are not to be expected as the ordinary equipment of the church." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Openness to Divine Sovereignty**
    - Maintained that God is sovereign and not bound by human expectations.
    - Refused to categorically deny the possibility of extraordinary works of the Spirit.
    - Affirmed that the Spirit may act in exceptional ways according to divine will.
    - Cautioned against limiting God’s freedom in the present age.
    - "We must not set bounds to the Holy Spirit’s operations where Scripture has not set them." (Romans, Vol. 1)

4. **Distinction Between Normative and Exceptional**
    - Differentiated between what is normative for the church and what is exceptional.
    - Held that the regular means of grace are **Word and sacrament**.
    - Saw extraordinary gifts as non-normative for the ongoing life of the church.
    - Encouraged discernment regarding claims of miraculous gifts.
    - "The ordinary operations of the Spirit are to be sought and cherished above all." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Pastoral Caution and Discernment**

    - Warned against fanaticism and undue emphasis on the miraculous.
    - Emphasized the primacy of **edification** and **order** in the church.

    - "The test of the Spirit’s presence is not the miraculous but the fruit of the Spirit." (Principles of Conduct)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s nuanced approach to **cessationism** has influenced generations of Reformed theologians, particularly in his insistence on the sufficiency of Scripture and the foundational nature of the apostolic era. His careful exegesis and pastoral sensitivity have shaped discussions on the **gifts of the Spirit** within conservative Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Murray’s legacy endures in his balanced refusal to limit God’s sovereignty while upholding the unique authority of the biblical canon.
