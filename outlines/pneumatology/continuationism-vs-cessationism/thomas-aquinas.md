# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas addressed the question of **miracles**, **prophecy**, and the **extraordinary gifts of the Spirit** within the framework of **sacramental theology** and the **economy of salvation**. He is often cited as a classical source for a **cessationist** perspective, arguing that the **charismatic gifts** given in the apostolic era were primarily for the **foundation of the Church** and are not normative for the ongoing life of the Church, though he allowed for the possibility of miracles by God’s sovereign will.

- "As the faith spread abroad, the need for these signs ceased." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 174, a. 6)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Miracles as Signs for the Foundation of the Church**
    - Miracles and **extraordinary gifts** were primarily given to confirm the apostolic preaching.
    - These signs were necessary when the faith was new and needed divine attestation.
    - Once the Church was established, the ordinary means of grace became normative.
    - Miracles can still occur, but not as a regular or expected feature of Christian life.
    - "Therefore, such signs are not necessary in every age, but only when the faith must be made manifest to the world." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 178, a. 1)

2. **Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Gifts**
    - Aquinas distinguishes between **gratia gratis data** (extraordinary, for others) and **gratia gratum faciens** (sanctifying, for the recipient).
    - The former includes prophecy, tongues, and miracles; the latter includes faith, hope, and charity.
    - The ordinary life of the Church is sustained by sanctifying grace, not by extraordinary gifts.
    - Extraordinary gifts are not a sign of personal holiness.
    - "The gratuitous graces are given for the profit of others, not for the sanctification of the one who receives them." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 111, a. 1)

3. **Cessation of Certain Charisms**
    - Aquinas teaches that some **charisms** (e.g., tongues, prophecy) were especially for the apostolic age.
    - Their cessation is linked to the completion of the **apostolic witness** and the spread of the Gospel.
    - He allows that God may still grant such gifts in extraordinary circumstances.
    - The normative expectation is their absence in the ordinary life of the Church.
    - "It was necessary for such signs to be given at the beginning of the Church, but not after it had been confirmed." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 174, a. 6)

4. **Ongoing Possibility of Miracles by Divine Sovereignty**
    - Aquinas affirms that God is always able to perform miracles.
    - Miracles are not bound to any era but are subject to God’s will and purpose.
    - The regularity of miracles is not to be expected, but their possibility is never denied.
    - Miracles serve to remind the faithful of God’s power and providence.
    - "God does sometimes work miracles through the saints, not for the establishment of the faith, but for the glory of the saints or the welfare of the faithful." (Summa Contra Gentiles III, 101)

5. **Authority of Scripture and the Ordinary Means of Grace**
    - The **canon of Scripture** and the **sacraments** are sufficient for the Church’s ongoing life.
    - The extraordinary gifts were never meant to replace the ordinary means.
    - The Church’s authority is grounded in Scripture and tradition, not ongoing revelation.
    - The sufficiency of the means of grace is a mark of the Church’s maturity.
    - "The doctrine of the apostles and prophets is contained in the canonical Scriptures, to which nothing can be added." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 1, a. 10)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s nuanced articulation of **cessationism** has profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and Protestant understandings of the **charismatic gifts** and their role in the Church. His distinction between **extraordinary and ordinary gifts** remains foundational in systematic theology, especially in discussions of the **means of grace** and the sufficiency of Scripture. While later traditions have developed his insights in different directions, Aquinas’s influence endures in debates over the ongoing validity of miracles and spiritual gifts.
