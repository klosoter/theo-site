# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** with a nuanced perspective shaped by his commitment to the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique role of **apostolic revelation**. While he affirmed the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer and the church, Luther generally held that the **extraordinary gifts** (such as prophecy and tongues) were primarily tied to the **apostolic era** and not normative for the post-apostolic church.

- "For God gave the apostles the Spirit and performed miracles through them to establish the doctrine, but now that the doctrine is established and in force, there is no need for such miracles." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Table Talk
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 24: Sermons on the Gospel of St. John
- Luther’s Catechisms (Small and Large)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the final and complete authority for faith and practice.
    - The canon is closed; new revelation is not expected or needed.
    - All spiritual gifts and experiences must be tested by Scripture.
    - The Word is the primary means by which God speaks to His people today.
    - "The Holy Scriptures alone are to be our guide; from them we are to learn what is necessary for our salvation." (Table Talk)

2. **Apostolic Foundation of Extraordinary Gifts**
    - Miraculous gifts were given to authenticate the apostolic message.
    - Such gifts were necessary for the initial establishment of the church.
    - The normative function of miracles ceased with the close of the apostolic age.
    - Later claims to miraculous gifts are viewed with skepticism.
    - "Miracles were necessary in the beginning to confirm the doctrine, but now that the doctrine is confirmed, they are no longer needed." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Ongoing Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit continues to regenerate, sanctify, and comfort believers.
    - The Spirit works primarily through the means of grace: Word and Sacrament.
    - Spiritual renewal and illumination are ongoing realities for the church.
    - The Spirit’s presence is not dependent on visible signs or wonders.
    - "The Holy Spirit is present in the Word, in Baptism, and in the Lord’s Supper." (Large Catechism)

4. **Discernment Against Enthusiasm (Schwärmerei)**
    - Luther warned against spiritual movements claiming direct revelation apart from Scripture.
    - He critiqued the "enthusiasts" for undermining the authority of the Word.
    - True spiritual experience is always tethered to biblical revelation.
    - Claims of new prophecy or tongues are to be tested and often rejected.
    - "Whatever does not have its origin in the Word is certainly from the devil." (Against the Heavenly Prophets)

5. **Prayer and Providence in the Christian Life**
    - God continues to answer prayer and intervene providentially.
    - Miracles are possible but are not normative or expected.
    - The focus is on faith in God’s promises rather than pursuit of signs.
    - The ordinary Christian life is marked by trust in God’s ongoing care.
    - "We should not tempt God by demanding miracles, but trust in His Word and providence." (Sermons on the Gospel of St. John)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s stance on **continuationism vs cessationism** shaped the trajectory of Protestant thought, emphasizing the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique role of the apostolic era in redemptive history. His warnings against **enthusiasm** influenced later Reformed and Lutheran approaches to spiritual gifts, fostering a cautious attitude toward claims of ongoing revelation. While affirming the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, Luther’s theology contributed to a broadly cessationist outlook within confessional Protestantism. His legacy endures in the way many churches prioritize the Word and sacraments as the primary means of grace.
