# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin is a central figure in the development of **Reformed theology**, and his stance on **continuationism vs cessationism** is foundational for later Protestant thought. Calvin argued that the **extraordinary gifts of the Spirit** (such as prophecy, tongues, and miracles) were given for the **apostolic age** to authenticate the gospel and are no longer normative in the life of the church after the close of the **canon of Scripture**.

- "The gift of healing, like the rest of the miracles, which the Lord willed to be brought forth for a time, has vanished away in order to make the preaching of the gospel marvelous forever." (Institutes 4.19.18)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book IV)
- Commentaries on Acts
- Commentaries on 1 Corinthians
- Sermons on the Book of Acts
- The Necessity of Reforming the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Miraculous Gifts Were Temporary**
   - The **extraordinary gifts** were given to confirm the apostolic message.
   - These gifts were not intended to be permanent features of the church.
   - Their cessation is linked to the completion of the **New Testament canon**.
   - Calvin saw their disappearance as evidence of the sufficiency of Scripture.
   - "The Lord willed to do miracles only for a time, that they might be a seal of his gospel." (Institutes 4.19.18)

2. **Sufficiency of Scripture**
   - The **canon** is now closed and fully authoritative.
   - No new revelation is needed beyond what is contained in Scripture.
   - The church is to be governed by the Word, not by ongoing prophecy or signs.
   - The Spirit works through the Word, not through new miraculous phenomena.
   - "For God did not will that we should seek his Word elsewhere than in the Scriptures." (Institutes 4.8.9)

3. **Purpose of Miracles**
   - Miracles served as **attestation** of the apostolic message.
   - Their primary function was to authenticate the gospel during its initial proclamation.
   - Once the church was established, miracles were no longer necessary.
   - Ongoing miracles would undermine the unique authority of the apostles.
   - "Miracles were aids to the gospel at its beginning, but ceased as soon as the gospel was established." (Commentary on Mark 16:17)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit**
   - The Spirit now works primarily through **illumination** of Scripture.
   - The Spirit’s ongoing ministry is to apply the benefits of Christ to believers.
   - The Spirit does not regularly bestow new revelatory gifts.
   - The ordinary means of grace are sufficient for the church’s edification.
   - "The Holy Spirit is not promised to make new revelations, but to seal the truth of the gospel in our hearts." (Institutes 1.9.3)

5. **Guarding Against Enthusiasm**
   - Calvin warned against **spiritual enthusiasm** that sought new revelations.
   - He saw claims to ongoing prophecy as a threat to the authority of Scripture.
   - Such claims often led to disorder and doctrinal error in the church.
   - True spirituality is grounded in the Word, not in new signs or wonders.
   - "Those who, leaving the Scripture, imagine to themselves any way of coming to God, are deluded by a vain and lying spirit." (Institutes 1.9.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s **cessationist** position became normative for much of the Reformed tradition, shaping confessional standards and church practice. His emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the temporary nature of miraculous gifts provided a theological foundation for later debates on spiritual gifts. Calvin’s warnings against enthusiasm influenced subsequent Reformed critiques of charismatic movements. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the authority of the Word and the ordinary means of grace.
