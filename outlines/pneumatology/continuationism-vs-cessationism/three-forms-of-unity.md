# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed** stance on the question of **continuationism vs cessationism**. These confessions affirm the sufficiency and finality of **Scripture**, viewing the extraordinary gifts of the **Holy Spirit** (such as prophecy and tongues) as having ceased with the close of the **apostolic era**. The focus is on the ongoing work of the Spirit in **illumination** and **sanctification** through ordinary means.

- "We believe that this Holy Scripture fully contains the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 3–7, 29
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19, 65–68
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads III/IV, Articles 6–7
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Sufficient and Complete**
    - The **canon** of Scripture is closed; no new revelation is expected.
    - All that is necessary for **faith and salvation** is contained in the Bible.
    - The confessions reject any claim to ongoing **prophetic or apostolic revelation**.
    - The church is to test all teaching by the **written Word** alone.
    - "We reject all that does not agree with this infallible rule." (Belgic Confession, Art. 7)

2. **Extraordinary Gifts Were for the Apostolic Era**
    - **Miraculous gifts** (prophecy, tongues, healing) served to confirm the gospel in its foundational period.
    - These gifts are not presented as normative for the post-apostolic church.
    - The confessions emphasize the **apostolic foundation** as unique and unrepeatable.
    - The ordinary means of grace—**Word and sacrament**—are now central.
    - "The apostles...were immediately called by God...and their successors are not apostles." (Belgic Confession, Art. 30)

3. **The Spirit Works Through Ordinary Means**
    - The **Holy Spirit** continues to work powerfully in the church.
    - This work is primarily through the **preaching of the Word** and the sacraments.
    - The Spirit brings **illumination, regeneration, and sanctification**.
    - The confessions do not anticipate ongoing miraculous manifestations.
    - "Faith comes from the Holy Spirit who works it in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 65)

4. **Rejection of Enthusiasm and Private Revelation**
    - The confessions warn against **subjective spiritual experiences** as sources of authority.
    - Claims to new revelation are seen as undermining the **sufficiency of Scripture**.
    - The church is to be guarded against **enthusiastic** or **fanatical** movements.
    - True assurance and guidance come through the **Word and Spirit**, not private voices.
    - "We reject all human inventions and laws...introducing a new worship of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 32)

5. **Ongoing Spiritual Gifts Are Ordinary, Not Extraordinary**
    - The Spirit continues to give gifts for **edification**, such as teaching, service, and leadership.
    - These gifts are to be exercised in accordance with **Scripture**.
    - The confessions do not deny the Spirit’s power, but restrict extraordinary gifts to the **apostolic age**.
    - The focus is on the building up of the church through **ordinary ministry**.
    - "Christ...governs us by the same Word and Spirit by which He united us to Himself." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 31)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped the **Reformed tradition’s** stance on **cessationism**, providing a confessional basis for the belief that extraordinary gifts ceased with the apostles. Their emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the ordinary means of grace continues to influence Reformed and Presbyterian churches worldwide. These confessions have served as a bulwark against both charismatic excesses and doctrinal innovation, anchoring the church in the authority of the written Word.
