# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** through his program of **demythologization**, arguing that the **New Testament**'s accounts of miracles and spiritual gifts must be interpreted existentially rather than as literal, ongoing phenomena. For Bultmann, the significance of **revelation** lies not in supernatural events but in the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—which calls individuals to authentic faith. Thus, he effectively set aside both continuationist and cessationist positions in favor of a focus on existential encounter.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." ("New Testament and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Kerygma and Myth" (1948, ed. Hans Werner Bartsch)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - The supernatural elements of the New Testament are mythological expressions of existential truths.
    - Miracles and spiritual gifts are not to be understood as literal, ongoing phenomena.
    - The task of theology is to interpret biblical texts in a way that makes sense to modern people.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential message behind mythic language.
    - "The mythical eschatology is incredible for modern man, but its existential meaning can and must be made clear." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not the continuation of miraculous gifts.
    - Faith arises from hearing the kerygma, not from witnessing supernatural events.
    - The kerygma confronts individuals with the call to authentic existence.
    - The ongoing relevance of the New Testament is in its existential challenge, not in perpetuated miracles.
    - "What matters is not the objective historicity of the events, but their existential meaning for the hearer." ("Kerygma and Myth")

3. **Existential Interpretation of Revelation**
    - Revelation is not a transmission of supernatural phenomena but an existential encounter.
    - The Holy Spirit's work is understood as awakening authentic existence, not as bestowing miraculous gifts.
    - The focus is on personal transformation rather than external signs.
    - The meaning of the New Testament is accessible through existential understanding, not through continuation of gifts.
    - "Faith is the surrender of the self to the word of God as it encounters us in the kerygma." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Rejection of Supernaturalism**
    - Modern scientific worldview renders belief in ongoing miracles untenable.
    - The supernatural worldview of the New Testament is a product of its time.
    - Theology must be credible to contemporary people, which excludes belief in continuing miraculous gifts.
    - The reality of God is not dependent on supernatural interventions.
    - "We cannot use electric light and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." ("New Testament and Mythology")

5. **Historical-Critical Method**
    - The New Testament must be interpreted using critical, historical methods.
    - Reports of miracles and gifts are understood as expressions of early Christian faith, not as normative for today.
    - The historical-critical approach separates the existential message from mythological form.
    - This method leads to a non-continuationist stance by default, as it denies the ongoing reality of supernatural gifts.
    - "The historical method compels us to distinguish between the message and its mythological clothing." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **demythologization** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in its skepticism toward both continuationist and cessationist debates as traditionally framed. By focusing on the existential meaning of the **kerygma**, he redirected attention from supernatural gifts to the transformative encounter with Christ. His influence persists in contemporary discussions about the relevance of the New Testament in a scientific age, challenging theologians to articulate faith in terms that resonate with modern existential concerns.
