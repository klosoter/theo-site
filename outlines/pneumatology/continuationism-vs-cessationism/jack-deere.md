# Jack Deere (1952– )

Jack Deere is a leading proponent of **continuationism**, contending that the **miraculous gifts of the Spirit**—such as prophecy, healing, and tongues—continue to function in the church today. He challenges **cessationism** as lacking strong **biblical** and theological support, urging the church to embrace the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** within the boundaries of **Scripture**.

- "The Bible never teaches that spiritual gifts will cease before the coming of the Lord." ("Surprised by the Power of the Spirit")

## Key Works

- Surprised by the Power of the Spirit (1993)
- Surprised by the Voice of God (1996)
- "Why I Am No Longer a Cessationist" (in Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views, 1996)
- The Beginner’s Guide to the Gift of Prophecy (2001)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuation of Miraculous Gifts**
    - The **New Testament** does not teach the cessation of gifts such as prophecy, healing, and tongues.
    - The purpose of gifts is the **edification** and mission of the church until Christ returns.
    - Arguments for cessationism are based on experience or tradition, not exegesis.
    - The Spirit distributes gifts according to His will, not according to a dispensational timeline.
    "There is not a single verse in the Bible that teaches the gifts of the Spirit have ceased." (Surprised by the Power of the Spirit)

2. **Authority of Scripture**
    - All experiences and claims of spiritual gifts must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - The **canon** is closed; new revelation does not add to or supersede the Bible.
    - Prophetic gifts are always subordinate to the authority of the written Word.
    - Continuationism does not undermine **sola Scriptura**.
    "The Bible is the final authority for faith and practice, even in the exercise of spiritual gifts." (Surprised by the Voice of God)

3. **Critique of Cessationist Exegesis**
    - Key cessationist proof texts (e.g., 1 Corinthians 13:8–12) are misapplied.
    - The claim that gifts ceased with the apostles is historically and biblically unfounded.
    - Cessationism often arises from reaction to abuses, not biblical mandate.
    - The early church and post-apostolic fathers reported ongoing gifts.
    "Cessationism is a tradition of men, not a doctrine of Scripture." (Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?)

4. **Role of Experience in Theology**
    - Personal and communal experience of the Spirit’s power is valid but must be discerned.
    - Testimonies of healing and prophecy should be evaluated, not dismissed.
    - Experience can challenge inherited theological paradigms.
    - The Spirit’s work is both experiential and doctrinal.
    "My theology changed because my experience forced me to re-examine the Scriptures." (Surprised by the Power of the Spirit)

5. **Edification and Mission of the Church**
    - The gifts are given for the **building up** of the body of Christ.
    - Miraculous gifts serve evangelism and compassion ministries.
    - Every believer is encouraged to seek and use spiritual gifts.
    - The church should foster an environment open to the Spirit’s leading.
    "The gifts of the Spirit are for the common good and the advancement of the gospel." (The Beginner’s Guide to the Gift of Prophecy)

## Legacy and Impact

Jack Deere has been instrumental in articulating a biblically grounded case for **continuationism** within evangelical and Reformed contexts. His writings have challenged many to reconsider the role of the **Holy Spirit** and the ongoing validity of spiritual gifts. Deere’s influence has encouraged a renewed openness to charismatic practices while maintaining a high view of **Scripture**. His legacy is evident in the growing acceptance of the Spirit’s gifts in historically non-charismatic churches.
