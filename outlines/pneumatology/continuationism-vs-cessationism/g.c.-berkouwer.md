# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the debate over **continuationism vs cessationism** with a focus on the centrality of **revelation**, the **authority of Scripture**, and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He was cautious about both rigid cessationist claims and uncritical acceptance of modern charismatic phenomena, emphasizing the sufficiency of **biblical revelation** and the importance of discerning the Spirit’s activity within the framework of **redemptive history**.

- "The question is not whether the Spirit works, but how the Spirit works in the light of the completed revelation." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Work of the Holy Spirit (De Heilige Geest)
- Holy Scripture (De Heilige Schrift)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Christocentric and Complete**
   - Emphasizes that **special revelation** culminates in Christ and is inscripturated in **Scripture**.
   - Argues that new revelatory gifts are unnecessary after the closure of the **canon**.
   - Sees the sufficiency of Scripture as foundational for the church’s life and doctrine.
   - Warns against seeking new revelation that would supplement or rival the biblical witness.
   - "The fullness of revelation in Christ excludes the necessity of new, supplementary revelations." (Holy Scripture)

2. **The Holy Spirit’s Work is Not Limited to the Apostolic Age**
   - Affirms the ongoing presence and activity of the **Holy Spirit** in the church.
   - Distinguishes between the unique, foundational role of the Spirit in **apostolic revelation** and the Spirit’s ongoing work in **illumination** and **sanctification**.
   - Rejects a strict cessationism that denies any supernatural activity after the apostolic era.
   - Maintains that the Spirit continues to edify, guide, and empower believers.
   - "The Spirit’s work is not exhausted in the apostolic age, but continues in the life of the church." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

3. **Discernment of Spiritual Gifts**
   - Stresses the need for discernment regarding claims of **spiritual gifts** and miraculous phenomena.
   - Insists that all experiences must be tested by the **norm of Scripture**.
   - Warns against both credulity and skepticism in evaluating charismatic claims.
   - Recognizes the potential for both genuine and spurious manifestations.
   - "Discernment is required lest the church be led astray by every wind of doctrine." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

4. **Sufficiency and Authority of Scripture**
   - Upholds the **sufficiency** of Scripture for faith and practice.
   - Argues that the authority of Scripture is not dependent on ongoing revelation or miraculous signs.
   - Maintains that the Spirit works through the Word to bring conviction and transformation.
   - Views any claim to new revelation as a threat to the finality of the biblical canon.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not enhanced by new revelations, but stands complete in itself." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
   - Interprets the distribution of gifts and miracles within the framework of **redemptive history**.
   - Sees the apostolic signs as having a unique, unrepeatable function in the foundation of the church.
   - Emphasizes the transition from the era of revelation to the era of proclamation and application.
   - Argues that the church’s focus should be on the ongoing application of the completed work of Christ.
   - "The history of redemption provides the context for understanding the Spirit’s gifts and their purpose." (Studies in Dogmatics)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **continuationism and cessationism** has influenced Reformed and evangelical discussions by prioritizing the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the centrality of Christ in revelation. His insistence on discernment and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit has encouraged a balanced, theologically grounded engagement with charismatic movements. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his call for the church to remain rooted in the completed revelation of Christ while remaining open to the Spirit’s transformative work.
