# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has articulated a robust **cessationist** position regarding the so-called **extraordinary gifts of the Spirit**. He argues that gifts such as **prophecy, tongues, and miracles** were uniquely tied to the **apostolic era** and the foundational stage of the **New Testament canon**, and thus are no longer normative for the church today.

- "The conclusion is that the New Testament does not support the continuation of prophecy and tongues beyond the apostolic age." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 111)

## Key Works

- "Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (1979)
- "Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views" (contributor, 1996)
- "By Spirit and Word: Pentecost and the New Creation" (2019)
- "Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment" (1998, relevant for his hermeneutical method)
- "Word and Spirit: Selected Writings in Biblical and Systematic Theology" (2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Apostolicity and Redemptive-Historical Finality**
   - The **apostolic office** was unique and foundational, not perpetuated in the post-apostolic church.
   - Extraordinary gifts served to authenticate the apostles and their message.
   - The close of the **apostolic era** marks the cessation of revelatory gifts.
   - The church is now governed by the completed **New Testament canon**.
   - "The gifts of prophecy and tongues are inseparably linked to the apostles and their foundational role." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 101)

2. **Normativity of the Canon**
   - The **canon of Scripture** is the final and sufficient revelation for the church.
   - No new normative revelation is expected or needed after the apostolic period.
   - The sufficiency of Scripture precludes ongoing revelatory gifts.
   - The church's authority is now derived from the written Word, not new prophecy.
   - "With the completion of the canon, the revelatory gifts have fulfilled their purpose." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 111)

3. **Distinction Between Ordinary and Extraordinary Gifts**
   - Ordinary gifts (e.g., teaching, service) continue in the church.
   - Extraordinary gifts (e.g., prophecy, tongues, miracles) were temporary and foundational.
   - The distinction is rooted in the redemptive-historical context of the New Testament.
   - The ongoing work of the Spirit is primarily through ordinary means of grace.
   - "The New Testament itself points to a distinction between gifts that continue and those that do not." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 53)

4. **Hermeneutics and Redemptive-Historical Method**
   - Interpretation of spiritual gifts must be governed by a redemptive-historical framework.
   - The unfolding of revelation is progressive and climaxes in Christ and the apostles.
   - The church's experience is not identical to that of the apostolic era.
   - The application of New Testament teaching requires attention to historical context.
   - "Redemptive history is decisive for understanding the presence and function of the gifts." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 20)

5. **Pneumatology and the Ongoing Work of the Spirit**
   - The Holy Spirit continues to empower, sanctify, and equip the church.
   - The Spirit's primary work is now through the **Word and sacraments**.
   - The absence of extraordinary gifts does not imply the Spirit is inactive.
   - The church is called to seek the Spirit's fullness in ordinary, not extraordinary, ways.
   - "The Spirit is present and active in the church, but in ways that accord with the completed revelation." ("Perspectives on Pentecost," p. 120)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s defense of **cessationism** has shaped contemporary Reformed and Presbyterian approaches to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the gifts. His redemptive-historical method and insistence on the sufficiency of the **New Testament canon** have provided a rigorous theological framework for evaluating claims of modern charismatic phenomena. Gaffin’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students wrestling with the question of **continuationism vs cessationism** in the life of the church.
