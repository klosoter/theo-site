# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s position on **continuationism vs cessationism** is nuanced and historically significant. While he initially leaned toward a **cessationist** view, suggesting that **miraculous gifts** such as tongues and healings had ceased with the apostolic age, later in life he acknowledged contemporary reports of miracles, especially in connection with the **sacraments** and the **life of the church**. Augustine ultimately emphasized the sovereignty of God in granting **signs and wonders** according to His purposes.

- "Even now, therefore, many miracles are wrought, the same God who wrought those we read of, still performing them, by whom He will, and as He will." (City of God, 22.8)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Sermons (various, especially on the Acts of the Apostles)
- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Miracles as Apostolic Confirmation**
    - Miracles primarily served to confirm the **apostolic message** and the foundation of the **church**.
    - The frequency of miracles was greatest during the **apostolic era**.
    - Augustine initially argued that such signs were no longer necessary after the church was established.
    - He viewed miracles as a means of authenticating **divine revelation**.
    - "These miracles were published, that they might be believed; and they were believed, that they might be published." (City of God, 22.8)

2. **Gradual Shift Toward Openness**
    - In later writings, Augustine acknowledged ongoing reports of miracles in his own time.
    - He recounted contemporary healings and exorcisms, especially in connection with the **relics of saints**.
    - Augustine became less dogmatic about cessation, emphasizing God’s freedom.
    - He saw the church as a living context in which God could still act miraculously.
    - "I am so pressed by the promise of finishing this work that I cannot record all the miracles I know." (City of God, 22.8)

3. **Miracles and the Sacraments**
    - Augustine linked the greatest ongoing miracle to the **regeneration** of souls through the **sacraments**.
    - He saw the transformation effected by **baptism** and the **Eucharist** as miraculous in a spiritual sense.
    - The ordinary means of grace were prioritized over extraordinary signs.
    - Augustine emphasized the **mystery** and power of sacramental life.
    - "What greater miracle is there than the change of a human heart?" (Sermon 98)

4. **God’s Sovereignty in Distributing Gifts**
    - Augustine stressed that the distribution of **spiritual gifts** is subject to God’s will.
    - He denied any human ability to demand or manipulate miraculous gifts.
    - The Spirit acts freely, bestowing gifts for the **edification of the church**.
    - Augustine warned against seeking signs for their own sake.
    - "It is not the miracles themselves, but the love which works through them, that is to be sought." (Homilies on the Gospel of John, 21.8)

5. **Miracles as Signs Pointing to Greater Realities**
    - Miracles are **signs** (signa) that point beyond themselves to spiritual truths.
    - Augustine emphasized the **allegorical** and **typological** significance of miracles.
    - He cautioned against focusing on the external act rather than its meaning.
    - Miracles serve to direct faith toward **Christ** and the **kingdom of God**.
    - "Let us not rest in the miracle, but rise to that to which it points." (Tractates on the Gospel of John, 24.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s evolving stance on **miraculous gifts** profoundly shaped later Western theology, especially in debates over **cessationism**. His early cessationist arguments influenced medieval and Reformation thought, while his later openness provided resources for those defending the possibility of ongoing miracles. Augustine’s emphasis on **God’s sovereignty** and the centrality of the **means of grace** continues to inform both Reformed and broader Christian discussions on the nature and purpose of miracles in the church.
