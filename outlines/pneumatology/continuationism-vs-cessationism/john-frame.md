# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the debate between **continuationism** and **cessationism** with a characteristically nuanced and irenic stance, emphasizing the authority of **Scripture** while remaining open to the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He affirms the sufficiency of **special revelation** in the biblical canon but does not categorically deny the possibility of **miraculous gifts** in the present age, urging discernment and submission to the lordship of **Christ**.

- "Scripture does not teach that miraculous gifts have ceased, nor does it teach that they will continue in the same form throughout the church age." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- Worship in Spirit and Truth (1996)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Sufficient and Final**
    - The **canon** of Scripture is closed and normative for all doctrine and practice.
    - All alleged revelations or gifts must be tested by the written Word.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture does not preclude God’s providential activity.
    - Frame distinguishes between **normative revelation** and non-normative guidance.
    - "The canon is closed, and nothing may be added to it." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Openness to the Spirit’s Sovereign Work**
    - God remains free to act miraculously in any age.
    - Frame cautions against dogmatic **cessationism** not explicitly grounded in Scripture.
    - He acknowledges credible reports of miracles, especially in frontier missions.
    - The Spirit’s work must always be evaluated by **biblical criteria**.
    - "We should not limit God’s freedom to bestow gifts as he pleases." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Discernment and Order in the Church**
    - Claims of spiritual gifts must be subject to **testing** and discernment.
    - The church must avoid both gullibility and undue skepticism.
    - Frame emphasizes the need for **order** and edification in corporate worship.
    - He warns against practices that undermine the authority of Scripture.
    - "All things should be done decently and in order." (Worship in Spirit and Truth)

4. **Distinction Between Revelation and Illumination**
    - Frame differentiates between **revelatory gifts** (e.g., prophecy, tongues) and the Spirit’s ongoing work of illumination.
    - He argues that illumination is promised to all believers, while revelation is tied to the apostolic foundation.
    - The cessation of foundational revelation does not mean cessation of all spiritual gifts.
    - The Spirit continues to guide, convict, and empower the church.
    - "Illumination is the Spirit’s work in helping us to understand and apply Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Christocentric Focus of All Gifts**
    - All true gifts of the Spirit exalt **Christ** and build up his body.
    - Frame insists that spiritual gifts must serve the unity and maturity of the church.
    - He critiques both charismatic excesses and cessationist rigidity when they detract from Christ’s lordship.
    - The ultimate test of any gift is its conformity to the gospel.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are given for the glory of Christ and the good of his church." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s balanced approach has influenced contemporary **Reformed theology** by challenging both uncritical **cessationism** and unrestrained continuationism. His emphasis on the **sufficiency of Scripture** alongside openness to the Spirit’s ongoing work has provided a mediating position in evangelical debates. Frame’s writings continue to shape discussions on the role of the **Holy Spirit** and spiritual gifts, especially among those seeking to uphold both biblical authority and spiritual vitality.
