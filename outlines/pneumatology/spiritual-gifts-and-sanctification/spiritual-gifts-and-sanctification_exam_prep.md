### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How **charismata** relate to **sanctification** under a Reformed account of **union with Christ**, and whether extraordinary gifts are constitutive of normal Christian maturity.
- Decisive figures: Paul, Augustine, John Calvin, John Owen, John Wesley, B. B. Warfield.
- Traditions: Pauline foundation; Patristic anti-Pelagian grace; Reformation and Puritan theology of **union with Christ** and **means of grace**; Wesleyan holiness; modern evangelical cessationist–charismatic controversy.
- Debates:
  - Internal: cessationism vs cautious continuationism, **definitive** and **progressive sanctification**, third use of the law, gifts versus graces.

- Position: Extraordinary revelatory and sign gifts served the once-for-all **apostolic foundation** and have ceased; ordinary gifts and all sanctifying graces continue, with sanctification grounded in **union with Christ**, ordered by Scripture and the **means of grace**, and measured by love and obedience rather than by spectacular manifestations.

### ESSAY
The topic of spiritual gifts and sanctification demands that we distinguish and integrate two distinct yet inseparable aspects of the Spirit’s economy: the Spirit’s distribution of **charismata** for the edification of the body and the Spirit’s work of conforming believers to Christ in **sanctification**. The conceptual center is **union with Christ**, by which the Spirit communicates both life and power to the church. Yet precisely at this point modern debates fracture: are the extraordinary gifts part of the ordinary means by which Christians mature in holiness, or were they redemptive-historical scaffolding for the **apostolic foundation** now removed as the building stands? Answering this requires exegesis of Paul, retrieval of Augustine, and careful construal with Calvin and Owen, tested against Wesley’s perfectionism and Warfield’s cessationism, and then pressed against contemporary charismatic claims. I will defend the claim that extraordinary revelatory and sign gifts functioned to attest and establish the once-for-all apostolic witness and have ceased, while the Spirit’s ordinary gifts and all sanctifying graces continue to empower the church’s life by the **means of grace**, with sanctification defined not by spectacular power but by **mortification** and **vivification** through the Word in the communion of saints.

Paul gives the architecture. In 1 Corinthians 12–14, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, and 1 Peter 4, charisms are given by the one Spirit for the common good and are subordinated to love. The body metaphor in 1 Corinthians 12 renders gifts as differentiated functions coordinated by one head and one Spirit. Ephesians 4 locates gifts within Christ’s triunely mediated reign who, having ascended, gave gifts to equip the saints for the work of ministry until the church attains maturity, measured as unity in the faith and knowledge of the Son of God. This teleology aligns gifts with sanctification’s goal, but sanctification for Paul is not reducible to giftedness. In Romans 6 and 8, sanctification is participation in Christ’s death and life, effected by the Spirit, expressed in obedience and the **fruit of the Spirit** in Galatians 5. The distinction between gifts and graces is implicit: gifts are capacities for service that can be present without love, while graces are Spirit-wrought dispositions that conform us to Christ. First Corinthians 13 makes the point with sobering clarity. One may speak in tongues and have prophetic powers yet be nothing without love. Sanctification is the Spirit’s work of making us actually holy, while gifts serve that work by building up the church’s members in knowledge and obedience.

Paul also links the extraordinary to the redemptive-historical. The church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ himself being the cornerstone in Ephesians 2. The writer to the Hebrews states that the great salvation was attested by those who heard, God also bearing witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit in Hebrews 2. Paul calls miracles and signs the signs of an apostle in 2 Corinthians 12. These texts do not directly state cessation, but they frame the function of extraordinary gifts as attestation and foundation. If the foundation is laid once and for all, then the norm of the church’s growth is the edification that flows from the completed apostolic witness inscripturated in Scripture.

Augustine relocates the axis of sanctification against Pelagius. In On the Spirit and the Letter and On Nature and Grace, he contends that the law commands but does not give life, while the Spirit writes the law on the heart, granting love and the **gift of perseverance**. Sanctification is not moral improvement by native powers but the Spirit’s infusion of love and new desires, which elicit our free cooperation after grace. Augustine’s anti-Pelagian insight secures that **progressive sanctification** is grounded in grace and enabled by the Spirit’s sovereign work. Augustine exhibits complexity regarding extraordinary gifts. Early comments can be read as assuming they had waned, yet in City of God 22 he catalogues miracles in his day and refuses to deny their reality, while also subordinating them to the higher good of faith working through love. This double strand is instructive. Augustine refuses a rationalist closure to divine power while locating sanctification in the Spirit’s inward renovation and prioritizing charity as the criterion. In Reformed hands, Augustine’s emphasis becomes the insistence that the norm of sanctification is inward renewal by grace and that the evidences of the Spirit are sanctifying graces. Extraordinary works of God may occur, but they are not constitutive of the ordo of sanctification nor definitive of Christian maturity.

Calvin gives the classic Reformed articulation that unites **union with Christ** and the **means of grace**, while disciplining charismatic exuberance under the **sufficiency of Scripture**. In the Institutes book three, Calvin structures salvation as the duplex gratia of justification and sanctification, both received in union with Christ by faith that is the Spirit’s gift. Sanctification is real and gradual, consisting of **mortification** of the old man and **vivification** in new obedience. Calvin’s pastoral method is to place us under preaching, sacraments, and discipline as the Spirit’s ordinary instruments. He expounds the **third use of the law** as the rule of gratitude, thereby integrating sanctification with the moral law without reintroducing legalism to justification. On gifts, Calvin’s commentaries on 1 Corinthians 12–14 argue that tongues and certain forms of prophecy served the church’s infancy and are not the ordinary pattern once the gospel is established. He resists the Anabaptist conflation of immediate inspiration with ecclesial authority, insisting that Spirit and Word are never divided. On divine operations he retains classical commitments. The Spirit is fully God, and the external works of the Trinity are **indivisible**. Therefore the diversity of gifts is not partitioning the divine essence but temporal missions appropriated to the Spirit for ecclesial edification. This allows Calvin to maintain **divine simplicity** and immutability while recognizing real historical variety in the Spirit’s effects.

John Owen develops sanctification and gifts with forensic precision and searching practical theology. In Of the Mortification of Sin, Of the Dominion of Sin, and Indwelling Sin, he anatomizes the believer’s warfare as Spirit-powered, Word-governed, and church-mediated. Sanctification is the Spirit’s work in believers, and believers truly act, a synergism of mode that preserves monergism of cause. Owen insists that mortification is impossible apart from the Spirit, through union with the death of Christ, applied in the conscience by faith. His Discourse on the Holy Spirit treats the Spirit’s gifts at length, carefully distinguishing between extraordinary gifts given for the founding age and ordinary gifts given continually for ministry. He makes the critical distinction between gifts and graces. Gifts, such as teaching ability or tongues, can be present in the unregenerate and do not of themselves sanctify. Graces, such as faith, hope, and love, are the forms of holiness wrought by the Spirit. This distinction answers the perennial confusion that equates giftedness with godliness. Owen’s ecclesial vision is ordered by **ecclesial discernment**. Prophecy, in the biblical sense of revelatory speaking from God, functioned in the canonical era and ceased with the completion of the foundation. What remains is the Spirit’s ordinary ministry through the Word. This stance is not functional deism. Owen expects real experiences of the Spirit’s presence and power in preaching, prayer, sacraments, and discipline, but all are tethered to the Word and judged by growth in holiness.

John Wesley reframed sanctification by positing entire sanctification as attainable in this life, a second distinct work subsequent to justification, described as perfect love and freedom from willful sin. It is not sinless perfection in the absolute sense, but it construes Christian perfection as maturity of love sometimes given instantaneously as a subsequent crisis experience. Wesley joins an experiential doctrine of assurance with a robust call to holiness, with revival phenomena including healings, tears, and convulsions accompanying the preaching of grace. Wesley’s doctrine supplied the conceptual matrix for the later holiness movement and the Pentecostal claim that a baptism in the Spirit subsequent to conversion is evidenced by tongues. Wesley’s strength is the insistence that sanctification is the telos of the gospel. His weakness is an over-realized eschatology that strains Paul’s already and not yet, risks mismeasuring holiness by crisis events, and sets the stage for treating extraordinary experience as normative content of sanctification.

B. B. Warfield, in Counterfeit Miracles, systematized a cessationist thesis deeply influential in Reformed circles. He argues historically that claims to the extraordinary have been recurrent and frequently shown false or inflated, and theologically that signs and wonders served a redemptive-historical purpose of attestation tied to the apostles. The linkage to Hebrews 2 and 2 Corinthians 12 is central. The New Testament presents miracles as accrediting the apostolic message during the time of its delivery. Once the message is delivered and inscripturated, the necessity for such attestation ceases. For Warfield, the church’s ordinary life is powered by the Spirit through ordinary gifts and the **means of grace**, and the quest for the extraordinary often distracts from holiness. Warfield’s thesis guards the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the unique authority of the apostolic witness. Yet the charge often comes that Warfield overstates his case historically and risks closing our eyes to God’s present interventions, especially in the global South. The better Reformed response is not to deny God’s freedom in **ordinary providence** to heal or to act unusually, but to deny that ongoing gifts of revelation and sign are promised as ordinary means or normative as marks of sanctification.

At this point the three layers of debate can be clarified. Internally, within the Reformed tradition, the chief debates concern cessationism versus cautious continuationism, the nature of **definitive sanctification** alongside its **progressive** dimension, and the role of the law. Definitive sanctification names the Spirit’s once-for-all breach with the dominion of sin and the believer’s consecration into Christ in union with his death and resurrection as in Romans 6. Progressive sanctification names the ongoing Spirit-enabled battle and growth. Some recent Reformed voices are open to a form of non-canonical prophecy fallible in delivery and subject to Scripture, often citing texts like 1 Corinthians 14 about weighing prophecies. The classical Reformed reply is that New Testament prophecy is revelatory, carries divine authority in substance, and its fallible delivery cannot reconcile with the nature of revelation. The practice of weighing in 1 Corinthians 14 is a discernment of true or false prophecy, not a demotion of prophecy to non-binding impressions. Moreover, if God speaks, even fallibly delivered, then the church is faced with binding divine speech beyond Scripture, which compromises **sola Scriptura**. The internal debate must also answer pastoral questions. If we deny revelatory gifts, do we quench the Spirit? Calvin and Owen reply that to insist on the Spirit’s chosen **means of grace** is to honor his sovereignty. The Spirit is not bound by our preferences, and he has told us where to expect him.

Externally, the Wesleyan tradition and Pentecostal-charismatic movements propose a pneumatology where sanctification and gifts are keyed to a second experience, sometimes evidenced by tongues. Here the Reformed answer appeals to Paul’s order in 1 Corinthians 12–13 and to the universal reception of the Spirit by all who belong to Christ in Romans 8. Pentecost is a once-for-all redemptive-historical event manifesting the ascension of Christ and the inauguration of the **new covenant**. The Spirit’s baptism unites us to Christ and his body at conversion. Diversity of filling and boldness for witness does occur, but not as a two-tiered status creating mature and immature by a single sign. The fruit of the Spirit, not tongues, marks sanctification. Roman Catholic theology frames sanctification as the infusion of grace through the sacraments, a real transformation that cooperates with grace toward increasing righteousness. In contrast, Reformed theology insists that justification is by the imputed righteousness of Christ, while sanctification is real inherent righteousness that follows. This guards assurance and clarifies that our sanctification is not the ground of our acceptance. The external debate here keeps us from conflating gifts or personal holiness with the righteousness that justifies.

Contemporary debates train the discussion at the pastoral front lines. The spiritual formation movement often borrows from monastic practices and psychology, sometimes treating disciplines as techniques. The Reformed answer is that **means of grace** are instituted by Christ and therefore principal; other disciplines may be prudential helps but cannot displace Word, sacraments, and prayer. Gifts inventories can confuse natural talent with **charismata**, overlooking that gifts are Spirit-energized capacities given for edification that often make use of creation endowments yet function ecclesially under Christ. Claims of prophecy must be tested by Scripture and church officers. Here Edwards’ pastoral wisdom is helpful. In Religious Affections and The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God, he argued that no amount of extraordinary phenomena proves a work of God, and no negative phenomena by themselves disprove it. The mark is the exalting of Christ, hatred of sin, love of Scripture, and growth in holiness. This does not commit us to continuationism. It commits us to measuring any claim by sanctifying outcomes rather than by dazzling inputs. Global South reports of healings should be received with charity, yet the norming principle remains that the church matures by the public ministry of the Word. If God heals, we give thanks. We do not build our doctrine of sanctification on the possibility of the unusual.

We must also draw the lines of coherence across loci. The works of the Trinity are one. **Divine simplicity** and inseparable operations mean that the Spirit’s distribution of gifts is not a separate divine effort that threatens order or sufficiency. Appropriation attributes the work to the Spirit fittingly because he is the personal bond of love and the one who perfects. The canon as the Spirit’s instrument binds conscience because Scripture is the Spirit’s own speech, and to claim normative revelations alongside it is to disorder the church’s **ecclesial discernment**. Ecclesiology matters, because gifts are ordered to offices and to the body. Ephesians 4 locates ministerial gifts in Christ’s bestowal to equip the saints, which presupposes structures of leadership. Tongues without interpretation, prophecy without testing, and power without accountability not only fail edification but contradict Paul’s pastoral aim that all be done decently and in order. Ethics and the law matter, because sanctification is conformity to the moral law as a rule of life. To claim Spirit leading against the law is antinomian. To claim law keeping as ground of acceptance is neonomian. Union with Christ secures both. In **union with Christ**, our sanctification is the Spirit forming Christ in us, and the moral law is written on our hearts as the promise of the **new covenant**.

Examiner-style objections can be faced directly. Does cessationism quench the Spirit or deny his freedom? No. It honors his freedom by submitting expectation to his own revealed economy. The Spirit may do what he wills, but the church may not construct a norm from providential exceptions. Where does Scripture teach cessation? Not by an isolated proof text, but by a redemptive-historical pattern. The extraordinary attested the apostolic message and laid the foundation. With foundation laid and canon complete, the church is called to maturity through ordinary means. Are you splitting gifts and graces artificially? Paul and Owen force the distinction. Gifts can be exercised without love. Therefore they may be present in the unregenerate. Graces are inseparable from saving faith and are the measure of sanctification. Does this undercut missional vitality? On the contrary, it protects mission from counterfeit power by focusing the church on the powerful gospel, fervent prayer, and patient holiness. The Lord confirms his Word as he pleases. The mission of Acts advances by preaching Christ, repentance, baptism, and the Spirit’s filling for boldness, none of which requires a standing power to speak new revelation. How do you account for the lived testimonies of healing and prophecy worldwide? By charity and discernment. God heals. People misperceive. Either way, sanctification’s mark is love and obedience, and doctrine is set by Scripture, not reports.

The practical upshot is a church life that prizes **means of grace** and cultivates all ordinary gifts. Teaching, shepherding, mercy, administration, exhortation, giving, hospitality, and evangelism are Spirit-given and must be stewarded. Pastors must catechize on **mortification** and **vivification**, leading people to use the Lord’s Day, preaching, sacraments, fellowship, and discipline to grow in holiness. Session and presbyteries ought to develop **ecclesial discernment** mechanisms to test claims, care for the wounded by abusive charismatic practices, and channel zeal into ordered service. Individuals should seek the higher gifts, which Paul makes clear are those that edify most, especially intelligible proclamation that brings repentance and faith. The entire church must be taught that the **fruit of the Spirit** is the index of sanctification, while gifts are tools for love’s work. On this basis, we neither despise a broken and contrite heart that never spoke in tongues nor exalt a fluent tongue that never bridled its speech.

Theologically, this position preserves Christ’s mediatorial glory. If prophecy is ongoing revelation, then the finality of Christ as the Word and the sufficiency of apostolic testimony are compromised. If tongues are a necessary sign of the Spirit’s presence, then the union that binds every believer to Christ by faith is relativized by an external badge. By locating sanctification in **union with Christ**, and gifts as ministerial to that end, we align sanctification with justification’s assurance. We also maintain divine freedom and richness. The Spirit can lift up the weary under the preached Word with an overwhelming sense of Christ’s love, may prompt believers in prudence under the Word’s general rules, and may grant providential deliverances. None of this is denied. But our norm is clear. God builds his church by the gospel and sustains her holiness by the Word read and preached, the sacraments duly administered, and the communion and discipline of the saints. The result is a sturdy, joyful piety that refuses to exchange holiness for spectacle.

The figures we have considered converge at this point. Paul tells us what gifts are for and what holiness looks like. Augustine secures sanctification as a work of grace and charity as the criterion. Calvin integrates **duplex gratia**, **third use**, and **sufficiency of Scripture**, disciplining gifts into edification. Owen clarifies gifts versus graces and supplies a Spirit-centered practice of holiness. Wesley’s insistence on holiness functions as a salutary provocation, but his two-stage model and openness to crisis experience as normative must be refused. Warfield cautions against credulity and recalls us to the apostolic finality. If we hold these together, we can answer pressure from Pentecostalism without denying the Spirit’s living agency, and we can shepherd our people into mature holiness, not tossed to and fro by every wind of giftedness, but growing up into Christ who is the head.

In sum, spiritual gifts and sanctification must be related as means to end. The Spirit distributes a diversity of **charismata** so that the body may be built up into the measure of the stature of Christ, which is sanctification. The spectacular belonged to the church’s foundation. The Spirit’s ordinary, powerful ministry continues, bringing holiness by union with the crucified and risen Lord, through the ordained **means of grace**, measured by love, ordered by Scripture, watched by elders, and lived in the communion of saints. This is neither anti-supernaturalism nor spiritual minimalism. It is biblically constrained, theologically coherent, pastorally sane, and missionally strong.
