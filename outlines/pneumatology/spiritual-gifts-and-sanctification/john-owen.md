# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen’s theology of **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** is rooted in his robust doctrine of the **Holy Spirit** and the ongoing work of **union with Christ**. He emphasizes that all true sanctification is the result of the Spirit’s application of Christ’s work to believers, and that spiritual gifts are sovereignly distributed by the Spirit for the edification of the church, always subordinate to the Spirit’s primary work of producing holiness.

- "All spiritual gifts whatever, which relate unto the edification of the church, are communicated unto it by the Holy Ghost, according to the promise of Christ." (The Holy Spirit)

- The Grace and Duty of Being Spiritually Minded

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as the Spirit’s Work**
    - Sanctification is a supernatural work wrought by the **Holy Spirit** in union with Christ.
    - It involves the mortification of sin and the vivification of new obedience.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s death and resurrection to believers.
    - Human effort is always dependent on the Spirit’s enabling power.
    - "Sanctification is an immediate work of the Spirit of God on the souls of believers, purifying and cleansing of their natures from the pollution and uncleanness of sin." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Spiritual Gifts for Edification**
    - **Spiritual gifts** are sovereignly distributed by the Spirit for the building up of the church.
    - Gifts are distinct from saving grace and do not guarantee regeneration.
    - The exercise of gifts must be governed by love and aimed at the common good.
    - The cessation or continuation of certain gifts is determined by God’s providential purposes.
    - "The end of all spiritual gifts is the edification of the church, the glory of Christ, and the good of them that do believe." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - All sanctifying grace and spiritual gifts flow from **union with Christ**.
    - The believer’s participation in Christ is mediated by the Spirit.
    - Union with Christ ensures both justification and sanctification.
    - This union is the basis for all spiritual transformation and fruitfulness.
    - "There is no participation of Christ, but by the Spirit; nor any communication of the Spirit, but from Christ alone." (Communion with God)

4. **Mortification of Sin as Central to Sanctification**
    - The ongoing **mortification of sin** is essential to true sanctification.
    - Believers must actively put to death the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit’s power.
    - Mortification is not merely external reform but an inward, spiritual work.
    - The Spirit alone enables believers to overcome the power of indwelling sin.
    - "Be killing sin or it will be killing you." (The Mortification of Sin)

5. **Distinction Between Gifts and Graces**
    - Owen distinguishes between **spiritual gifts** (charismata) and **graces** (fruits of the Spirit).
    - Gifts may be present without saving faith or sanctification.
    - Graces are inseparable from regeneration and true holiness.
    - The presence of gifts must not be confused with the reality of saving grace.
    - "Gifts are for the benefit of others; graces for our own benefit and salvation." (The Holy Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s theology of **sanctification** and the **Holy Spirit** has profoundly shaped Reformed and Puritan understandings of the Christian life. His careful distinction between gifts and graces remains influential in discussions of spiritual experience and assurance. Owen’s emphasis on the Spirit’s sovereign work in both sanctification and the distribution of spiritual gifts continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of holiness and charismatic phenomena within the church.
