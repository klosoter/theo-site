# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** within the framework of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the sovereignty of God in the distribution of gifts and the progressive nature of sanctification. He integrates the work of the **Holy Spirit** with the believer's union with Christ, stressing that all spiritual gifts serve the edification of the church and the glory of God. Frame maintains that sanctification is both a definitive act and an ongoing process, rooted in the believer’s relationship to Christ and empowered by the Spirit.

- "Sanctification is a work of God’s grace in which he renews our whole persons after the image of Christ." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Both Definitive and Progressive**
    - Sanctification is initiated by God at conversion, setting the believer apart in Christ.
    - It is also an ongoing process, involving the believer’s active participation by faith.
    - The Holy Spirit is the primary agent, applying Christ’s work to the believer.
    - Growth in holiness is marked by increasing conformity to Christ’s image.
    - "Sanctification is both a once-for-all event and a lifelong process." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Spiritual Gifts for the Edification of the Church**
    - All spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit according to God’s sovereign will.
    - The purpose of gifts is to build up the body of Christ, not for personal exaltation.
    - Every believer receives at least one spiritual gift for service in the church.
    - The exercise of gifts must be governed by love and the authority of Scripture.
    - "The gifts are given to serve others, not to exalt ourselves." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Integration of Gifts and Sanctification**
    - Spiritual gifts function within the broader context of sanctification.
    - The use of gifts is a means by which believers grow in holiness and maturity.
    - There is no dichotomy between the Spirit’s extraordinary and ordinary work in sanctification.
    - The pursuit of holiness and the exercise of gifts are mutually reinforcing.
    - "The Spirit’s gifts and his sanctifying work are inseparable in the Christian life." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Cessation and Continuity of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Frame is open but cautious regarding the continuation of miraculous gifts.
    - He affirms that God can still work miraculously but stresses the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The normative function of gifts is subject to biblical regulation and discernment.
    - The focus should remain on the ordinary means of grace in the church.
    - "We must not seek gifts apart from the Word, nor expect them to supersede it." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

5. **Trinitarian Foundation of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    - The Father ordains, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies sanctification.
    - Union with Christ is central to understanding both gifts and sanctification.
    - The believer’s growth is grounded in the redemptive work of the triune God.
    - "Sanctification is a Trinitarian work, grounded in our union with Christ." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions by emphasizing the unity of doctrine and practice, and the centrality of the Holy Spirit’s work. His tri-perspectival approach has encouraged theologians and pastors to integrate biblical, theological, and practical perspectives on the Christian life. Frame’s influence is evident in the renewed focus on the ordinary means of grace and the ongoing relevance of spiritual gifts within the church. His work continues to inform debates on the nature of sanctification and the role of the Spirit in the believer’s growth.
