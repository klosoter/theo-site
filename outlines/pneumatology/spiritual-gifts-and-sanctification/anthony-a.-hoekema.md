# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** from a Reformed perspective, emphasizing the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer. He maintained that spiritual gifts are given for the **edification of the church** and are integrally connected to the believer’s growth in **holiness** and conformity to **Christ**. Hoekema rejected both perfectionism and antinomianism, stressing the necessity of progressive sanctification.

- "Sanctification is a process that continues throughout our lives, involving both God’s work and our responsible activity." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Works

- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Holy Spirit (in "Created in God’s Image," 1986)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Five Views on Sanctification (contributor, 1987)
- What About Tongue-Speaking? (1966)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Progressive Work**
    - Sanctification is not instantaneous but a lifelong process.
    - The believer is called to active participation, empowered by the Holy Spirit.
    - Growth in holiness involves both mortification of sin and vivification in Christ.
    - The process is rooted in union with Christ and the application of redemption.
    - "Sanctification is a work in which we are never passive, but always active." (Saved by Grace)

2. **Spiritual Gifts for the Edification of the Church**
    - Spiritual gifts are distributed by the Holy Spirit according to His will.
    - Their primary purpose is the building up of the body of Christ.
    - No single gift is normative for all believers; diversity is essential.
    - The exercise of gifts must be governed by love and order.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good, not for personal glorification." (What About Tongue-Speaking?)

3. **Rejection of Perfectionism**
    - Believers will not attain sinless perfection in this life.
    - The struggle against sin continues throughout the Christian life.
    - Sanctification involves continual repentance and renewal.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in personal achievement.
    - "The Bible does not teach that Christians can become perfect in this life." (Saved by Grace)

4. **The Holy Spirit as the Agent of Sanctification**
    - The Spirit indwells every believer, enabling growth in holiness.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the believer.
    - Spiritual gifts are manifestations of the Spirit’s presence and power.
    - The Spirit leads believers into deeper obedience and Christlikeness.
    - "It is the Holy Spirit who works in us both to will and to do according to God’s good pleasure." (Created in God’s Image)

5. **Sanctification and the Already/Not Yet**
    - Sanctification reflects the tension between inaugurated and consummated eschatology.
    - Believers are already set apart in Christ but not yet fully conformed to His image.
    - The presence of spiritual gifts anticipates the fullness of the age to come.
    - The Christian life is marked by hope and expectation of final glorification.
    - "We live in the tension of the already and the not yet, growing in holiness as we await Christ’s return." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of **sanctification** and spiritual gifts has shaped Reformed discussions on the Christian life, particularly in relation to the work of the Holy Spirit. His rejection of both perfectionism and charismatic excesses provided a balanced, biblically grounded approach. Hoekema’s writings continue to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking clarity on the nature of spiritual growth and the role of spiritual gifts within the church. His integration of eschatology and sanctification remains a significant contribution to contemporary Reformed theology.
