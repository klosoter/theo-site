# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He emphasized the transformation of the individual through encounter with the **kerygma** rather than through supernatural manifestations or traditional moral progress, focusing on authentic existence in response to the **Word of God**.

- "The gift of the Spirit is not a magical power but the possibility of a new existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament
- New Testament and Mythology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Faith and Understanding
- Existence and Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Spiritual gifts are interpreted existentially, not as supernatural phenomena.
    - The New Testament language of gifts is re-read as symbolic of authentic self-understanding.
    - Miraculous gifts are not central to Christian faith or experience.
    - The focus is on the existential transformation of the believer.
    - "The mythological conception of the Spirit must be interpreted in terms of the self-understanding of man before God." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Sanctification as Existential Decision**
    - Sanctification is not a process of moral improvement but a decisive act of faith.
    - The believer is called to authentic existence through encounter with the kerygma.
    - Ethical transformation is secondary to existential openness to God’s call.
    - The new life is characterized by freedom from self and openness to the future.
    - "Sanctification is the event in which man is claimed by God’s word and responds in faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the means by which spiritual transformation occurs.
    - Spiritual gifts are subordinate to the existential encounter with the kerygma.
    - The Word of God confronts the individual and calls for decision.
    - The church’s task is proclamation, not the cultivation of supernatural gifts.
    - "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Objectivist Pneumatology**
    - The Holy Spirit is not an objective force but the event of God’s address.
    - Spiritual experience is interpreted as existential self-understanding before God.
    - There is no ontological change; transformation is relational and existential.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the proclamation of the Word.
    - "The Spirit is not a substance but the power of the word that calls man to decision." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Authenticity and Freedom in Christian Life**
    - Christian existence is marked by authenticity, not conformity to external norms.
    - Freedom from the law is a result of the existential encounter with Christ.
    - The believer lives in the tension of decision, not in static sanctity.
    - Spiritual gifts are expressions of authentic life, not mystical endowments.
    - "The Christian life is a life of freedom, lived in responsibility before God." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** profoundly shaped 20th-century theology, especially in the realms of **hermeneutics** and **New Testament studies**. His emphasis on demythologization challenged traditional views and redirected focus from supernatural phenomena to existential transformation. While controversial among confessional theologians, his work remains influential in discussions of faith, authenticity, and the interpretation of biblical texts.
