# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** through the lens of classic **Reformed soteriology**. He emphasized that **sanctification** is a work of the **Holy Spirit**, distinct from but inseparable from **justification**, and that **spiritual gifts** are distributed by the Spirit for the edification of the church, not as marks of extraordinary piety.

- "Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit, by which the soul is renewed after the image of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit**
    - Sanctification is distinct from justification but always accompanies it in the believer.
    - The Holy Spirit is the efficient cause, progressively renewing the believer in holiness.
    - Human effort is real but subordinate to the Spirit’s enabling power.
    - Sanctification involves both the mortification of sin and the vivification of righteousness.
    - "It is the work of God in us, not a work of man for himself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Spiritual gifts are for the edification of the church**
    - Spiritual gifts are sovereignly distributed by the Holy Spirit.
    - Their primary purpose is the building up of the body of Christ, not individual exaltation.
    - Not all gifts are miraculous; many are ordinary and enduring.
    - The cessation of extraordinary gifts is consistent with the completion of the apostolic era.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are not given for personal display, but for the common good." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians)

3. **Sanctification is progressive, not instantaneous**
    - Growth in holiness is gradual and lifelong.
    - Believers remain imperfect in this life, always dependent on grace.
    - The struggle against sin continues until glorification.
    - Assurance of growth is grounded in the promises of God, not subjective experience.
    - "Sanctification is a progressive work; it is carried on from day to day through the whole life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Union with Christ is foundational for sanctification**
    - All spiritual blessings, including sanctification, flow from union with Christ.
    - The believer’s mystical union with Christ is effected by the Holy Spirit.
    - This union ensures both the imputation of righteousness and the impartation of new life.
    - Sanctification is the fruit of this vital connection, not a separate achievement.
    - "Our sanctification, as well as our justification, is in Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **The means of grace are essential for sanctification**
    - The Word, sacraments, and prayer are ordained means for spiritual growth.
    - The Spirit works through these means, not apart from them.
    - Regular participation in the means of grace is necessary for progress in holiness.
    - Neglect of these means leads to spiritual stagnation and vulnerability to sin.
    - "The ordinary means of sanctification are the truth, the sacraments, and prayer." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially in the American context. His insistence on the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** and the ordinary means of grace provided a bulwark against both perfectionism and enthusiasm. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing influence of **Old Princeton Theology** and its commitment to a balanced, biblical doctrine of the Christian life.
