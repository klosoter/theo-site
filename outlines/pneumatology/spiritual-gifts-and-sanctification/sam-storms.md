# Sam Storms (1951– )

Sam Storms is a contemporary theologian and pastor known for his advocacy of **continuationism**, the belief that **spiritual gifts** such as prophecy, tongues, and healing continue in the church today. He connects the exercise of these gifts to the process of **sanctification**, emphasizing the role of the **Holy Spirit** in empowering believers for growth in holiness and service within the body of Christ.

## Legacy and Impact

Sam Storms has played a significant role in bridging the gap between **Reformed theology** and charismatic practice, providing a thoughtful and biblically grounded defense of **continuationism**. His writings and pastoral ministry have encouraged many within evangelical circles to pursue both doctrinal depth and experiential openness to the **Holy Spirit**. Storms’ influence is seen in the growing acceptance of spiritual gifts within traditionally non-charismatic Reformed communities, shaping contemporary discussions on sanctification and the life of the church.
