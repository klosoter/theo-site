### TITLE
Charism and Character: Integrating Spiritual Gifts with Progressive Sanctification in Reformed Theology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: how to relate **spiritual gifts** as sovereign charismatic endowments to **sanctification** as progressive moral renewal, without collapsing one into the other or divorcing them.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, John Owen, Abraham Kuyper, and John Wesley.
- Relevant traditions: patristic Latin theology, Reformed confessional and Puritan theology, Wesleyan Methodism, and modern evangelical-charismatic debates.
- Debates addressed: internal Reformed debates over cessationism and “ordinary” versus “extraordinary” gifts; external debates with Wesleyan perfectionism and charismatic second-blessing theology; contemporary debates on sign gifts, spiritual formation, and the ethics of gifted yet morally compromised leaders.
- Defended position: spiritual gifts are sovereign, **non-meritorious charismata** distributed to every believer in union with Christ, inseparably ordered to but not identical with **definitive and progressive sanctification**, and ordinarily exercised within the visible church under Word and sacrament, with an ongoing but non-normative place for so-called “extraordinary” gifts submissive to canonical Scripture.

### ESSAY
To defend an integrated account of spiritual gifts and sanctification one must begin with careful definition, because the New Testament itself speaks in multiple registers that, if conflated, generate many of the pastoral and theoretical confusions that examiners will probe. By spiritual gifts we mean those **charismata** that the ascended Christ distributes through the Spirit to his body, the church, for the common good and the building up of the saints. They are functions, endowments or empowerments grounded in union with Christ but differentiated according to measure, office, and occasion. By sanctification we mean both the **definitive sanctification** in which believers are once-for-all separated unto God and freed from sin’s dominion, and **progressive sanctification** in which the Spirit conforms them more and more to the image of Christ in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. The core conceptual tension is this: gifts are distributed diversely and sometimes appear in morally immature or even deeply compromised persons, whereas sanctification concerns the Spirit’s work in moral transformation that is common to all believers. The question is how these two diverse operations of the one Spirit in union with Christ are related without being collapsed or torn apart.

Augustine of Hippo is a decisive early figure because he reframes gifts and sanctification under the rubric of **grace and charity** as opposed to the more spectacular pneumatology that many associate with the early church. In works such as On Baptism and On the Spirit and the Letter Augustine reads passages about tongues and miracles primarily in redemptive-historical terms. The so-called extraordinary gifts were, for him, chiefly signs accrediting the apostolic foundation of the church. In his own era the more central operation of the Spirit is the infusion of **caritas**, love for God poured out in our hearts, which both justifies in its rootedness in Christ and renews in sanctification. This move does not entail an absolute cessationist thesis in Augustine, but it decisively relocates the center of pneumatology from episodic manifestations to the stable transformation of the will. Augustine therefore sets up a conceptual architecture in which the crowning gift of the Spirit is charity itself, and other gifts are ordered to it. An examiner might challenge: does Augustine thereby erase the distinction between gifts and graces, reducing everything to sanctifying love. The better reading is to say that Augustine establishes a hierarchy. **Sanctifying grace** is the Spirit’s primary operation, while charismatic endowments, where present, are subordinated signs and helps. This Augustinian hierarchy will later resource both Reformed and Roman Catholic accounts against more spectacularist forms of spirituality.

John Calvin, however, is the crucial architect for a Reformed account of spiritual gifts and sanctification. In the Institutes, especially book 3, Calvin organizes the Christian life under **union with Christ**, from which flow the duplex gratia of justification and sanctification. For Calvin, the Spirit is first the bond uniting us to Christ, and only then the giver of diverse gifts. This Christological ordering is decisive: spiritual gifts are not autonomous charisms but facets of Christ’s fullness communicated to his body. Calvin comments on 1 Corinthians 12–14 and Romans 12 in a way that distinguishes between **extraordinary gifts** associated with the foundation of the church and **ordinary gifts** that persist for its edification. Apostles and prophets are foundational; pastors and teachers are ordinary offices. Tongues and miracle-working Calvin tends to treat as largely temporary functions, though he does not press an absolute dogmatic cessationism. What matters, as he repeatedly insists, is that all gifts are given “for the common advantage” and must be regulated by love and order.

In his exegesis Calvin already faces a problem that remains alive in contemporary charismatic debates: if gifts are sovereignly given, how do we avoid spiritual elitism or antinomianism in gifted persons. His answer is to distinguish sharply between charismatic endowments and **the fruits of the Spirit**. The former can be present in the reprobate and are no sure sign of adoption; the latter are inseparable from the work of **progressive sanctification** in the elect. When Calvin comments on Matthew 7, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,” he underscores that miraculous gifts may coexist with fundamental unbelief. The Reformed tradition after Calvin codifies this distinction: gifts may be common and outward; sanctification is saving and inward. Examiners will press whether this creates a dualism in Calvin. It does not; rather, it reflects a comprehensive doctrine of **common operations of the Spirit** as distinct from his special, regenerating work. The same Spirit distributes gifts widely even while working sanctification effectually only in the elect.

John Owen stands as the most elaborate Puritan development of a Reformed pneumatology that integrates gifts and sanctification. His work On the Holy Spirit and his treatises on mortification and communion with God systematize and refine the Calvinian inheritance. Owen is methodologically careful to distinguish diverse **operations of the Spirit**: regeneration, indwelling, mortification, vivification, illumination, and the conferral of gifts. For Owen, spiritual gifts are essentially abilities or endowments, spiritual in origin but not necessarily saving in effect. Preaching ability, administrative wisdom, or even occasional prophetic impressions fall under this broad category. Yet Owen relentlessly insists that such gifts, abstracted from **holiness of heart and life**, are dangerous. He witnessed in his own context the moral collapse of some highly gifted ministers, and so devotes significant space to the theme of a “gifted but unsanctified” ministry.

Theologically, Owen grounds sanctification in union with Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit as a new principle of life. Gifts, by contrast, are appended capacities that can be given or withdrawn without altering the fundamental state of the soul. This allows Owen to handle texts like Hebrews 6, where people taste the powers of the age to come yet fall away, without losing an Augustinian and Reformed commitment to the perseverance of the saints. Those texts refer to charismatic experiences and common operations, not to the definitive implantation of new spiritual life. In internal Reformed debates about assurance, this distinction becomes crucial: one may not infer saving grace from the presence of gifts. The examiner will likely ask whether this undervalues gifts or discourages their pursuit. Owen’s answer, and one to defend, is that gifts are valuable precisely as instruments of **Word-centered ministry** and church edification, but their true worth is measured by their ordered service to sanctification in others, not as badges of spiritual status in the possessor.

Abraham Kuyper, a later Reformed voice, extends the discussion into the modern world and anticipates contemporary issues. In his work on the Holy Spirit Kuyper introduces the concept of **the organic life of the church** and connects spiritual gifts with the diversified functioning of the body under Christ as head. Influenced by both Calvin and the emerging complexity of modern society, Kuyper sees gifts as corresponding to callings and spheres of activity, not only within the institutional church but across culture. This is integrated with his doctrine of **common grace**, which allows for Spirit-wrought abilities and social goods outside the circle of the regenerate while reserving **special grace** for the saving work that renews nature in union with Christ. Here Kuyper intensifies the Reformed distinction between gifts in a broad sense and sanctification properly speaking. A believer’s artistic or political or scientific gift is a genuine charism for service, yet sanctification concerns especially the renovation of the heart to love God. Kuyper resists a narrow ecclesiastical confinement of gifts, but also resists romanticizing natural or cultural gifting as ipso facto evidences of holiness.

At this point the internal Reformed debate over **cessationism** must be faced. Classic confessional Reformed theology, as reflected in Westminster Confession 1.1, affirms the cessation of new revelation and inscripturation. Many Reformed theologians therefore argue that apostolic and prophetic gifts ceased as standing endowments with the close of the canon. Others, especially in recent Reformed charismatic circles, affirm a form of continuationism in which prophecy and tongues continue but in a noncanonical, fallible mode strictly subordinate to Scripture. To integrate this with sanctification one must stress two points. First, the locus of **normative revelation** and sanctifying truth is the completed canon ministered by the Spirit. Second, whatever ongoing gifts exist must be exegeted under the Pauline principle that love, order, and edification are their telos. If purported prophecies or miraculous gifts function to distract from ordinary means of grace, they have already failed their sanctifying purpose. Thus a classical Reformed position may affirm the possibility of unusual providences and extraordinary operations while denying any standing office or gift that undermines the sufficiency and finality of Scripture.

In order to expose the contours of the doctrine under pressure, it is necessary to contrast the Reformed-Augustinian trajectory with John Wesley and the Methodist tradition. Wesley’s doctrine of **Christian perfection** and his broader emphasis on conscious experience of grace reconfigures the relation of gifts and sanctification. In sermons such as “Christian Perfection” and his Plain Account of Christian Perfection, Wesley argues for an attainable state of perfect love in this life, defined negatively as freedom from voluntary transgression and positively as entire devotion to God. He does not claim sinless perfection in absolute terms, yet his emphasis upon a second work of grace beyond justification tends toward a two-stage model of sanctification. Within this framework, spiritual gifts and powerful experiences of the Spirit are often associated with crises of deeper consecration or “entire sanctification.”

Wesley was not a systematic charismatic theologian in the modern sense, but he did see the Spirit’s operations in terms of successive, experientially discernible stages, and the Methodist movement often interpreted certain manifestations or heightened religious affections as tokens of advanced sanctity. Here the Reformed critic presses: does Wesleyan perfectionism effectively identify higher gifts with higher holiness, thereby undermining the Reformation insistence that sanctification remains incomplete and conflicted in this life. On a Reformed reading, it does. This is not to deny the possibility of extraordinary growth in holiness in some believers, but it is to deny that any believer attains a state in which indwelling sin is eradicated or in which spiritual experiences and gifts can serve as reliable indicators of near-perfection. The Reformed stress on **indwelling sin** and ongoing mortification stands against any theology that makes heightened giftedness or experience the norm for mature sanctification.

The rise of modern Pentecostal and charismatic movements, formally distinct from Wesley but historically indebted to his emphasis on second blessings, intensifies the puzzle. Many forms of Pentecostal theology introduce a **baptism in the Spirit** as a distinct, post-conversion event, often evidenced by tongues and other sign gifts. Sanctification and spiritual gifts, in this model, are frequently aligned with sequential experiences. A believer is justified and perhaps initially sanctified at conversion, and later fully empowered or sanctified at Spirit-baptism. Tongues and prophecy thus become badges of spiritual advancement. From a Reformed standpoint shaped by Augustine, Calvin, and Owen, this schema is deeply problematic. It reintroduces a two-tier Christianity foreign to Paul’s insistence that every believer is baptized in one Spirit into one body and that not all speak in tongues. It also undermines the sufficiency of union with Christ by treating Spirit-baptism as something other than the initial incorporation into Christ.

In response, a Reformed account must insist that every believer receives the Spirit fully at conversion, and that **union with Christ** is the comprehensive source of every spiritual blessing, including both sanctification and gifts. There are subsequent fillings of the Spirit in the sense of renewed empowerments and experiences of his presence, but no ontological gap between ordinary believers and Spirit-baptized believers. Gifts then are differentiated expressions of one and the same Spirit given to all in Christ. This implies that the presence or absence of any particular gift cannot, in principle, be a mark of higher sanctity. Rather, the controlling mark of sanctification is conformity to Christ in faith working through love, as manifest in the **fruit of the Spirit**. An examiner pressing the text of Acts, with its seemingly sequential experiences, must be answered by appealing to redemptive-historical uniqueness and to Luke’s programmatic concern to trace the extension of the gospel from Jerusalem to the nations, not to describe a normative ordo salutis for all time.

One must now address the contemporary ethical crisis that has made the distinction between gifts and sanctification inescapably salient: the phenomenon of profoundly gifted leaders whose ministries flourish even as their personal holiness collapses. This raises the practical question: if gifts and sanctification are distinct, does this not excuse or mask sin under the cloak of usefulness. The Reformed tradition, especially in Owen, supplies the tools to say the opposite. The more sharply we distinguish charismata from **holy character**, the more strenuously we insist that the church must never evaluate ministers solely by gifting. Office in the church is tied institutionally to both competence and tested character, and the Spirit’s primary work in a minister is to make him a holy bearer of the Word, not a spectacular performer of gifts. Gifts without holiness become instruments of judgment, both on the unholy minister and on the church that exalts him.

Internally, Reformed debates today have emerged between those who want to integrate “spiritual gifts inventories” and therapeutic language of “self-actualization” into sanctification, and those who fear the psychologizing of charismata. A Reformed answer, again drawing from Kuyper, is to affirm the **creational grounding of vocation**: natural talents and dispositions are providentially given, and when the Spirit regenerates, he frequently elevates and redirects them as gifts for the kingdom. Yet sanctification cannot be reduced to the flourishing of one’s talents. Rather, sanctification is fundamentally about dying and rising with Christ, which may at times involve the cruciform curbing or even obscuring of one’s most impressive natural gifts. The theology of the cross warns that the most visibly gifted are not necessarily the most holy, and at times the least impressive according to worldly criteria may be the most sanctified.

Finally, to integrate the doctrine of spiritual gifts and sanctification with adjacent loci, one must show its coherence with **ecclesiology**, **Scripture**, and **Christology**. Ecclesiologically, gifts are given for the upbuilding of the body, not for isolated individual experiences. The Spirit’s distribution of gifts presupposes the visible church with its offices, discipline, and sacraments. Sanctification likewise is ordinarily a corporate reality, nourished by the ministry of Word and sacrament. This means that a theologically sound pursuit of gifts must be embedded in a robust church life. Examiners may probe whether this marginalizes small group or parachurch dynamics. The answer is that while the Spirit is not confined to formal structures, the normative arena of his sanctifying work is the church as instituted by Christ, where the gifts are ordered and tested.

With respect to Scripture, the cessation of inscripturating revelation entails that all claims of prophecy or extraordinary gifts today must be submitted to the canonical norm. The Spirit who gives gifts is the Spirit who breathed out the Word. There can be no tension between them. This guards sanctification from being unmoored from biblical norms under the guise of prophetic leading. Christologically, all gifts must be seen as participations in the one ministry of Christ as prophet, priest, and king. Teaching and prophecy share in his prophetic office; mercy and intercession in his priestly compassion; governance and wisdom in his kingly rule. Sanctification itself is conformity to Christ’s image. Thus gifts without Christlikeness are not simply neutral; they are misalignments of the body with its head.

The position to defend, then, can be stated sharply. Spiritual gifts are sovereign, **non-meritorious charismata** given to every believer in union with Christ, diversified for the body’s good, and not reliable indicators of saving grace in themselves. **Definitive sanctification** occurs at union with Christ, and **progressive sanctification** is the Spirit’s ongoing work to renew the whole person in the image of Christ through the ordinary means of grace. The one Spirit thus operates in two related but distinct ways: he equips with gifts according to divine wisdom, and he sanctifies according to the decree of election. Any theology that collapses gifts into holiness will misjudge visible giftedness as a sure sign of sanctity, while any theology that severs them will tolerate gifts exercised apart from moral accountability and ecclesial order. The Reformed-Augustinian line, developed through Augustine, Calvin, Owen, and Kuyper and clarified in contrast with Wesleyan perfectionism and modern charismatic second-blessing schemas, maintains the necessary distinction while preserving the unity of the Spirit’s work. Facing examiners, one must be ready to say without qualification: the greatest gift is the Spirit himself, uniting us to Christ; all other gifts are good only insofar as they serve that union’s fruit in **holiness and love**.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: spiritual gifts are sovereign **charismata** distributed by the Spirit for the church’s edification, distinct from yet ordered to **definitive and progressive sanctification**, which is the Spirit’s work of moral renewal in union with Christ.
- Decisive figures: Augustine subordinates spectacular gifts to **charity** as the Spirit’s central work; Calvin grounds gifts and sanctification in **union with Christ** and distinguishes gifts from saving graces; Owen rigorously separates common gifts from **holiness** and stresses mortification; Kuyper connects gifts to **common and special grace** and the organic life of church and culture; Wesley promotes a second-blessing and **perfectionist** orientation that tends to align higher gifts with higher sanctity.
- Debates: internally, Reformed disputes over **cessationism**, assurance, and the role of gifts in ministry; externally, tensions with Wesleyan perfectionism and Pentecostal second-blessing theology; contemporarily, disputes about sign gifts, spiritual formation, and ethically compromised gifted leaders.
- Defended position: one Spirit works in two related yet distinct modes, granting non-meritorious gifts for service and effecting sanctification unto Christlikeness, with all gifts normed by Scripture, ordered to love, and exercised in the visible church under Word and sacrament, and with any ongoing “extraordinary” gifts strictly non-normative and subordinated to the closed canon.
- Likely examiner questions and answers:
  - How do you distinguish gifts from graces without splitting the Spirit’s work? By affirming one Spirit in union with Christ operating diversely, and by subordinating all gifts to the telos of **holiness and love**.
  - Are tongues and prophecy still for today? Any ongoing manifestations must be noncanonical, tested by Scripture and love, and cannot function as marks of higher sanctification.
  - Can gifts be present in the unregenerate? Yes, as **common operations of the Spirit**; they are no sure evidence of saving grace.
  - How would you counsel a gifted but morally failing leader? Insist that office requires tested character, that gifts without sanctification are dangerous, and that discipline aims at the leader’s restoration in holiness, not mere preservation of ministry usefulness.
  - Does Reformed theology deny profound experiences of the Spirit? No, it denies a two-tier or second-blessing scheme, while affirming repeated fillings and deep experiences within the one gift of the Spirit given at union with Christ.
