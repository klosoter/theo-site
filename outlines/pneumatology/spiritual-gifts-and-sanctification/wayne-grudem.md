# Wayne Grudem (1948– )

Wayne Grudem is a leading evangelical theologian who affirms the ongoing validity of **spiritual gifts** within the church and emphasizes their role in the believer’s **sanctification**. He advocates for a **continuationist** perspective, arguing that the **gifts of the Spirit** are meant for the edification of the body and the growth of individual holiness, while maintaining a strong commitment to the authority of **Scripture** in discerning their use.

- "Paul nowhere indicates that any gifts will cease before Christ returns." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (1994)
- The Gift of Prophecy in the New Testament and Today (1988)
- Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (ed., 1996)
- 1 Peter: An Introduction and Commentary (1988)
- Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith (1999)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuation of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Argues that **miraculous gifts** such as prophecy, tongues, and healing continue today.
    - Bases this on New Testament teaching and the absence of clear cessationist texts.
    - Emphasizes that all gifts must be exercised under the authority of **Scripture**.
    - Sees gifts as intended for the **edification** and unity of the church.
    - "There is no convincing evidence that any gifts have ceased." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Sanctification as a Cooperative Process**
    - Defines **sanctification** as a work of God and man, involving both divine initiative and human response.
    - Stresses the ongoing, progressive nature of sanctification in the believer’s life.
    - Connects the exercise of spiritual gifts to growth in holiness and maturity.
    - Encourages active pursuit of both personal holiness and the gifts of the Spirit.
    - "Sanctification is a work in which God and man cooperate each playing distinct roles." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Scripture as the Final Authority**
    - Insists that all claims of spiritual gifts must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - Rejects any use of gifts that contradicts biblical teaching or undermines the sufficiency of Scripture.
    - Warns against subjective excesses and unbiblical practices.
    - Upholds the **regulative principle** in worship and church life.
    - "The Bible is our final authority in all matters of faith and practice." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Purpose of Gifts: Edification and Mission**
    - Teaches that spiritual gifts are given for the **common good** and the building up of the church.
    - Links the exercise of gifts to the church’s mission and witness in the world.
    - Emphasizes love as the necessary context for all spiritual gifts.
    - Encourages discernment and order in the public use of gifts.
    - "Spiritual gifts are given to equip the church to carry out its ministry until Christ returns." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Distinction Between Regeneration and Sanctification**
    - Clearly distinguishes **regeneration** (a once-for-all act) from **sanctification** (a lifelong process).
    - Argues that spiritual gifts are not signs of regeneration but tools for sanctification.
    - Maintains that all believers receive the Holy Spirit at conversion, but may experience various empowerments.
    - Rejects a two-tiered Christianity based on possession of certain gifts.
    - "Sanctification is distinct from regeneration and justification, though closely related." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Wayne Grudem’s robust defense of the **continuationist** position has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical thought on spiritual gifts and sanctification. His accessible yet scholarly approach has influenced both academic and pastoral circles, providing a framework for the responsible exercise of spiritual gifts within the boundaries of **biblical authority**. Grudem’s work continues to foster dialogue between charismatic and non-charismatic traditions, emphasizing the unity and edification of the church.
