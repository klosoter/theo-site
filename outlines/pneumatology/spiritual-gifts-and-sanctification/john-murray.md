# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robustly Reformed understanding of **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification**, emphasizing the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer. He distinguished between the definitive act of **sanctification** at regeneration and its ongoing progressive aspect, while maintaining that all spiritual gifts serve the unity and edification of the **body of Christ**.

- "Sanctification is a work of God in us, and the Holy Spirit is the agent of this work." ("Redemption: Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- Principles of Conduct
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- "The Gifts of the Spirit" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is both definitive and progressive**
    - Definitive sanctification occurs at the moment of union with Christ.
    - Progressive sanctification is the lifelong process of being made holy.
    - Both aspects are rooted in the believer’s union with Christ.
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent who applies sanctification.
    - "There is a decisive and definitive breach with the power of sin, and there is also a continuous process of mortification and renewal." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Spiritual gifts are sovereignly distributed by the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit gives gifts according to His will, not human merit.
    - All gifts are for the edification of the church, not individual exaltation.
    - No one gift is universal or normative for all believers.
    - The diversity of gifts serves the unity of the body.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are sovereignly bestowed and are designed for the common good." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Sanctification is inseparable from union with Christ**
    - Union with Christ is the foundation for all spiritual blessings.
    - Sanctification flows from participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - The believer’s new identity in Christ necessitates a new way of life.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised within this union.
    - "All the blessings of salvation, including sanctification, are comprehended in union with Christ." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Sanctification involves both God’s initiative and human responsibility**
    - God works in the believer both to will and to work for His good pleasure.
    - Believers are called to active obedience and mortification of sin.
    - The Spirit enables, but does not override, human agency.
    - Spiritual disciplines are means by which sanctification is advanced.
    - "God’s working in us is not suspended because we work, nor our working suspended because God works." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Extraordinary gifts are not normative for the church today**
    - Murray was cautious regarding claims of miraculous gifts in the contemporary church.
    - He affirmed the sufficiency of Scripture and ordinary means of grace.
    - The primary evidence of the Spirit’s work is holiness, not extraordinary phenomena.
    - The focus is on edification, not sensationalism.
    - "The supreme evidence of the Spirit’s presence is not the possession of gifts but the fruit of the Spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **sanctification** and the role of **spiritual gifts** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the Christian life. His distinction between definitive and progressive sanctification remains influential in systematic theology and pastoral practice. By grounding spiritual gifts in the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit and emphasizing their purpose for the church’s edification, Murray provided a balanced and biblically grounded framework that continues to inform contemporary discussions.
