# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson approaches **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** from a classic **Reformed** perspective, emphasizing the work of the **Holy Spirit** in uniting believers to Christ and enabling growth in holiness. He maintains that spiritual gifts serve the edification of the **church** and are subordinate to the Spirit’s primary work of conforming believers to the image of Christ through **progressive sanctification**.

- "The Spirit’s work is to bring us into conformity with Christ, and all his gifts are directed to that end." ("The Holy Spirit")

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (Contours of Christian Theology)
- Devoted to God: Blueprints for Sanctification
- Maturity: Growing Up and Going On in the Christian Life
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction
- Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister is Called to Be

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification is union with Christ applied by the Spirit**
    - Believers are sanctified through their union with Christ, established by the Spirit.
    - Sanctification is both definitive (set apart) and progressive (growing in holiness).
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s work, making sanctification a Trinitarian reality.
    - Holiness is not self-generated but Spirit-wrought in the context of union with Christ.
    - "Sanctification is the fruit of our union with Christ through the Spirit." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Spiritual gifts serve the body, not individual exaltation**
    - Gifts are given by the Spirit for the common good and edification of the church.
    - No gift is for personal status or self-promotion.
    - The diversity of gifts reflects the unity and interdependence of the body of Christ.
    - All gifts must be exercised in love, under the lordship of Christ.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are never ends in themselves, but means to the building up of the body." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Sanctification is progressive and lifelong**
    - Growth in holiness is a continual process, not a one-time event.
    - The believer experiences ongoing conflict with sin but is assured of ultimate victory.
    - The Spirit enables mortification of sin and vivification to righteousness.
    - Progress is measured by increasing conformity to Christ, not external achievement.
    - "Sanctification is a process that continues throughout the whole of the Christian life." (Devoted to God)

4. **Word and Spirit are inseparable in sanctification**
    - The Spirit works through the Word to sanctify believers.
    - Scripture is the primary means by which the Spirit instructs, convicts, and transforms.
    - There is no true sanctification apart from biblical truth.
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) are central to the Spirit’s sanctifying work.
    - "The Spirit never works independently of the Word he has inspired." (The Holy Spirit)

5. **Assurance and sanctification are linked by the Spirit**
    - The Spirit assures believers of their adoption and empowers their growth in holiness.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work and the Spirit’s testimony.
    - Growth in sanctification strengthens assurance, and assurance encourages further growth.
    - The Spirit’s witness is both objective (Word) and subjective (inner testimony).
    - "The Spirit who sanctifies is also the Spirit who assures." (The Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s teaching on **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** has shaped contemporary Reformed understanding by emphasizing the centrality of the Holy Spirit’s work in both personal holiness and the life of the church. His insistence on the inseparability of **Word and Spirit** has provided a corrective to both legalism and spiritualism. Ferguson’s accessible yet profound writings continue to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking a robust, Christ-centered approach to sanctification and the use of spiritual gifts.
