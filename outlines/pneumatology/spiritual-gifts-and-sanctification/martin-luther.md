# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood **spiritual gifts** as the work of the **Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer, rooted in the believer’s union with Christ by faith. For Luther, **sanctification** is inseparable from **justification**, proceeding from faith and manifesting in good works, yet always remaining the work of God’s grace rather than human effort. He emphasized the **priesthood of all believers**, teaching that every Christian is endowed with spiritual gifts for service within the community.

- "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

## Key Works

- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 31: Career of the Reformer

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification flows from justification**
    - Sanctification is the necessary fruit of being justified by faith alone.
    - Good works are the result, not the cause, of salvation.
    - The believer is simultaneously **simul iustus et peccator** (at once righteous and a sinner).
    - Sanctification is ongoing and never perfect in this life.
    - "Thus a Christian man is righteous and holy by an alien or foreign holiness—the righteousness and holiness of Christ Himself." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit**
    - All believers receive gifts through the indwelling Spirit.
    - Gifts are not earned but graciously bestowed for the benefit of the church.
    - There is no spiritual hierarchy; all gifts serve the body of Christ.
    - The Spirit works through ordinary vocations as well as extraordinary gifts.
    - "We are all priests, as many of us as are Christians." (The Freedom of a Christian)

3. **Priesthood of all believers**
    - Every Christian has direct access to God and spiritual gifts for ministry.
    - Ministry is not limited to clergy but is the calling of the whole church.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised in love and service to neighbors.
    - The distinction between sacred and secular vocations is abolished.
    - "There is no true, basic difference between laymen and priests... except for the sake of office and work, but not for the sake of status." (To the Christian Nobility)

4. **Sanctification is both passive and active**
    - Sanctification is God’s work in the believer, yet believers are called to active obedience.
    - The Christian life is marked by daily repentance and renewal.
    - Human effort is always dependent on God’s enabling grace.
    - The law guides but does not empower sanctification; the gospel does.
    - "It is not imitation that makes sons; it is birth that makes them heirs." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Word and Sacrament as means of grace**
    - The Holy Spirit works sanctification through the preached Word and the sacraments.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are central for nurturing faith and spiritual growth.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised and strengthened within the gathered church.
    - The means of grace are objective, not dependent on human merit.
    - "The Word of God cannot be received and cherished by any works whatever but only by faith." (The Freedom of a Christian)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s theology of **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of the Christian life, emphasizing the primacy of faith and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. His doctrine of the **priesthood of all believers** democratized spiritual gifts and ministry, influencing later Reformed and evangelical traditions. Luther’s insistence that sanctification flows from justification remains a hallmark of confessional Lutheran and broader Protestant theology. His focus on the means of grace continues to inform sacramental and ecclesial practices across denominations.
