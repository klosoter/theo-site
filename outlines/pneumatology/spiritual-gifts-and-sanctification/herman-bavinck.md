# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**, emphasizing the work of the **Holy Spirit** in uniting believers to Christ and progressively renewing them in His image. He maintained that spiritual gifts serve the **edification of the church** and are distributed according to the Spirit’s sovereign will, while sanctification is a lifelong process rooted in **union with Christ** and the application of redemption.

- "The Holy Spirit is the author and finisher of sanctification, distributing gifts to each as He wills, for the benefit of the whole body." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - Sanctification is initiated and sustained by the Holy Spirit, not by human effort alone.
    - It is both definitive (set apart in Christ) and progressive (growth in holiness).
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to believers, effecting real transformation.
    - Sanctification involves mortification of sin and vivification to new obedience.
    - "Sanctification is the gracious operation of the Holy Spirit, who renews man after the image of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Spiritual Gifts for the Edification of the Church**
    - Spiritual gifts are given by the Spirit for the common good and building up of the church.
    - No gift is given for personal boasting; all serve the unity and maturity of the body.
    - The diversity of gifts reflects the richness of Christ’s grace to His people.
    - Bavinck distinguishes between extraordinary (apostolic era) and ordinary (ongoing) gifts.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are distributed for the benefit of the church, not for the exaltation of individuals." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

3. **Union with Christ as the Foundation of Sanctification**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, which is the source of all spiritual life and growth.
    - Sanctification flows from this union, as Christ’s life is communicated to His people.
    - The Spirit mediates this union, making believers partakers of Christ’s benefits.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and transformative (sanctification).
    - "All the benefits of salvation, including sanctification, flow from union with Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Distinction and Connection between Justification and Sanctification**
    - Justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct aspects of salvation.
    - Justification is God’s declaration of righteousness; sanctification is the process of being made holy.
    - Both are gifts of grace, but sanctification involves active participation by the believer.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in justification, but evidenced in sanctification.
    - "Justification and sanctification are two benefits, distinct yet inseparable, flowing from the same Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **The Eschatological Goal of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is incomplete in this life but will be perfected at Christ’s return.
    - The Spirit’s work points believers toward the final renewal of all things.
    - Spiritual gifts anticipate the fullness of the new creation, where all will be made perfect.
    - The church’s present sanctification is a foretaste of future glory.
    - "Sanctification is the beginning of the new creation, to be completed in the resurrection." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of **sanctification** and spiritual gifts has shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in his emphasis on the centrality of the **Holy Spirit** and the communal purpose of spiritual gifts. His nuanced distinction between justification and sanctification remains influential in discussions of the ordo salutis. Bavinck’s work continues to inform contemporary debates on the role of spiritual gifts and the nature of Christian growth, grounding them in the believer’s union with Christ and the eschatological hope of the church.
