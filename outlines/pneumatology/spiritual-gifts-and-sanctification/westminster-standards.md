# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a classic Reformed doctrine of **sanctification** as a progressive work of **God’s grace** in believers, grounded in union with Christ and effected by the **Holy Spirit**. **Spiritual gifts** are understood as diverse endowments given for the **edification of the church**, always exercised within the context of the ordinary means of grace and the pursuit of holiness.

- "Sanctification is throughout, in the whole man, yet imperfect in this life; there abideth still some remnants of corruption in every part." (Westminster Confession of Faith 13.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 13, 16, 18, 26)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 72–77, 154–160)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 35–38)
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Distinct Work of Grace**
    - Sanctification is a real, progressive work distinct from **justification**.
    - It is initiated and sustained by the **Holy Spirit** through union with Christ.
    - The whole person is renewed after the image of God, though not made perfect in this life.
    - Believers are enabled to die more and more unto sin and live unto righteousness.
    "They, who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally..." (WCF 13.1)

2. **Means of Sanctification**
    - The **Word, sacraments, and prayer** are the ordinary means by which sanctification is advanced.
    - The Spirit works through these means to strengthen faith and obedience.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised within the context of these means, not apart from them.
    - Growth in grace is inseparable from participation in the visible church.
    "The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption are his ordinances, especially the word, sacraments, and prayer..." (WSC 88)

3. **Spiritual Gifts for Edification**
    - Spiritual gifts are given by the Spirit for the common good and building up of the church.
    - All gifts are to be used in accordance with **Scripture** and under church oversight.
    - Extraordinary gifts (e.g., prophecy, tongues) are considered to have ceased with the apostolic era.
    - Ordinary gifts (e.g., teaching, leadership, service) remain operative for the church’s edification.
    "Unto this catholic visible church Christ hath given the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God, for the gathering and perfecting of the saints..." (WCF 25.3)

4. **Imperfect Yet Real Progress**
    - Sanctification is never complete in this life; remnants of sin remain.
    - There is continual conflict between the flesh and the Spirit in every believer.
    - Yet, the regenerate will certainly persevere and grow in holiness.
    - Assurance of growth is grounded in God’s promises, not subjective experience alone.
    "There abideth still some remnants of corruption in every part, whence ariseth a continual and irreconcilable war..." (WCF 13.2)

5. **Corporate and Individual Dimensions**
    - Sanctification is both a personal and a corporate reality within the **covenant community**.
    - The church is responsible to nurture, discipline, and encourage growth in grace.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised for mutual benefit, not private exaltation.
    - The communion of saints is essential for the believer’s sanctification.
    "Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification." (WCF 26.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on sanctification and spiritual gifts, emphasizing the centrality of the **means of grace** and the ongoing work of the Spirit in the life of the believer. Their teaching on the cessation of extraordinary gifts and the primacy of ordinary means has influenced Presbyterian and broader Reformed practice. The Standards’ careful distinction between justification and sanctification, while maintaining their inseparable connection, remains foundational for confessional Reformed churches. Their legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on both personal holiness and the corporate life of the church.
