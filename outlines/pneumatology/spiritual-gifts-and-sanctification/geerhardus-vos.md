# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** within the broader framework of **redemptive history** and the application of **union with Christ**. He emphasized that the **Holy Spirit** is the agent of both the distribution of gifts and the progressive transformation of believers, situating these realities within the unfolding of the **ordo salutis** and the eschatological work of God.

- "The Spirit is the principle of all spiritual life and activity in the believer." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Soteriology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (in Reformed Dogmatics and lectures)
- "The Work of the Holy Spirit" (various lectures and writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Work of the Holy Spirit**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - The Holy Spirit progressively renews the believer in the image of Christ.
    - Sanctification is both definitive and progressive in the life of the Christian.
    - The Spirit’s work is inseparable from the application of redemption.
    - "Sanctification is the gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit by which He delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Spiritual Gifts as Eschatological Blessings**
    - Spiritual gifts are manifestations of the **age to come** breaking into the present.
    - The distribution of gifts is sovereignly determined by the Holy Spirit.
    - Gifts serve the edification of the church and the advancement of God’s kingdom.
    - The diversity of gifts reflects the unity and variety within the body of Christ.
    - "The gifts are tokens of the Spirit’s presence, pledges of the eschatological inheritance." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - All spiritual blessings, including sanctification and gifts, flow from union with Christ.
    - Union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification and renewal).
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of His life.
    - This union is the basis for both the mortification of sin and the vivification of new obedience.
    - "Union with Christ is the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Context of Sanctification and Gifts**
    - Sanctification and gifts must be understood within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The Spirit’s work in the church is the continuation of Christ’s redemptive mission.
    - The New Testament era is marked by a heightened outpouring of the Spirit’s gifts.
    - The church’s sanctification anticipates the final consummation in glory.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the Spirit’s work in the people of God." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Objective and Subjective Dimensions of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification has both an objective aspect (definitive break with sin) and a subjective aspect (ongoing renewal).
    - The believer’s growth in holiness is grounded in Christ’s finished work.
    - The Spirit enables both the will and the ability to pursue holiness.
    - Assurance and fruitfulness are the Spirit’s testimony in the believer’s life.
    - "The subjective realization of salvation is as much the Spirit’s work as its objective accomplishment." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s integration of **redemptive history** with the doctrines of sanctification and spiritual gifts has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology. His emphasis on the eschatological and pneumatological dimensions of the Christian life provided a robust framework for understanding the Spirit’s ongoing work in the church. Vos’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between the **ordo salutis** and the history of salvation, ensuring his enduring significance in systematic and biblical theology.
