# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** emphasizes their inseparable connection to **union with Christ** and the ongoing work of the **Holy Spirit**. He argues that the **gifts of the Spirit** are distributed according to God’s sovereign will and that sanctification is fundamentally rooted in the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection life. Gaffin is known for his careful exegesis of **Pauline theology**, especially regarding the cessation or continuation of certain gifts and the centrality of the Spirit in the Christian life.

- "The work of the Spirit in the believer is inseparable from the work of Christ for the believer." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Sanctification" in The Westminster Theological Journal (various articles)
- "The Holy Spirit" in The New Dictionary of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - Sanctification and spiritual gifts flow from the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work is always Christocentric, never independent of Christ’s redemptive accomplishment.
    - All benefits of salvation, including sanctification and gifts, are mediated through union with Christ.
    - This union is both definitive and progressive, shaping the entire Christian life.
    - "All the blessings of salvation, including the Spirit’s gifts, are found in union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Sanctification as Spirit-Wrought Transformation**
    - Sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit, not merely human effort.
    - It involves both definitive (once-for-all) and progressive (ongoing) aspects.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s resurrection to believers, enabling new obedience.
    - Growth in holiness is inseparable from the Spirit’s indwelling presence.
    - "Sanctification is the existential outworking of the believer’s participation in Christ’s resurrection." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Spiritual Gifts as Sovereignly Distributed**
    - The Holy Spirit distributes gifts according to God’s sovereign purpose, not human desire.
    - Not all gifts are given to every believer; diversity is essential for the church’s edification.
    - The purpose of gifts is to build up the body of Christ, not individual self-fulfillment.
    - Gaffin argues for the cessation of certain revelatory gifts (e.g., tongues, prophecy) after the apostolic era.
    - "The Spirit’s gifts are given as he wills, for the common good of the church." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Cessationism and the Apostolic Foundation**
    - Revelatory and foundational gifts (apostleship, prophecy, tongues) ceased with the close of the apostolic age.
    - The completed canon of Scripture now serves as the church’s foundation for faith and practice.
    - Ongoing gifts are those that edify and serve the church in ordinary ministry.
    - This view safeguards the sufficiency and finality of Scripture.
    - "The New Testament does not expect the continuation of all gifts throughout the church’s history." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Sanctification and Eschatology**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the already-not-yet tension of redemptive history.
    - Believers experience the inaugurated reality of resurrection life, awaiting its consummation.
    - The Spirit’s work in sanctification is both a present possession and a future hope.
    - Eschatology shapes the believer’s pursuit of holiness and use of gifts.
    - "The Spirit’s sanctifying work is the present manifestation of the age to come." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **union with Christ** and the Spirit’s role in sanctification has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology. His defense of cessationism and careful exegesis of Pauline texts have influenced debates on spiritual gifts within confessional circles. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a standard reference for understanding the relationship between the Holy Spirit, sanctification, and the life of the church. His legacy endures in the ongoing theological formation of pastors, scholars, and students committed to a Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered vision of the Christian life.
