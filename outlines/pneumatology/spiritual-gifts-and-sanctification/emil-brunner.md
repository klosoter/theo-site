# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** through the lens of **personal encounter with God** and the transformative work of the **Holy Spirit**. He emphasized that sanctification is not a human achievement but a response to God's initiative, with spiritual gifts serving the communal life of the **Body of Christ** rather than individual exaltation.

- "Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit, who alone can make us new creatures in Christ." (The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and the Consummation (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- The Misunderstanding of the Church

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Divine Initiative**
    - Sanctification originates in God's gracious action, not human effort.
    - The Holy Spirit is the primary agent of transformation in the believer.
    - Human cooperation is a response to God's prior work.
    - Sanctification is inseparable from justification in the life of faith.
    - "Sanctification is not our work, but God’s work in us." (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Spiritual Gifts for the Community**
    - Spiritual gifts are given for the edification of the church, not personal status.
    - Every believer receives gifts according to the Spirit’s will.
    - The diversity of gifts reflects the unity and interdependence of the Body of Christ.
    - Gifts must be exercised in love and humility.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are for service, not for self-glorification." (The Misunderstanding of the Church)

3. **Personal Encounter with God**
    - True sanctification arises from a living encounter with the risen Christ.
    - Faith is relational, not merely doctrinal or ethical.
    - The Holy Spirit mediates this encounter, making Christ present to the believer.
    - Spiritual gifts flow from this personal relationship, not from abstract principles.
    - "Faith is always an encounter, never a possession." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Rejection of Perfectionism**
    - Sanctification is always incomplete in this life due to human sinfulness.
    - The believer remains dependent on grace throughout the process.
    - Spiritual gifts do not indicate spiritual perfection.
    - The church is a community of sinners in continual need of renewal.
    - "There is no perfection in this world, only the beginning of the new creation." (Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Christocentric Focus of Sanctification**
    - Christ is the model and source of sanctified life.
    - The Spirit conforms believers to the image of Christ.
    - Spiritual gifts are to be exercised in imitation of Christ’s self-giving love.
    - All sanctification is oriented toward glorifying Christ, not the individual.
    - "The Christian life is a life lived in Christ and for Christ." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** shaped mid-20th-century Protestant thought by emphasizing the primacy of the Holy Spirit and the communal nature of Christian life. His insistence on the personal encounter with God and the Christocentric orientation of sanctification influenced both ecumenical dialogues and evangelical spirituality. Brunner’s work continues to challenge individualistic and perfectionist tendencies by rooting spiritual growth in divine initiative and the life of the church.
