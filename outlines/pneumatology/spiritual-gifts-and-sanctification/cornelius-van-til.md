# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** within the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology** and **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the work of the **Holy Spirit** in applying redemption, insisting that all spiritual gifts and growth in holiness are rooted in union with Christ and the antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate mind. Van Til’s thought underscores the necessity of a **biblical epistemology** for understanding the nature and purpose of sanctification and spiritual gifts.

- "The work of the Holy Spirit is to apply to the people of God the redemption purchased by Christ, and this includes both their sanctification and the gifts necessary for their service." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as the Outworking of Union with Christ**
    - Sanctification is inseparable from the believer’s union with Christ.
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s benefits, enabling true holiness.
    - Growth in holiness is both definitive and progressive.
    - All progress in sanctification is grounded in the finished work of Christ.
    - "Sanctification is not a human achievement but the fruit of the Spirit’s application of Christ’s work." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Spiritual Gifts as Functions within the Covenant Community**
    - Spiritual gifts are distributed by the Spirit for the edification of the church.
    - Gifts serve the corporate body, not individual self-exaltation.
    - The diversity of gifts reflects the unity and catholicity of the church.
    - All gifts must be exercised under the authority of Scripture.
    - "The Spirit equips each member for service, always in harmony with the Word." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis between Regenerate and Unregenerate Life**
    - The regenerate alone can exercise spiritual gifts rightly.
    - Sanctification and gifts manifest the antithesis between the church and the world.
    - The unregenerate misuse or misunderstand spiritual gifts.
    - True holiness is possible only through the Spirit’s renewing work.
    - "There is a radical difference between the ethical life of the believer and that of the unbeliever." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Epistemological Foundation for Sanctification**
    - Knowledge of God is covenantal and presupposes regeneration.
    - Sanctification involves the renewal of the mind according to Scripture.
    - The Spirit enables believers to interpret reality rightly.
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised in submission to God’s revelation.
    - "All knowledge, including knowledge of sanctification, must be taken captive to Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Primacy of Scripture in Regulating Gifts and Growth**
    - Scripture is the final authority for discerning and regulating spiritual gifts.
    - No gift or experience is valid apart from biblical warrant.
    - Sanctification is shaped by the means of grace revealed in Scripture.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture guards against enthusiasm and error.
    - "The Word of God is the norm by which all gifts and growth are to be measured." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s integration of **Reformed theology** and **presuppositional apologetics** has shaped contemporary discussions on the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification and spiritual gifts. His insistence on the antithesis and the necessity of a renewed mind has influenced both systematic theology and pastoral practice. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on the primacy of Scripture and the centrality of union with Christ in the Christian life.
