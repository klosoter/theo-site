# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading voice in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a doctrine of **sanctification** as a work of the **Holy Spirit** grounded in union with Christ. He affirmed the **cessation** of extraordinary spiritual gifts after the apostolic era, emphasizing the ongoing necessity of ordinary graces for the believer’s growth in holiness and the distinction between **justification** and sanctification.

- "The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, such as prophecy and tongues, were peculiar to the apostolic age and are not to be expected in the ordinary course of the church." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected sermons and disputations on the Christian life
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as a Distinct Grace**
   - Sanctification is distinct from **justification**, involving the internal renewal of the believer.
   - It is both a definitive act (breaking the dominion of sin) and a progressive work (growth in holiness).
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the principal agent, applying Christ’s benefits to the elect.
   - Good works are the fruit and evidence of sanctification, not its cause.
   "Sanctification is not the cause of our justification, but the necessary effect of it." (Institutes)

2. **Cessation of Extraordinary Spiritual Gifts**
   - Miraculous gifts (e.g., tongues, prophecy, healing) were given for the foundation of the church.
   - These gifts ceased with the close of the apostolic age and the completion of **Scripture**.
   - The ordinary gifts of the Spirit (faith, hope, love) continue for the edification of believers.
   - The sufficiency of **Scripture** renders new revelation unnecessary.
   "The extraordinary gifts were for the first planting of the church, not for its ordinary edification." (Institutes)

3. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Sanctification**
   - The **Spirit** unites believers to Christ, the source of all spiritual life.
   - He indwells, empowers, and progressively transforms the believer.
   - The Spirit works through the means of grace, especially the **Word** and sacraments.
   - Sanctification is synergistic: believers cooperate, enabled by grace.
   "The Spirit is the efficient cause of sanctification, working in us both to will and to do." (Institutes)

4. **Means of Grace and Growth in Holiness**
   - The **Word of God** is the primary means by which the Spirit sanctifies.
   - Prayer, sacraments, and fellowship are essential for spiritual growth.
   - Mortification of sin and vivification to righteousness are ongoing duties.
   - The church community supports and encourages sanctification.
   "The means of grace are instituted by God for our sanctification and must not be neglected." (Institutes)

5. **Assurance and Perseverance in Sanctification**
   - Assurance of salvation is possible through the witness of the Spirit and the fruits of sanctification.
   - Perseverance is grounded in God’s promise and the Spirit’s sustaining work.
   - True believers will not fall away finally, though they may struggle with sin.
   - Growth in holiness is evidence of genuine faith and election.
   "Perseverance in holiness is the fruit of God’s unchangeable love and the Spirit’s continual presence." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful distinction between **justification** and sanctification shaped later Reformed confessional theology, especially in debates over assurance and the Christian life. His defense of the **cessation** of extraordinary gifts influenced the mainstream Reformed tradition’s approach to charismatic phenomena. Turretin’s emphasis on the **means of grace** and the Spirit’s role in sanctification remains foundational for Reformed spirituality and pastoral practice. His scholastic clarity continues to inform systematic theology and the doctrine of Christian living in confessional Reformed circles.
