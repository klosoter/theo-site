# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** through the lens of **religious experience** and the individual's **God-consciousness**. He saw spiritual gifts as expressions of the community's shared life in Christ, rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence, and sanctification as the deepening of this consciousness within the Christian community. For Schleiermacher, both are inseparable from the communal and experiential dimensions of faith.

- "Every Christian is a member of the community only through the communication of the Spirit." ("The Christian Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Spiritual gifts as communal expressions**
   - Spiritual gifts arise from the shared **God-consciousness** within the Christian community.
   - They are not individual possessions but serve the edification of the whole body.
   - The diversity of gifts reflects the manifold ways the Spirit operates in the community.
   - The exercise of gifts is inseparable from the communal life of faith.
   - "The Spirit is not given to the individual for his own sake, but for the sake of the community." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Sanctification as growth in God-consciousness**
   - Sanctification is the progressive deepening of the individual's sense of dependence on God.
   - It is not primarily moral improvement but an intensification of religious feeling.
   - The process is ongoing and communal, not merely individualistic.
   - True sanctification results in greater unity with Christ and the church.
   - "Sanctification is nothing other than the constant increase of God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of religious experience**
   - Religious experience, especially the feeling of absolute dependence, is foundational for understanding gifts and sanctification.
   - Doctrines about spiritual gifts must be rooted in lived experience, not abstract theory.
   - The authenticity of gifts is measured by their capacity to deepen God-consciousness.
   - Sanctification is validated by the transformation of experience, not external conformity.
   - "Religion is to be found in the heart, not in external works." (On Religion)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in the community**
   - The Holy Spirit is the principle of unity and life in the church.
   - All spiritual gifts are manifestations of the Spirit's presence in the community.
   - The Spirit works through the means of grace, especially in communal worship.
   - The Spirit's activity is dynamic, adapting to the needs of the church in every age.
   - "The Holy Spirit is the common spirit of the Christian community." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical transformation as fruit of sanctification**
   - Ethical renewal is a byproduct of the deepening God-consciousness.
   - True sanctification leads to love, humility, and service within the community.
   - The ethical life is shaped by the Spirit's ongoing work, not by legalistic striving.
   - The goal is the realization of the kingdom of God in personal and communal life.
   - "The ethical is the necessary expression of the religious." (Christian Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher's understanding of **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** shifted the focus from external acts to the inner life and communal experience of faith. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the centrality of the Spirit in the church profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in the areas of ecclesiology and pneumatology. While later theologians critiqued his subjectivism, his legacy endures in contemporary discussions of spiritual formation and the communal nature of sanctification.
