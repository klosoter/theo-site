# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine** of **sanctification** as the Spirit-wrought renewal of believers, inseparably joined to **union with Christ** and grounded in **justification by faith alone**. **Spiritual gifts** are understood as gracious endowments from the Holy Spirit, given for the edification of the church and the service of others, not as a means of personal merit or boasting. The confessions emphasize the necessity of **good works** as fruit and evidence of true faith, while maintaining that all spiritual growth and gifting are rooted in divine grace.

- "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 64)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Lord’s Day 32–33, 44
- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 22–24
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine, Articles 11–16
- Lyle D. Bierma, "An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism: Sources, History, and Theology"
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification flows from union with Christ**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, and sanctification is the necessary result of this union.
    - Good works are the fruit, not the ground, of acceptance with God.
    - The Spirit applies Christ’s benefits, renewing the whole person after God’s image.
    - Sanctification is distinguished from justification but inseparably connected.
    - "Christ, having redeemed us by His blood, also renews us by His Holy Spirit after His own image." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 86)

2. **Spiritual gifts are sovereignly distributed by the Spirit**
    - All gifts are given by the Holy Spirit according to His will, not human merit.
    - Gifts are for the common good and the building up of the church.
    - No gift is a sign of superior spiritual status.
    - The confessions avoid speculation about extraordinary gifts, focusing on ordinary means.
    - "We must not misuse God's gifts, but use them to serve our neighbor." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 55)

3. **Good works as evidence, not cause, of salvation**
    - Good works are the necessary evidence of true faith and gratitude for salvation.
    - They do not contribute to justification or merit before God.
    - The regenerate are enabled to do good only by the Spirit’s power.
    - Assurance is strengthened by the presence of spiritual fruit.
    - "We do good works, but not to merit by them." (Belgic Confession, Article 24)

4. **Sanctification is progressive and lifelong**
    - Believers remain engaged in a continual struggle against sin.
    - Growth in holiness is gradual and never complete in this life.
    - The Spirit enables mortification of the old nature and vivification of the new.
    - The confessions stress daily repentance and renewal.
    - "Even the holiest men, while in this life, have only a small beginning of this obedience." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 114)

5. **The church as the context for gifts and growth**
    - Spiritual gifts are exercised within the communion of saints.
    - Mutual edification and service are essential to sanctification.
    - The ministry of Word and Sacrament is central to spiritual growth.
    - The confessions emphasize corporate responsibility for nurturing faith.
    - "Everyone must know it to be his duty, readily and cheerfully to employ his gifts for the advantage and salvation of other members." (Belgic Confession, Article 28)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and piety, providing a robust framework for understanding **sanctification** as Spirit-driven, Christ-centered, and inseparable from the life of the church. Their teaching on **spiritual gifts** as means for mutual service and edification continues to inform Reformed practice and catechesis. By insisting on the distinction yet inseparability of justification and sanctification, these confessions have safeguarded the gospel of grace while promoting a vibrant, grateful pursuit of holiness. Their influence endures in Reformed churches worldwide, shaping both doctrine and devotion.
