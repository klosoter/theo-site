# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** through the lens of **covenant theology** and **redemptive history**. He emphasized the work of the **Holy Spirit** as integral to the believer’s transformation within the context of the **new covenant**, highlighting the eschatological dimension of sanctification as participation in the inaugurated kingdom. Kline’s focus on the **intrusion ethic** and the typological fulfillment of Old Testament patterns shaped his understanding of how spiritual gifts function in the church’s sanctifying life.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sanctification as Eschatological Renewal**
    - Sanctification is rooted in the believer’s participation in the **new creation** inaugurated by Christ.
    - The Holy Spirit is the agent of eschatological transformation, applying Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The process is covenantal, reflecting the movement from promise to fulfillment.
    - Sanctification anticipates the consummation of the kingdom in the age to come.
    - "Sanctification is the present realization of the age-to-come life by the Spirit." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Spiritual Gifts as Covenant Blessings**
    - Spiritual gifts are distributed by the Spirit as signs of the new covenant community.
    - They serve the edification and priestly ministry of the church.
    - Gifts are not merely individual endowments but are oriented toward the corporate body.
    - Their function is typological, pointing to the fullness of the Spirit’s work in the eschaton.
    - "The gifts of the Spirit are the powers of the age to come breaking into the present." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Typology and the Intrusion Ethic**
    - Old Testament spiritual phenomena prefigure the greater realities of the new covenant.
    - The intrusion of eschatological realities shapes the church’s experience of sanctification and gifting.
    - Spiritual gifts are understood in light of typological fulfillment in Christ and the Spirit.
    - The ethic of the church reflects the already/not yet tension of redemptive history.
    - "The Spirit’s gifts are tokens of the final order, intruding into the present age." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Sanctification**
    - Sanctification is framed by the structure of God’s covenants with His people.
    - The Spirit’s work is covenantally administered, not merely existential or mystical.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are covenant signs that signify and seal sanctifying grace.
    - The church’s sanctification is communal, rooted in its identity as the covenant people.
    - "Sanctification is the outworking of covenantal consecration by the Spirit." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Authority of Scripture in Spiritual Formation**
    - The Spirit works through the Word, not apart from it, in sanctifying believers.
    - Spiritual gifts are regulated by the authority and sufficiency of Scripture.
    - The canon provides the norm for discerning authentic spiritual experience.
    - The church’s spiritual life is shaped by the redemptive-historical unfolding of revelation.
    - "The Spirit’s ministry is inseparable from the Word he inspired." (Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and redemptive-historical approach to **sanctification** and **spiritual gifts** has significantly influenced Reformed biblical theology. His emphasis on the **intrusion ethic** and the eschatological work of the Spirit has shaped contemporary discussions on the nature and purpose of spiritual gifts in the church. Kline’s insights continue to inform debates on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, especially regarding the Spirit’s role in the life of God’s people. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of covenant theology and its application to Christian sanctification.
