# Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899–1981)

Martyn Lloyd-Jones emphasized the ongoing reality of **spiritual gifts** and the necessity of the **Holy Spirit’s power** in the believer’s life for true **sanctification**. He distinguished between **regeneration** and the **baptism of the Holy Spirit**, arguing that the latter brings a deeper assurance and empowerment for Christian living and ministry. Lloyd-Jones critiqued cessationism and called for a renewed expectation of **spiritual vitality** and **holiness** through the Spirit’s work.

- "The baptism with the Spirit is something that is done by the Lord Jesus Christ, not by us, and it is something that is done to those who are already believers." (Joy Unspeakable)

## Key Works

- The Sermon on the Mount (1959–1960)
- The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors (1987)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Regeneration and Baptism with the Spirit**
    - Regeneration is the Spirit’s work in giving new life, while baptism with the Spirit is a distinct, empowering experience.
    - Baptism with the Spirit brings assurance, joy, and boldness for witness.
    - Not all believers have experienced this baptism, though all are regenerated.
    - This distinction is crucial for understanding the fullness of **sanctification**.
    - "The baptism of the Holy Spirit is not the same as regeneration." (Joy Unspeakable)

2. **Ongoing Validity of Spiritual Gifts**
    - Lloyd-Jones rejected strict cessationism, affirming that **spiritual gifts** continue today.
    - He encouraged openness to gifts such as prophecy, healing, and tongues, within biblical boundaries.
    - The gifts are for the edification of the church and the advance of the gospel.
    - He warned against both fanaticism and unbelief regarding the Spirit’s work.
    - "There is no scriptural warrant for saying that these things ceased at the end of the apostolic age." (Joy Unspeakable)

3. **Sanctification as Dependent on the Spirit’s Power**
    - Sanctification is not merely self-effort but the result of the Spirit’s ongoing work.
    - The believer must seek continual filling and empowerment by the Spirit.
    - True holiness flows from communion with Christ through the Spirit.
    - Reliance on the Spirit guards against legalism and spiritual stagnation.
    - "Holiness is not something we are called upon to do in order that we may become something; it is something we are to do because of what we already are." (Sermon on the Mount)

4. **Assurance and Joy as Marks of the Spirit’s Work**
    - The Spirit’s presence brings assurance of adoption and the love of God.
    - Joy is a distinguishing mark of those filled with the Spirit.
    - Assurance is not merely doctrinal but experiential, rooted in the Spirit’s testimony.
    - This joy and assurance empower bold witness and perseverance in sanctification.
    - "The greatest need of the hour is a revived and joyful church, full of the Holy Spirit." (Joy Unspeakable)

5. **Centrality of Scripture in Testing Spiritual Experience**
    - All claims of spiritual gifts and experiences must be tested by **Scripture**.
    - The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word of God.
    - Discernment is necessary to avoid deception and excess.
    - The authority of Scripture safeguards the church’s pursuit of spiritual gifts and sanctification.
    - "The test of the Spirit always is the Word." (Joy Unspeakable)

## Legacy and Impact

Lloyd-Jones’s teaching on **spiritual gifts** and **sanctification** helped revive interest in the experiential and supernatural dimensions of Reformed spirituality. His insistence on the Spirit’s ongoing work influenced both charismatic and non-charismatic evangelicals, challenging cessationist assumptions. Lloyd-Jones remains a pivotal figure in twentieth-century British evangelicalism, shaping discussions on the relationship between **holiness**, assurance, and the power of the Holy Spirit.
