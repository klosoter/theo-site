# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **regeneration** and **indwelling** from a Reformed, presuppositional perspective, emphasizing the sovereign initiative of God in the application of redemption. He views **regeneration** as the Spirit’s monergistic act that brings spiritual life, and the **indwelling** of the Holy Spirit as the ongoing presence and empowerment of believers for sanctification and assurance. Frame integrates these doctrines within his broader **tri-perspectival** framework, highlighting their significance for Christian experience and obedience.

- "Regeneration is the Spirit’s work of giving new life, and indwelling is his continuing presence in that new life." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord"
- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is monergistic**
    - God alone, by the Holy Spirit, initiates and accomplishes regeneration without human cooperation.
    - Regeneration precedes faith and is necessary for any response to the gospel.
    - It is a supernatural act that imparts spiritual life to the elect.
    - Human will is renewed as a result, not a cause, of regeneration.
    - "Regeneration is not a cooperative effort between God and man, but the sovereign work of God alone." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Indwelling as the Spirit’s personal presence**
    - The Holy Spirit takes up residence in every believer at the moment of regeneration.
    - Indwelling is distinct from but inseparable from regeneration and union with Christ.
    - The Spirit’s presence empowers sanctification, assurance, and perseverance.
    - Indwelling marks the believer as belonging to Christ and the new covenant community.
    - "The indwelling Spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance and the source of our spiritual vitality." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Tri-perspectival integration**
    - Regeneration and indwelling are understood through normative (biblical), situational (experiential), and existential (personal) perspectives.
    - This approach guards against reductionism and highlights the richness of the Spirit’s work.
    - The doctrines are not merely abstract but shape the believer’s life and obedience.
    - Frame’s method connects theological truth to practical Christian living.
    - "We must see regeneration and indwelling as realities that shape our knowledge, our situation, and our hearts." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Union with Christ as the context**
    - Regeneration and indwelling are benefits of union with Christ, not isolated blessings.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them participants in his life, death, and resurrection.
    - All aspects of salvation, including regeneration and indwelling, flow from this union.
    - Assurance and growth are grounded in the believer’s ongoing relationship to Christ by the Spirit.
    - "All the blessings of salvation, including regeneration and indwelling, come to us in union with Christ." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

5. **Ethical and ecclesial implications**
    - The indwelling Spirit enables obedience and transformation in the Christian life.
    - Regeneration creates a new community marked by holiness and love.
    - The church is the temple of the Holy Spirit, corporately indwelt and empowered.
    - Ethical living and mission flow from the Spirit’s renewing and indwelling work.
    - "The Spirit’s indwelling is not only individual but corporate, shaping the life and witness of the church." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s articulation of **regeneration** and **indwelling** has reinforced the Reformed emphasis on God’s sovereignty in salvation while integrating these doctrines with practical Christian living. His **tri-perspectivalism** has provided a fresh methodological lens for understanding the Spirit’s work in both the individual and the church. Frame’s influence is evident in contemporary Reformed theology, especially among those seeking to connect doctrinal precision with experiential and ethical dimensions of faith.
