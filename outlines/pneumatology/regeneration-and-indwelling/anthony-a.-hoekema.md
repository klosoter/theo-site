# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema, a prominent Reformed theologian, emphasized the transformative nature of **regeneration** as a sovereign act of the **Holy Spirit** that imparts new spiritual life and results in the **indwelling of Christ** within believers. He maintained that regeneration is monergistic, preceding faith, and that the indwelling presence of the Spirit is essential for the believer’s sanctification and assurance. Hoekema’s approach integrates **union with Christ**, highlighting the inseparability of regeneration and the ongoing work of the Spirit in the life of the Christian.

- "Regeneration is the implanting of the new life in the heart, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the abiding presence of Christ in the believer." ("Saved by Grace")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Work of God**
    - Regeneration is exclusively the work of the **Holy Spirit**, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - It is instantaneous, effecting a radical change in the sinner’s nature.
    - Precedes and enables **saving faith**; faith is the result, not the cause, of regeneration.
    - Rooted in the eternal decree and accomplished through the application of **redemption**.
    - "Regeneration is the act of God by which the principle of new life is implanted in man, and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy." (Saved by Grace)

2. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit as Essential to Christian Life**
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the means by which **union with Christ** is realized.
    - This indwelling is permanent, distinguishing the New Covenant experience from the Old.
    - The Spirit’s presence empowers believers for **sanctification** and spiritual growth.
    - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in the Spirit’s ongoing work within.
    - "The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the abiding presence of Christ in the believer, making possible a life of true holiness." (Saved by Grace)

3. **Union with Christ as the Context for Regeneration and Indwelling**
    - Regeneration and indwelling are inseparable from the believer’s **union with Christ**.
    - All benefits of salvation, including new birth and Spirit-indwelling, flow from this union.
    - Union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification and renewal).
    - The Spirit mediates the presence of Christ, uniting believers to Him.
    - "All the blessings of salvation flow from our union with Christ, which is established by the Spirit in regeneration." (Saved by Grace)

4. **Regeneration Produces a New Disposition**
    - The regenerate person receives a new heart and spiritual orientation.
    - This new disposition inclines the will toward God and away from sin.
    - The change is internal and foundational, affecting the whole person.
    - The fruit of regeneration is seen in repentance, faith, and obedience.
    - "Regeneration is not merely a change in status but a radical renewal of the inner man." (Saved by Grace)

5. **Assurance and Perseverance Rooted in the Spirit’s Indwelling**
    - The indwelling Spirit testifies to the believer’s adoption and security.
    - Assurance is not based on subjective feelings but on the objective work of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit enables perseverance by continually applying Christ’s benefits.
    - The believer’s growth in holiness is evidence of the Spirit’s abiding presence.
    - "The Spirit’s indwelling presence is the guarantee of our inheritance and the source of our assurance." (Saved by Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** has shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in discussions of the ordo salutis and the believer’s union with Christ. His clear distinction between regeneration and conversion, while maintaining their inseparable connection, has provided clarity for pastors and theologians alike. Hoekema’s work continues to influence evangelical understandings of assurance, sanctification, and the Spirit’s role in the Christian life.
