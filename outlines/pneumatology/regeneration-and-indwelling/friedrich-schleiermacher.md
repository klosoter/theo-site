# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher redefined **regeneration** and **indwelling** by rooting them in the individual's **God-consciousness** and the communal life of the **Christian church**. For Schleiermacher, regeneration is not a supernatural infusion of new life but a deepening of the feeling of absolute dependence on God, while indwelling is experienced through participation in the **Spirit** as mediated by the community of faith.

- "Regeneration is nothing other than the awakening of the God-consciousness which had been dormant." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Awakening of God-Consciousness**
    - Regeneration is the emergence of **God-consciousness** within the individual.
    - It is not a metaphysical change but a transformation of self-awareness.
    - The process is continuous rather than instantaneous.
    - Regeneration is inseparable from the communal life of the church.
    - "Regeneration is simply the awakening of the God-consciousness which is dormant in all men." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Indwelling as Participation in the Spirit**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is present in the community, not as an individual possession.
    - Indwelling is experienced through participation in the life of the church.
    - The Spirit unites believers by deepening their God-consciousness.
    - The Spirit’s presence is dynamic and relational, not static or ontological.
    - "The Spirit is present only in the fellowship of believers, not in the individual as such." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Supernaturalist Ontology**
    - Regeneration is not a supernatural infusion of substance or essence.
    - Schleiermacher opposes the idea of a metaphysical change in human nature.
    - He emphasizes psychological and experiential transformation.
    - The language of "new birth" is metaphorical, not literal.
    - "The new creation is not a change of substance, but a change in the direction of the self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Mediation of Grace through the Church**
    - The church is the locus of the Spirit’s activity and the means of grace.
    - Regeneration and indwelling are realized in the context of Christian community.
    - The sacraments and preaching are communal means of awakening God-consciousness.
    - Individual experience is always mediated by the shared life of faith.
    - "The Spirit works only in and through the fellowship of the Church." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - The feeling of absolute dependence is the core of Christian experience.
    - Regeneration is the intensification of this feeling.
    - Indwelling is the ongoing presence of this consciousness within the believer.
    - Doctrine articulates, but does not produce, the experience of regeneration and indwelling.
    - "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **regeneration** and **indwelling** shifted the focus from metaphysical change to the experiential and communal dimensions of Christian life. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the mediating role of the church profoundly influenced modern liberal theology and the development of Protestant thought. While his views were controversial among confessional traditions, they laid the groundwork for later discussions on the relationship between religious experience, community, and doctrine. Schleiermacher remains a pivotal figure in the transition from classical to modern theology.
