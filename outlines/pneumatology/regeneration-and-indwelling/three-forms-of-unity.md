# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** as central to the believer’s union with Christ. These confessional standards emphasize that **regeneration** is a sovereign work of God, effecting a new heart and enabling true faith, while the **Spirit’s indwelling** assures believers of their adoption and empowers sanctification. The confessions consistently uphold the necessity of this inward renewal for participation in the benefits of salvation.

- "He also assures me of eternal life, and makes me heartily willing and ready henceforth to live unto him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 1)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 1, 8, 21, 53, 86
- The Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 22–24
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads III/IV
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Work of God**
    - Regeneration is not a human achievement but a gracious act of God alone.
    - The Spirit works inwardly, effecting a new birth apart from human will or effort.
    - This renewal is necessary for faith and repentance to arise in the heart.
    - The confessions reject any synergistic or semi-Pelagian understanding of regeneration.
    - "Regeneration is a supernatural work, most powerful, and at the same time most delightful, astonishing, mysterious, and ineffable." (Canons of Dort III/IV.12)

2. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Holy Spirit personally dwells within all true believers.
    - This indwelling assures believers of their union with Christ and adoption as children of God.
    - The Spirit’s presence is the source of comfort, sanctification, and perseverance.
    - The confessions link the Spirit’s indwelling to the ongoing application of Christ’s benefits.
    - "By the Holy Spirit, who dwells in me, I am united to Christ and share in all his benefits." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 53)

3. **Faith as the Fruit of Regeneration**
    - True faith arises only from a heart renewed by the Spirit.
    - Regeneration precedes and enables the exercise of saving faith.
    - The confessions stress that faith is not a human work but a gift granted through regeneration.
    - Assurance and trust in Christ flow from this Spirit-wrought faith.
    - "Faith is the gift of God, not because it is offered by God to man’s free will, but because it is actually conferred, instilled, and infused into him." (Canons of Dort III/IV.14)

4. **Sanctification Flows from Indwelling**
    - The indwelling Spirit produces genuine sanctification in the believer’s life.
    - Good works are the necessary fruit of regeneration, not the ground of acceptance.
    - The confessions emphasize the Spirit’s ongoing work in mortifying sin and renewing the image of God.
    - Believers are called to live in gratitude, empowered by the Spirit’s presence.
    - "It is impossible that those grafted into Christ by true faith should not bring forth fruits of thankfulness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 64)

5. **Perseverance Secured by the Spirit**
    - The Spirit’s indwelling guarantees the perseverance of the saints.
    - Believers are preserved in faith and holiness by the Spirit’s continual work.
    - The confessions reject the possibility of true believers finally falling away.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s sustaining presence.
    - "God, who is rich in mercy, according to his unchangeable purpose of election, does not wholly withdraw the Holy Spirit from His own people." (Canons of Dort V.8)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, especially regarding the doctrines of regeneration and the indwelling Spirit. Their clear articulation of monergistic regeneration and the Spirit’s ongoing presence has influenced Reformed confessional identity and pastoral practice. These confessions continue to serve as doctrinal standards for many Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring a consistent emphasis on the necessity and fruit of the Spirit’s work in salvation.
