# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates **regeneration** as the infusion of **sanctifying grace** by the Holy Spirit, transforming the soul and enabling participation in the divine life. He understands the **indwelling** of the Holy Spirit as the presence of God within the justified, grounding the believer’s capacity for **charity** and supernatural virtue. For Aquinas, both regeneration and indwelling are rooted in the **sacramental economy**, especially **baptism**, and are sustained by ongoing cooperation with grace.

- "By the gift of sanctifying grace, the Holy Spirit dwells in us as in His temple." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 110, a. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as the Infusion of Sanctifying Grace**
    - Regeneration is the initial movement from spiritual death to life, effected by God alone.
    - It occurs primarily through the sacrament of baptism, which cleanses original sin.
    - The soul receives a new supernatural principle, enabling it to act toward God.
    - This grace is not merely external but transforms the very nature of the soul.
    - "Regeneration is nothing else than the justification of the ungodly." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 69, a. 1)

2. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit as a Personal Presence**
    - The Holy Spirit dwells in the soul as an uncreated gift, distinct from created grace.
    - This indwelling is the basis for the believer’s friendship with God.
    - It is realized through the possession of sanctifying grace and charity.
    - The indwelling is lost through mortal sin but restored by penance.
    - "God is said to dwell in us by His grace." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 43, a. 3)

3. **Sacramental Mediation of Regeneration**
    - Baptism is the ordinary means by which regeneration is conferred.
    - The sacraments are effective signs, truly causing what they signify.
    - The grace of regeneration is not limited to the moment of baptism but can be renewed.
    - Faith and intention are necessary for the fruitful reception of sacramental grace.
    - "Baptism is the sacrament of faith, and without faith no one is spiritually regenerated." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 68, a. 8)

4. **Habitual Grace and the Virtues**
    - Regeneration implants **habitual grace**, a stable disposition in the soul.
    - This grace enables the theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity.
    - The indwelling Spirit empowers the believer to perform supernatural acts.
    - Growth in grace and virtue is possible through cooperation with God’s action.
    - "Grace is a certain participation in the divine nature." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 110, a. 3)

5. **Distinction Between Created and Uncreated Effects**
    - The indwelling Spirit is uncreated, while sanctifying grace is a created effect in the soul.
    - The presence of the Spirit is both ontological (by grace) and relational (by love).
    - Created grace makes the soul apt for the Spirit’s indwelling.
    - The distinction safeguards both God’s transcendence and immanence.
    - "The Holy Spirit is given to us so that we may be made partakers of the divine nature." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 21)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s account of **regeneration and indwelling** shaped the Roman Catholic understanding of **justification**, **sanctification**, and the **sacramental life**. His synthesis of patristic and scholastic thought provided a foundation for later debates on grace, especially at the Council of Trent. Aquinas’s distinctions between created and uncreated grace continue to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of the Spirit’s presence in the believer. His influence extends beyond Catholicism, impacting ecumenical dialogues on the doctrine of salvation and the work of the Holy Spirit.
