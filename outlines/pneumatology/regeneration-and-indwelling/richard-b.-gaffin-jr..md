# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** emphasizes the centrality of **union with Christ** in the application of redemption. He insists that **regeneration** is inseparable from the Spirit’s work of uniting believers to Christ, and that the **indwelling** Spirit is the source of all spiritual life and sanctification. Gaffin’s approach is marked by a strong biblical-theological method, especially in relation to **Pauline soteriology**.

- "The work of the Spirit in the application of redemption is essentially the work of union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in the Ordo Salutis
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Holy Spirit" in The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century, Vol. 2
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" in Westminster Theological Journal

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Union with Christ**
    - Regeneration is not an isolated act but occurs in the context of being united to the resurrected Christ.
    - The Spirit’s work of regeneration is inseparable from the believer’s incorporation into Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Emphasizes the eschatological nature of regeneration as participation in the new creation.
    - Rejects a purely ordo salutis (order of salvation) approach that abstracts regeneration from union with Christ.
    - "Regeneration is not something that can be abstracted from union with Christ, but is an aspect of it." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Indwelling of the Spirit as the Essence of Christian Life**
    - The indwelling Spirit is the defining mark of the new covenant believer.
    - Indwelling is not a second blessing but is coextensive with faith and union with Christ.
    - The Spirit’s presence is both the source and guarantee of sanctification and perseverance.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is eschatological, marking believers as participants in the age to come.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the distinguishing feature of the Christian, the hallmark of the new age." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

3. **Resurrection and Regeneration**
    - Christ’s resurrection is the ground and pattern of the believer’s regeneration.
    - The Spirit applies the resurrection life of Christ to believers, effecting new creation.
    - Regeneration is thus both forensic (justification) and transformative (new life).
    - The believer’s present experience of resurrection life anticipates future bodily resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event for the application of redemption, including regeneration." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Gaffin’s approach is shaped by redemptive-historical and biblical-theological categories.
    - He resists systematic abstraction, preferring to trace the unfolding of regeneration and indwelling in the history of redemption.
    - Emphasizes Pauline theology as foundational for understanding the Spirit’s work.
    - Sees the ordo salutis as subordinate to the historia salutis (history of salvation).
    - "Paul’s soteriology is fundamentally eschatological and Christocentric, not merely a sequence of discrete acts." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Rejection of a Two-Stage Pneumatology**
    - Opposes Pentecostal and some Reformed views that separate regeneration from subsequent Spirit baptism.
    - Argues that all believers receive the Spirit fully at conversion.
    - The gifts and fruit of the Spirit are inseparable from the initial indwelling.
    - The Spirit’s work is unified, not divided into distinct post-conversion experiences.
    - "There is no basis in Paul for a two-stage experience of the Spirit; the Spirit’s indwelling is definitive for all believers." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of **union with Christ**, especially in relation to **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit**. His biblical-theological emphasis has encouraged a more integrated reading of Pauline soteriology and has challenged both traditional ordo salutis models and charismatic pneumatologies. Gaffin’s influence is evident in the resurgence of redemptive-historical preaching and in ongoing debates about the application of redemption within the Reformed tradition.
