### TITLE
Union, New Birth, and Presence: Regeneration and Indwelling in Reformed Soteriology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How **regeneration** as monergistic new creation relates to the **indwelling** presence of the Spirit and of Christ in the believer, and how both are ordered within **union with Christ** and the ordo salutis.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, John Owen, Jonathan Edwards, Louis Berkhof.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian and medieval preparation for grace, Reformed orthodoxy and Puritan theology, post-Reformation Calvinism, modern evangelical and Pentecostal debates, with Roman Catholic and Arminian/Wesleyan soteriologies as external contrasts.
- Debates:
  - Internal: priority of **union with Christ** or regeneration, nature of **indwelling** as mystical, moral, or sacramental, and the relation of regeneration to effectual calling, faith, and assurance.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian views of the will, Roman Catholic synergy and sacramental causality, Arminian/Wesleyan prevenient grace and resistibility, Pentecostal subsequence and “second blessing” models.
  - Contemporary: “Spirit Christology” and indwelling, sacramental vs “decisionist” evangelism, psychological models of conversion, and charismatic experiences of presence.
- Defended position: In a classic Reformed, Westminsterian sense, **regeneration** is the instantaneous, sovereign, Trinitarian act by which the Spirit unites the elect sinner to the risen Christ, imparting a new heart and principle of life, and this very union necessarily entails and grounds the **indwelling** of the Holy Spirit and of Christ such that indwelling is not a later second blessing but the personal, covenantal form of the new life granted in regeneration.

### ESSAY
To face oral examination on **regeneration and indwelling** in a Westminster setting, one must bring into clear focus three interlocking issues: the nature of the human condition in sin, the mode and moment of divine saving action in the sinner, and the way the triune God personally inhabits those whom he saves. If the doctrine of sin is misjudged, **regeneration** will collapse into moral persuasion. If the ordo salutis is confused, regeneration will either be swallowed by justification and adoption or turned into a post-conversion experience. If the doctrine of God and the Trinity is not held in its classical form, **indwelling** degenerates either into pantheistic fusion or into a merely moral metaphor. The crucial task is to state precisely what is meant when we confess that the Spirit regenerates sinners and indwells them, and how this relates to **union with Christ** and the rest of the work of salvation.

Historically, Augustine is the decisive starting point because he reframed both the human problem and the divine remedy in a way that makes regeneration as monergistic new birth necessary. Against Pelagius, Augustine insisted on the radical impotence of the fallen will. In works such as On the Spirit and the Letter and On the Predestination of the Saints, he argues that postlapsarian humanity is not merely weakened but turned in on itself, bound by concupiscence, unable not to sin. For Augustine, grace is not simply divine assistance added to an intact faculty of self-determination; it is **healing and re-creating grace** that gives what it commands. The heart of his antipelagian move is that faith itself is a gift of God’s grace, not a self-generated response. When he speaks of the Spirit’s work in the heart, Augustine anticipates later language of regeneration and indwelling: God “pours his love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” and “our wills are not free from righteousness unless they are freed by the grace of God.” This implies an inward, efficacious operation of God in the will.

However, Augustine does not sharply distinguish terminologically between **regeneration** and ongoing sanctification, nor does he systematically separate effectual calling, regeneration, faith, and justification. He tends to treat the gift of a new heart, the infusion of love, the indwelling of the Spirit, and the sacrament of baptism as different aspects of one grace of new life. This simultaneous breadth and lack of conceptual isolation is precisely what later Reformed theologians will refine. Still, Augustine’s theological grammar is foundational: the Spirit’s inward operation is unilateral, precedes and enables faith, and establishes a real though analogical **indwelling** of God in the soul. Any attempt to make regeneration a mere human decision, or to treat indwelling as a metaphor for moral influence, runs directly against this Augustinian legacy.

The Reformed tradition, and especially John Calvin, receives Augustine’s anti-Pelagian insight but advances clarity on **union with Christ**, regeneration, and indwelling. In the Institutes, particularly book 3, Calvin’s central axiom is that as long as Christ is outside of us, all that he has done for salvation is of no benefit to us. The Spirit’s primary saving work is to graft us into Christ. Calvin treats **union with Christ** not as one benefit among others, but as the encompassing reality in which justification, adoption, sanctification, and all gifts are found. Within that framework, he describes regeneration as the inward renewal by the Spirit, a mortification of the old man and vivification of the new, a being made partaker of Christ’s life. While later Reformed orthodoxy often locates regeneration as a discrete instant in the ordo salutis, Calvin more fluidly speaks of the Spirit’s **effectual calling**, gift of faith, repentance, and new life in close connection and sometimes under overlapping terms such as “regeneration” and “repentance.”

Crucially, Calvin’s doctrine of **indwelling** is intensely Trinitarian and Christological. The Spirit is the bond of union, uniting us to the whole Christ. Calvin can say both that Christ dwells in our hearts by faith and that the Spirit dwells within us as the earnest of our inheritance. Indwelling is thus the personal mode of union: to be united to Christ is to have his Spirit dwelling in us. Examiners will press here: does regeneration precede union, or does union precede regeneration? A defensible, Calvinian answer is that one should not hypostatize the ordo salutis into a temporal sequence inside a single instant, but rather distinguish logical relations. The Spirit sovereignly unites us to Christ, and this union includes the implantation of a new principle of life, which is what we call **regeneration**. To speak of regeneration apart from union risks treating “new life” as a quasi-substance detached from Christ himself. Calvin guards against this by insisting that all life is in the Son by the Spirit.

John Owen, operating in the high seventeenth-century Reformed orthodoxy and Puritan context, gives perhaps the most refined dogmatic articulation of **regeneration** and **indwelling** within a fully developed doctrine of the Spirit. In The Holy Spirit, Owen distinguishes carefully between external and internal operations of the Spirit. The external call of the gospel addresses the mind and conscience through the word, but in **effectual calling** the Spirit adds an internal, sovereign, and invincible work. Owen insists that the sinner, considered in Adam, is spiritually dead, lacking any power to cooperate in initial conversion. Regeneration for Owen is the infusion of a new habitus, a new spiritual principle in the soul, by which the mind is enlightened, the will freed and inclined to God, and the affections set on heavenly things.

Here internal debates arise. Some Reformed theologians define **regeneration** strictly as the instantaneous first impartation of life prior to the act of faith, while using terms like “conversion” and “repentance” for the first conscious acts of the renewed soul. Others, following Calvin’s broader usage, use regeneration more comprehensively to include the whole turning from sin to God. Owen holds the narrower, more technical view: regeneration is monergistic, prior to faith, and causally grounds the free, willing act of believing. Examiners may challenge: if regeneration precedes faith, do you not have a regenerate unbeliever, which seems absurd? The Owenic answer is that the priority is logical and causal, not temporally extended. The Spirit’s quickening and the soul’s believing are inseparable in time, but the former grounds the latter as its principle. There is no temporally enduring regenerate unbelief, yet one must not reverse the relation and make faith the cause of new birth.

On **indwelling**, Owen again is decisive. He distinguishes between the Spirit’s essential omnipresence, his gracious special presence, and his indwelling as the author of holiness. Indwelling is not a mixture of divine and human essences nor an absorption of the human mind into God, which would violate **divine simplicity** and classical theism. Rather, the Spirit personally and graciously dwells in believers as in a temple, producing faith, holiness, and consolation. This indwelling is covenantal and Christological: the Spirit indwells as the Spirit of Christ, mediating Christ’s presence and benefits. For Owen, there is no regenerate believer who is not indwelt by the Spirit. To posit regeneration without indwelling would be to posit new life without its personal source.

Jonathan Edwards, working in the eighteenth-century New England context, reframes regeneration and indwelling in terms of a sophisticated psychology of the affections and a strong doctrine of divine sovereignty. In works like Religious Affections and A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections, Edwards grapples with the empirical phenomena of awakenings, “false conversions,” and deep experiences of God. He insists, in Augustinian and Reformed continuity, that the natural man is wholly unable to embrace the gospel. Regeneration is a “new sense of the heart,” a new disposition by which the excellency of God’s glory is tasted as sweet. For Edwards, this new sense is not mere information but a transformation of the will’s inclination. This allows him to uphold a robust compatibilism: the regenerate freely choose God because their hearts have been changed.

Edwards contributes to the doctrine of **indwelling** by tying it to the communication of God’s beauty and love. The Spirit’s indwelling is not just the cause of moral transformation but the personal presence of God’s glory in the soul, giving a “new sense of the heart” concerning divine things. He writes of “God’s dwelling in the heart” as a real though analogical participation in the divine fullness. However, Edwards also guards transcendence and **analogical knowledge**: creaturely participation does not erase the Creator–creature distinction. Examiners may press whether this “new sense” collapses theology into religious experience or makes indwelling essentially affective. A careful Edwardsian reading shows that for him the new sense is an effect of the Spirit’s efficacious operation, not its essence, and that it is always tethered to the objective revelation of God in Christ.

Louis Berkhof, as a representative twentieth-century Reformed dogmatician, systematizes the classic ordo salutis that Westminster examiners expect students to navigate. In his Systematic Theology, Berkhof defines **regeneration** as the act of God by which the principle of the new life is implanted in man and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy. He distinguishes between “regeneration in the restricted sense,” which is the instantaneous begetting of new life, and “regeneration in the wider sense,” which can include conversion. In the ordo, Berkhof places effectual calling first as the general heading for the Spirit’s work through the word, and then regeneration, followed by conversion understood as the conscious exercise of repentance and faith. Berkhof’s aim is clarity: to safeguard monergism at the root while acknowledging the necessity of conscious response.

On **indwelling**, Berkhof is typical of classic Reformed orthodoxy: he speaks of the Spirit’s indwelling as the abiding presence of the Spirit in believers, from which flows sanctification, assurance, and perseverance. He strongly rejects any notion of a subsequence of indwelling after conversion as a “second blessing.” For Berkhof, regeneration and indwelling are inseparable benefits of union with Christ applied by the Spirit. Once a person is regenerated, he is indwelt; and being indwelt, he is progressively sanctified. The logic is covenantal and Christocentric: those whom the Father elected and the Son redeemed are in due time called, regenerated, united to Christ, justified, adopted, and indwelt by the Spirit, all infallibly and indefectibly.

Against this Reformed line stand important external alternatives. Roman Catholic theology, especially as articulated at Trent, affirms the necessity of grace and speaks freely of the **indwelling** of God in the soul through infused grace and charity. However, it locates the initial conferral of this life primarily in the sacrament of baptism as an instrumental cause and treats human free cooperation as a true partial cause in justification and sanctification. The issue for oral defense is not whether Rome believes in inward renewal and indwelling, but whether **regeneration** is monergistic and whether the grace that regenerates can be merited de congruo or de condigno. The Reformed position denies both. Regeneration is not sacramentally automatic, is not within human control, and is not the fruit of preparatory merits. Sacraments are means, not causes; they signify and seal what God sovereignly gives by the Spirit.

Arminian and Wesleyan theologies present a different kind of challenge. They often affirm the language of new birth and inner transformation but place heavy weight on **prevenient grace** given universally, which restores the ability of all sinners to respond to the gospel. Regeneration in the strict sense is then made contingent upon the foreseen free choice of the sinner to believe. Indwelling likewise is sometimes made conditional and losable. The Reformed critique, building on Augustine, Calvin, Owen, and Edwards, is that such a scheme reintroduces a semi-Pelagian anthropology, makes the decisive difference lie in the human will’s autonomous choice, and undermines the Pauline accent on God’s distinguishing grace. Examiners will ask whether monergistic regeneration compromises human responsibility. A solid answer, following Edwards, is that the regenerate freely and responsibly believe because their wills have been renewed; responsibility does not require the power of contrary choice, but the capacity to act voluntarily in accordance with one’s renewed nature.

Contemporary evangelical and Pentecostal debates add further complexity around **indwelling**. Some Pentecostal and holiness traditions speak of a post-conversion “baptism in the Spirit,” often evidenced by tongues, as a distinct experience of Spirit indwelling or empowerment. Others make a sharp difference between regeneration and later “fullness.” A Westminsterian defense must affirm with Paul that all who belong to Christ have his Spirit, and all who do not have the Spirit do not belong to him. The Spirit’s **indwelling** is coextensive with belonging to Christ. There can be many subsequent fillings, empowerments, and experiences, but no second ontological entrance of the Spirit. Regeneration and initial indwelling form a single complex of grace that inaugurates the Christian life.

At this point, the question of ordering returns: is **union with Christ** logically prior to regeneration, or is regeneration the means by which union is effected? Some modern Reformed voices have pushed the primacy of union so strongly that regeneration risks becoming redundant. Others, in a more ordo-salutis oriented frame, speak as if regeneration, faith, justification, and adoption are discrete steps preceding union. A coherent synthesis must maintain that election and redemption establish Christ as the representative head of his people, that union with Christ is the comprehensive benefit in which all others are contained, and that the Spirit’s act of uniting the elect sinner to Christ is the very act in which he regenerates the sinner. Thus one can say that in the application of redemption, **union with Christ**, regeneration, and the first graces of faith and repentance are distinct aspects of a single Spirit-wrought event, with regeneration as the immediate internal effect and union as the objective relation thereby realized. This preserves both the Christocentric and the monergistic emphases without absorbing one into the other.

Another area examiners will probe is the relation of **regeneration** and **indwelling** to assurance. If regeneration is invisible and indwelling is spiritual, how can one know one has been born again and is indwelt? Here the Reformed tradition, exemplified in Owen and Edwards, insists that the primary ground of assurance is the external word and promise of the gospel and the sufficiency of Christ’s finished work. Yet they also affirm that the Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are children of God, and that **regeneration** manifests itself in new desires, obedience, and perseverance. The marks are not infallible in a psychological sense, since hypocrites can mimic external forms, but they are real evidences that, interpreted in light of Scripture and the work of the Spirit, can yield real though variable assurance. The key is to avoid collapsing assurance into introspection on experience while also avoiding a bare forensicism that ignores the Spirit’s transforming and indwelling work.

Finally, the doctrine of **indwelling** must be secured within classical trinitarian theism. Contemporary “Spirit Christology” and certain panentheistic trends speak about God’s presence in the world and the Spirit’s indwelling in ways that threaten **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction. To say that the Spirit indwells the believer is not to say that the divine essence becomes mixed with human essence, nor that God’s being is ontologically expanded by creaturely participation. Rather, the undivided Trinity, in which each person subsists, is present to all things by essence, power, and knowledge, and is present to the saints in a further gracious mode by the Spirit who is sent by the Father and the Son. This indwelling is personal, not spatial. It is covenantal and eschatological: the Spirit as down payment of the inheritance, the firstfruits of the coming glory when God will dwell with his people in unveiled communion. Thus **indwelling** is not an add-on to **regeneration** but the personal shape of that new life as fellowship with the triune God.

In summary, a Westminsterian defense should articulate and uphold the following position. Fallen humanity is dead in sin and unable to turn to God. In the effectual call, through the external word, the Holy Spirit sovereignly and instantaneously unites the elect sinner to the risen Christ, thereby implanting a new principle of spiritual life, which is **regeneration**. This new birth is wholly monergistic and logically prior to the sinner’s acts of faith and repentance, though inseparable from them in time. By this same act, the Spirit comes to **indwell** the believer as the Spirit of Christ, so that the believer is now a temple of God. Indwelling is the personal, covenantal mode of the new life: through it the Spirit mediates Christ’s presence, sanctifies, assures, and preserves. There is no regenerate person who is not indwelt, and no indwelt person who is not regenerate. All of this occurs within and for the sake of **union with Christ**, which is the encompassing reality of salvation. This account guards divine sovereignty, upholds human responsibility, maintains classical theism, and sets **regeneration and indwelling** in coherent relation to justification, sanctification, and the Christian life.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Regeneration** is the instantaneous, sovereign work of the Holy Spirit uniting the elect sinner to Christ and implanting a new principle of life; **indwelling** is the personal, covenantal presence of the Spirit and of Christ in the believer, the form in which this new life is maintained and exercised.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: anti-Pelagian, grace as healing and re-creating, anticipates inner renewal and divine **indwelling**.
  - Calvin: centers **union with Christ**, sees regeneration and indwelling as Spirit’s uniting and enlivening work.
  - Owen: sharp monergistic definition of **regeneration** and a precise doctrine of covenantal Spirit **indwelling**.
  - Edwards: regeneration as a new sense of the heart, indwelling as presence of divine beauty, within strong sovereignty.
  - Berkhof: classic ordo salutis, narrow and broad senses of regeneration, inseparability of regeneration and indwelling.
- Debates:
  - Internal: order of **union with Christ** and regeneration; wide versus narrow definitions of regeneration; nature of indwelling as personal presence versus mere moral influence.
  - External: Pelagian and semi-Pelagian synergism; Roman Catholic sacramental causality; Arminian prevenient grace and resistible regeneration; Pentecostal subsequence and “second blessing” models.
  - Contemporary: psychological versus theological models of conversion; charismatic experiences and their relation to initial **indwelling**; panentheistic and Spirit-Christology challenges to classical theism.
- Defended position: In Reformed, Westminsterian terms, the Spirit’s effectual, monergistic act of **regeneration** is the inward side of being united to Christ, and necessarily entails the **indwelling** of the Spirit as the personal presence of God in the believer; there is no regenerate non-indwelt believer, no subsequent ontological second blessing, and both realities must be framed within **union with Christ** and classical trinitarian theism.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Does regeneration precede faith? Yes, logically and causally, as the Spirit’s gift of life enabling the free act of believing, though the two are inseparable in time.
  - Is indwelling a second work after conversion? No, initial **indwelling** coincides with regeneration and union with Christ; later “fillings” are intensifications, not new entrances.
  - How does this differ from Roman Catholic baptismal regeneration? It denies sacramental automatism and synergistic merit, insisting that the Spirit regenerates sovereignly and not ex opere operato.
  - How do you avoid pantheism in indwelling? By affirming **divine simplicity** and the Creator–creature distinction: indwelling is a personal, gracious mode of presence, not an ontological fusion.
  - What evidences regeneration and indwelling? The primary ground is the promise of God in Christ; secondary evidences are enduring faith, repentance, love, and growth in holiness produced by the indwelling Spirit.
