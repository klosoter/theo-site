# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin taught that **regeneration** is the sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit**, effecting a radical transformation of the sinner’s heart and enabling true faith and repentance. He closely linked **regeneration** with the **indwelling of Christ** and the Spirit, emphasizing the believer’s mystical union with Christ as the source of new life and ongoing sanctification. For Calvin, these doctrines are central to the **ordo salutis** and the believer’s assurance.

- "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself." (Institutes 3.1.1)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Work of the Spirit**
    - Regeneration is initiated solely by **God’s grace**, not human effort.
    - The Holy Spirit transforms the heart, enabling faith and repentance.
    - Regeneration is distinct from, but inseparable from, justification.
    - The Spirit’s work is both instantaneous (renewal) and ongoing (sanctification).
    - "Regeneration is the secret energy of the Spirit by which we come to enjoy Christ and all his benefits." (Institutes 3.1.1)

2. **Union with Christ as the Foundation**
    - All saving benefits, including regeneration and indwelling, flow from union with Christ.
    - This union is effected by the Spirit and received by faith.
    - The indwelling of Christ is not merely notional but a real participation in his life.
    - Union with Christ ensures both justification and sanctification.
    - "We must understand that as long as Christ remains outside of us, and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us." (Institutes 3.1.1)

3. **Indwelling of the Spirit as the Source of New Life**
    - The Holy Spirit personally indwells believers, making them temples of God.
    - Indwelling is the means by which believers are empowered for obedience.
    - The Spirit’s presence assures believers of their adoption and inheritance.
    - Indwelling is inseparable from regeneration and sanctification.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ effectually unites us to himself." (Institutes 3.1.1)

4. **Regeneration Produces Repentance and Faith**
    - Regeneration precedes and enables saving faith and true repentance.
    - The Spirit renews the will, making it responsive to God’s call.
    - Faith is not a human achievement but a gift resulting from regeneration.
    - Repentance is the fruit and evidence of the Spirit’s renewing work.
    - "Repentance is not only a turning from sin, but a turning to God, which the Spirit alone can effect." (Institutes 3.3.5)

5. **Sanctification as the Ongoing Fruit of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration initiates a lifelong process of sanctification.
    - The indwelling Spirit continually mortifies sin and vivifies righteousness.
    - Believers are progressively conformed to the image of Christ.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s ongoing work.
    - "The same Spirit who has begun the work of regeneration in us continues it by daily renewing us." (Institutes 3.3.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **regeneration** and the **indwelling Spirit** shaped the Reformed understanding of the Christian life, emphasizing the necessity of supernatural renewal and the believer’s mystical union with Christ. His teaching provided a foundation for later Reformed discussions of the **ordo salutis** and the experiential reality of salvation. Calvin’s emphasis on the Spirit’s sovereign work continues to influence Reformed theology, pastoral practice, and debates about assurance and sanctification.
