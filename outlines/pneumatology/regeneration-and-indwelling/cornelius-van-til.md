# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology** and his hallmark **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the radical transformation of the **noetic structure** in regeneration, insisting that the **Holy Spirit** not only renews the heart but also enables true knowledge of God, grounding all epistemology in the **covenantal relationship** established by divine initiative.

- "Regeneration is the act of God whereby the sinner is made a new creature and is enabled to respond to the truth of God as it is in Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Apologetics
- The Theology of James Daane (for interaction with pneumatology)
- Essays on Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Act of God**
    - Regeneration is exclusively the work of the **Holy Spirit**, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - It is a **monergistic** event, effecting a radical change in the sinner’s disposition.
    - The human will is utterly passive in regeneration, reflecting **total depravity**.
    - This act is the foundation for all subsequent spiritual life and faith.
    - "Regeneration is the prerequisite for any true knowledge of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Noetic Renewal through Indwelling**
    - The **indwelling Spirit** transforms the believer’s mind, enabling a new epistemological orientation.
    - Regeneration restores the **image of God** in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - The renewed mind is able to submit to **Scripture** as the ultimate authority.
    - This noetic renewal is essential for a truly Christian worldview.
    - "The regenerated man alone is able to think God’s thoughts after Him." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenantal Context of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration occurs within the context of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling unites the believer to Christ, the federal head of the new humanity.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification).
    - The covenantal framework ensures that regeneration is never isolated from the broader redemptive plan.
    - "All of salvation, including regeneration, is covenantal in character." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Antithesis between Regenerate and Unregenerate**
    - Regeneration establishes a fundamental **antithesis** between the believer and the unbeliever.
    - The indwelling Spirit creates a new principle of life, opposed to the old nature.
    - This antithesis is epistemological, ethical, and spiritual.
    - The church is the community of the regenerate, set apart from the world.
    - "There is no common ground between the regenerate and the unregenerate except that which God Himself provides." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Epistemological Implications of Indwelling**
    - The **Holy Spirit’s indwelling** is the basis for true knowledge and certainty.
    - Regeneration enables the believer to presuppose the truth of **Scripture** in all reasoning.
    - The unregenerate mind suppresses the truth, while the regenerate mind is illumined.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the necessity of regeneration for genuine understanding.
    - "Only the regenerate man, indwelt by the Spirit, can truly know God and interpret reality rightly." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **regeneration** and the **indwelling Spirit** profoundly shaped Reformed theology and apologetics, especially in emphasizing the epistemological transformation wrought by the Spirit. His insistence on the **antithesis** between regenerate and unregenerate thought continues to influence discussions on Christian worldview and the nature of saving faith. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of presuppositional apologetics and in the robust defense of the Spirit’s sovereign role in salvation.
