# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust doctrine of **regeneration** as a sovereign, monergistic act of the **Holy Spirit** that imparts new spiritual life to the elect. He distinguished **regeneration** from **conversion**, emphasizing the Spirit’s internal work and the resulting **indwelling** presence of God in the believer, which enables faith and sanctification. Turretin’s careful distinctions shaped later Reformed understandings of the ordo salutis and the nature of spiritual renewal.

- "Regeneration is not only a change of actions from evil to good, but a change of the very heart itself from spiritual death to spiritual life." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Churches of Geneva
- Selected sermons and disputations on the Holy Spirit and the new birth
- Secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is a monergistic act of God**
    - Regeneration is accomplished solely by the **Holy Spirit** without cooperation from the human will.
    - The human heart is spiritually dead and incapable of initiating or contributing to its own renewal.
    - God’s efficacious grace precedes and enables all acts of faith and repentance.
    - Regeneration is the root from which all subsequent spiritual acts flow.
    - "Regeneration is not a work in which God and man cooperate, but one in which God alone acts efficaciously." (Institutes)

2. **Distinction between regeneration and conversion**
    - Regeneration refers to the initial impartation of spiritual life; conversion is the conscious turning to God.
    - The former is immediate and internal; the latter involves human response enabled by grace.
    - Regeneration is the cause, and conversion is the effect.
    - This distinction guards against confusing the Spirit’s sovereign work with human activity.
    - "Regeneration precedes faith and repentance, which are fruits of the new birth." (Institutes)

3. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit as the source of spiritual life**
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is inseparable from regeneration and continues in the believer.
    - Through indwelling, the Spirit sustains, sanctifies, and assures the believer.
    - The indwelling presence is both personal and transformative, not merely external or forensic.
    - This union with Christ by the Spirit is foundational for all Christian experience.
    - "The Spirit of God, having regenerated us, abides in us as a principle of new life." (Institutes)

4. **Necessity of regeneration for salvation**
    - Without regeneration, no one can see or enter the kingdom of God.
    - The fallen human will is in bondage to sin and must be renewed by divine power.
    - Regeneration is the beginning of all saving benefits, including justification and sanctification.
    - The necessity underscores the utter dependence of sinners on God’s mercy.
    - "No one is able to believe or repent unless first renewed by the Spirit of God." (Institutes)

5. **Means and instrumentality in regeneration**
    - While regeneration is immediate, the **Word of God** is ordinarily the external means used by the Spirit.
    - The Spirit works through the preaching of the gospel to effect regeneration in the elect.
    - The sacraments confirm and strengthen the new life already imparted.
    - There is no regeneration apart from the Spirit’s sovereign application of the Word.
    - "The Word is the instrument, but the Spirit is the efficient cause of regeneration." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, especially in distinguishing the monergistic work of God from synergistic tendencies. His careful distinctions influenced the development of the **ordo salutis** and shaped confessional standards such as the Westminster Confession. Turretin’s legacy endures in Reformed theology’s emphasis on the necessity and efficacy of the Spirit’s work in salvation.
