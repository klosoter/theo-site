# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **regeneration** and **indwelling** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected a literal, supernatural understanding of these doctrines, instead emphasizing the transformative encounter with the **kerygma** that brings about authentic existence and new self-understanding in relation to God.

- "It is not the mystical experience of a new being, but the decision of faith that constitutes the new life." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Regeneration**
   - Regeneration is not a supernatural event but a metaphor for existential transformation.
   - The language of "new birth" points to a radical reorientation of the self.
   - Mythological elements must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
   - The focus is on the individual's response to the **kerygma**.
   - "The mythological event of rebirth is the existential event of coming to faith." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Indwelling**
   - Indwelling of the Spirit is not a metaphysical reality but an existential mode of being.
   - The Spirit represents the power of authentic existence awakened by faith.
   - Indwelling is realized in the believer’s openness to God’s call.
   - The presence of God is experienced in existential decision, not ontological change.
   - "The Spirit is not a substance but the power of new life in decision." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation of Christ is the means by which regeneration and indwelling occur.
   - Faith arises from hearing and responding to the kerygma, not from mystical infusion.
   - The kerygma confronts individuals with the demand for authentic existence.
   - Salvation is existential, not forensic or ontological.
   - "Faith is awakened by the word, not by a supernatural process." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Rejection of Supernaturalism**
   - Bultmann denies the possibility of supernatural interventions in history.
   - Regeneration and indwelling are not magical or miraculous events.
   - The New Testament’s mythological language must be translated into existential categories.
   - The focus is on the meaning of faith for the modern person.
   - "We cannot use electric light and radio... and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

5. **Authenticity and Decision**
   - Regeneration is the existential decision to live authentically before God.
   - Indwelling is the ongoing openness to God’s call in daily existence.
   - The new life is characterized by freedom from self and openness to others.
   - Authentic existence is marked by responsibility and faith.
   - "To believe means to be open to the future, to be ready for decision." (Existence and Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **regeneration** and **indwelling** profoundly shaped modern **existential theology** and the interpretation of the New Testament. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional doctrines, prompting both sharp criticism and significant engagement among theologians. While many in the Reformed tradition reject his existential reductionism, his influence endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between faith, history, and existential experience.
