# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **regeneration** and **indwelling** not as discrete supernatural events but as existential realities rooted in the encounter with the **New Being** in Christ. For Tillich, **regeneration** is the experience of being grasped by the **Spirit**, resulting in a new state of existence, while **indwelling** is the ongoing presence of the **divine Spirit** within the depths of human personality, transforming alienation into reunion with the **Ground of Being**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Participation in the New Being**
    - Regeneration is not a momentary event but an existential transformation through encounter with Christ.
    - The **New Being** in Christ overcomes estrangement and initiates a new mode of existence.
    - This transformation is mediated by the **Spirit**, who actualizes reunion with the **Ground of Being**.
    - Regeneration is universal in scope, offered to all who are open to the divine self-disclosure.
    - "Regeneration is the event in which the New Being is received in the personal center of man's existence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

2. **Indwelling as the Presence of the Spirit**
    - The **indwelling** of the Spirit is the ongoing presence of God within the depths of human existence.
    - This presence is not spatial but existential, affecting the whole person.
    - The Spirit's indwelling enables continual transformation and reunion with God.
    - Indwelling is experienced in the community of the **Spiritual Presence**, especially in the church.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the presence of the New Being in the community and in the individual." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Spiritual Realities**
    - Tillich interprets **regeneration** and **indwelling** in existential, not forensic or metaphysical, terms.
    - Spiritual realities are understood as changes in the state of being, not as external interventions.
    - The language of "Spirit" and "indwelling" points to the depth dimension of human life.
    - Faith is the act in which one is grasped by the **Spiritual Presence**.
    - "The Spirit is the depth of our spiritual life, the power of our ultimate concern." ("The Dynamics of Faith")

4. **The Role of the Church as Bearer of the Spiritual Presence**
    - The church is the community where the **Spiritual Presence** is manifest and regeneration is nurtured.
    - Sacraments and proclamation mediate the presence of the Spirit to individuals.
    - The church is not identical with the **Spiritual Presence** but is its bearer and witness.
    - Indwelling is thus both personal and communal, realized in the life of the church.
    - "The church is the place where the Spiritual Presence is manifest under the conditions of existence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

5. **Transformation of Alienation into Reunion**
    - Human existence is marked by **estrangement** from the Ground of Being.
    - Regeneration and indwelling are the means by which this alienation is overcome.
    - The Spirit works to reunite the person with the divine source, healing existential separation.
    - This process is ongoing, never fully complete in temporal existence.
    - "The work of the Spirit is the reunion of the separated with the Ground of Being." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **regeneration** and **indwelling** has profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially in the dialogue between theology and existential philosophy. His emphasis on the **Spiritual Presence** and the transformation of alienation into reunion has shaped discussions on the nature of salvation and the work of the Spirit. While Tillich’s approach departs from traditional supernaturalist accounts, his thought remains a significant resource for those seeking to articulate Christian doctrines in conversation with contemporary existential concerns.
