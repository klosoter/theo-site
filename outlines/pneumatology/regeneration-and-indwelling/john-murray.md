# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robustly **Reformed doctrine of regeneration**, emphasizing its monergistic character and its inseparable connection to **union with Christ** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit**. He insisted that **regeneration** is the sovereign work of God, effecting a radical transformation of the sinner’s nature, and that the **Spirit’s indwelling** is both the result and evidence of this new life.

- "Regeneration is the act of God by which the principle of new life is implanted in man, and the governing disposition of the soul is made holy." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (1959–1965)
- "Christian Baptism" (1952)
- "The Holy Spirit" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration is monergistic**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of God, not a cooperative act between God and man.
    - The sinner is passive in regeneration, being acted upon by the Holy Spirit.
    - This act precedes all conscious response, including faith and repentance.
    - It is a decisive, instantaneous event, not a process.
    - "Regeneration is exclusively the work of the Holy Spirit and of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of God." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Regeneration effects a radical transformation**
    - It implants a new principle of spiritual life in the believer.
    - The governing disposition of the soul is made holy, enabling true faith.
    - This transformation is not merely moral improvement but a new creation.
    - The change is ontological, affecting the very nature of the person.
    - "Regeneration is a supernatural and radical change wrought in the soul by the Spirit of God." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

3. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit is inseparable from regeneration**
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is both the cause and evidence of new life.
    - Indwelling unites the believer to Christ and assures ongoing sanctification.
    - The presence of the Spirit is permanent and marks the believer as God’s own.
    - Indwelling is not a subsequent blessing but integral to the new birth.
    - "The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the distinguishing mark of the child of God." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Union with Christ grounds regeneration and indwelling**
    - Regeneration is the application of redemption accomplished in Christ.
    - Union with Christ is the fountainhead from which all saving benefits flow.
    - The Spirit unites the believer to Christ, effecting both regeneration and indwelling.
    - All aspects of salvation, including regeneration and indwelling, are inseparable from union with Christ.
    - "It is in Christ that the people of God are made alive, and it is by the Spirit that this union is effected." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Regeneration precedes and enables faith**
    - Faith is the immediate fruit of regeneration, not its cause.
    - The new birth enables the sinner to respond to the gospel in faith and repentance.
    - This order preserves the sovereignty of grace in salvation.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in the Spirit’s regenerating and indwelling work.
    - "It is by regeneration that we are enabled to believe, and not by believing that we are regenerated." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Holy Spirit** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in its insistence on the monergistic and transformative nature of the new birth. His careful exegesis and theological clarity have influenced generations of pastors and theologians, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Murray’s integration of union with Christ into the application of redemption remains a hallmark of his enduring legacy.
