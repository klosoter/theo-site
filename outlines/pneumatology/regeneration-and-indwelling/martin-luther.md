# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood **regeneration** as the work of the **Holy Spirit** through the **Word and Sacraments**, effecting a new birth in the believer and uniting them to Christ. He emphasized the **indwelling of Christ** in the heart by faith, which transforms the person and enables true repentance and sanctification, while maintaining a distinction between justification and sanctification.

- "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to the Epistle to the Romans)

## Key Works

- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Large Catechism (1529)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)
- Preface to the Epistle to the Romans (1522)
- Sermons on John (various years)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration by the Word and Spirit**
    - Regeneration is effected by the **Holy Spirit** working through the **preached Word**.
    - Baptism is a means by which the Spirit grants new birth.
    - The human will is passive in regeneration; it is God’s act alone.
    - Regeneration leads to a new orientation toward God and His promises.
    - "For through the Word and the Sacraments, as through instruments, the Holy Spirit is given, who works faith, when and where it pleases God." (Augsburg Confession, Article V, Luther’s influence)

2. **Indwelling of Christ by Faith**
    - Christ dwells in the believer’s heart through faith, not by physical presence.
    - This indwelling brings assurance, comfort, and spiritual transformation.
    - Faith unites the believer to Christ’s righteousness and life.
    - The indwelling is relational and dynamic, not static or ontological.
    - "Christ lives in me; that is, He is with me and in me, and I am in Him." (Commentary on Galatians)

3. **Distinction between Justification and Sanctification**
    - Justification is forensic and external; sanctification is internal and transformative.
    - Regeneration is closely linked to sanctification but flows from justification.
    - The indwelling Spirit produces good works as fruit, not as the basis of acceptance.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s work, not on the degree of inward renewal.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone." (Preface to Romans)

4. **Ongoing Struggle with Sin (Simul Justus et Peccator)**
    - The regenerate believer remains both righteous and a sinner.
    - The indwelling Spirit initiates a lifelong battle against the flesh.
    - Renewal is real but incomplete in this life; perfection awaits glorification.
    - The believer’s confidence is in Christ’s righteousness, not personal holiness.
    - "A Christian is righteous and a sinner at the same time, holy and profane, an enemy of God and a child of God." (Lectures on Romans)

5. **Means of Grace and the Objective Promise**
    - The external Word and Sacraments are the means by which regeneration and indwelling are effected.
    - The promise of the Gospel is objective and must be received by faith.
    - The Spirit works through these means, not apart from them.
    - Assurance is grounded in God’s promise, not subjective experience.
    - "God does not want to deal with us otherwise than through the spoken Word and the Sacraments." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s teaching on **regeneration** and the **indwelling of Christ** shaped Protestant understandings of the new birth, emphasizing the primacy of faith and the means of grace. His distinction between justification and sanctification provided a framework for later Reformed and Lutheran theology. Luther’s focus on the objective promise and the believer’s union with Christ continues to influence discussions on assurance, sanctification, and the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Christian.
