# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a robust doctrine of **regeneration** as a sovereign act of the **Holy Spirit** that imparts new spiritual life, enabling faith and repentance. He closely linked **regeneration** with the **indwelling of the Spirit**, emphasizing that the Spirit’s presence is both the source and sustainer of the believer’s new life in union with **Christ**.

- "Regeneration is the instantaneous change from spiritual death to spiritual life, imparted by the Holy Spirit, and is always attended by the indwelling of the Spirit in the soul." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as a Sovereign Act of God**
    - Regeneration is not a cooperative process but a unilateral work of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - It precedes and enables faith, rather than resulting from it.
    - The human will is passive in regeneration, being acted upon by divine power.
    - This act imparts a new principle of spiritual life, distinct from mere moral reform.
    - "Regeneration, therefore, is not the act of the sinner, but the act of God." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

2. **Indwelling of the Spirit as Essential to Salvation**
    - The **indwelling Spirit** is the distinguishing mark of the true believer.
    - This indwelling unites the believer to **Christ** and is the source of all spiritual vitality.
    - The Spirit’s presence is permanent, not intermittent, in the justified.
    - Indwelling leads to sanctification, assurance, and perseverance.
    - "Where the Spirit is, there is life; and where He dwells, there is holiness." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

3. **Union with Christ through Regeneration and Indwelling**
    - Regeneration establishes the vital union between the believer and **Christ**.
    - The Spirit mediates this union, making believers partakers of Christ’s life.
    - This union is mystical yet real, grounding all benefits of redemption.
    - The indwelling Spirit is both the bond and the evidence of this union.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the bond of union between Christ and his people." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

4. **Distinction between Regeneration and Conversion**
    - Regeneration is the impartation of new life; conversion is the conscious turning to God.
    - Conversion (faith and repentance) is the immediate result of regeneration.
    - The two are inseparable in experience but distinct in order and causality.
    - This distinction safeguards the doctrine of **sovereign grace**.
    - "Regeneration is the cause, and conversion the effect." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance Rooted in the Spirit’s Indwelling**
    - The Spirit’s indwelling guarantees the perseverance of the saints.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in the Spirit’s witness and work.
    - The Spirit continually sanctifies and preserves the regenerate.
    - The believer’s security rests not in self, but in the abiding presence of the Spirit.
    - "The indwelling of the Spirit is the pledge of the believer’s final salvation." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **regeneration** and the **indwelling of the Spirit** became foundational for later Reformed and evangelical theology, especially within the American Presbyterian tradition. His careful distinctions and emphasis on the Spirit’s sovereign work shaped the contours of **Old Princeton** and influenced generations of systematic theologians. Hodge’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions of **union with Christ** and the ordo salutis, providing a clear, biblically grounded framework for understanding the Spirit’s role in salvation.
