# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized **regeneration** as a decisive act of God’s grace, wherein the human person is made new through encounter with the **Word of God** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. For Brunner, **indwelling** is not a metaphysical possession but a dynamic, relational presence of Christ in the believer, marking the beginning of authentic **faith** and **new life**. He rejected both rationalistic and mystical reductions, insisting on the personal and existential character of the Spirit’s work.

- "Regeneration is the act of God in which He creates in man a new heart, a new center of life, through the Holy Spirit." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of God: Dogmatics, Volume I
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Man in Revolt
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Divine Initiative**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of **God’s grace**, not human effort.
    - The **Holy Spirit** acts directly upon the human heart, initiating new life.
    - Human response is enabled, not produced, by this divine action.
    - Regeneration marks the existential beginning of authentic **faith**.
    - "The new birth is not a human achievement, but a miracle of God’s creative word." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

2. **Indwelling as Personal Encounter**
    - The **indwelling of Christ** is relational, not ontological or mystical.
    - It is realized in the ongoing encounter with the **Word of God**.
    - The presence of Christ is mediated by the **Holy Spirit** in the believer’s life.
    - Indwelling is evidenced by transformed existence and obedience.
    - "Christ dwells in us, not as a substance, but as the living Lord who meets us in faith." (The Mediator)

3. **Rejection of Mechanistic or Magical Views**
    - Brunner opposes sacramental or automatic views of regeneration.
    - He critiques both Roman Catholic and Protestant tendencies toward objectivism.
    - Regeneration is not tied to external rites but to the **personal address** of God.
    - The Spirit’s work is mysterious but always personal and existential.
    - "The Spirit does not work magically, but personally, calling man to decision." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Faith as the Fruit of Regeneration**
    - True **faith** arises from the regenerative work of the Spirit.
    - Faith is trustful response to God’s self-revelation in Christ.
    - Regeneration and faith are inseparable but distinct moments.
    - The believer’s assurance rests on God’s promise, not subjective feeling.
    - "Faith is the awakening of man to God, made possible by the Spirit’s creative act." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Ethical Transformation as Evidence**
    - Regeneration results in a new orientation toward God and neighbor.
    - The indwelling Spirit empowers ethical living and love.
    - Christian existence is marked by continual renewal and repentance.
    - The fruit of the Spirit is the sign of genuine regeneration and indwelling.
    - "Where the Spirit is, there is a new creation, manifest in love and obedience." (Man in Revolt)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **regeneration and indwelling** shaped 20th-century Protestant thought by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of salvation. His critique of both rationalism and sacramentalism influenced later discussions on the nature of the **Holy Spirit’s work** in the believer. Brunner’s insistence on the personal encounter with God continues to inform contemporary debates on the relationship between faith, experience, and ethical transformation. His legacy endures in both Reformed and ecumenical circles, especially regarding the doctrine of the new birth.
