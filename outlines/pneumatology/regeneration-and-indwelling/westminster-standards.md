# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **regeneration** as a sovereign act of the **Holy Spirit**, effecting a radical inward change and enabling faith in Christ. The **indwelling** of the Spirit is presented as the ongoing presence of God within believers, securing their **union with Christ** and empowering sanctification. These doctrines are foundational for the Standards’ understanding of the **ordo salutis** and the believer’s assurance.

- "This effectual call is of God’s free and special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man, who is altogether passive therein, until, being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it." (Westminster Confession of Faith 10.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 9–13
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 66–79
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 29–32

- The Theology of the Westminster Standards (J.V. Fesko)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Regeneration as Monergistic Work of the Spirit**
    - Regeneration is solely the work of the **Holy Spirit**, not dependent on human will or effort.
    - The human soul is entirely passive in regeneration, being "dead in sin" until made alive.
    - This act precedes faith and is necessary for any response to the gospel.
    - Regeneration is effectual, infallibly bringing about the new birth in the elect.
    - "All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in His appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by His Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death... enlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God." (WCF 10.1)

2. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit**
    - The Spirit takes up residence in every true believer at regeneration.
    - This indwelling is the source of spiritual life and growth in holiness.
    - The indwelling Spirit assures believers of their adoption and perseverance.
    - Indwelling is inseparable from union with Christ and is permanent for the elect.
    - "They, who are effectually called and regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them." (WCF 13.1)

3. **Union with Christ as the Context for Regeneration and Indwelling**
    - Regeneration and indwelling are benefits applied in union with Christ.
    - Union with Christ is spiritual, vital, and the fountain of all saving blessings.
    - The Spirit unites believers to Christ, making them partakers of His life.
    - This union is the basis for justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification.
    - "The union which the elect have with Christ is the work of the Spirit of God, whereby, by faith, they are joined to Christ their Head." (WLC 66)

4. **Necessity and Efficacy of Regeneration**
    - Regeneration is absolutely necessary due to total depravity.
    - It effectually renews the will and enables saving faith.
    - No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born again.
    - The efficacy of regeneration is rooted in God’s sovereign grace.
    - "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation." (WCF 9.3)

5. **Sanctification as the Fruit of Regeneration and Indwelling**
    - The indwelling Spirit progressively sanctifies the believer.
    - Sanctification is distinct from, yet flows out of, regeneration.
    - The Spirit enables mortification of sin and growth in holiness.
    - Sanctification is incomplete in this life but will be perfected in glory.
    - "They, who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally." (WCF 13.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, especially regarding the doctrines of **regeneration** and the **indwelling Spirit**. Their clear articulation of the Spirit’s sovereign work and the believer’s union with Christ has influenced confessional documents and theological education across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. These doctrines continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions of the **ordo salutis** and the nature of Christian assurance.
