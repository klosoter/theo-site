# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl approached **Genesis 1–11** not as a literal historical account but as a collection of **religious narratives** expressing the **community’s faith** and ethical ideals. He emphasized the primacy of **religious value-judgments** over scientific or metaphysical claims, arguing that **Scripture** should be interpreted in light of its function for the **Christian community** rather than as a source of scientific information.

- "The religious value of the biblical narratives is not dependent on their historical or scientific accuracy, but on their power to express the faith of the community." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (1870–74)
- Instruction in the Christian Religion (1901, posthumous lectures)
- Theology and Metaphysics (in various essays and lectures)
- Ritschl and Luther: A Fresh Perspective (secondary, for context on his hermeneutics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Value-Judgments**
    - Scripture’s authority is rooted in its capacity to shape the community’s faith and ethics.
    - Genesis 1–11 serves to articulate the religious consciousness of Israel, not scientific fact.
    - Theological meaning is prioritized over historical or scientific correspondence.
    - Faith is oriented toward the practical and communal, not speculative knowledge.
    - "The value-judgment is the decisive principle in all Christian doctrine." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Rejection of Metaphysical and Scientific Readings**
    - Ritschl opposes interpreting Genesis 1–11 as cosmological or scientific explanation.
    - He sees metaphysical speculation as foreign to the biblical writers’ intent.
    - The narratives are not meant to compete with scientific accounts of origins.
    - The focus is on the religious message, not on reconciling with natural science.
    - "The Bible is not a manual of natural science, but a witness to the revelation of God in history." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

3. **Community-Centered Hermeneutic**
    - The meaning of Genesis 1–11 is found in its function for the believing community.
    - Scripture is interpreted through the lens of the church’s lived experience.
    - The authority of the text is communal and practical, not individual and speculative.
    - The narratives foster communal identity and ethical orientation.
    - "The Church is the sphere in which the meaning of revelation is realized." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Christocentric Interpretation of Scripture**
    - All Scripture, including Genesis 1–11, is interpreted in light of the revelation in Christ.
    - The Old Testament is preparatory, its value realized in the Christian message.
    - Christ is the criterion for determining the enduring significance of biblical texts.
    - Genesis 1–11 points forward to the fulfillment of God’s purpose in Christ.
    - "The revelation of God reaches its goal and norm in the person of Jesus Christ." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Distinction Between Faith and Knowledge**
    - Faith concerns the meaning and value of existence, not empirical or scientific knowledge.
    - Genesis 1–11 addresses the ultimate questions of purpose and destiny, not origins in a scientific sense.
    - Theological claims are distinct from scientific or historical assertions.
    - The task of theology is to clarify the meaning of faith, not to harmonize with science.
    - "Faith is not a form of knowledge, but a judgment of value." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** profoundly influenced modern **liberal theology**, especially in its distinction between religious and scientific truth. His emphasis on **religious value-judgments** and the communal function of Scripture paved the way for later developments in hermeneutics and the theology of revelation. While often criticized by confessional theologians for downplaying the historicity of biblical texts, Ritschl’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **science and Scripture**.
