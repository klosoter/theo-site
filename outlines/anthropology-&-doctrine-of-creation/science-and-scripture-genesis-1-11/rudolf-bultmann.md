# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Genesis 1–11** through the lens of **demythologization**, arguing that these texts are not literal historical accounts but **mythological narratives** expressing existential truths about human existence. He maintained that **Scripture** must be interpreted in light of modern **scientific understanding**, and that the message of the Bible is accessible only when its mythological framework is reinterpreted for contemporary readers.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Kerygma and Myth (1948, ed. Hans Werner Bartsch)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Genesis 1–11 contains mythological language that must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
   - The aim is to uncover the existential meaning behind the biblical myths.
   - Literal readings are incompatible with contemporary scientific knowledge.
   - Demythologization seeks to make the **kerygma** relevant today.
   - "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation**
   - The true message of Genesis 1–11 concerns the human condition, not scientific origins.
   - Biblical myths express fundamental truths about **sin**, **alienation**, and **authentic existence**.
   - The focus is on the individual's encounter with God, not on historical events.
   - Existential interpretation bridges the gap between ancient texts and modern readers.
   - "Myth speaks of the unworldly in worldly terms." (Kerygma and Myth)

3. **Critical Engagement with Science**
   - Modern science renders a literal reading of Genesis 1–11 untenable.
   - Theological interpretation must respect the findings of **natural science**.
   - Faith and science address different questions but must not contradict each other.
   - The Bible’s authority is not in its cosmology but in its existential message.
   - "We cannot use electric light and radio and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Rejection of Concordism**
   - Attempts to harmonize Genesis with modern science are misguided.
   - The biblical worldview is prescientific and should not be forced into scientific categories.
   - The value of Genesis 1–11 lies in its theological, not scientific, claims.
   - Concordist readings obscure the existential significance of the text.
   - "Myth is the use of imagery to express the other-worldly in terms of this world." (Kerygma and Myth)

5. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
   - The proclamation (kerygma) of the gospel is the heart of Scripture.
   - Genesis 1–11 serves as a vehicle for the existential call to faith.
   - The kerygma must be freed from mythological trappings to speak to modern people.
   - Theological truth is not dependent on historical or scientific accuracy.
   - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the truth to which it points." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **demythologization** profoundly shaped 20th-century theology, especially debates on the relationship between **science and Scripture**. His existential interpretation of Genesis 1–11 challenged both conservative and liberal readings, insisting on the necessity of reinterpreting biblical texts in light of modern knowledge. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on biblical authority, hermeneutics, and the dialogue between theology and science.
