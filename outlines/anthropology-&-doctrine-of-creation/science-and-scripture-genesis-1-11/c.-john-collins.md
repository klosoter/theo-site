# C. John Collins (1954– )

C. John Collins approaches **Genesis 1–11** as a foundational text for **biblical worldview**, emphasizing its literary and historical coherence while engaging with contemporary **science**. He advocates for a reading that respects the **theological intent** of the text, affirming its role in shaping **doctrine of creation** and **human origins** without capitulating to either strict literalism or reductionist naturalism.

- "Genesis 1–11 is intended to shape the worldview of its readers, not simply to inform them about ancient events." (Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genesis 1–11 as Literary-Historical Narrative**
    - Argues that Genesis 1–11 is best understood as a **literary-historical** account, not pure myth or modern historiography.
    - Emphasizes the text’s function in shaping **worldview** and **theological identity**.
    - Recognizes literary artistry (e.g., structure, repetition) as serving theological aims.
    - Maintains that the narrative refers to real events, though not always in modern scientific terms.
    - "The stories in Genesis 1–11 are not mere myths, but are presented as accounts of real events with theological significance." (Genesis 1–4)

2. **Doctrine of Creation and Divine Sovereignty**
    - Upholds the **doctrine of creation ex nihilo** and God’s sovereign ordering of the cosmos.
    - Sees Genesis 1 as affirming the goodness and orderliness of creation.
    - Rejects both materialistic evolutionism and young-earth creationism as inadequate.
    - Affirms that the text’s primary aim is to teach about God’s relationship to the world.
    - "Genesis 1 is about God’s wise ordering of the world, not a scientific manual." (Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?)

3. **Historical Adam and Human Origins**
    - Defends the existence of a **historical Adam and Eve** as foundational for **biblical anthropology**.
    - Argues that the New Testament’s use of Adam presupposes his historicity.
    - Engages critically with genetic and scientific claims about human origins.
    - Maintains that Adam and Eve’s historicity is crucial for doctrines of **sin** and **redemption**.
    - "If there was no Adam, much of the Bible’s teaching about sin and salvation unravels." (Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?)

4. **Scripture and Scientific Inquiry**
    - Advocates for a **complementary relationship** between Scripture and scientific investigation.
    - Warns against both concordism (forcing Scripture to match science) and conflict models.
    - Encourages Christians to read Genesis with literary sensitivity and scientific humility.
    - Sees the Bible as providing the framework for understanding the world, not detailed scientific data.
    - "We must let the Bible set its own agenda, and not force it into the mold of modern science." (Reading Genesis Well)

5. **Theological Function of Genesis 1–11**
    - Emphasizes the formative role of Genesis 1–11 in shaping **covenant theology** and **redemptive history**.
    - Sees these chapters as foundational for understanding **sin**, **judgment**, and **promise**.
    - Argues that the text addresses ultimate questions of meaning, purpose, and destiny.
    - Maintains that Genesis 1–11 provides the narrative context for the rest of Scripture.
    - "Genesis 1–11 sets the stage for the entire biblical drama of redemption." (Genesis 1–4)

## Legacy and Impact

Collins has significantly influenced evangelical engagement with **science and Scripture**, especially regarding **Genesis 1–11**. His work has encouraged a nuanced approach that respects both the literary and theological depth of the biblical text and the legitimate findings of science. By insisting on the importance of a **historical Adam** and the formative power of the biblical narrative, Collins has shaped contemporary discussions on **creation, human origins, and biblical authority** within the Reformed tradition.
