# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the relationship between **science and Scripture**—especially in **Genesis 1–11**—with a focus on the **theological intent** of the biblical text rather than a literalistic reading. He emphasized the importance of understanding **revelation**, **hermeneutics**, and the **doctrine of creation** in dialogue with contemporary scientific insights, while maintaining the authority of Scripture.

- "The question is not whether Scripture is true, but how it intends to be true." (Holy Scripture, p. 181)

## Key Works

- Holy Scripture (De Heilige Schrift)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Creation and Evolution
- Studies in Dogmatics: Man: The Image of God
- General Revelation (Algemene Openbaring)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Sin

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority and Intent**
   - Scripture is authoritative in all it affirms, but its intent must be discerned contextually.
   - Genesis 1–11 conveys **theological truths** about God, humanity, and creation, not scientific data.
   - The genre and purpose of these chapters are crucial for interpretation.
   - The authority of Scripture is not diminished by recognizing its theological focus.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not threatened by the recognition of its own intention." (Holy Scripture, p. 181)

2. **Doctrine of Creation**
   - Creation is a foundational confession of dependence on God.
   - Genesis 1–11 affirms God as Creator, but does not provide a scientific account.
   - The **doctrine of creation** is central for understanding humanity’s place in the world.
   - Scientific theories must be evaluated in light of the biblical doctrine of creation, not vice versa.
   - "The confession of creation is not a scientific explanation but a confession of faith." (Creation and Evolution, p. 24)

3. **Hermeneutical Sensitivity**
   - Interpreting Genesis 1–11 requires attention to literary form and ancient context.
   - The text’s **hermeneutics** must respect its original audience and purpose.
   - Avoids both concordism and a purely mythological reading.
   - Emphasizes the need for humility in interpreting difficult passages.
   - "We must let the text speak in its own way, not force it into our categories." (Holy Scripture, p. 187)

4. **Dialogue with Science**
   - Science and theology address different questions but can be in constructive dialogue.
   - Theological interpretation should not fear scientific discoveries.
   - Recognizes the provisional nature of scientific theories.
   - Maintains that faith and science are not inherently in conflict.
   - "Theology need not be afraid of science, for both seek truth in their own domains." (Creation and Evolution, p. 41)

5. **Doctrine of Sin and the Fall**
   - The reality of **sin** and the **fall** is central to Genesis 3–11.
   - The narrative conveys the universality and seriousness of sin, not a scientific anthropology.
   - The historicity of Adam is significant for the doctrine of sin, but must be understood theologically.
   - The fall is a theological event with cosmic consequences, not merely a historical curiosity.
   - "The fall is not a myth, but a profound reality that shapes all of human existence." (Sin, p. 57)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **science and Scripture** has influenced Reformed hermeneutics, especially regarding **Genesis 1–11**. His insistence on the theological intent of Scripture and openness to scientific dialogue provided a model for engaging modern questions without compromising biblical authority. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **revelation**, **creation**, and contemporary science within the Reformed tradition.
