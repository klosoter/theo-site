# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Genesis 1–11** not as a literal historical account but as a collection of **mythological symbols** expressing the **existential condition** of humanity. He argued that the **truth of Scripture** lies in its power to reveal the **depth dimension** of reality, rather than in scientific or historical accuracy, and that the **relationship between science and faith** is one of correlation, not conflict.

- "The stories of Genesis are not reports of events but symbolic expressions of the human situation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially sections on "Reason and Revelation" and "The Meaning of Myth")
- The Interpretation of History
- Theology of Culture
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Myth as Symbolic Truth**
    - Genesis 1–11 conveys **mythological** rather than literal or scientific truth.
    - Myths express the **ultimate concerns** and existential realities of human life.
    - The value of these texts lies in their **symbolic power** to communicate about God and humanity.
    - Literalism undermines the depth and transformative potential of biblical myth.
    - "Myth is the way in which the unconditioned is expressed through the conditioned." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Correlation of Theology and Science**
    - Theology and science address different dimensions of reality: **ultimate meaning** vs. empirical facts.
    - Scientific accounts of origins do not threaten the **religious message** of Genesis.
    - The **method of correlation** seeks dialogue, not opposition, between faith and reason.
    - Genesis 1–11 should be interpreted in light of contemporary knowledge without loss of theological meaning.
    - "There is no conflict between science and religion, for they ask different questions." (Theology of Culture)

3. **Existential Interpretation of the Fall**
    - The story of the **Fall** is a symbol of the universal human condition of estrangement.
    - Sin is understood as **existential separation** from the ground of being, not a historical event.
    - The narrative reveals the **anxiety** and **finitude** inherent in human existence.
    - The myth points to the need for **reconciliation** and **new being** in Christ.
    - "The Fall is not an event in the past, but a perennial possibility and reality of human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Revelation as Depth, Not Data**
    - **Revelation** is the disclosure of the **depth of reality**, not propositional information.
    - Genesis 1–11 reveals the **ground of being** through symbolic language.
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its power to **mediate ultimate concern**.
    - Scientific or historical criticism does not diminish the revelatory function of these texts.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human experience." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Critique of Literalism and Fundamentalism**
    - Literal readings of Genesis 1–11 distort its **theological significance**.
    - Fundamentalism confuses **symbolic myth** with empirical fact.
    - Such approaches lead to unnecessary conflict with scientific understanding.
    - Tillich advocates for a **hermeneutic of depth** that respects the symbolic nature of biblical texts.
    - "Fundamentalism sacrifices the truth of myth for the sake of its factuality." (Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has profoundly shaped modern theological engagement with science, especially through his emphasis on **myth** and the **method of correlation**. His work provided a framework for understanding Scripture as a source of existential and theological truth, rather than as a competitor to scientific explanation. While some criticize his views for undermining biblical authority, his influence endures in contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith and reason. Tillich’s legacy is especially significant for those seeking to integrate **systematic theology** with the realities of modern scientific thought.
