# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to the compatibility of **faith and reason**, emphasizing the **theological meaning** of Scripture over literalist readings. He argued that the **doctrine of creation**, **original sin**, and **revelation** must be understood in light of both **historical-critical exegesis** and the enduring truths of **Christian anthropology**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Theological Meaning over Literalism**
    - Genesis 1–11 conveys **theological truths** rather than scientific or historical data.
    - The **creation narratives** are symbolic, expressing humanity’s relationship to God.
    - The text’s **mythic language** serves to communicate existential realities.
    - Literal readings risk obscuring the **revelatory purpose** of Scripture.
    - "The intention of the biblical author is not to teach us scientific facts, but to proclaim the truth about God and man." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

2. **Compatibility of Faith and Reason**
    - **Revelation** and **scientific knowledge** are not inherently opposed.
    - The doctrine of **creation** affirms God as the ground of all being, not a competitor with scientific explanation.
    - Scientific accounts of origins can coexist with the **confession of God as Creator**.
    - The Church must engage with modern science to articulate faith credibly.
    - "Faith does not fear the truth that science discovers, for all truth is from God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Historical-Critical Exegesis**
    - **Historical-critical methods** are essential for understanding the intention of biblical texts.
    - Genesis 1–11 must be read in its **ancient Near Eastern context**.
    - The **genre** of these chapters is not modern history but theological narrative.
    - Exegesis must distinguish between **form** and **content** of revelation.
    - "We must not confuse the form of expression with the content of revelation itself." (Inspiration in the Bible)

4. **Doctrine of Original Sin as Existential Condition**
    - **Original sin** is not a biological inheritance but a universal existential reality.
    - Genesis 3 expresses the **brokenness** of human freedom and alienation from God.
    - The narrative’s value lies in its **anthropological insight**, not historical reportage.
    - The **fall** is a symbol of the human condition in every age.
    - "Original sin is the situation of every person, not a story of a single event in the past." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Scripture as Word of God in Human Words**
    - The Bible is both **divine revelation** and a product of human culture.
    - Inspiration does not override the **historical limitations** of the authors.
    - The **truth** of Genesis 1–11 is theological, not scientific.
    - The Church must interpret Scripture in light of **contemporary knowledge**.
    - "The word of God is always spoken in the language of its time and place." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 11)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has shaped Catholic and ecumenical discussions on the relationship between **science and Scripture**. His emphasis on the **theological meaning** of biblical texts has encouraged dialogue between theology and the natural sciences, influencing post-Vatican II hermeneutics. Rahner’s work remains foundational for those seeking to uphold the integrity of both **Christian doctrine** and scientific inquiry.
