# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached **Genesis 1–11** by integrating **sacred doctrine** with **natural philosophy**, affirming the **literal sense** of Scripture while allowing for **allegorical** and **anagogical** interpretations. He maintained that **Scripture** and **science** ultimately harmonize, as both originate from God, but prioritized **revelation** when apparent conflicts arise, especially regarding the **creation** and **fall** narratives.

- "The author of Holy Writ knows perfectly all sciences, since He is the author of them all." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.5)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Part I (Questions 65–74: the Hexaemeron)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book II (Creation and Providence)
- Commentary on the Book of Genesis (In Librum Genesis Expositio)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Book II, Distinctions 1–15)
- De Potentia Dei (Questions 3–5: Creation and Providence)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal and Spiritual Senses of Scripture**
    - Scripture possesses a **literal sense** as its foundation, but also includes **spiritual senses** (allegorical, moral, anagogical).
    - The **literal sense** is primary for doctrinal matters, especially in **Genesis 1–11**.
    - Spiritual senses enrich understanding but do not override the literal meaning.
    - The **creation narrative** is to be read first as a true account, with spiritual meanings as secondary.
    - "Nothing necessary to faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is not elsewhere put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

2. **Harmony of Faith and Reason**
    - Both **natural philosophy** (science) and **theology** are valid paths to truth.
    - Apparent contradictions between **science** and **Scripture** are due to human misunderstanding.
    - **Revelation** is authoritative in matters unattainable by reason, such as the **creation ex nihilo**.
    - Scientific findings may inform but not overturn the **literal sense** of Scripture.
    - "Since faith rests upon infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never be demonstrated, it is clear that the articles of faith can never be demonstrated or be opposed to reason." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.6)

3. **Doctrine of Creation**
    - God created the world **ex nihilo** in accordance with His will and wisdom.
    - The **six days** of creation are real but may be understood in various ways (e.g., as logical order or temporal sequence).
    - The **order of creation** reflects divine purpose and hierarchy.
    - The **creation of humanity** is unique, involving both body and rational soul.
    - "God alone can create, and creation is the production of something from nothing." (Summa Theologiae I, q.45, a.5)

4. **Historical Reality of Genesis 1–11**
    - The events of **Genesis 1–11** (creation, fall, flood, Babel) are fundamentally historical.
    - These narratives also convey **theological truths** about sin, providence, and redemption.
    - The **unity of the human race** is affirmed through Adam and Eve.
    - The **fall** is a real event with consequences for all humanity.
    - "The formation of the first man is both a historical fact and a mystery of faith." (Summa Theologiae I, q.92, a.4)

5. **Limits of Scientific Explanation**
    - **Science** can explain the processes of the natural world but not its ultimate origin.
    - The **beginning of time** and **creation ex nihilo** are accessible only through **revelation**.
    - Natural causes operate within creation, but the initial act of creation is supernatural.
    - **Scripture** is not a scientific textbook but teaches truth necessary for salvation.
    - "It is not the intention of Scripture to teach us about the nature of the heavens, but how one goes to heaven." (In Hexaemeron, cited in ST I, q.68, a.1 ad 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **faith and reason** profoundly shaped subsequent Christian engagement with science and Scripture, especially regarding **Genesis 1–11**. His insistence on the **literal sense** as foundational, while allowing for spiritual interpretation, influenced both Catholic and Reformed hermeneutics. Aquinas’s careful distinction between the domains of **natural philosophy** and **theology** provided a framework for later discussions on the relationship between scientific discovery and biblical revelation. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the interpretation of the **creation narrative** and the compatibility of **science and Scripture**.
