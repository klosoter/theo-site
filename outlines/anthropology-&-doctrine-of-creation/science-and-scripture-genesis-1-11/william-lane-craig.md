# William Lane Craig (1949– )

William Lane Craig approaches **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to both the **historicity** and **theological significance** of these chapters, while engaging critically with **modern science** and **hermeneutics**. He argues for a nuanced reading that recognizes the **mytho-historical genre** of Genesis 1–11, seeking to harmonize **biblical authority** with contemporary scientific findings, especially regarding human origins.

- "Genesis 1–11 is best understood as mytho-history: a narrative with both mythic and historical elements." ("In Quest of the Historical Adam")

## Key Works

- In Quest of the Historical Adam: A Biblical and Scientific Exploration (2021)
- Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics (3rd ed., 2008)
- Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview (with J.P. Moreland, 2003)
- "The Historical Adam" (various articles and lectures)
- "Genesis 1–11: Myth or History?" (public lectures and debates)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genesis 1–11 as Mytho-History**
   - Genesis 1–11 employs literary features of **myth** but is rooted in real historical events.
   - The text uses **figurative language** and **archetypal motifs** common in ancient Near Eastern literature.
   - Craig distinguishes between **mythic elements** (e.g., talking serpent) and **historical core** (e.g., existence of Adam and Eve).
   - He maintains that the genre does not undermine the **truthfulness** or **theological value** of the narrative.
   - "The primeval history of Genesis is neither pure myth nor straightforward history, but a unique blend I call mytho-history." (In Quest of the Historical Adam)

2. **Historical Adam and Eve**
   - Craig affirms the existence of a **historical Adam and Eve** as the first true humans.
   - He argues that their historicity is essential for **Pauline theology** and the doctrine of **original sin**.
   - Scientific evidence is engaged to identify a plausible time and context for Adam and Eve.
   - He is open to the possibility that Adam and Eve were members of an early **hominin** species endowed with **God’s image**.
   - "The New Testament authors, especially Paul, presuppose a historical Adam as the progenitor of the human race." (In Quest of the Historical Adam)

3. **Compatibility of Science and Scripture**
   - Craig seeks **concord** between the findings of modern science and the teachings of Scripture.
   - He rejects **young-earth creationism** and a strictly literal reading of Genesis 1–11.
   - He is open to **evolutionary biology** as a means by which God created humanity.
   - The authority of Scripture is maintained, but its interpretation must be informed by **general revelation**.
   - "We must interpret Genesis in light of both the ancient context and the deliverances of modern science." (In Quest of the Historical Adam)

4. **Doctrine of Inspiration and Inerrancy**
   - Craig upholds the **inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture in all that it affirms.
   - He contends that inerrancy applies to what the biblical authors intended to teach, not necessarily to incidental details.
   - The **genre** of Genesis 1–11 shapes what is to be affirmed as inerrant.
   - He distinguishes between **theological truths** and **scientific or historical particulars** in the text.
   - "Inerrancy is not threatened by recognizing the mytho-historical genre of Genesis 1–11." (In Quest of the Historical Adam)

5. **Theological Significance of Genesis 1–11**
   - Genesis 1–11 lays the foundation for **creation, fall, and redemption**.
   - The narrative provides essential truths about **human nature**, **sin**, and **God’s purposes**.
   - The theological message remains authoritative regardless of the precise historical details.
   - Craig emphasizes the **universal scope** of sin and the need for **salvation** as rooted in these chapters.
   - "The theological truths of Genesis 1–11 are indispensable for a coherent Christian worldview." (In Quest of the Historical Adam)

## Legacy and Impact

William Lane Craig’s work has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical engagement with **science and Scripture**, especially regarding **Genesis 1–11**. His advocacy for a **mytho-historical** reading has provided a mediating position between strict literalism and liberal demythologization. Craig’s influence extends into apologetics, biblical studies, and the philosophy of religion, encouraging a robust dialogue between **biblical authority** and scientific discovery. His approach continues to provoke discussion on the nature of **hermeneutics** and the doctrine of **original sin** within the broader Reformed and evangelical communities.
