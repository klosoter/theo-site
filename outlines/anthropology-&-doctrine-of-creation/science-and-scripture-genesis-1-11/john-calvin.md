# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin approached **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to the **clarity and authority of Scripture**, while recognizing the accommodation of divine revelation to human understanding. He emphasized that **Moses** wrote as a pastor, not a scientist, and that the **literal sense** of the text should be prioritized, yet interpreted in light of its theological purpose. Calvin maintained that **Scripture** is not intended to teach scientific detail, but to reveal **God’s sovereignty**, **creation**, and the **fallen condition** of humanity.

- "He who would learn astronomy and other recondite arts, let him go elsewhere." (Commentary on Genesis 1:6)

## Key Works

- Commentary on the First Book of Moses Called Genesis
- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 14–18)
- Sermons on Genesis
- Calvin’s Preface to the Geneva Bible
- John Calvin’s Doctrine of the Creation (Secondary: Paul Helm, Calvin at the Centre)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture Accommodates to Human Understanding**
    - God communicates in a way suited to human capacity, especially in **Genesis 1–11**.
    - The language of Scripture is **phenomenological**, not technical or scientific.
    - Calvin warns against seeking scientific precision in the biblical text.
    - The purpose is to reveal **God’s works** and character, not natural philosophy.
    - "For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to ‘lisp’ in speaking to us?" (Institutes I.13.1)

2. **Literal Sense with Theological Focus**
    - Calvin affirms the **literal sense** but insists it serves theological, not scientific, ends.
    - The narrative structure of Genesis is real history, but its aim is to teach about **God** and **humanity**.
    - He resists allegorical or speculative readings that obscure the plain meaning.
    - The **historicity** of Adam, Eve, and the Fall is essential for Christian doctrine.
    - "Let us rather conclude that the Spirit of God here intended to give all men the knowledge of their Creator, and not to teach them astronomy or other sciences." (Commentary on Genesis 1:6)

3. **Doctrine of Creation ex nihilo**
    - Calvin upholds the **creation of the world out of nothing** by God’s sovereign will.
    - The six days of creation are a literary framework, not a scientific chronology.
    - The order and goodness of creation reflect God’s wisdom and providence.
    - Creation is distinct from God, countering both ancient and contemporary errors.
    - "The world was made out of nothing, and that the world had a beginning." (Institutes I.14.1)

4. **The Authority and Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the only reliable source for knowledge of **God**, **creation**, and the **fall**.
    - Human reason is insufficient to grasp the truths revealed in Genesis 1–11.
    - The authority of Scripture is not diminished by its accommodation to human language.
    - Calvin opposes both rationalist and mystical distortions of the biblical account.
    - "The Scriptures obtain full authority among believers only when men regard them as having sprung from heaven." (Institutes I.7.1)

5. **Theological Anthropology and the Fall**
    - Calvin insists on the **historical Adam and Eve** as the first humans.
    - The **fall** in Genesis 3 is a real event with universal consequences for humanity.
    - Human depravity and the need for redemption are rooted in the events of Genesis 1–11.
    - The narrative sets the stage for the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - "We must, therefore, hold, that the sin of Adam is the proximate cause of the corruption of his posterity." (Institutes II.1.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has shaped the **Reformed doctrine of Scripture**, emphasizing both its **clarity** and its accommodation to human understanding. His insistence on the theological—not scientific—purpose of the text has influenced generations of interpreters, especially in debates over science and faith. Calvin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the **authority of Scripture** and the centrality of **creation and fall** in Christian theology.
