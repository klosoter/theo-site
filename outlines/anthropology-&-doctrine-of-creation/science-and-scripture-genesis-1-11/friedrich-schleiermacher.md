# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **Genesis 1–11** by emphasizing the primacy of **religious consciousness** and the symbolic nature of **biblical revelation**. He regarded these chapters as expressions of the community’s **God-consciousness** rather than literal historical or scientific accounts, seeking to reconcile **modern science** with the enduring value of **Scripture** for faith.

- "The narratives of the Old Testament are not to be regarded as historical in the modern sense, but as expressions of the religious spirit of the community." (Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Hermeneutics: The Handwritten Manuscripts
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- The Christian Faith and the Modern Mind (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Witness to God-Consciousness**
    - Scripture conveys the **feeling of absolute dependence** and the community’s experience of God.
    - Genesis 1–11 is interpreted as a symbolic articulation of humanity’s relation to the divine.
    - The authority of Scripture lies in its power to evoke religious consciousness, not in literal historicity.
    - The text’s value is theological, not scientific or strictly historical.
    - "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of absolute dependence." (Christian Faith)

2. **Accommodation to Historical Context**
    - Biblical authors communicated within the intellectual frameworks of their time.
    - Genesis 1–11 reflects ancient cosmologies, not modern scientific knowledge.
    - The enduring message is not tied to the accuracy of ancient worldviews.
    - Divine revelation adapts to human limitations and cultural context.
    - "Revelation is always accommodated to the capacity of its recipients." (Christian Faith)

3. **Symbolic and Mythic Interpretation**
    - Early Genesis is best understood as **myth**, expressing truths about God and humanity.
    - The stories function as vehicles for religious meaning, not scientific explanation.
    - Mythic language conveys existential realities about creation, sin, and human nature.
    - Theological interpretation takes precedence over literalism.
    - "Myth is the necessary form in which religious truth is expressed." (Hermeneutics)

4. **Integration of Science and Faith**
    - Scientific discoveries do not threaten the core of Christian faith.
    - Genesis 1–11 should not be read as a scientific account of origins.
    - Faith and science address different questions: meaning versus mechanism.
    - Theological meaning persists even as scientific paradigms change.
    - "The truths of faith are not in competition with the truths of science." (Christian Faith)

5. **Hermeneutics Rooted in Religious Experience**
    - Interpretation must attend to the religious intent of the text.
    - The interpreter seeks the spiritual message, not factual precision.
    - Hermeneutics bridges the gap between ancient text and modern reader.
    - The goal is to foster genuine religious self-consciousness.
    - "Understanding is the re-experiencing of the religious spirit of the text." (Hermeneutics)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** profoundly shaped modern **hermeneutics** and the theological engagement with science. By prioritizing **religious experience** and symbolic meaning, he paved the way for non-literal readings of Scripture that remain influential in liberal Protestantism. His work continues to inform debates on the relationship between **biblical revelation** and scientific knowledge, challenging the church to articulate faith in dialogue with contemporary thought.
