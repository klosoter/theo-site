# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to the full **authority of Scripture** and a nuanced understanding of the relationship between **science and revelation**. He affirms the **inerrancy** and **perspicuity** of the biblical text, while also advocating for careful interpretation that respects both the **historical** and **theological** dimensions of these foundational chapters.

- "Scripture is the ultimate standard for all human knowledge, including scientific knowledge." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Science, Theology, and the Bible" in The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1 (2012)
- "The Bible and Science" (article, available online)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Ultimate Authority**
    - Scripture is the final standard for truth, including in matters of **origins**.
    - Scientific claims must be evaluated in light of **biblical revelation**.
    - Apparent conflicts between science and Scripture are due to human error, not divine revelation.
    - The **self-attesting** nature of Scripture grounds its authority over all disciplines.
    - "The Bible is the criterion by which all other claims to truth are to be judged." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Historical Adam and Real Events**
    - Genesis 1–11 refers to real historical events and persons, including **Adam and Eve**.
    - Denial of the historicity of these chapters undermines **redemptive history** and the gospel.
    - The genealogies and narrative structure support a historical reading.
    - Frame rejects purely mythological or symbolic interpretations of Genesis 1–11.
    - "If Adam is not a historical figure, the biblical doctrine of sin and redemption collapses." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Analogical Days Interpretation**
    - The "days" of Genesis 1 are best understood as **God’s workdays**, analogous but not necessarily identical to human days.
    - This view allows for flexibility regarding the age of the earth.
    - Frame maintains that the literary structure communicates real events, not mere allegory.
    - The analogical days approach seeks to honor both the text and legitimate scientific inquiry.
    - "The days are God’s workdays, not necessarily identical to ours, but analogous." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Integration of General and Special Revelation**
    - Both **general revelation** (nature) and **special revelation** (Scripture) are true and come from God.
    - Apparent contradictions arise from misinterpretation of one or both sources.
    - Science, as a human endeavor, is fallible and must be corrected by Scripture.
    - Christians should engage science critically, not dismissively.
    - "God’s revelation in nature and Scripture cannot ultimately conflict, for God is the author of both." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Covenantal Epistemology**
    - All human knowledge, including scientific and biblical interpretation, is shaped by one’s **covenantal relationship** with God.
    - Unbelief leads to distortion of both scientific and scriptural understanding.
    - The **lordship of Christ** extends to all intellectual pursuits.
    - Frame’s **triperspectivalism** encourages integrating normative, situational, and existential perspectives in approaching Genesis 1–11.
    - "Our knowledge is always covenantal; it is shaped by our relationship to God as Lord." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** on the relationship between **science and Scripture**, especially regarding Genesis 1–11. His emphasis on the **ultimate authority of Scripture** and his analogical approach to the creation days have provided a mediating position within evangelical debates. Frame’s **triperspectivalism** and covenantal epistemology continue to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking to navigate the challenges of modern science while remaining faithful to biblical revelation.
