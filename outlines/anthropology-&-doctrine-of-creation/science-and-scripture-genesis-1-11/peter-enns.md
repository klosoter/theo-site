# Peter Enns (1961– )

Peter Enns approaches **Genesis 1–11** by emphasizing its ancient Near Eastern context and literary character, arguing that these chapters should not be read as straightforward **historical narrative** or **scientific account**. He contends that **Scripture** reflects the cultural assumptions of its original audience and that **inerrancy** must be understood in light of the Bible’s own genres and intentions.

- "The Bible is, after all, an ancient book, and we must respect its ancient context if we are to hear it properly." ("Inspiration and Incarnation")

## Key Works

- Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament (2005)
- The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn’t Say about Human Origins (2012)
- The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It (2014)
- How the Bible Actually Works (2019)
- "Genesis and the Challenge of the Fossil Record" (various articles and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Incarnational**
    - The Bible is both a divine and human product, reflecting the culture and worldview of its time.
    - Ancient Near Eastern parallels inform our understanding of Genesis 1–11.
    - The text’s humanity does not undermine its theological message.
    - Inspiration accommodates ancient cosmology and mythic elements.
    - "The doctrine of inspiration must account for the Bible that we actually have, not the one we wish we had." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

2. **Genesis 1–11 is Theological, Not Scientific**
    - These chapters communicate theological truths rather than scientific or historical data.
    - The focus is on **God’s relationship to creation**, not material origins.
    - Ancient cosmology is used as a vehicle for theological meaning.
    - Attempts to harmonize Genesis with modern science misunderstand its purpose.
    - "Genesis is not interested in answering the questions that concern modern science." (The Evolution of Adam)

3. **Accommodation in Revelation**
    - God accommodates revelation to the cultural and intellectual context of the original audience.
    - Ancient worldviews are not corrected but used to convey divine truth.
    - Accommodation is a necessary aspect of **divine communication**.
    - This principle is seen throughout both Old and New Testaments.
    - "God speaks in ways that ancient people would have understood." (Inspiration and Incarnation)

4. **Historical Adam is Theologically Flexible**
    - The existence of a historical Adam is not essential for the theological claims of Genesis.
    - Paul’s use of Adam is shaped by Second Temple Jewish interpretation, not strict historicity.
    - The **doctrine of sin** can be maintained without a literal first couple.
    - Evolutionary science challenges but does not destroy biblical faith.
    - "The Bible itself does not demand a historical Adam as the first human being." (The Evolution of Adam)

5. **Scripture’s Authority is Christocentric**
    - The authority of Scripture is grounded in its witness to Christ, not in literalism.
    - Reading Genesis 1–11 through a Christ-centered lens allows for theological depth.
    - The Bible’s authority is not diminished by recognizing its ancient context.
    - Faithfulness involves wrestling with difficult questions, not avoiding them.
    - "The Bible’s purpose is to lead us to Christ, not to provide a textbook of science or history." (The Bible Tells Me So)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Enns has significantly influenced contemporary evangelical debates on **hermeneutics**, especially regarding the relationship between **science and Scripture**. His work has encouraged many to reconsider traditional readings of Genesis 1–11 in light of ancient Near Eastern literature and modern scientific discoveries. While controversial among some conservative audiences, Enns has shaped ongoing discussions about **inerrancy**, biblical authority, and the nature of divine revelation. His approach continues to provoke both critique and appreciation in academic and church contexts.
