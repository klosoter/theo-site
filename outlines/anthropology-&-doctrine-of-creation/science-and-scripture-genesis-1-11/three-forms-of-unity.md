# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity—comprising the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a distinctively **Reformed doctrine of Scripture** as the inspired, authoritative, and sufficient Word of God. These confessions uphold the **historicity of Genesis 1–11**, the reality of the **Fall**, and the necessity of grounding all theological and scientific claims in the teaching of Scripture.

- "We believe that the Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (especially Articles 2, 5, 7, 12, 14, 15)
- Heidelberg Catechism (Questions 6, 9, 26, 54, 122, 124)
- Canons of Dort (especially First Head, Article 1; Third and Fourth Heads, Article 1)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English edition)
- The Reformed Confessions: Harmonized with Annotated Bibliography (James T. Dennison, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Supreme Authority**
   - Scripture alone is the rule for faith and life, surpassing all human writings and traditions.
   - Its authority is rooted in **divine inspiration** by the Holy Spirit.
   - All doctrines, including those about creation and early history, must be derived from Scripture.
   - The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture are emphasized for understanding essential truths.
   "We believe that these Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently taught therein." (Belgic Confession, Article 7)

2. **Creation as Historical Act**
   - God created the world out of nothing by His Word, as described in **Genesis 1**.
   - The creation account is affirmed as a real, historical event, not merely symbolic or mythological.
   - Humanity is created in the **image of God**, with Adam and Eve as historical individuals.
   - The doctrine of **providence** is grounded in God’s ongoing upholding of creation.
   "We believe that the Father by the Word, that is, by His Son, has created of nothing the heaven, the earth, and all creatures." (Belgic Confession, Article 12)

3. **The Fall and Original Sin as Historical Realities**
   - The disobedience of Adam and Eve in Genesis 3 is a real event with universal consequences.
   - **Original sin** is transmitted to all humanity through Adam as the federal head.
   - The confessions reject any denial of the historicity of the Fall or its effects.
   - **Redemption in Christ** is necessitated by the actual entrance of sin into the world.
   "We believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race." (Belgic Confession, Article 15)

4. **Scripture Interprets Science**
   - Scripture is the norming norm for all knowledge, including scientific inquiry.
   - Apparent conflicts between science and Scripture must be resolved by upholding the truthfulness of the biblical text.
   - The created order reveals God, but is subordinate to **special revelation**.
   - Human reason and observation are valuable but always subject to correction by Scripture.
   "We know Him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe... second, by His holy and divine Word." (Belgic Confession, Article 2)

5. **Unity of Redemptive History**
   - Genesis 1–11 is foundational for understanding the unity of God’s **redemptive plan**.
   - The promise of redemption (Genesis 3:15) is central to the confessional understanding of Scripture.
   - The genealogies and narratives of Genesis 1–11 are treated as real history, connecting Adam to Christ.
   - The confessions emphasize the continuity of the **covenant of grace** from the earliest chapters of Genesis.
   "We believe that our gracious God, in His marvelous wisdom and goodness, seeing that man had thus thrown himself into temporal and eternal death, did seek and comfort him, promising him that He would give His Son." (Belgic Confession, Article 17)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed hermeneutics** and the church’s approach to the relationship between science and Scripture, especially regarding Genesis 1–11. Their insistence on the **historicity of creation, the Fall, and the unity of redemptive history** continues to influence confessional Reformed churches worldwide. These documents remain a touchstone for debates over evolution, biblical authority, and the interpretation of early Genesis, providing a robust confessional framework for engaging contemporary scientific challenges.
