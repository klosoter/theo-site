# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **Genesis 1–11** through the framework of **eschatology**, focusing on the **theological meaning** of the creation narratives rather than a literal or scientific reading. He emphasizes **creation theology**, the ongoing work of the **Spirit**, and the importance of the **dialogue between science and faith** for understanding these foundational texts.

- "The biblical creation narratives are not scientific reports but confessions of faith in God the Creator." (God in Creation)

## Key Works

- God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God
- Theology of Hope
- Science and Wisdom
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as an Eschatological Event**
    - Creation is oriented toward the **future fulfillment** of God’s purposes.
    - Genesis 1–11 is read as a **proleptic** witness to the new creation.
    - The **eschatological horizon** shapes the meaning of beginnings.
    - Scientific accounts are not in competition with the **theological telos** of creation.
    - "Creation is not finished; it is a project open to the future." (God in Creation)

2. **Non-Literal Interpretation of Genesis**
    - Genesis 1–11 is **mythopoetic** and theological, not a scientific chronology.
    - The text conveys **truths about God, humanity, and the world** through narrative.
    - Literalism is seen as a misreading that obscures the **theological message**.
    - The **dialogue with science** is possible because the text’s intent is not empirical.
    - "The creation narratives are not meant to be read as scientific cosmologies." (God in Creation)

3. **Creation and the Doctrine of the Spirit**
    - The **Spirit of God** is central in the ongoing process of creation.
    - Genesis 1:2 is foundational for understanding the **Spirit’s creative presence**.
    - The Spirit’s work bridges the gap between **theology and scientific insight**.
    - Creation is dynamic, open to **renewal and transformation**.
    - "The Spirit is the energy of creation and the power of its renewal." (God in Creation)

4. **Humanity’s Vocation in Creation**
    - Genesis 1–11 grounds human responsibility for the **care of creation**.
    - The **imago Dei** is a call to stewardship, not domination.
    - Ecological crisis is a theological issue rooted in misunderstanding Genesis.
    - Science aids in understanding the scope of human responsibility.
    - "The human being is the earth’s partner and not its master." (God in Creation)

5. **Dialogue Between Science and Theology**
    - Science and theology are **distinct but complementary** approaches to truth.
    - Genesis 1–11 provides a **framework of meaning** for scientific inquiry.
    - Theological reflection on creation is enriched, not threatened, by science.
    - The **doctrine of creation** invites ongoing engagement with scientific discovery.
    - "Theology must learn from science, just as science must be open to theological questions." (Science and Wisdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has significantly shaped contemporary **theology of creation**, especially in its engagement with scientific perspectives. His emphasis on the **eschatological dimension** of creation and the dynamic role of the **Spirit** has encouraged theologians to move beyond literalist debates and to see Scripture as a source of hope and ecological responsibility. Moltmann’s work continues to foster fruitful dialogue between **science and faith**, influencing both academic theology and Christian ecological movements.
