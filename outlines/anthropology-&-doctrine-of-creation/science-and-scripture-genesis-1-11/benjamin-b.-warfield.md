# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached **Genesis 1–11** by upholding the **inerrancy of Scripture** while engaging critically with developments in **science** and **historical criticism**. He affirmed the theological truthfulness of the biblical account, yet allowed for the possibility of **theistic evolution** and non-literal interpretations of the creation days, provided these did not undermine essential doctrines such as the **historical Adam** and **original sin**.

- "The question is not, How did God create? but, Did God create?" (Works, "On the Antiquity and the Unity of the Human Race")

## Key Works

- "On the Antiquity and the Unity of the Human Race" (1888)
- "Evolution, Science, and Scripture" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible" (1948, posthumous collection)
- "Calvin and Evolution" (1916)
- "The Idea of Revelation and Theories of Evolution" (in Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is Inerrant and Authoritative**
   - Scripture, including Genesis 1–11, is without error in all it affirms.
   - The authority of the Bible is foundational for Christian doctrine and faith.
   - Inerrancy applies to theological, historical, and moral assertions.
   - Warfield defended the trustworthiness of Genesis against higher criticism.
   - "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

2. **Openness to Theistic Evolution**
   - Warfield did not see evolution as inherently incompatible with Christian faith.
   - He distinguished between naturalistic evolution and a God-directed process.
   - The mechanism of creation could involve secondary causes under divine providence.
   - He insisted that any evolutionary theory must preserve the doctrine of creation.
   - "I do not think that there is any general statement in the Bible or any part of the account of creation, either as given in Genesis 1 and 2 or elsewhere alluded to, that need be opposed to evolution." ("Evolution, Science, and Scripture")

3. **Historical Adam and Original Sin**
   - Warfield maintained the necessity of a real, historical Adam.
   - The doctrine of **original sin** depends on the historicity of Adam’s fall.
   - He rejected any evolutionary theory that denied the unity and fall of the human race.
   - Genesis 1–3 is foundational for understanding human nature and redemption.
   - "If there was no first man, there was no fall, and if there was no fall, the basis of redemption is gone." ("On the Antiquity and the Unity of the Human Race")

4. **Accommodation and Genre Sensitivity**
   - Warfield allowed for non-literal readings of Genesis 1–2, considering literary form and intent.
   - He recognized the possibility of **accommodation** in the biblical text to ancient cosmology.
   - The days of creation could be understood as literary or topical, not strictly chronological.
   - He urged careful exegesis to distinguish between core doctrine and peripheral details.
   - "The question is not as to the fact, but as to the mode of creation." ("Calvin and Evolution")

5. **Harmony of Science and Scripture**
   - Warfield believed that true science and true biblical interpretation cannot ultimately conflict.
   - He encouraged engagement with scientific findings, provided Scripture’s authority is upheld.
   - Apparent conflicts arise from misinterpretations of either nature or the Bible.
   - The Christian scholar’s task is to pursue both theological and scientific truth.
   - "There may be apparent discrepancies between the Bible and the facts of nature, but there can be no real ones." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s nuanced approach to **Genesis 1–11** shaped the Reformed tradition’s engagement with **science and Scripture**, especially regarding **evolution** and **biblical inerrancy**. His insistence on the compatibility of the **historical Adam** with scientific inquiry influenced later evangelical debates. Warfield’s legacy endures in contemporary discussions on the relationship between faith and science, providing a model for rigorous theological fidelity alongside intellectual openness.
