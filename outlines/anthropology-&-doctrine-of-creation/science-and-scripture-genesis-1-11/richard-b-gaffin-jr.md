# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches **Genesis 1–11** with a strong commitment to the **authority of Scripture**, emphasizing its **redemptive-historical** character and the **unity of special revelation**. He insists that the early chapters of Genesis are foundational for **biblical theology** and must be interpreted in light of their **theological purpose** rather than as a modern scientific account, while affirming their historical reliability.

- "The question of the relation of science and Scripture is ultimately a question of the authority and interpretation of the Bible." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 104)

## Key Works

- God’s Word in Servant-Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture
- "The Importance of Adam: A Response to the Recent ‘Adam’ Debate" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2010)
- "The Vitality of Reformed Systematic Theology for the Church’s Task" (in The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)
- Perspectives on the Sabbath: Essays by Gaffin and others (for his treatment of creation and rest)
- Resurrection and Redemption (for redemptive-historical method implications)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority is Absolute**
    - Scripture is the final norm for faith and life, including matters touching origins.
    - The authority of **Genesis 1–11** is not diminished by scientific challenges.
    - The text must be received as **God’s Word**, not merely ancient literature.
    - The church’s doctrine of creation stands or falls with the trustworthiness of these chapters.
    - "The authority of Scripture is not subject to the shifting sands of scientific theory." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 110)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Interpretation**
    - Genesis 1–11 is foundational for the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The narrative sets the stage for the **covenant of grace** and the coming of Christ.
    - The structure and themes of these chapters are theological, not merely chronological.
    - The focus is on God’s acts in history, not on providing a scientific cosmology.
    - "Genesis 1–11 is not isolated prehistory but the essential prologue to redemption." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 117)

3. **Historical Adam and Fall**
    - The existence of a real, historical Adam is non-negotiable for **Pauline theology** and the gospel.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the doctrine of **original sin** and **federal headship**.
    - The events of Genesis 3 are essential for understanding **human depravity** and redemption.
    - The New Testament’s use of Adam presupposes his reality.
    - "Without a historical Adam, the coherence of the gospel is lost." ("The Importance of Adam," WTJ 2010)

4. **Scripture and Science: Distinct but Related**
    - Scripture and science address different questions: **ultimate meaning** vs. **secondary causes**.
    - Apparent conflicts arise from misinterpretation of either Scripture or scientific data.
    - The church must avoid both **scientific concordism** and unwarranted accommodation.
    - The priority remains with the **hermeneutical integrity** of the biblical text.
    - "Science must not dictate the interpretation of Scripture, but neither should Scripture be read as a science textbook." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 112)

5. **Unity of Special Revelation**
    - Genesis 1–11 is organically connected to the rest of Scripture.
    - The doctrines of **creation, fall, and redemption** are inseparable.
    - The early chapters of Genesis provide the necessary backdrop for the work of Christ.
    - The unity of the canon demands a coherent reading of Genesis as Christian Scripture.
    - "The unity of special revelation is at stake in how we read Genesis 1–11." (God’s Word in Servant-Form, p. 119)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped **Reformed approaches to the doctrine of Scripture**, especially regarding the relationship between **science and Genesis 1–11**. His insistence on the **historicity of Adam** and the redemptive-historical reading of early Genesis has influenced debates within confessional Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Gaffin’s careful balance between theological fidelity and engagement with contemporary science continues to provide a model for evangelical scholarship. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the **authority and unity of Scripture** in the face of modern challenges.
