# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to the **inerrancy of Scripture** and a high view of its **historical reliability**. He maintained that the early chapters of Genesis are foundational for **Reformed theology**, especially regarding **creation**, **the fall**, and the **covenant of works**, and he rejected attempts to harmonize these texts with naturalistic or purely scientific paradigms.

- "The biblical account of creation is not myth but sober history, and the facts recorded are to be accepted as such." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Christian Faith and the Truthfulness of the Old Testament" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Adamic Administration" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT), especially discussions on Adam and original sin
- "The Covenant of Grace" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Inerrancy and Authority**
    - Scripture is the inspired and infallible Word of God.
    - Genesis 1–11 is not myth or allegory but reliable history.
    - The authority of Scripture stands above all human theories, including scientific ones.
    - The text’s plain meaning is to be received unless compelling reasons dictate otherwise.
    - "We must not allow any supposed scientific discovery to impugn the veracity of the biblical record." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Historical Adam and the Fall**
    - Adam is a real, historical individual, not a literary figure.
    - The fall described in Genesis 3 is an actual event with universal consequences.
    - Denial of the historicity of Adam undermines the doctrine of **original sin**.
    - The unity of the human race is grounded in Adam’s headship.
    - "The historicity of Adam is integral to the apostolic teaching regarding sin and redemption." (Romans, NICNT)

3. **Creation Ex Nihilo**
    - God created all things out of nothing by His sovereign word.
    - The creation account affirms divine intentionality and purpose.
    - The days of creation are to be interpreted with reverence for the text’s intent.
    - Creation is distinct from any evolutionary process not governed by divine fiat.
    - "The doctrine of creation ex nihilo is essential to the biblical worldview." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Covenant Theology Rooted in Genesis**
    - The **covenant of works** is established with Adam in Genesis 2.
    - The **covenant of grace** is anticipated after the fall.
    - Genesis 1–11 provides the foundation for understanding redemptive history.
    - The Noahic covenant demonstrates God’s faithfulness to creation.
    - "The whole subsequent development of covenant revelation is rooted in these early chapters." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Limits of Science in Interpreting Scripture**
    - Science is a valuable but subordinate discipline to theology.
    - Scripture must interpret science, not vice versa.
    - Apparent conflicts arise from misinterpretations of either Scripture or science.
    - The supernatural elements of Genesis 1–11 cannot be explained by naturalistic methods.
    - "We must beware of allowing scientific hypotheses to dictate the exegesis of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s robust defense of the **historicity of Genesis 1–11** has shaped Reformed approaches to the relationship between **science and Scripture**. His insistence on the **inerrancy** and **authority** of the biblical text continues to influence conservative evangelical and Reformed scholarship. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the integrity of the early chapters of Genesis within systematic theology.
