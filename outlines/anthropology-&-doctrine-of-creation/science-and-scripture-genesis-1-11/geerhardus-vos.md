# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached **Genesis 1–11** as foundational for **biblical theology**, emphasizing the unity of **special revelation** and the progressive unfolding of **redemptive history**. He maintained that **Scripture** provides a divinely authoritative account of origins, while also recognizing the distinct roles of **science** and **theology** in interpreting reality.

- "The opening chapters of Genesis are not merely a prelude to revelation, but themselves revelation in the highest sense." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit"
- "The Mosaic Origin of the Pentateuchal Codes" (Princeton Theological Review)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Special Revelation**
   - Genesis 1–11 is the starting point for understanding **God’s self-disclosure** in history.
   - **Revelation** is necessary to interpret the created order rightly.
   - Scripture’s account of origins is not subordinate to scientific theories.
   - Theological meaning is rooted in the text’s revelatory character.
   - "Revelation is not a supplement to natural knowledge, but its corrective and completion." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
   - The narrative of Genesis 1–11 is integral to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
   - Later biblical revelation presupposes and builds upon these chapters.
   - The unity of Scripture resists fragmenting the text into myth or legend.
   - Theological coherence is maintained from creation to consummation.
   - "The unity of revelation is nowhere more clearly seen than in the opening chapters of Genesis." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Historical Adam and Fall**
   - Adam is presented as a real, historical individual.
   - The **Fall** is a factual event with cosmic and covenantal consequences.
   - Denial of the historicity of Adam undermines the doctrine of **original sin**.
   - The Pauline doctrine of redemption presupposes a historical Genesis.
   - "The New Testament treats Adam as a historical person, and the fall as an actual event." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Distinction and Harmony of Science and Theology**
   - Science and theology have distinct domains but are not inherently in conflict.
   - Scripture speaks authoritatively on matters of **ultimate origin** and meaning.
   - Scientific findings must be interpreted within a **theological framework**.
   - Apparent conflicts arise from misreading either Scripture or nature.
   - "Theology and science are not rivals, but each must keep to its own method and sphere." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Progressive Revelation**
   - Genesis 1–11 contains the seeds of later **covenant** and **eschatological** themes.
   - The meaning of these chapters unfolds throughout the canon.
   - Early revelation is not exhaustive but anticipatory.
   - Theological interpretation must account for the progress of redemptive history.
   - "The principle of progressive revelation is essential to understanding the early chapters of Genesis." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** shaped the Reformed tradition’s understanding of the relationship between **science and Scripture**, emphasizing the primacy of **special revelation** and the unity of **redemptive history**. His insistence on the historical character of Adam and the Fall has influenced confessional Reformed theology and debates on origins. Vos’s biblical-theological method continues to inform contemporary discussions on the interpretation of Genesis and the doctrine of creation.
