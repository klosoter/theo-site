# John H. Walton (1952– )

John H. Walton approaches **Genesis 1–11** by emphasizing its **ancient Near Eastern context** and advocating for a **functional interpretation** rather than a modern scientific or material account. He contends that **Scripture** communicates theological truths using the cultural categories of its original audience, and that **science and faith** need not be in conflict when the Bible is read on its own terms.

- "We must let the text be what it is, not what we want it to be." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

## Key Works

- The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate (2009)
- The Lost World of Adam and Eve: Genesis 2–3 and the Human Origins Debate (2015)
- Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology (2011)
- The NIV Application Commentary: Genesis (2001)
- The Lost World of Scripture: Ancient Literary Culture and Biblical Authority (with D. Brent Sandy, 2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genesis 1 as Functional Origins**
   - Genesis 1 describes the assignment of **functions** rather than the material creation of the universe.
   - The text reflects an **ancient Near Eastern worldview** where existence is defined by purpose and order.
   - The seven-day structure is understood as a **temple inauguration** rather than a scientific chronology.
   - Material origins are not the concern of the biblical author; **theological meaning** is central.
   - "The key to understanding Genesis is recognizing that it is about God bringing order and function, not about material manufacturing." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

2. **Scripture Speaks in Ancient Categories**
   - The Bible communicates using the **cultural and literary conventions** of its original context.
   - Modern scientific questions are not addressed by the text, which uses **phenomenological language**.
   - Ancient cosmology, including the **firmament** and cosmic waters, reflects Israel’s intellectual environment.
   - The authority of Scripture is not diminished by recognizing its **contextual embeddedness**.
   - "We must read the text as an ancient document, not impose our modern questions upon it." (Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology)

3. **Non-Conflict Model of Science and Faith**
   - **Scripture and science** answer different sets of questions: purpose vs. process.
   - The Bible’s silence on material mechanisms allows for **scientific investigation** of origins.
   - **Evolutionary theory** and ancient earth models are not inherently at odds with Genesis 1–11.
   - Theological affirmations (e.g., God as Creator) remain central regardless of scientific models.
   - "The Bible is not at war with science; it simply operates in a different sphere." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

4. **Adam and Eve as Archetypes**
   - Genesis 2–3 presents **Adam and Eve** as archetypal representatives, not necessarily as the first biological humans.
   - The narrative conveys **theological truths** about humanity’s vocation and relationship to God.
   - The historicity of Adam and Eve is not essential for the **doctrinal core** of the text.
   - Paul’s use of Adam in the New Testament is compatible with an archetypal reading.
   - "Adam is presented as an archetype, representing all humanity in its relationship to God." (The Lost World of Adam and Eve)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Ancient Literary Culture**
   - **Biblical authority** is grounded in what the text meant to its original audience.
   - Recognizing **oral tradition** and ancient literary practices enhances, rather than undermines, trust in Scripture.
   - The Bible’s message is **theological and covenantal**, not scientific or technical.
   - Faithfulness to Scripture requires careful attention to **genre, context, and intent**.
   - "The authority of Scripture is tied to its communicative intent, not to our modern expectations." (The Lost World of Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Walton’s work has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical engagement with **Genesis 1–11**, especially in discussions of **science and faith**. His emphasis on the **ancient Near Eastern context** and functional interpretation has provided a framework for reconciling biblical authority with modern scientific understanding. Walton’s approach has influenced both academic scholarship and church teaching, encouraging a more nuanced and historically informed reading of Scripture.
