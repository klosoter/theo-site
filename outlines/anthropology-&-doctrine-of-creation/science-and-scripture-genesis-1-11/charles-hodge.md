# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached **Genesis 1–11** as a foundational text for both **Christian doctrine** and the relationship between **science and Scripture**. He maintained that while the Bible is not a scientific textbook, its teachings on **creation, the fall, and early history** are historically reliable and theologically authoritative, and any scientific theory must be evaluated in light of **biblical inerrancy**.

- "The Bible is to be interpreted by the same rules as any other book; but it is to be received as the word of God, and, therefore, as infallible and authoritative." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- What is Darwinism?
- The Way of Life
- Essays and Reviews (various articles on science and Scripture)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Inerrancy and Authority**
    - The Bible, including Genesis 1–11, is **inerrant** and authoritative in all it affirms.
    - Historical narratives in Genesis are to be accepted as factual unless compelling evidence dictates otherwise.
    - The authority of Scripture supersedes all human theories, including scientific hypotheses.
    - Theological doctrines such as **original sin** and **the image of God** depend on the historicity of early Genesis.
    - "If the historical truth of the first chapters of Genesis be denied, the whole scheme of redemption is subverted." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Accommodation and Literary Form**
    - Scripture sometimes uses **phenomenological language** to communicate to its original audience.
    - Genesis 1–11 may employ figurative or poetic elements, but this does not undermine its truthfulness.
    - The days of creation may be interpreted as periods or literal days, but the text’s theological intent remains central.
    - Hodge allowed for some flexibility in interpreting the **genre** of Genesis, provided core doctrines are preserved.
    - "It is admitted that the sacred writers do speak of natural phenomena in popular language." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Compatibility of Science and Scripture**
    - True science and true biblical interpretation cannot ultimately conflict.
    - Apparent contradictions arise from either faulty exegesis or erroneous scientific conclusions.
    - Hodge affirmed the legitimacy of scientific inquiry, provided it respects **biblical boundaries**.
    - He critiqued materialistic or naturalistic readings of origins that exclude divine agency.
    - "Science has its province, and the Bible has its province; and the one cannot contradict the other." (What is Darwinism?)

4. **Creation and Providence**
    - God is the **Creator** and sustainer of all things, as affirmed in Genesis 1–11.
    - Hodge rejected atheistic evolution but allowed for the possibility of **theistic evolution** if it did not deny divine creation.
    - The special creation of humanity is essential for doctrines such as the **imago Dei** and the unity of the human race.
    - The providential governance of God is evident throughout the early chapters of Genesis.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the universe owes its existence to the will of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **The Historicity of Adam and the Fall**
    - The existence of a historical Adam is non-negotiable for **federal headship** and **original sin**.
    - The fall described in Genesis 3 is a real event with universal consequences.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the entire structure of **redemptive history**.
    - Hodge opposed attempts to mythologize or allegorize the early chapters of Genesis.
    - "The doctrine of the fall of man is the foundation of the doctrine of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s approach to **science and Scripture** in Genesis 1–11 shaped the **Princeton Theology** and influenced generations of Reformed theologians. His insistence on the **inerrancy** and historical reliability of early Genesis provided a framework for engaging scientific developments without compromising core doctrines. While later theologians have nuanced his positions, Hodge’s careful balance of biblical authority and openness to scientific discovery remains a touchstone in evangelical discussions of creation and origins.
