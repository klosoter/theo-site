# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached **Genesis 1–11** as a literal and historical account, affirming the **authority of Scripture** over human reason and emerging scientific claims. He maintained that the **creation**, **fall**, and **flood** narratives were factual events, foundational for Christian doctrine and the understanding of **original sin** and **redemption**.

- "When Moses writes that God created Heaven and Earth and whatever is in them in six days, then let this period continue to have been six days, and do not venture to devise any comment according to which six days were one day." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis, Chapters 1–5
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 2: Lectures on Genesis, Chapters 6–14
- Disputation on the Divinity and Humanity of Christ (1540)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525) [for broader hermeneutical context]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Supremacy over Reason**
    - Scripture is the highest authority, surpassing all human philosophy and science.
    - Genesis 1–11 is to be read as a true historical record, not allegory or myth.
    - Human reason is fallen and must be subordinated to the clear teaching of the Word.
    - Attempts to harmonize Scripture with secular science undermine faith.
    - "We know from Moses that the world was not in existence before six thousand years ago." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Literal Six-Day Creation**
    - The six days of creation are literal, consecutive 24-hour days.
    - God’s creative acts are direct and immediate, not mediated by natural processes.
    - The order and structure of creation reflect God’s wisdom and power.
    - Rejects allegorical or figurative readings of the creation days.
    - "Let us rather confess our ignorance than wrest the words of Moses out of their true and proper meaning." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Historical Adam and Fall**
    - Adam and Eve were real, historical individuals created by God.
    - The fall in Genesis 3 is a factual event with universal consequences.
    - **Original sin** is inherited from Adam, grounding the need for redemption.
    - Denial of the historicity of Adam undermines the gospel itself.
    - "If we do not understand the fall as a real event, the entire doctrine of original sin collapses." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Global Flood as Judgment**
    - The flood in Genesis 6–9 was a worldwide, historical event.
    - The flood demonstrates God’s righteous judgment against sin.
    - Noah’s ark and deliverance prefigure salvation through Christ.
    - Rejects attempts to reduce the flood to a local or symbolic event.
    - "The Flood was a punishment so great that it destroyed all living things except those preserved in the ark." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Christocentric Reading of Genesis**
    - Genesis 1–11 points forward to Christ and the promise of redemption.
    - The protoevangelium (Genesis 3:15) is the first announcement of the gospel.
    - The genealogies and narratives prepare for the coming of the Savior.
    - All Scripture, including early Genesis, must be interpreted in light of Christ.
    - "All the promises of God in the Old Testament are directed to Christ." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **historicity of Genesis 1–11** shaped subsequent Protestant approaches to **Scripture and science**, especially within the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. His insistence on the **literal sense** of the text and the supremacy of Scripture over reason provided a foundation for later debates on creation, evolution, and biblical authority. Luther’s influence endures in confessional statements and in ongoing discussions about the relationship between **biblical revelation** and scientific inquiry.
