# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **Genesis 1–11** as a unique form of **revelatory myth**, emphasizing that these chapters convey profound **theological truths** rather than scientific or literal historical accounts. He argued for a clear distinction between the **domains of science and faith**, maintaining that **Scripture** communicates the meaning of existence and humanity’s relationship to God, while science addresses empirical realities.

- "The Bible is not a textbook of natural science, but the record of revelation." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge
- Man in Revolt: A Christian Anthropology
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genesis 1–11 as Revelatory Myth**
    - Genesis 1–11 communicates **universal truths** about God, creation, and humanity, not scientific data.
    - The narratives are **mythic** in form but are vehicles for **divine revelation**.
    - Brunner rejects both literalism and liberal demythologization, seeking a **middle path**.
    - The focus is on the **meaning** of the text, not its correspondence to scientific chronology.
    - "The so-called myths of the Bible are not legends, but expressions of truth in narrative form." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

2. **Distinction Between Science and Faith**
    - Science and faith are **distinct spheres** with different methods and aims.
    - **Scripture** addresses ultimate questions of meaning, purpose, and relationship with God.
    - Scientific explanations of origins do not threaten the **theological message** of Genesis.
    - Attempts to harmonize Genesis with science misunderstand both disciplines.
    - "Faith and science are not in competition, for they answer different questions." (Revelation and Reason)

3. **Doctrine of Creation**
    - Creation is a **theological affirmation** of God as the source and sustainer of all.
    - The doctrine of creation is foundational for understanding **human dignity** and responsibility.
    - The **imago Dei** is central to Brunner’s anthropology, rooted in Genesis.
    - The creation narratives express the **dependence** of all things on God.
    - "Creation means that the world is not God, but is wholly dependent upon Him." (The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption)

4. **The Fall and Human Sinfulness**
    - The story of the **Fall** in Genesis 3 is a true account of the human condition, not a literal event.
    - Sin is described as **rebellion** against God, a reality experienced by all.
    - The narrative form conveys the **universality** of sin and alienation.
    - Brunner emphasizes the existential relevance of the **Fall** for every person.
    - "The Fall is not a historical event in the ordinary sense, but the story of every man." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Authority of Scripture**
    - Scripture is authoritative as the **Word of God** in its witness to Christ and revelation.
    - The authority is not tied to literal historicity but to the **truth** it communicates.
    - Brunner rejects both fundamentalism and liberalism regarding biblical authority.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the encounter with God through Scripture.
    - "The authority of the Bible lies in its power to bring us face to face with God." (Truth as Encounter)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** shaped twentieth-century discussions on the relationship between **science and theology**, especially within neo-orthodox circles. His insistence on the distinctiveness of **revelation** and the non-competitive nature of science and faith influenced later theologians grappling with the challenges of modernity. While his concept of **revelatory myth** has been both influential and controversial, it remains a significant contribution to the ongoing dialogue about the interpretation of Scripture in the age of science.
