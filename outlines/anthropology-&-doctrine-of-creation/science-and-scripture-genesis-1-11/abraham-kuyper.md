# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **Genesis 1–11** with a commitment to the **sovereignty of God** over all spheres, including both **science** and **Scripture**. He insisted on the **infallibility of Scripture** while affirming the legitimacy of scientific inquiry, provided it operated within a **Reformed worldview** that acknowledged the effects of **common grace** and the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief.

- "Scripture is not a manual for natural science, but it is the Word of God, and as such, it speaks the truth in all that it affirms." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Key Works

- Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology (1894)
- "Common Grace" (Collected Articles, De Heraut)
- Pro Rege (1911–1912)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Absolute Authority**
    - Scripture is the final authority in all matters it addresses, including origins.
    - The **infallibility** of the Bible is non-negotiable for Christian theology.
    - Genesis 1–11 is to be received as true history, though its genre and intent must be respected.
    - Any scientific theory must be subordinate to the clear teaching of Scripture.
    - "The authority of Scripture is absolute, and its testimony concerning creation is not to be set aside by human speculation." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

2. **Legitimacy of Science under Divine Sovereignty**
    - Science is a valid enterprise under God’s providence.
    - The pursuit of scientific knowledge is a form of obedience to the **cultural mandate**.
    - Scientific findings must be interpreted within a theistic framework.
    - There is no ultimate conflict between true science and true exegesis.
    - "Science, too, is a gift of God, but it must never usurp the place of revelation." (Lectures on Calvinism)

3. **Common Grace and the Antithesis**
    - **Common grace** allows for genuine knowledge among unbelievers, including in science.
    - The **antithesis** means that worldviews shape interpretation of both Scripture and nature.
    - Believers and unbelievers approach Genesis 1–11 with fundamentally different presuppositions.
    - Common grace restrains the effects of sin, making scientific progress possible.
    - "The antithesis runs through all of life, including the interpretation of both Scripture and nature." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Accommodation and Genre Sensitivity**
    - God accommodates His revelation to human capacity in Genesis 1–11.
    - The text uses phenomenological language, not modern scientific terminology.
    - Genre analysis is necessary to avoid misreading the text’s intent.
    - The purpose of Genesis 1–11 is theological and covenantal, not scientific.
    - "The Holy Spirit did not intend to teach us astronomy or geology, but to reveal to us the glory of God in creation." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

5. **Integration without Synthesis**
    - Theology and science must remain distinct but dialogical disciplines.
    - Attempts to synthesize Scripture with prevailing scientific theories risk compromising biblical authority.
    - Christians should engage science critically, affirming what is true and rejecting what contradicts revelation.
    - The Reformed worldview provides the only stable foundation for integrating faith and science.
    - "We must not force Scripture into the mold of science, nor science into the mold of Scripture, but honor both as distinct gifts of God." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s approach to **science and Scripture** in Genesis 1–11 shaped the **Neo-Calvinist** tradition, emphasizing the compatibility of robust biblical faith with scientific engagement. His doctrines of **common grace** and the **antithesis** continue to influence Reformed discussions on origins, hermeneutics, and the relationship between faith and reason. Kuyper’s insistence on the **absolute authority of Scripture** alongside a principled openness to scientific inquiry remains a hallmark of Reformed engagement with modern science.
