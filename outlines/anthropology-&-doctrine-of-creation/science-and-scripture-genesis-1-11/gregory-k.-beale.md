   - Critiques attempts to subordinate biblical teaching to contemporary scientific paradigms.
   - "The authority of Scripture is not diminished by scientific theories that contradict its claims." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism, p. 246)

2. **Canonical and Intertextual Reading**
   - Reads Genesis 1–11 in light of the entire **biblical canon**.
   - Highlights how New Testament writers interpret early Genesis as **historical** and **theological**.
   - Emphasizes the **intertextual connections** between Genesis and later Scripture, especially regarding **creation** and **new creation**.
   - Argues that the meaning of Genesis is deepened by its use in the rest of the Bible.
   - "The New Testament’s use of Genesis 1–3 demonstrates its ongoing theological significance." (A New Testament Biblical Theology, p. 24)

3. **Theological Primacy of Genesis 1–11**
   - Sees Genesis 1–11 as the **theological foundation** for the entire biblical narrative.
   - Identifies key themes: **creation, fall, judgment, promise, and restoration**.
   - Argues that these chapters set the stage for the **mission of God** and the **eschatological hope**.
   - Maintains that the **image of God** and the concept of **temple** originate in these chapters.

   - Emphasizes the **already/not yet** dynamic rooted in Genesis and developed throughout Scripture.

   - "The movement from Eden to the new creation is a central theme of biblical theology." (God Dwells Among Us, p. 18)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **evangelical biblical theology**, especially regarding the relationship between **Genesis 1–11** and the rest of Scripture. His insistence on the **inerrancy** and **theological coherence** of the Bible has provided a robust framework for engaging with modern scientific questions. Beale’s typological and canonical approach has influenced a generation of scholars and pastors seeking to read Genesis within the whole-Bible storyline. His contributions continue to foster dialogue between **theology, exegesis, and science** in the Reformed tradition.
