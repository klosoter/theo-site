# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards affirm the **divine inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and **clarity** of **Scripture**, holding that **Genesis 1–11** is a true and authoritative account of **creation**, **the fall**, and **early history**. They maintain that Scripture is the supreme standard for interpreting both **natural revelation** and **scientific inquiry**, insisting that all truth claims must be tested by the **Word of God**.

- "The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself." (Westminster Confession of Faith 1.9)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 1, 4, and 6)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 15–29)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 9–19)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on creation and providence)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on reading and preaching Scripture)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is the Supreme Authority**
    - Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
    - All doctrines, including those about creation and history, must be derived from Scripture.
    - Human reason and scientific theories are subordinate to the teaching of the Bible.
    - Apparent conflicts between science and Scripture must be resolved in favor of the biblical text.
    - "The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined... can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture." (WCF 1.10)

2. **Genesis 1–11 as Historical Narrative**
    - The Standards treat Genesis 1–11 as a factual account of real events.
    - Adam and Eve are affirmed as historical individuals, the first humans.
    - The fall, the flood, and genealogies are presented as actual history, not myth or allegory.
    - The narrative forms the theological foundation for doctrines of sin, redemption, and covenant.
    - "Our first parents, being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, sinned..." (WCF 6.1)

3. **Doctrine of Creation ex nihilo**
    - God created the world out of nothing, by the word of His power, in the space of six days.
    - Creation is a free act of God, not a process of natural development.
    - The created order is distinct from God but wholly dependent on Him.
    - The Standards reject any view that undermines the Creator-creature distinction.
    - "It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost... to create, or make of nothing, the world, and all things therein..." (WCF 4.1)

4. **The Fall and Original Sin**
    - The historical fall of Adam brought sin and death into the world.
    - All humanity descends from Adam by ordinary generation and inherits original sin.
    - The doctrine of original sin is grounded in the events of Genesis 3.
    - The need for redemption is rooted in the literal, historical disobedience of Adam and Eve.
    - "By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God..." (WCF 6.2)

5. **Harmony of General and Special Revelation**
    - God reveals Himself both in nature (general revelation) and Scripture (special revelation).
    - General revelation is always subordinate to and interpreted by special revelation.
    - Scientific inquiry is valuable but must never contradict the clear teaching of Scripture.
    - The Standards encourage the study of creation as a means to glorify God, within biblical boundaries.
    - "The light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God..." (WCF 1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the relationship between **science and Scripture**, especially regarding the interpretation of Genesis 1–11. Their insistence on the **primacy of Scripture** has influenced debates on creation, evolution, and biblical authority for centuries. The Standards continue to serve as a touchstone for confessional Reformed churches navigating questions of faith and science, providing a robust framework for upholding the historicity and theological significance of the early chapters of Genesis.
