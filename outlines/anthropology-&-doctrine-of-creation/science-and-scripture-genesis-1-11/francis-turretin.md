# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin approached **Genesis 1–11** with a strong commitment to the **literal-historical interpretation** of Scripture, affirming the **inerrancy** and **clarity** of the biblical text. He defended the **historicity of Adam and Eve**, the **global Flood**, and the **chronological reliability** of the early chapters of Genesis, insisting that these narratives are foundational for **Reformed theology** and the doctrine of **original sin**.

- "The history of the creation is not to be allegorized, but to be received as a true and real history." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.9.8)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Disputations 5–9)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Creation and the Fall (in Institutes)
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal-Historical Interpretation of Genesis**
    - Genesis 1–11 is to be read as a **true historical account**, not as myth or allegory.
    - The days of creation are six **literal, consecutive days**.
    - The genealogies and events are chronologically and factually reliable.
    - Rejects attempts to harmonize Genesis with speculative philosophy or non-biblical science.
    - "The history of the creation is not to be allegorized, but to be received as a true and real history." (Institutes, 5.9.8)

2. **Doctrine of Creation ex nihilo**
    - God created all things out of nothing by his **sovereign will**.
    - Creation is distinct from God, opposing any form of **emanation** or **pantheism**.
    - The order and structure of creation reflect divine wisdom and purpose.
    - The act of creation is completed and not ongoing.
    - "God created the world not from any pre-existing matter, but from nothing, by the word of his power." (Institutes, 5.1.3)

3. **Historicity of Adam and Original Sin**
    - Adam and Eve were real, historical individuals.
    - The **Fall** is a historical event with universal consequences for humanity.
    - The doctrine of **original sin** depends on the historicity of Genesis 3.
    - Denies any figurative or symbolic reading that undermines the federal headship of Adam.
    - "If Adam did not exist, or did not fall, the whole doctrine of original sin and redemption falls to the ground." (Institutes, 8.2.6)

4. **Authority and Inerrancy of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the **supreme authority** in all matters of faith and practice, including origins.
    - The biblical account is without error in all it affirms, including history and science.
    - Human reason and science must be subordinate to the clear teaching of Scripture.
    - Apparent conflicts between science and Scripture arise from misinterpretation, not error in the text.
    - "The Scriptures are the infallible rule of faith, and cannot deceive or be deceived." (Institutes, 1.6.4)

5. **Rejection of Accommodation to Secular Science**
    - Opposes attempts to reinterpret Genesis to fit contemporary scientific theories.
    - Maintains that the **Flood** was global and catastrophic, not local or mythical.
    - Asserts that the chronology of Genesis is reliable and not to be extended indefinitely.
    - Science is valuable but must not override the **plain sense** of Scripture.
    - "We must not twist the sacred text to fit the opinions of philosophers, but rather judge all things by the Word of God." (Institutes, 5.9.12)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust defense of the **literal-historical reading** of Genesis 1–11 shaped subsequent **Reformed orthodoxy** and provided a bulwark against both rationalist and allegorical interpretations. His insistence on the **inerrancy** and **clarity** of Scripture continues to influence conservative Reformed approaches to the relationship between science and the Bible. Turretin’s work remains a key reference point for debates on **creation, the Fall, and the authority of Scripture** in the modern era.
