# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **Genesis 1–11** by emphasizing the **absolute authority of Scripture** and the necessity of a **presuppositional apologetic** when engaging with **science**. He insisted that all human reasoning, including scientific inquiry, must be subordinated to the **self-attesting revelation of God**, and he rejected any attempt to interpret **creation**, **fall**, or **flood** accounts apart from a consistently **Reformed doctrine of revelation**.

- "It is only upon the presupposition of the truth of what is taught in Genesis 1–11 that any fact can be truly known or interpreted." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- Christian Apologetics

- The Doctrine of Scripture (essays and lectures)
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Self-Attesting Authority**
    - Scripture is the ultimate standard for all knowledge, including scientific claims.
    - The authority of Genesis 1–11 is not subject to external validation by science.
    - The self-authenticating nature of revelation demands submission of all disciplines to God's Word.
    - Attempts to judge Scripture by autonomous reason are fundamentally flawed.
    - "The Bible, as the Word of God, must be accepted on its own authority." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - All reasoning operates from foundational presuppositions, either for or against God.
    - Christian apologetics must challenge the unbeliever’s autonomous assumptions.
    - Genesis 1–11 provides the only coherent foundation for science and rationality.
    - Neutrality in science or exegesis is impossible; all thought is covenantal.
    - "There is no such thing as a brute fact; all facts are interpreted facts." (Christian Apologetics)

3. **Historical Adam and Events**
    - The historicity of Adam, the Fall, and the Flood is essential to Christian doctrine.
    - Denial of Genesis 1–11 as history undermines the gospel and the doctrine of sin.
    - The unity of redemptive history depends on the reality of early Genesis events.
    - Attempts to mythologize these chapters reflect non-Christian presuppositions.
    - "If Adam is not a historical individual, the whole of the Christian system is undermined." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Antithesis Between Christian and Non-Christian Thought**
    - There is a fundamental antithesis between biblical and secular interpretations of origins.
    - Non-Christian science suppresses the truth revealed in Genesis 1–11.
    - Only regeneration enables true understanding of creation and history.
    - The Christian worldview alone provides the preconditions for intelligible science.
    - "The antithesis between the regenerate and the unregenerate mind is basic to all interpretation." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Doctrine of Revelation and Interpretation**
    - God’s revelation in Scripture is clear, sufficient, and necessary for understanding origins.
    - General revelation and special revelation are harmonious, but Scripture interprets nature.
    - Scientific theories must be critiqued and corrected by biblical teaching.
    - The clarity of Genesis 1–11 is not diminished by modern scientific challenges.
    - "Special revelation must interpret general revelation, not the other way around." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has profoundly shaped **Reformed apologetics**, especially in its insistence on the **primacy of Scripture** over all human reasoning, including science. His presuppositional method has influenced generations of theologians and apologists to defend the historicity and authority of the early chapters of Genesis. While his views have been critiqued for their perceived intransigence toward scientific consensus, Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the relationship between faith and science within confessional Reformed circles.
