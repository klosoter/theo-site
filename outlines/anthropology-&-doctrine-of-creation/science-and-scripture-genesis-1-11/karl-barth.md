# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached **Genesis 1–11** as a unique form of **saga** rather than straightforward historical or scientific account, emphasizing the **theological message** over literal chronology. He insisted that **Scripture** is the witness to **God’s revelation** in Christ, and that its authority is not contingent on scientific concordism but on its function as the Word of God.

- "The creation stories are not reports but proclamations; they do not describe what happened but what must be said." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genesis 1–11 as Saga, Not History**
    - Barth viewed these chapters as **saga**—a literary form conveying theological truth, not scientific or historical data.
    - He argued that their purpose is to witness to **God’s creative action** and relationship with humanity.
    - The text’s value lies in its **theological proclamation**, not in its factual correspondence to scientific accounts.
    - Barth rejected both fundamentalist literalism and liberal demythologization.
    - "We have to do here with saga in the strictest sense, not with history or nature." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

2. **Revelation over Scientific Concordism**
    - Barth insisted that **revelation** is the primary content of Scripture, not scientific information.
    - He maintained that the Bible’s authority is rooted in its witness to **Jesus Christ**.
    - Scientific theories and biblical texts operate in distinct domains and should not be conflated.
    - Theological interpretation must not be subordinated to contemporary scientific paradigms.
    - "The Bible is not a book of nature or of natural science, but a book of God and of man." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

3. **Doctrine of the Word of God**
    - Scripture is the **Word of God** in its function as witness, not in its material form alone.
    - The authority of Genesis 1–11 is derived from its role in the **self-revelation of God**.
    - The text becomes the Word of God as it is encountered in faith and proclamation.
    - Barth distinguished between the **written word**, the **proclaimed word**, and the **revealed Word**.
    - "The Bible becomes God’s Word as God speaks through it." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

4. **Christocentric Interpretation**
    - Barth read all of Scripture, including Genesis 1–11, through the lens of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The meaning of creation and fall is ultimately disclosed in the light of Christ’s person and work.
    - Genesis 1–11 points forward to the **reconciliation** accomplished in Christ.
    - The **unity of Scripture** is found in its witness to Christ, not in uniform literary genre or historical method.
    - "Jesus Christ is the secret of the creation and its beginning." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

5. **Humanity and the Image of God**
    - Barth emphasized the **relational nature** of humanity as created in the **image of God**.
    - Genesis 1–11 reveals the dignity and responsibility of humanity before God.
    - The fall narrative is interpreted as a theological account of **human alienation** and **grace**.
    - The text’s anthropological insights are more significant than its cosmological details.
    - "Man is the creature whom God has chosen and loved from all eternity." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** profoundly shaped modern theological engagement with **science and Scripture**, steering the conversation away from literalism and scientific concordism toward a focus on **theological meaning** and **revelation**. His insistence on the **Christocentric** and revelatory character of Scripture has influenced generations of theologians, especially within the neo-orthodox tradition. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about biblical authority, hermeneutics, and the relationship between faith and science.
