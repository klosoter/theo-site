# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg addressed the relationship between **science and Scripture**—especially in **Genesis 1–11**—by emphasizing the historical and provisional character of theological claims. He argued that **revelation** is discerned within the unfolding of **universal history**, allowing for a critical and constructive dialogue between **scientific cosmology** and the biblical narrative. Pannenberg maintained that the **doctrine of creation** must remain intellectually responsible in light of modern scientific knowledge, while still affirming the theological significance of the biblical witness.

- "The biblical doctrine of creation is not in competition with scientific explanations, but rather provides the ultimate ground of all reality." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation in Universal History**
    - Revelation is disclosed through the totality of **history**, not isolated to miraculous events.
    - Genesis 1–11 is interpreted as a theological account embedded within the broader sweep of human history.
    - The meaning of **creation** is accessible to all, not just the faith community.
    - Scientific insights into origins are seen as opportunities for theological reflection.
    "Revelation is not a supernatural communication isolated from the world, but the disclosure of God in the history of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Compatibility of Creation and Scientific Cosmology**
    - The biblical doctrine of creation addresses the ultimate origin and dependence of all things on God.
    - Scientific accounts (e.g., Big Bang, evolution) explain processes, not ultimate causes.
    - Genesis 1–11 should not be read as literal scientific history but as theological proclamation.
    - Theological and scientific explanations are complementary, not mutually exclusive.
    "The doctrine of creation is not a rival to scientific cosmology, but its presupposition." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

3. **Provisionality of Theological Statements**
    - All theological claims, including those about creation, are open to revision in light of new knowledge.
    - The church must engage with contemporary science to maintain intellectual credibility.
    - Genesis 1–11 provides foundational meaning, but its interpretation must remain open.
    - Theological truth is eschatological, awaiting final confirmation in the future.
    "Theology must always be open to correction and deepening through the advance of knowledge." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Anthropology and the Image of God**
    - The **imago Dei** is not a static attribute but a dynamic destiny within history.
    - Human uniqueness is affirmed, but evolutionary accounts can be integrated into theological anthropology.
    - Genesis 1–11’s portrayal of humanity is symbolic of the human vocation in creation.
    - Theological anthropology must account for both scientific findings and biblical witness.
    "The image of God is not a fixed possession but a task and destiny for humanity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Creation**
    - Creation is oriented toward its fulfillment in the future, not merely its origin in the past.
    - Genesis 1–11 points forward to the consummation of history in Christ.
    - Scientific accounts of cosmic development can be seen as part of God’s unfolding purpose.
    - The meaning of creation is ultimately revealed in the **eschaton**.
    "The beginning and end of the world belong together in the unity of God’s creative purpose." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **science and Scripture** has shaped contemporary theology’s engagement with scientific cosmology, especially regarding **Genesis 1–11**. His insistence on the **public and historical character of revelation** encouraged theologians to move beyond literalist readings and to seek constructive dialogue with the sciences. Pannenberg’s work remains influential among those advocating for a theology that is both intellectually credible and faithful to the biblical witness. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between **creation, history, and scientific knowledge**.
