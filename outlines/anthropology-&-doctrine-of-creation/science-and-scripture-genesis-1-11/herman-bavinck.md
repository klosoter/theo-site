# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached **Genesis 1–11** as both foundational to **Christian doctrine** and as a text requiring careful engagement with the findings of **modern science**. He affirmed the **historicity** and **theological significance** of these chapters, while also recognizing the need for nuanced interpretation that respects both **special revelation** and **general revelation**. Bavinck sought to uphold the authority of **Scripture** without dismissing legitimate scientific inquiry.

- "Scripture and nature, the book of God’s words and the book of God’s works, cannot be in conflict." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- In the Beginning: Foundations of Creation Theology (translated selections)
- "Evolution" (article in The Princeton Theological Review, 1901)
- Philosophy of Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture as Authoritative and Sufficient**
    - Scripture is the ultimate norm for faith and life, including matters of origins.
    - Genesis 1–11 provides a true account of creation, fall, and early history.
    - The authority of Scripture is not undermined by scientific theories.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture pertains to its purpose, not exhaustive scientific detail.
    - "Holy Scripture is the foundation and norm of all theological knowledge." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.82)

2. **Organic Inspiration and Accommodation**
    - Inspiration is organic, respecting the human authors’ context and language.
    - God accommodates revelation to human understanding without error.
    - Genesis 1–11 uses literary forms suitable for its ancient audience.
    - The text conveys real history through divinely accommodated means.
    - "The Holy Spirit adapts himself to the level of those to whom he speaks." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.430)

3. **Unity of General and Special Revelation**
    - God reveals himself in both nature (general revelation) and Scripture (special revelation).
    - There is no ultimate conflict between true science and true exegesis.
    - Scientific discoveries must be interpreted in light of biblical revelation.
    - Both revelations are coherent, as they come from the same divine source.
    - "Faith in God’s revelation in nature and Scripture is the foundation of all true science." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1.311)

4. **Historical Adam and Universal Sin**
    - Adam is a real, historical individual, not a myth or symbol.
    - The fall in Genesis 3 is an actual event with universal consequences.
    - The doctrine of original sin depends on the historicity of Adam and early Genesis.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the gospel’s coherence.
    - "The whole of Scripture proceeds from the unity of the human race in Adam." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.28)

5. **Critical Engagement with Science**
    - Scientific theories (e.g., evolution) must be critically evaluated, not uncritically accepted or rejected.
    - Bavinck distinguished between empirical findings and philosophical naturalism.
    - He allowed for some flexibility in interpreting the days of creation.
    - Theological truths remain non-negotiable even as scientific models change.
    - "The Christian faith is not hostile to science, but it does demand that science recognize its own limits." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.495)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s approach to **Genesis 1–11** has shaped Reformed engagement with the relationship between **science and Scripture**, emphasizing both the integrity of biblical revelation and the legitimacy of scientific inquiry. His insistence on the **unity of general and special revelation** continues to influence contemporary discussions on origins, creation, and hermeneutics. Bavinck’s careful balance between theological fidelity and intellectual openness remains a model for evangelical and Reformed theologians navigating questions of faith and science.
