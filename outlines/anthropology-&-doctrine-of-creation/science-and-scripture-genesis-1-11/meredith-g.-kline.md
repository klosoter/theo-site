# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached **Genesis 1–11** with a distinctive **framework interpretation**, emphasizing the **covenantal structure** and **literary framework** of the early chapters of Scripture. He argued that these chapters are not intended as a literal, chronological account of **cosmic and human origins**, but rather as a **theological prologue** that sets the stage for the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The Bible is not a textbook on science, but a book of redemptive revelation." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Key Works

- The Structure of Biblical Authority (1972)
- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview (2000)
- "Because It Had Not Rained" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1958)
- "Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony" (Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, 1996)
- Images of the Spirit (1980)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Framework Interpretation of Genesis 1**
   - Genesis 1 is structured as a literary framework, not a sequential, literal chronology.
   - The six days are arranged in two parallel triads, highlighting **theological motifs** rather than scientific sequence.
   - The focus is on God’s sovereignty and covenantal lordship over creation.
   - This view allows for compatibility with scientific accounts of origins.
   - "The creation week is a literary structure, not a literal chronology." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Structure of Early Genesis**
   - Genesis 1–11 establishes the foundational **covenant** relationship between God and humanity.
   - The narrative sets up the categories of **blessing, curse, and promise** that shape redemptive history.
   - The Adamic administration is presented as a covenantal arrangement, not merely a historical episode.
   - The flood and Babel narratives are interpreted through the lens of covenantal judgment and grace.
   - "The covenant is the backbone of the biblical worldview." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Distinction Between Science and Scripture**
   - Scripture and science address different kinds of questions: **theological** versus **empirical**.
   - Genesis 1–11 communicates theological truths, not scientific data or mechanisms.
   - The Bible’s authority is not compromised by non-literal readings of early Genesis.
   - Christians are free to engage with scientific theories without undermining biblical faith.
   - "The Bible is not a scientific textbook but a revelation of God’s redemptive purpose." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

4. **Polemic Against Pagan Cosmologies**
   - Genesis 1–11 is written in conscious contrast to ancient Near Eastern myths.
   - The text affirms **monotheism**, divine sovereignty, and the goodness of creation.
   - The structure and content of Genesis serve to demythologize pagan worldviews.
   - The narrative’s literary features are intentionally crafted to correct false cosmologies.
   - "Genesis is a polemic against the mythological cosmologies of the ancient world." ("Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony")

5. **Theological Primacy of Redemptive History**
   - The main purpose of Genesis 1–11 is to introduce the **redemptive storyline** of Scripture.
   - Adam’s role is foundational for understanding **sin, judgment, and promise**.
   - The early chapters set the stage for the Abrahamic covenant and the unfolding of salvation.
   - The text’s theological message takes precedence over questions of scientific detail.
   - "Genesis 1–11 is the theological prologue to the history of redemption." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s **framework interpretation** has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions on the relationship between **science and Scripture**, especially regarding Genesis 1–11. His work provided a robust theological rationale for reading these chapters as literary and covenantal rather than strictly historical or scientific. Kline’s influence is evident in contemporary debates over creation, evolution, and biblical authority, offering a mediating position that upholds the integrity of both Scripture and scientific inquiry. His covenantal insights continue to inform evangelical hermeneutics and the doctrine of creation.
