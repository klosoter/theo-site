# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg’s **eschatological anthropology** centers on the conviction that human identity and destiny are fundamentally shaped by the **future consummation** of history in God. He argues that the meaning of **human personhood**, **imago Dei**, and **resurrection** can only be fully understood in light of the **eschaton**, where humanity’s relationship to God and creation is finally revealed and completed. For Pannenberg, the future is not merely an endpoint but the decisive horizon that retroactively defines the essence of humanity.

- "Man is what he is from his future, from his end, and not from his beginning." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (1994)

- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. Rendtorff et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Identity Defined by the Eschaton**
   - Human beings are constituted by their orientation toward the **future fulfillment** in God.
   - The **eschaton** is the decisive moment that retroactively determines human essence.
   - Anthropology cannot be separated from **eschatology**; the meaning of humanity is only clear in light of the end.
   - The **resurrection** is the paradigm of true human existence, realized in Christ and promised to all.
   - "The true being of man is determined from the future, from the end that God has promised." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

2. **Imago Dei as Dynamic and Eschatological**
   - The **image of God** is not a static possession but a destiny to be realized in communion with God.
   - Human beings are created with an openness to the future, reflecting God’s own openness.
   - The fullness of the **imago Dei** is only achieved in the eschatological consummation.
   - Christ is the definitive revelation of the **image of God**, embodying humanity’s future.
   - "The image of God in man is not a finished state but a task and destiny." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Resurrection as the Fulfillment of Humanity**
   - The **resurrection of the dead** is central to Pannenberg’s anthropology.
   - Resurrection is not merely individual survival but the transformation of human existence.
   - The future resurrection grounds hope for the restoration of **bodily and communal life**.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the proleptic realization of humanity’s eschatological destiny.
   - "The resurrection of Jesus is the anticipation of the future of all men." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **History and Personhood Oriented to the Future**
   - Human beings are historical creatures whose identity unfolds in relation to the **future**.
   - The meaning of history is given from its **eschatological** goal, not from its origins.
   - Personal identity is shaped by anticipation and hope for the **kingdom of God**.
   - The openness of the future is essential to authentic human freedom and responsibility.
   - "History receives its meaning from the future, not from the past." (Theology and the Kingdom of God)

5. **Community and Universality in Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - Human destiny is inherently **communal**; the eschaton involves the reconciliation of all humanity.
   - The **kingdom of God** is the universal horizon in which individual and communal identities are fulfilled.
   - Anthropology must account for the social and cosmic dimensions of human existence.
   - The final consummation is the realization of true community in God’s presence.
   - "The destiny of the individual is inseparable from the destiny of all mankind." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s **eschatological anthropology** has profoundly influenced contemporary theology by insisting that the meaning of humanity is inseparable from the future consummation in Christ. His integration of **resurrection**, **imago Dei**, and the **kingdom of God** into a unified vision of human destiny has shaped both systematic and philosophical anthropology. Pannenberg’s work continues to challenge theologians to ground their understanding of personhood and community in the horizon of God’s promised future.
