# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached **eschatological anthropology** through the lens of classic **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the continuity of human nature, the resurrection of the body, and the final state of humanity in relation to **original sin**, **union with Christ**, and the **consummation** of redemption. He insisted that the destiny of humanity is inseparable from the doctrines of **imago Dei**, the **fall**, and the **future resurrection**, all culminating in the restoration and glorification of the redeemed.

- "The resurrection of the body is necessary to the consummation of the work of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity Created in the Image of God**
   - Humanity’s original state reflects the **imago Dei**, including rationality, morality, and immortality.
   - The image is marred but not destroyed by the **fall**.
   - Restoration of the image is central to eschatological hope.
   - The final state involves the perfect realization of the image in Christ.
   - "Man, even in his fallen state, retains the essential attributes of his nature as a rational, moral, and immortal being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **The Doctrine of Original Sin and Its Eschatological Consequences**
   - The fall brought **spiritual death** and corruption to all humanity.
   - Eschatological anthropology must account for both the curse and its removal in Christ.
   - The resurrection reverses the effects of original sin for the elect.
   - The final judgment confirms the consequences of sin for the reprobate.
   - "The consequences of Adam’s sin are removed only in Christ, and fully only in the resurrection." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
   - The resurrection is essential for the completion of redemption.
   - The same body that dies will be raised, transformed, and glorified.
   - Bodily resurrection affirms the goodness of creation and the unity of body and soul.
   - The resurrection is grounded in the resurrection of Christ as the firstfruits.
   - "The resurrection of Christ is the pledge and the pattern of the resurrection of his people." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Union with Christ and the Consummation of Redemption**
   - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection.
   - This union guarantees participation in Christ’s glorified humanity.
   - The consummation involves the full realization of sanctification and glorification.
   - Eschatological anthropology is Christocentric and covenantal.
   - "Our life is hid with Christ in God, and when he shall appear, we shall appear with him in glory." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Final State: Heaven and Hell**
   - The redeemed will experience eternal communion with God in a glorified state.
   - The wicked face eternal separation and punishment, confirming the seriousness of sin.
   - The final state is both physical and spiritual, involving the whole person.
   - The justice and mercy of God are displayed in the destinies of all humanity.
   - "The Scriptures teach that the future state of men is unchangeable and eternal." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s **eschatological anthropology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians by grounding human destiny in the doctrines of **creation**, **fall**, and **redemption**. His emphasis on the resurrection and the unity of body and soul influenced later systematic treatments of the human person and the final state. Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of the **image of God**, original sin, and the consummation of salvation in Christ. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to a holistic, biblically grounded vision of humanity’s eschatological hope.
