# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s eschatological anthropology centers on the radical impact of **sin**, the necessity of **justification by faith**, and the ultimate **resurrection of the body**. He views human beings as fundamentally shaped by their relationship to God, with **eschatological hope** grounded in Christ’s redemptive work and the promise of **new creation**. For Luther, anthropology cannot be separated from the drama of **law and gospel**, nor from the believer’s anticipation of final **consummation**.

- "We must know that we are justified by faith alone, and yet we await the resurrection of the body and life everlasting." (Large Catechism)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- The Freedom of a Christian
- Commentary on Galatians
- The Large Catechism
- Sermons on 1 Corinthians 15

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as simul iustus et peccator**
    - Humans are simultaneously **righteous** and **sinners** in this age.
    - This dual status persists until the final resurrection.
    - The believer’s identity is eschatologically oriented, awaiting full transformation.
    - Justification is a present reality, but sanctification is not yet complete.
    - "For in this life, even the saints are always sinners." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Eschatological hope in bodily resurrection**
    - The resurrection of the body is central to Christian hope.
    - The soul does not attain its final blessedness apart from the body.
    - Luther rejects notions of disembodied immortality as unbiblical.
    - The whole person—body and soul—will be restored in the new creation.
    - "I shall arise again, and with my own eyes I shall see God." (Sermons on 1 Corinthians 15)

3. **Anthropology shaped by law and gospel**
    - The law reveals human sinfulness and mortality.
    - The gospel proclaims forgiveness and new life in Christ.
    - Human identity is defined by response to these two words from God.
    - Eschatological anthropology is grounded in the transition from condemnation to promise.
    - "The Law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. Grace says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **Union with Christ as the ground of eschatological renewal**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, sharing in his death and resurrection.
    - This union is both a present reality and a future hope.
    - The transformation of the believer is inaugurated now, consummated at Christ’s return.
    - Eschatological anthropology is Christocentric and participatory.
    - "Through faith in Christ, we become new creatures, though not yet perfect." (The Freedom of a Christian)

5. **The intermediate state and the ‘sleep’ of the soul**
    - Luther often described the dead as ‘sleeping’ until the resurrection.
    - He rejected speculative views about the soul’s conscious activity between death and resurrection.
    - The focus is on the certainty of resurrection, not the details of the intermediate state.
    - This view underscores the unity of the person and the priority of eschatological fulfillment.
    - "We should learn to console ourselves with the thought that we shall sleep until He comes and knocks on the little grave and says, 'Dr. Martin, get up!'" (Table Talk)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s eschatological anthropology profoundly shaped **Protestant understandings of human nature**, emphasizing the tension between present justification and future glorification. His focus on the **resurrection of the body** and the unity of body and soul influenced later Lutheran and Reformed thought. By rooting anthropology in the drama of **law and gospel** and the hope of new creation, Luther provided a robust framework for understanding human destiny in light of Christ’s redemptive work. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of the intermediate state and the meaning of Christian hope.
