# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **eschatological anthropology** by emphasizing the dynamic relationship between **human nature**, **sin**, and the **consummation** of redemption in Christ. He rejected speculative dualisms and instead rooted human destiny in the biblical narrative of **creation, fall, and restoration**, highlighting the significance of the **resurrection** and the **new creation** for understanding the future of humanity.

- "Eschatology is not a separate doctrine but the perspective from which all theology must be viewed." (The Return of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Return of Christ (De wederkomst van Christus)
- Man: The Image of God (De mens het beeld Gods)
- Sin (De zonde)
- Faith and Perseverance (Geloof en volharding)
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as the Fulfillment of Anthropology**
   - Human destiny is inseparable from the **eschatological consummation** in Christ.
   - Anthropology must be understood in light of **God’s redemptive purpose**.
   - The resurrection is central to the future of human existence.
   - Eschatology provides the horizon for understanding the meaning of being human.
   - "The meaning of man is not exhausted in the present but is oriented toward the future in Christ." (Man: The Image of God)

2. **Unity of Body and Soul**
   - Rejects Greek dualism in favor of a holistic biblical view.
   - The human person is a psychosomatic unity, destined for resurrection.
   - The hope of the believer is not disembodied immortality but **bodily resurrection**.
   - The final state involves the restoration of the whole person.
   - "Scripture does not speak of the immortality of the soul, but of the resurrection of the dead." (The Return of Christ)

3. **Sin and Eschatological Restoration**
   - Sin distorts but does not destroy the image of God in humanity.
   - Eschatological hope is grounded in the **victory of Christ** over sin and death.
   - Restoration involves both forgiveness and renewal of human nature.
   - The consummation will reveal the true meaning of humanity in Christ.
   - "The eschatological perspective is the perspective of restoration, not annihilation." (Sin)

4. **Corporate and Cosmic Dimensions**
   - Eschatological anthropology is not individualistic but communal.
   - The destiny of humanity is tied to the **renewal of creation**.
   - The church is the firstfruits of the new humanity.
   - Final redemption includes both people and the cosmos.
   - "The new man is not an isolated individual, but a member of the new humanity in Christ." (The Return of Christ)

5. **Christocentric Orientation**
   - Christ is the true image of God and the pattern for redeemed humanity.
   - All eschatological hope is centered on union with Christ.
   - The resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of the believer’s future.
   - Anthropology finds its fulfillment in conformity to Christ’s glorified humanity.
   - "In Christ, the future of man is secured and revealed." (Man: The Image of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s **eschatological anthropology** has shaped Reformed theology by integrating **eschatology** into the heart of doctrinal reflection on humanity. His rejection of dualism and emphasis on the resurrection have influenced contemporary discussions on the **image of God** and the destiny of creation. Berkouwer’s work continues to challenge theologians to view human nature and destiny through the lens of Christ’s redemptive work and the promise of the new creation.
