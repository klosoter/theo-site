### ESSAY
Eschatological anthropology asks what a human being finally is when God finishes with us. It studies human nature and destiny not by abstract speculation but by reading creation through consummation, the image through its telos. The claim defended here is that the human telos is the beatific vision within the resurrected life of the new creation, given through union with the risen Christ and the indwelling Spirit, such that the whole human person, body and soul, participates by grace in the life of God without confusion of natures. This teleology sets the grammar for the body–soul relation, personal identity, the intermediate state, the nature–grace relation, and the shape of sanctification. It resists both gnostic spiritualization of salvation and modern reduction of personhood to the brain. It is not a detachable appendix to soteriology but the horizon in which **federal theology**, Christology, and ecclesiology find coherence.

The decisive patristic voice against the perennial temptation to disincarnate salvation is Irenaeus. In the second century he reframed Christian anthropology by confronting Gnosticism and its contempt for material creation. In his theology of recapitulation, the eternal Son becomes what we are to renew what Adam disordered, gathering up humanity and history into himself so that the end answers to the beginning. This has two anthropological effects. First, the **resurrection of the flesh** is non-negotiable. Salvation is not flight from embodiment but the transformation of the body by the Spirit’s vivifying power. Second, the telos is seeing and enjoying God in an embodied mode. Irenaeus’s aphorism that the glory of God is a living human, and the life of the human is the vision of God, places the beatific vision inside the economy of redemption and the renewed creation. For Irenaeus the difference between now and then is not a shift from bodily to disembodied spirituality but the quickening of fleshly life by the Spirit so that creaturely seeing becomes participatory communion. His insistence on the continuity of identity, the goodness of matter, and the visibility of God in the face of Christ became the patristic platform on which subsequent eschatological anthropology stands. When examiners ask whether the vision of God requires abandoning embodiment, the Irenaean answer is categorical: vision is intensified, not de-materialized, and occurs in and through the risen body, which is the perfected instrument of communion.

Augustine consolidates this trajectory by giving eschatological anthropology its metaphysic of desire and its civic horizon. In Confessions and City of God he interprets human nature by ordered love directed to God as the supreme good and by the pilgrimage of the two cities. The end for which we are made is rest in God, a rest that is not mere cessation but active delight arising from the right ordering of love. Augustine’s insistence that nothing short of God can satisfy the heart shows why eschatology is intrinsic to anthropology. The beatific vision crowns beatitude because only in seeing God as he is does desire come to rest and charity burn without impediment. Yet Augustine is equally firm that the telos includes the **resurrection of the flesh** with identifiable continuity. He rejects Platonist disdain for the body, arguing that God created and redeems corporeity, and that the resurrection body will be free of corruption and rightly ordered to the soul. In City of God he develops a consistent account of the risen body as spiritual not by loss of materiality but by the Spirit’s perfect dominion. He also affirms a conscious intermediate state in which the soul, separated from the body contrary to its natural union, is with Christ awaiting resurrection. Two Augustinian moves matter for contemporary examination. First, the priority of love and vision binds ethics to eschatology. Second, the distinction yet tight relation between soul and body safeguards identity through death while insisting that the soul apart from the body is in an abnormal state that only resurrection heals. If pressed that Augustine smuggles in Platonism, the response is that his ontology is not escapist but teleological. The body is not a prison; disembodiment is the prison, and liberation is resurrection into the glory of God.

If Augustine furnishes the grammar of desire and love, Thomas Aquinas articulates the metaphysics of the telos with analytic precision. In the Summa Theologiae he argues that perfect happiness lies only in the immediate vision of the essence of God. This is not a negation of **analogical knowledge** but its eschatological flowering by the infusion of the light of glory. The distance between Creator and creature remains infinite; the vision is a created participation, not an ontological absorption. That is why **divine simplicity** is not compromised but displayed in the beatific vision, since the one simple God is known directly without the mediation of created species, and the intellect is elevated to receive what surpasses its natural capacity. Aquinas likewise defends a hylomorphic human nature, in which soul and body form a single substance, and thus insists that the natural state of the human is ensouled corporeity. The intermediate state is therefore provisional and imperfect, however blessed, and the consummation requires bodily resurrection. He develops a theology of the glorified body’s properties that clarifies how embodiment is perfected: clarity, agility, impassibility, and subtlety name modes of Spirit-ruled corporeity. Aquinas situates all this within a nature–grace relation where grace heals and perfects nature. The Reformed fear that this yields a two-tiered anthropology that could marginalize the eschatological orientation of creation must be engaged. The best Thomistic reading shows that nature’s perfection is from the start oriented to a supernatural end granted by grace, which means eschatology is baked into creational teleology. When examiners ask whether immediate vision of the divine essence collapses Creator–creature distinction, the Thomistic answer is clear: the vision is participation by likeness in a created act of knowing, such that God remains simple and the knower remains a creature. Properly received, this offers a grammar by which to affirm the beatific vision as the capstone of human destiny without violating classical theism.

Calvin receives the patristic and medieval bequest and reframes it in explicitly christological and covenantal terms. His anthropology is organized by union with Christ and the duplex grace of justification and sanctification that flows from this union. Thus eschatological anthropology is inseparable from Christology. The risen Christ is the firstfruits and pattern of our resurrection, and by the Spirit we are conformed to him now in mortification and vivification, and finally in glory. Calvin’s Psychopannychia defends a conscious intermediate state against soul sleep and binds the hope of the believer to presence with Christ pending the final resurrection. His caution against speculation insists that Scripture govern our affirmations and that the resurrection body will be the same numerically, though glorified. In the Supper believers receive a pledge and foretaste of that glory and participate spiritually in the risen Christ. Calvin does not reject the beatific vision; he reframes it as beholding the glory of God in the face of Christ, now by faith and then by sight. If challenged whether this is an evasion, the response is that it is a purification. Vision is not abstract intuition of an essence detached from the mediator but immediate knowledge of the triune God in and through the glorified Christ whose humanity remains the instrument of our communion with God.

Geerhardus Vos reorients the entire discussion by showing that eschatology is not an afterthought to anthropology but its inherent drive from the beginning. In his Pauline eschatology and biblical theology he argues that eschatology is protological. The Sabbath rest and the tree of life set before Adam a higher, confirmed life beyond probation. The covenant of works, or better the covenant of life, shows that humanity was created with a superadded eschatological destiny. This is the **federal theology** grammar that makes sense of the last Adam. Christ, as the eschatological man endowed with the Spirit, secures the heavenly life for his people. The Spirit is the arrabon, the down payment, of that life, so that believers already participate in resurrection power while awaiting its consummation. Anthropology is therefore irreducibly eschatological, pneumatological, and christological. Vos insists that the resurrection body is spiritual not in the sense of being nonmaterial but as being determined by the Spirit. He supports the Augustinian and Thomistic insistence on the integrity of body and soul while giving the already and not yet their full weight. This has two exam-relevant implications. First, the nature–grace debate is recast. Grace does not compete with nature because creational teleology already points beyond itself. Second, the beatific vision is not an add-on; it is the covenantal reward of communion with God in Christ and so must be preached as the true end of human nature. When challenged that inaugurated eschatology could downplay the future, the Vosian response is that the presence of the future intensifies expectation and holy restlessness rather than dissolving it. Participation is real yet penultimate; faith sees truly yet not nakedly face to face.

This position generates internal debates within the Reformed tradition that must be addressed. First, should the beatific vision be owned robustly or received cautiously as a medieval accretion. The better Reformed catholic answer is to own it robustly with careful christological and covenantal calibration. Scripture promises that the pure in heart shall see God and that we shall see him as he is, while Revelation declares that the servants of the Lamb shall see his face. The danger is not the vision but the conceptual laziness that imagines unmediated univocal knowledge. The antidote is **analogical knowledge** informed by **divine simplicity** and the binding of vision to the incarnate mediator. Second, theosis. The East speaks of deification, and contemporary Reformed retrievals speak of participation. The distinction between ontological deification and participatory communion is essential. We become partakers of the divine nature by grace so that our created capacities are filled with God’s own life without crossing the Creator–creature boundary. Third, the constitution of the human person and the intermediate state. Substance dualism is often assumed, but Reformed theology is better read as a hylomorphic duality. The soul is the form of the body, so that body and soul together constitute the person. Death is the rending of what God joined and is therefore an enemy. Nevertheless the separated soul continues consciously with Christ, awaiting the resurrection of the body, and this is not soul sleep. If an examiner presses whether this view is compatible with biblical holism, the answer is that biblical holism concerns the integrated unity of the human person, not a denial of real distinction between soul and body.

External debates sharpen the contours of this anthropology. Ancient Platonism and Gnosticism denigrate the body and valorize escape. The Christian answer, from Irenaeus to Vos, is that salvation is not escape but transfiguration. The resurrection of the flesh is the hinge. Modern physicalism, including Christian physicalist monism, denies or marginalizes the soul’s survival between death and resurrection. Though it rightly resists gnostic disdain for embodiment, it fails to account for the biblical teaching of presence with Christ after death and slides into a view of personhood as reducible to bodily continuity. Annihilationism and universalism reshape destiny in ways that distort both justice and mercy. The classical theist insists that eternal fellowship with God is the fruit of grace in Christ and that eternal separation is the just end for those who persist in rejecting God. Eastern Orthodox essence–energies theosis develops a different account of how creatures participate in God. A Reformed catholic response affirms the central insight of participation while noting that visibility of the triune life is mediated christologically and that the metaphysics of simplicity and analogical predication suffice to ensure real communion without positing a metaphysical split in God.

Contemporary debates stress test eschatological anthropology. Transhumanism offers a secular eschatology of enhancement promising longevity, cognitive expansion, or mind uploading. It mimics Christian form while denying its substance. In response we contend that the human telos cannot be engineered because it is not merely an extension of natural capacities. The death of death occurs only in resurrection, not in indefinite prolongation. The integrity of the body as the site of personal presence cannot be replaced by digital patterns, and identity is not data continuity but personal subsistence in a rational soul embodied in resurrected form. If asked whether God could resurrect a mind uploaded to a server, the best answer is that God can reconstitute personal identity by his omnipotence, but what he promises is resurrection of the body, not the preservation of an information pattern. Analytic discussions of identity in resurrection challenge us to propose criteria. The classic answer is a combination of psychological continuity, bodily continuity as reconstituted by divine power, and the persistence of the soul. The numerically same person rises because God preserves and restores the concrete supposit, not because matter atoms persist. Disability and gender in glorification raise pastoral and doctrinal questions. Glorification does not erase human histories but heals and perfects them; bodily markers that are consequences of the fall are removed, while creational sexual difference persists as integral to personal identity ordered to communion and service. Ecological concerns also bear on this locus. The new creation is the enlarged theater of glory; humans are restored priests and vicegerents. Eschatological anthropology must therefore be cosmic without ceasing to be personal.

To integrate these threads into a single argument, begin with the doctrine of creation. The image of God names a royal, relational, and teleological constitution ordered to communion. The Sabbath holds before humanity its eschatological rest with God. The garden sacramentally signals a higher life beyond mere probation. **Federal theology** makes sense of this by positing a covenantal arrangement in which the first Adam could attain a higher fixed state. The fall shatters that path and enslaves human desire to disordered loves, bending anthropology into curved-in self-love. Christ as last Adam succeeds where the first failed, and his resurrection inaugurates the age to come. The Spirit, poured out by the exalted Christ, unites us to him, making us participants in his life. This union yields a duplex grace now and guarantees glorification. Sanctification trains desires toward the vision of God, as Augustine taught. Justification secures the right to life and communion with God that Aquinas described as perfect happiness. The church as the body of Christ is an eschatological community, a colony of heaven living by the powers of the age to come. The sacraments are down payments of the future, engaging the body as the instrument of faith and foreshadowing its transformation. Worship is ordered to beholding by faith the glory of God in the face of Christ, which becomes sight at the last. Death remains an enemy and renders the intermediate state abnormal, yet for the believer to die is to be with Christ. At the trumpet the dead are raised, the living are transformed, and we receive bodies spiritual in the Pauline sense, that is, bodies wholly enlivened and ruled by the Spirit. The beatific vision then crowns our destiny as we see God and are satisfied forever, knowing as we are known without abolishing our finitude but filling it with light.

Anticipate objections. If the beatific vision seems unbiblical, we note that Scripture promises vision of God in Christ and that the Reformed have consistently affirmed it with christological checks. If the doctrine seems to jeopardize **divine simplicity** by promising immediate knowledge of God’s essence, we deploy the Thomistic and Augustinian tools of participation and infused light. Knowledge remains analogical, God remains incomprehensible in se, yet he gives himself to be seen in a mode suited to creaturely reception. If the location of the vision seems to displace the centrality of resurrection, we bind the two together: the vision is the form of our final act, the resurrected life is its bodily matter. The person God made is a body-soul composite; our end is not disembodied contemplation but embodied seeing. If a contemporary examiner worries that substance duality undermines social and political attention to bodily justice, we reply that only a robust account of the body as integral to personhood grounds the urgency of bodily care and the hope of bodily redemption. If one insists that nature–grace two-tiering downgrades the eschatological drive, we reformulate along Vosian lines: creation bears an eschatological imprint, grace is its appointed path, and glory is its promised end.

The positive proposal may be summarized. Human beings are created as images, ordered to God, with a natural desire that only supernatural fulfillment satisfies. Sin disorders love and introduces death through Adamic headship. Christ, by his obedience and resurrection, secures the last Adamic life, and by the Spirit unites us to himself, beginning the **inaugurated eschatology** in which we now walk. The intermediate state is a temporary blessing in which the soul is with Christ but longs for reunion with the body. At the return of Christ the dead are raised bodily, the just are glorified, and the saints behold God in Christ. This vision is participatory, not pantheistic, made possible by the light of glory, and is the consummation of **union with Christ**. The new creation is not an ethereal sphere but the transfigured cosmos, the theater of the glory of God, where human culture, purged and perfected, serves the worship of the Lamb. Theosis by participation is received as biblical and catholic when defined by **analogical knowledge**, classical theism, and christological mediation. The body matters irreducibly; identity is preserved by God’s providential preservation of the soul and restoration of bodily life; and destiny is not self-augmentation but adoption into divine communion. Theological anthropology is eschatological or it is not Christian. In defending this position, we do not romanticize mystery into vagueness. Rather, we bind exegesis to dogmatics, insist on the coherence of the loci, and answer the assembled challenges with conceptual clarity.

When examiners probe the pastoral yield, we note that this doctrine recalibrates hope and holiness. Sanctification becomes the training of sight, the purification of love, the habituation for glory. Suffering is interpreted as the shaping of a weight of glory beyond comparison. Ethics is infused with eschatological realism; every bodily act matters because the body is destined for glory. Worship is thick with anticipation; the Supper is not nostalgia but pledge. Mission is outreach from the city of God to the city of man, inviting neighbors into a destiny higher than any technology can promise. And at the grave we confess both grief and defiance. Death is an enemy, but at the last trump the Lord will raise us, and we shall see his face.

If required to summarize our commitments: we stand with Irenaeus against disincarnate salvation, with Augustine in seeing desire ordered to God and rest in vision, with Aquinas in defining perfect happiness as immediate participatory knowledge of the simple God, with Calvin in binding all this to the risen Christ and the reality of the intermediate state, and with Vos in recasting anthropology within **inaugurated eschatology** and **federal theology**. This is not eclecticism but catholicity. It is the eschatological anthropology that can be defended exegetically, sustained metaphysically, and preached pastorally. It prepares a candidate to answer not only what we are now but who, by grace, we shall be.
