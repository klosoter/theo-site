# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate an **eschatological anthropology** rooted in the doctrines of **creation**, **fall**, **redemption**, and **consummation**. Humanity is understood as created in the **image of God**, fallen into **sin and death**, and destined for **resurrection** and **final judgment**, with the ultimate hope of glorified existence in the **new heavens and new earth**.

- "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls...return to God who gave them: the souls of the righteous...are received into the highest heavens...and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 4, 6, 8, 16, 32, 33)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Q/A 17, 37–90)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q/A 10, 16, 37–38)
- Chad Van Dixhoorn, Confessing the Faith: A Reader’s Guide to the Westminster Confession of Faith
- Robert Letham, The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity Created for Eschatological Communion**
   - Humanity is created in the **image of God** with an original destiny of eternal fellowship.
   - The **covenant of works** held out the promise of glorified, incorruptible life contingent on obedience.
   - The eschatological goal was not mere continuation in Eden but advancement to confirmed, everlasting life.
   - Anthropology is thus inherently oriented toward consummation in God's presence.
   - "God made a covenant of life with Adam...upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (WCF 7.2)

2. **Death and the Intermediate State**
   - Physical death is the consequence of **sin** and the breach of the original covenant.
   - At death, the **soul** is separated from the body: the righteous enter into blessedness, the wicked into misery.
   - The intermediate state is conscious and anticipates the final resurrection.
   - The body returns to dust, but the soul remains immortal and accountable.
   - "The souls of the righteous...are received into the highest heavens...and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell." (WCF 32.1)

3. **Resurrection and Final Judgment**
   - All humanity will be raised bodily at the last day, both just and unjust.
   - The **resurrection** reunites body and soul for eternal destinies.
   - The **final judgment** determines everlasting blessedness or punishment.
   - The resurrection body is incorruptible for the righteous, fitted for glory.
   - "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies..." (WCF 32.2)

4. **Union with Christ and Glorification**
   - Believers are united to Christ, sharing in his resurrection and future glory.
   - **Sanctification** in this life leads to **glorification** in the life to come.
   - The eschatological hope is full conformity to Christ, body and soul.
   - The redeemed will enjoy God forever in the new creation.
   - "Being united to Christ...they shall be made perfectly blessed in the full enjoying of God to all eternity." (WSC 38)

5. **New Heavens and New Earth**
   - The ultimate destiny of redeemed humanity is embodied life in the **new heavens and new earth**.
   - The created order will be renewed and freed from corruption.
   - The righteous will dwell eternally with God in a perfected state.
   - Eschatological anthropology is thus cosmic and communal, not merely individual.
   - "In the day of judgment...the righteous shall be received into everlasting life, and enjoy full communion with God." (WLC 90)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed anthropology**, especially in their integration of **eschatology** with doctrines of creation, fall, and redemption. Their teaching on the **resurrection**, the **intermediate state**, and the **new creation** remains foundational for confessional Presbyterian and Reformed churches. By emphasizing humanity’s eschatological orientation and the hope of glorified embodied life, the Standards continue to inform contemporary discussions on the destiny and dignity of human persons in redemptive history.
