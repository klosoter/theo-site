# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s eschatological anthropology emphasizes the transformative hope of the **resurrection of the body** and the **coming Kingdom of God**. He rejects dualistic views of human nature, insisting on the **holistic unity of body and soul** and the future-oriented destiny of humanity within **God’s redemptive purposes**. For Moltmann, human identity and fulfillment are inseparable from the eschatological renewal of all creation.

- "The resurrection of the dead means the end of the whole person’s history in death and the beginning of the whole person’s new history in the creative resurrection of God." ("The Coming of God")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- Man: Christian Anthropology in the Conflicts of the Present (1974)
- God in Creation (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Resurrection as the Fulfillment of Human Personhood**
    - Human beings reach their true destiny only through **bodily resurrection**.
    - Resurrection is not mere survival of the soul but the transformation of the whole person.
    - The future of humanity is tied to the **eschatological renewal** of creation.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness and significance of embodied existence.
    - "The resurrection of the body means the future of the whole person, not just the immortality of the soul." (The Coming of God)

2. **Holistic Unity of Body and Soul**
    - Rejects anthropological dualism in favor of a **psychosomatic unity**.
    - Human beings are created as integrated wholes, not as separable parts.
    - Salvation and eschatological hope pertain to the entire person.
    - The biblical vision is of a renewed creation, not an escape from materiality.
    - "Man is not a soul in a body, but a psychosomatic unity destined for resurrection." (Man: Christian Anthropology)

3. **Eschatological Hope as Human Vocation**
    - Humanity is defined by openness to the future promised by God.
    - **Hope** is constitutive of human existence and shapes ethical action.
    - Eschatological anthropology grounds human dignity in God’s promised future.
    - The anticipation of the **Kingdom** motivates participation in liberation and justice.
    - "Hope’s significance is that it opens up the future for human beings and makes them capable of history." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Solidarity with Creation**
    - Human destiny is inseparable from the **renewal of all creation**.
    - Eschatological anthropology includes ecological and cosmic dimensions.
    - The resurrection of the body implies the redemption of material reality.
    - Human beings are called to solidarity with all creatures in hope.
    - "The resurrection hope is the hope for the new creation of all things, not just the salvation of individual souls." (God in Creation)

5. **Critique of Individualistic Immortality**
    - Rejects the notion of an **immortal soul** as unbiblical and individualistic.
    - Emphasizes communal and corporate aspects of eschatological fulfillment.
    - Eternal life is participation in the **community of the redeemed**.
    - The future is not private survival but shared transformation in Christ.
    - "Christian hope is not for the immortality of the soul, but for the resurrection of the dead in the community of God’s new world." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped contemporary **systematic theology**, especially in its integration of **resurrection hope** with a holistic view of human nature. His rejection of dualism and emphasis on the future of embodied existence have influenced debates on the nature of salvation, human dignity, and the destiny of creation. Moltmann’s vision continues to inspire theological reflection on the intersection of anthropology, ecology, and eschatology.
