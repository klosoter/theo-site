# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s eschatological anthropology is grounded in the conviction that **humanity’s destiny** is inseparable from the **consummation of creation** in Christ. He emphasizes the **unity of body and soul**, the **restoration of the image of God**, and the **corporate, cosmic scope** of redemption, insisting that eschatology fulfills rather than abolishes true humanity. For Bavinck, the resurrection and glorification of the body are central to the Christian hope, as God’s purposes for humanity are realized in the new creation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Body and Soul in Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Humanity is essentially psychosomatic; the resurrection affirms the goodness of embodied existence.
    - The soul without the body is incomplete; final redemption involves bodily resurrection.
    - Eschatology does not negate creation but brings it to perfection.
    - The glorified state is not a return to Eden but a consummation beyond it.
    - "The resurrection is the restoration of the whole person, body and soul, to the glory intended by God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

2. **Restoration and Consummation of the Image of God**
    - The image of God, marred by sin, is fully restored in Christ at the eschaton.
    - Eschatological anthropology centers on conformity to Christ, the true image.
    - The restoration is both individual and corporate, encompassing the entire people of God.
    - The image is perfected in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness in the new creation.
    - "In Christ, the image of God is restored and perfected in humanity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Cosmic and Corporate Scope of Redemption**
    - Human destiny is inseparable from the renewal of all creation.
    - Eschatological hope includes not only personal salvation but the transformation of the cosmos.
    - The new humanity is realized in the context of the new heavens and new earth.
    - Redemption is communal, involving the whole church as the body of Christ.
    - "The destiny of humanity is bound up with the destiny of the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Present Existence**
    - There is real continuity between present human existence and the eschatological state.
    - Discontinuity arises from the transformation and glorification of human nature.
    - The resurrection body is both recognizable and qualitatively different.
    - The new creation is the fulfillment, not the abolition, of the old.
    - "The new creation is not a second, wholly other world, but this world cleansed from sin and glorified." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4)

5. **Christocentric Eschatological Anthropology**
    - Christ is the pattern and guarantee of humanity’s eschatological future.
    - Union with Christ is the basis for resurrection and glorification.
    - The last Adam secures the destiny forfeited by the first Adam.
    - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from Christology and soteriology.
    - "All that is lost in Adam is restored and more in Christ." (The Wonderful Works of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, especially in its insistence on the goodness of creation and the holistic nature of redemption. His integration of **creation, redemption, and consummation** offers a robust alternative to dualistic or merely spiritualized accounts of human destiny. Bavinck’s vision continues to inform contemporary discussions on the resurrection, the image of God, and the cosmic scope of salvation. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a theologically rich and biblically grounded account of humanity’s eschatological hope.
