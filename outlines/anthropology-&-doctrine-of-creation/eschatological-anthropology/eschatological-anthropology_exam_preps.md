### ESSAY
Eschatological anthropology is the doctrine that human nature must be understood from its divinely appointed end, the consummation of humanity in union with the risen Christ. It asks not only what humans are, but what humans are for, and insists that our answer cannot be drawn merely from protology but must be normed by eschatology: by the resurrection of Christ as firstfruits and the promised new creation. The central thesis to defend is that human beings are created as covenantal image bearers whose identity and destiny are to be conformed to the glorified Christ in a renewed cosmos, enjoying the **beatific vision** of God in resurrected bodies within a corporate communion as the bride and body of Christ. This claim must be sharpened against missteps within the Christian tradition, against external anthropologies that either dissolve teleology or evacuate embodiment, and in conversation with pressing contemporary concerns.

Augustine is decisive because he relocates human identity within a linear, eschatological history ordered to the heavenly city. Against pagan cyclical notions of history and Platonist devaluation of the body, he articulates a teleological anthropology governed by God’s predestining grace and the final vision of God. In the Confessions and The City of God he frames the human as a restless lover whose heart is oriented by an ultimate end. For Augustine, the two cities are constituted by two loves, and these loves reach their terminus in eschatological destinies: the eternal enjoyment of God or eternal separation from him. The anthropology here is irreducibly eschatological: to be human is to be a rational, loving creature whose beatitude consists in the visio Dei, a direct although still creaturely seeing of God in the face of Christ. He insists on the resurrection of the body, not as an optional add-on, but as intrinsic to the completion of human nature. The final state is not the escape of the soul from flesh but the ordering of the whole person to God. Yet Augustine also transmits tensions that later debates will exploit: is the **beatific vision** conceived primarily in terms of the soul’s intellectual act, and how does that relate to bodily and cosmic renewal

Thomas Aquinas takes Augustine’s line and renders it with metaphysical and conceptual precision. For Aquinas, especially in the Summa Theologiae, human beings are rational animals ordered by nature and supernature to the vision of God. His nature–grace schema is central to eschatological anthropology. By nature, humans desire to know their first cause; by grace, they are elevated to a supernatural end: the **beatific vision** of the divine essence. This elevatio does not violate nature but perfects it. Thomas insists that no created power can attain this end; it requires the lumen gloriae, an infused habit that proportionates the intellect to see God. The destiny of human beings is thus essentially relational and contemplative: the intellect seeing God, the will resting in him. Yet he also strongly affirms bodily resurrection and a renewed cosmos. Still, his ordering of ends raises the question examiners will press: does this framework subordinate the cosmic and corporate dimensions to the intellectual vision of individuals Does it risk suggesting that Adam in Eden already possessed a natural end distinct from the supernatural destiny now revealed in Christ Reformed examiners will especially query whether Thomas’s two-tier ordering compromises the unity of God’s decree and the Christocentric nature of creation’s telos.

John Calvin, while deeply indebted to Augustine, reframes eschatological anthropology within a more explicitly christological and covenantal structure. In the Institutes and his commentaries, he grounds human destiny in union with the risen Christ, the last Adam. For Calvin, the imago Dei is not first a natural endowment but a dynamic vocation that finds its consummation in Christ’s glorified humanity. Believers are predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, and that conformity reaches its fullness in the resurrection. Calvin’s anthropology is thus already eschatological in its protological moment: Adam was created in a state of mutable righteousness, with a promised progression to a higher, confirmed life had he obeyed. That is, creation already anticipated eschatological glorification, not as a detachable supernature but as the gracious goal of the covenant relationship. This is a decisive correction of a strict two-tier scheme. The end for which humans are made is not an abstract vision of the divine essence but communion with the triune God in the Mediator, the incarnate Son, by the Spirit, in a renewed cosmos.

Calvin gives more prominence than Thomas to the resurrection body as essential to the perfection of humanity. His polemic against psychopannychia underscores that the intermediate state is provisional and incomplete, that the soul’s rest with Christ awaits the full redemption of the body. Yet he continues to affirm, with Augustine and Thomas, that the consummation is God-centered: the blessed will see God, not by collapsing into divinity, but by a participatory knowledge and love in Christ. The anthropological implications are clear: the human person is a psychosomatic unity destined for embodied communion, not a soul that can achieve its proper blessedness apart from resurrection. Calvin’s stress on union with Christ also makes eschatological anthropology irreducibly corporate. The destiny is that of the church, the body of Christ, raised together in glory. Examiners will rightly probe whether this corporate emphasis eclipses individual identity or whether the beatitude of the individual is swallowed in the destiny of the ecclesial whole. The answer within Calvin is that individuality is not erased but perfected within communion; the eschatological self is a member-in-communion.

The Reformed **federal theology** that follows Calvin, and that reaches a kind of biblical-theological maturity with Geerhardus Vos, clarifies the covenantal and historical shape of eschatological anthropology. Vos’ Pauline Eschatology and his Biblical Theology are crucial. Vos argues that eschatology is not merely about the last things but about the goal built into creation from the beginning. The first Adam stood under a covenant of works, with the Sabbath rest and tree of life symbolizing the higher, eschatological life held out on condition of obedience. Human nature, therefore, is structurally ordered to a confirmed, glorified state, and this confirmation was to be obtained covenantally. When Adam falls, this eschatological goal is not abolished but is now secured in the second Adam. For Vos, Christ’s resurrection is not an isolated miracle but the intrusion of the age to come into the present, the downpayment of the eschatological humanity for which the first creation was designed. Human identity is thus now doubly eschatological: believers exist simultaneously in this age and in the age to come, as those already raised with Christ yet awaiting bodily resurrection.

Vos reframes anthropology with the **already–not yet** grammar. The image of God is being renewed in true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, but this renewal is grounded in and patterned after the glorified Christ. Union with Christ by the Spirit means that the eschatological life has begun inwardly, but it will culminate outwardly in resurrection and participation in the renewal of all things. Vos thereby guards against both over-realized eschatology, which might claim that perfection is attainable now, and under-realized eschatology, which relegates all transformation to the future. Examiners will push on whether this inaugurated eschatology undermines the integrity of present creaturely life or common grace. Vos’ answer, consistent with classic Reformed thought, is that the presence of the age to come does not abolish the natural but reorients it; common structures continue, but the church lives within them as a community of the new creation.

Herman Bavinck consolidates and nuances this trajectory into a richly integrated **eschatological anthropology**. In his Reformed Dogmatics and his shorter writings, he resists every dualism that would pit nature against grace, body against soul, individual against community, or humanity against creation. For Bavinck, humanity is microcosm and mediator of creation, created in the image of God for communion with God and for the cultural development of the world unto God’s glory. Crucially, he rejects the notion that there is a purely natural end alongside a distinct supernatural end. From the outset, the human is oriented toward a consummation that can only be achieved by God’s gracious condescension in covenant. Eschatology is not an add-on but the very goal embedded in creation. The resurrection of Christ reveals what humanity was always meant to become.

Bavinck’s account of the **beatific vision** is christological, ecclesial, and cosmic. He maintains that the blessed will see God yet always as accommodated in Christ, since the incarnate Son remains the mediator and face of God for humanity. This guards against any vision of eschatological knowledge that bypasses Christ’s humanity or the covenantal economy. At the same time, he insists that glory is not merely mental or mystical: it is the perfection of the whole creature in a transfigured cosmos. The resurrection body is truly physical yet incorruptible, fully human yet Spirit-animated. Bavinck’s emphasis that grace restores and perfects nature drives his vision of continuity and discontinuity: the diversity of persons, cultures, and even the marks of earthly life are not simply erased but brought to their fullest, sinless realization. Examiners may ask whether this entails that present social identities, including gender and ethnicity, persist in glory. Bavinck provides resources for saying yes, in a transformed and purified mode that expresses the richness of the imago Dei rather than its division.

With these figures in hand, the main internal debates within the Christian tradition can be addressed. One central intramural debate concerns the relation of nature and grace, and thus whether eschatology is extrinsic or intrinsic to anthropology. The Thomistic tradition’s distinction between natural and supernatural ends has been charged by Reformed theologians with introducing a dualism in God’s intentions for humanity. The Reformed response, from Calvin through Vos and Bavinck, is that although human rationality can know something of God from nature, there never was a purely natural finality. The very structure of the image and the placement of Adam under a covenant with sacramental promises indicate that God created humanity for a destiny that exceeds the capacities of nature but is not a detachable superstructure. The position to defend is that eschatology is intrinsic to anthropology: to be human is to be ordered by grace to a consummation in Christ. Any anthropology that allows for a completed natural happiness apart from this eschatological communion is defective.

Another internal debate touches the image of God and whether it must be defined eschatologically. In scholastic and some Reformation formulations the image is described as a set of faculties or endowments, with the eschatological orientation treated as an accidental perfection. A more robustly eschatological anthropology, following Augustine, Calvin, Vos, and Bavinck, insists that the image is not static but teleological. The image is a relational and vocational reality, fulfilled only in the Son who is the image of the invisible God. Humanity as such is patterned after and destined for conformity to this eschatological image. This bears directly on questions examiners will raise about prelapsarian and postlapsarian anthropology: was Adam already in some sense eschatologically oriented, or is eschatology purely a response to sin The Reformed federal schema answers that Adam’s state was genuinely good yet provisional, beckoning him toward a higher, immutable life. Sin did not introduce teleology; it disrupted and perverted it.

A third intramural debate concerns the intermediate state and its anthropological status. If eschatological anthropology insists on the unity of body and soul, how can the disembodied state of believers with Christ be accounted for without endorsing a Greek dualism Reformed theology, following Augustine and Calvin, typically answers that the intermediate state is real yet abnormal, a state of conscious communion with Christ that does not fulfill the creational design. The soul without the body is not a complete human; the integrity of humanity is restored only in resurrection. Therefore, eschatological anthropology must affirm the intermediate state without absolutizing it, constantly directing attention to the resurrection as the decisive completion of human personhood.

Externally, eschatological anthropology must confront rival frameworks that either deny teleology or construe it in radically different terms. Ancient paganism and modern secularism often share a cyclical or open-ended vision of time with no definitive consummation. Human history becomes an endless repetition or an indefinite progress driven by human agency alone. Within such schemes, human nature is not ordered to a divinely given, final state but is plastic, self-creating, or tragically contingent. The Christian insists on a divinely determined telos: history moves from creation through fall and redemption to consummation, with Christ’s resurrection as the hinge. Without this eschatological anchor, anthropology tends toward either despairing nihilism or Promethean hubris.

At the level of body–soul relations, Christian eschatological anthropology stands against dualist and monist alternatives. Gnostic and some Platonist currents interpret salvation as escape from the body; various materialisms, ancient and modern, dissolve personal identity into impersonal processes. The Christian doctrine affirms a real distinction between soul and body but refuses to treat the body as a dispensable shell. The resurrection of Christ’s body, the continuity of scars, and the reign of the incarnate mediator argue that embodiment is permanent to human existence. Yet this does not mean the body as presently conditioned by mortality and sin is essential. Rather, eschatological anthropology teaches that human embodiment will be transfigured into incorruption, glorified by the Spirit. This position must answer the secular challenge that such a view is mythological. The response is twofold: first, that the resurrection of Christ is a publicly attested historical event grounding this hope; second, that any anthropology which denies a real telos for embodied existence is unable to do justice to the moral weight of bodily life and suffering.

Contemporary debates sharpen and often distort these classic questions. One pressing area is the intersection of eschatological anthropology with gender and embodiment. Some modern theologies propose that eschatological perfection transcends or dissolves gendered difference, treating male and female as essentially provisional. Others, often in reaction, absolutize current gender roles as eternal structures. An eschatological anthropology shaped by Christ’s resurrection and the **new creation** should take a more nuanced line. Gender is ordered to communion and fruitfulness in this age and thus is intrinsic to our mode of being human. Yet marriage is explicitly said to be temporary; in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage. The likely answer is that sexually differentiated embodiment persists, now ordered entirely to the corporate communion of the bride with Christ and freed from procreative and hierarchical conditions of the present order. The point to stress in examination is that eschatological anthropology honors the givenness of the body while subjecting all current social forms to eschatological critique and transformation.

Another contemporary issue is disability and perfection. Does eschatological anthropology imply that all impairments are removed in glory, and if so, does that denigrate disabled persons now A robustly christological account notes that the risen Christ bears his scars yet without limitation or pain. This suggests that the eschatological body is both healed and historically transparent. Disabilities associated with suffering and limitation are removed, yet the particular histories through which persons have known God are not erased. Eschatological anthropology affirms that every saint will participate fully in the **beatific vision** and the communal life of the new creation without deficiency, while also recognizing that present weaknesses are often the sites of God’s power. Thus, the doctrine undermines any present discrimination while grounding a hope for comprehensive restoration.

Eschatological anthropology also intersects with ecological concerns. If humans are destined for an immaterial heaven, environmental care can appear optional. But if human telos is bound to a renewed earth and if humans are mediators and stewards, then eschatology reinforces rather than negates creational responsibility. Vos and Bavinck both stress that the final state will not be a brand-new creation ex nihilo but the transformation of this world by fire into a **cosmic temple** of God’s glory. Human beings in resurrection are priests and kings in this renewed order. Therefore, eschatological anthropology undermines escapist attitudes and calls for anticipatory practices of care that accord with the world’s destined transfiguration.

Finally, contemporary transhumanism and secular projects of human enhancement present a technologically mediated eschatology. They promise extended life, augmented capacities, and perhaps digital immortality. Eschatological anthropology must expose these as parasitic on Christian hopes while fundamentally misconstruing them. The problem is not the desire for human flourishing and longevity but the attempt to achieve an immanentized, self-wrought pseudo-resurrection without reconciliation with God or transformation of the heart. Resurrection in Scripture is not mere prolongation but judgment and re-creation. Human persons are not information patterns transferable to hardware but psychosomatic unities whose identity is held in covenantal relation to God. Therefore, Christianity can affirm medical and technological goods as expressions of creaturely stewardship while rejecting the idolatrous fantasy of engineering our own eschaton.

Connecting this locus to adjacent doctrines clarifies its coherence within Christian dogmatics. Eschatological anthropology presupposes **creation ex nihilo** and **providence**, since only a sovereign, personal God can order human history to a definitive end. It is anchored in **Christology**: Christ as last Adam is the template and guarantee of eschatological humanity. It shapes **soteriology**, since justification, adoption, and sanctification are all ordered to glorification, the final conforming of the believer to Christ’s image. It informs **ecclesiology**, since the church is the eschatological community of the Spirit, an outpost of the age to come. It guards **doctrine of God**, especially **divine simplicity** and immutability, since the eschatological transformation of creatures does not entail any change in God but the consummation of his eternal decree. In every case, anthropology is not an isolated doctrine but a nexus in which the end of all God’s works in Christ is understood.

The position to defend before examiners, then, is that eschatological anthropology must be thoroughly christological, covenantal, and creational. Human beings are created as image bearers whose nature is already structured by an eschatological goal: incorruptible communion with the triune God in the glorified Christ by the Spirit, in the context of a renewed creation and a redeemed community. This telos is neither a detachable supernature nor an achievement of autonomous human effort, but the gracious fulfillment of God’s purpose in creation, secured by the death and resurrection of the last Adam. Any account of humanity that abstracts from this end, whether by restricting attention to original created capacities, by collapsing the final vision into an intellectualist individualism, or by substituting technological enhancement and immanent progress, fails to grasp what a human being truly is. Only in light of the eschaton do we see the human creature as it was always meant to be.
