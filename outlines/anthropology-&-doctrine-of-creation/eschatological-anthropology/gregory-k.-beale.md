# Gregory Beale (1949– )

Gregory Beale’s eschatological anthropology centers on the **image of God**, the **new creation**, and the **already/not yet** dynamic of **biblical eschatology**. He emphasizes that humanity’s identity and vocation are intrinsically tied to participation in the **eschatological fulfillment** inaugurated by Christ and consummated in the new heavens and new earth. Beale’s approach integrates **biblical theology** with a redemptive-historical framework, highlighting the transformation of human nature in union with Christ.

- "The image of God is not merely a static quality but a dynamic calling to reflect God’s glory, ultimately fulfilled in the eschatological new creation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Image of God**
    - Humanity’s original vocation as **image bearers** is eschatologically oriented toward reflecting God’s glory.
    - The **restoration and transformation** of the image occur through union with the resurrected Christ.
    - The **new creation** is the ultimate context for perfected human identity.
    - The church corporately embodies the renewed image as the temple of God.
    - "The image of God is restored and consummated in Christ, the true image, and in those united to him." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Already/Not Yet Anthropology**
    - Believers experience inaugurated transformation now, anticipating consummation at Christ’s return.
    - The tension between present renewal and future perfection shapes Christian identity and ethics.
    - Sanctification is participation in the **eschatological life** of the Spirit.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits of the new humanity.
    - "The new creation has broken in, but its fullness awaits the final resurrection." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

3. **Temple and Human Vocation**
    - Humanity’s original role in Eden is priestly and kingly, pointing to a cosmic temple.
    - The church, as God’s temple, is the locus of restored human vocation.
    - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from the presence of God among his people.
    - The final state is depicted as a temple-city where redeemed humanity dwells with God.
    - "The church is the beginning fulfillment of the end-time temple, where God’s presence transforms his people." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

4. **Corporate and Individual Dimensions**
    - Eschatological anthropology is both individual (personal renewal) and corporate (the people of God).
    - The church’s identity as the new humanity is central to Beale’s vision.
    - The Spirit’s work unites individuals into the eschatological community.
    - The consummation involves both personal glorification and communal participation in God’s reign.
    - "The new creation is not merely individual but corporate, encompassing the redeemed community." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Beale employs a redemptive-historical approach, tracing themes from Genesis to Revelation.
    - Typology and intertextuality are key tools for understanding eschatological anthropology.
    - The Old Testament’s vision of humanity is fulfilled and expanded in the New Testament.
    - Christological fulfillment is the lens through which human destiny is interpreted.
    - "The Bible’s story of humanity finds its climax in Christ and the eschatological new creation." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in the areas of **eschatology** and the doctrine of humanity. His integration of the **image of God**, temple theology, and the already/not yet framework has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to anthropology. Beale’s scholarship continues to inform discussions on the relationship between creation, redemption, and consummation, providing a robust foundation for understanding human identity in light of Christ’s eschatological work.
