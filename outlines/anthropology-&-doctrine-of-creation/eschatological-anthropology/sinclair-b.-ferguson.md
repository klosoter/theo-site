# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson’s eschatological anthropology is shaped by a robust **Reformed Christology** and a deep commitment to the **already/not yet** structure of **redemptive history**. He emphasizes that human identity and destiny are defined by union with the risen Christ, whose resurrection inaugurates the new creation and guarantees the believer’s **glorification**. Ferguson’s approach integrates **biblical theology** with classic **systematic categories**, highlighting the transformation of humanity in Christ as both present reality and future hope.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the foundation of the new humanity, and in him, believers already participate in the life of the age to come." (The Holy Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Holy Spirit (Contours of Christian Theology, 1996)
- The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction (1981)
- In Christ Alone: Living the Gospel Centered Life (2007)
- Devoted to God: Blueprints for Sanctification (2016)
- Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister is Called to Be (2017)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as Eschatological Center**
    - Believers are united to Christ in his death and resurrection, sharing in his eschatological life.
    - This union is both forensic and transformative, grounding justification and sanctification.
    - The new humanity is realized in Christ, who is the "firstborn from the dead."
    - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from Christ’s person and work.
    - "All that Christ has accomplished is communicated to us by the Spirit through union with him." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Redemption**
    - The believer’s identity is shaped by participation in the inaugurated new creation.
    - Sanctification is the present outworking of the eschatological reality begun in Christ.
    - Glorification is both a present possession in Christ and a future consummation.
    - The tension of living between the ages marks Christian anthropology.
    - "We live in the overlap of the ages, already raised with Christ, but not yet fully transformed." (The Christian Life)

3. **Pneumatological Transformation**
    - The Holy Spirit applies Christ’s eschatological work to believers, effecting new creation.
    - Regeneration is the beginning of eschatological renewal in the human person.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling is the guarantee of future resurrection and glorification.
    - Transformation into Christ’s image is the Spirit’s ongoing work in anticipation of the end.
    - "The Spirit is the bond of union with Christ and the agent of our eschatological renewal." (The Holy Spirit)

4. **Corporate and Covenantal Dimensions**
    - Eschatological anthropology is not merely individual but corporate, realized in the church.
    - The church is the community of the new creation, the firstfruits of redeemed humanity.
    - Participation in Christ includes incorporation into his body, the eschatological people of God.
    - The covenantal framework situates personal transformation within God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The church is the community in which the new humanity is being formed by the Spirit." (Devoted to God)

5. **Resurrection and Glorification as Human Destiny**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the pattern and pledge of believers’ future bodily resurrection.
    - Glorification is the consummation of the believer’s transformation into Christ’s likeness.
    - Human destiny is not escape from creation but its renewal and fulfillment in Christ.
    - Hope for the future shapes present identity and ethical living.
    - "Our destiny is resurrection glory, patterned after Christ, in the renewed creation." (In Christ Alone)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s eschatological anthropology has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology**, especially in its emphasis on **union with Christ** and the transformative work of the **Holy Spirit**. His integration of biblical and systematic theology has provided pastors and scholars with a robust framework for understanding human identity in light of redemptive history. Ferguson’s teaching continues to influence discussions on sanctification, the church, and the believer’s hope, reinforcing the centrality of Christ’s resurrection for Christian anthropology.
