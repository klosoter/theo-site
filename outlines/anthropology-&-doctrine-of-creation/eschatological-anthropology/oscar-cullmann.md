# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann’s eschatological anthropology is grounded in his conviction that **salvation history** unfolds between the decisive events of **Christ’s resurrection** and the **parousia**. He rejects both an over-realized eschatology and a purely future hope, emphasizing the **“already/not yet”** tension that shapes human existence. For Cullmann, human beings live in the tension between the old age and the new, with **bodily resurrection**—not immortality of the soul—as the true Christian hope.

- "The New Testament nowhere teaches the immortality of the soul in the Hellenistic sense, but everywhere the resurrection of the body." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Tension: “Already/Not Yet”**
    - Human existence is defined by living between the **resurrection** and the **parousia**.
    - Salvation is inaugurated but not consummated; believers experience both the old and new creation.
    - Anthropology must account for the provisional nature of present existence.
    - The Christian life is marked by hope and anticipation of final redemption.
    - "The Christian lives between D-Day and V-Day, in the tension of the already and the not yet." (Christ and Time)

2. **Bodily Resurrection over Immortality of the Soul**
    - Cullmann rejects the Greek concept of the soul’s inherent immortality.
    - The New Testament affirms the resurrection of the whole person, not just the survival of a soul.
    - Death is a real enemy, not a liberation of the soul from the body.
    - Hope centers on God’s act to raise the dead at the end of history.
    - "Resurrection, not immortality, is the central hope of Christian anthropology." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

3. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Human beings are a psychosomatic unity, not a dualistic composite.
    - The biblical view resists separating body and soul as independent substances.
    - Redemption involves the whole person, not merely the spiritual aspect.
    - Anthropology is inseparable from eschatology and soteriology.
    - "The New Testament knows nothing of a dualism between body and soul." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

4. **Historical Orientation of Salvation**
    - Human destiny is tied to the unfolding of **salvation history**.
    - Anthropology must be understood within the linear, historical framework of biblical revelation.
    - The meaning of human life is found in participation in God’s redemptive acts.
    - The future resurrection is grounded in the historical resurrection of Christ.
    - "The Christian hope is historical, not mythological." (Christ and Time)

5. **Death as an Eschatological Reality**
    - Death is not a natural transition but an enemy to be overcome.
    - The final victory over death awaits the return of Christ.
    - The intermediate state is provisional, not the final destiny of the human person.
    - Eschatological anthropology insists on the necessity of God’s intervention for true life.
    - "Death is the last enemy, not a friend." (Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?)

## Legacy and Impact

Cullmann’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped modern discussions of **resurrection**, challenging both liberal and traditional dualistic interpretations. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** framework has influenced New Testament theology and the understanding of Christian hope. By rooting anthropology in salvation history, Cullmann redirected attention to the bodily and historical dimensions of redemption, leaving a lasting mark on biblical and systematic theology.
