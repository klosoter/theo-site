# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper’s eschatological anthropology is rooted in his conviction that **humanity** is created in the **image of God** and destined for consummation in the **eschaton**. He emphasizes the continuity between **creation, redemption, and final restoration**, insisting that human nature and culture are not abolished but transformed in the new creation. Kuyper’s vision integrates **common grace** and **particular grace**, affirming the enduring significance of human personhood and vocation in God’s unfolding redemptive plan.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as the Image of God**
    - Humanity’s dignity and destiny are grounded in being created in the **imago Dei**.
    - The image is not lost in the Fall but marred, awaiting restoration in Christ.
    - Eschatological fulfillment involves the full realization of the image in communion with God.
    - Human faculties—reason, will, creativity—retain significance in the new creation.
    - "The image of God in man is destined to be restored and perfected in the final state." (Encyclopaedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Continuity of Creation and Consummation**
    - The original creation is not discarded but renewed in the eschaton.
    - Human culture, labor, and society have enduring value in God’s plan.
    - Redemption is restorative, not merely escapist or spiritualizing.
    - The material and spiritual are integrated in the final state.
    - "Grace restores nature, it does not abolish it." (Lectures on Calvinism)

3. **Common Grace and Eschatological Hope**
    - **Common grace** preserves and prepares humanity for redemption.
    - All human achievements are significant under God’s providence.
    - The effects of common grace anticipate the transformation of all things.
    - Eschatological anthropology affirms the value of human life and culture now and in eternity.
    - "Common grace restrains sin and enables the unfolding of human potential, pointing forward to the renewal of all things." (Common Grace)

4. **Particular Grace and the New Humanity in Christ**
    - **Particular grace** effects regeneration and union with Christ.
    - The church is the firstfruits of the renewed humanity.
    - Eschatological anthropology centers on participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - The destiny of humanity is corporate, realized in the communion of saints.
    - "In Christ, the new man is created, destined for eternal fellowship with God." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

5. **Vocation and Cultural Mandate in the Eschaton**
    - The **cultural mandate** is not annulled but fulfilled in the new creation.
    - Human work and stewardship have eschatological significance.
    - The redeemed exercise dominion in service to God’s glory forever.
    - Eschatological anthropology includes the transformation of all spheres of life.
    - "Our calling in this world is not meaningless, but finds its consummation in the kingdom to come." (Pro Rege)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, especially in its affirmation of the enduring value of creation and human culture. His integration of **common grace** and the **cultural mandate** has influenced Neo-Calvinism and contemporary discussions on faith and public life. Kuyper’s vision continues to inspire theologians to affirm both the present significance and the future transformation of human existence in Christ.
