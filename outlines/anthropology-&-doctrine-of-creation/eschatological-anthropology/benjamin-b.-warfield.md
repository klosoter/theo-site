# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield’s approach to **eschatological anthropology** is rooted in his Reformed commitment to the **original creation**, **the image of God**, and the **consummation of humanity** in Christ. He emphasizes the continuity between the **first Adam** and the **last Adam**, arguing that human destiny is fulfilled in the resurrection and glorification brought by Christ’s redemptive work. Warfield’s anthropology is thus deeply shaped by his understanding of **eschatology** as the final realization of humanity’s purpose.

- "The destiny of man is not to be found in the first Adam, but in the second." ("The Divine Origin of the Soul," in Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Works

- "The Divine Origin of the Soul" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Fact" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 9)
- "The Christ That Paul Preached" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Person and Work of Christ"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity Created for Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - Humanity was created with an inherent orientation toward **eschatological consummation**.
   - The **image of God** includes a destiny beyond mere earthly existence.
   - The original state was not the final goal; **glorification** was always intended.
   - The fall did not erase the eschatological purpose, but necessitated redemption.
   - "Man was made for more than innocence; he was made for glory." ("The Divine Origin of the Soul")

2. **Christ as the Eschatological Man**
   - Christ is the **second Adam**, embodying the true destiny of humanity.
   - The resurrection of Christ is the pattern and guarantee of believers’ future resurrection.
   - Union with Christ secures the believer’s participation in **eschatological life**.
   - The work of Christ restores and consummates the original purpose for humanity.
   - "It is in Christ, the second Adam, that man attains his true end." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

3. **Resurrection as the Fulfillment of Human Nature**
   - The resurrection is central to Warfield’s eschatological anthropology.
   - Human nature finds its completion not in death, but in resurrection and glorification.
   - The body is not discarded but transformed in the eschaton.
   - The hope of resurrection shapes Christian identity and ethics.
   - "The resurrection of the body is the completion of the redemption of man." ("The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Fact")

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Eschatological Transformation**
   - There is real continuity between present human existence and eschatological glory.
   - The **image of God** is restored and perfected, not replaced.
   - Sin and corruption are removed, but personal identity is preserved.
   - The eschatological state is both a restoration and a surpassing of Eden.
   - "The life to come is not a mere return to the old, but the attainment of the new." ("The Divine Origin of the Soul")

5. **Theological Anthropology Grounded in Reformed Soteriology**
   - Warfield’s anthropology is inseparable from his doctrines of **election**, **union with Christ**, and **perseverance**.
   - The eschatological destiny of humanity is secured by God’s sovereign grace.
   - The Spirit’s work in sanctification is oriented toward final glorification.
   - Anthropology and eschatology are unified in the Reformed ordo salutis.
   - "The whole process of salvation looks forward to the final glorification of the sons of God." ("The Plan of Salvation")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s **eschatological anthropology** has profoundly influenced Reformed theology, particularly in its emphasis on the **resurrection** and the **consummation of humanity in Christ**. His integration of anthropology and eschatology helped shape twentieth-century evangelical and Reformed discussions on the image of God and human destiny. Warfield’s insistence on the continuity between creation, redemption, and consummation remains a hallmark of robust Reformed anthropology. His work continues to serve as a bridge between classic Reformed thought and contemporary theological reflection on human nature and destiny.
