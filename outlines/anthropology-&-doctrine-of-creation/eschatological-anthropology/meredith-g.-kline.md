# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline’s eschatological anthropology is rooted in a **covenantal framework** that interprets humanity’s original and ultimate destiny through the lens of **kingdom consummation** and **image of God**. He emphasizes that Adam’s probation in the **covenant of works** was eschatological in orientation, with humanity created for **glorification** beyond Eden, not mere maintenance of original righteousness. Kline’s anthropology thus integrates **eschatology** and **anthropology** by insisting that human nature and destiny are inseparable from the trajectory toward the **heavenly kingdom**.

- "Man was created not simply to exist in the earthly paradise but to attain to the consummation of life in the heavenly reality symbolized by the Sabbath." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Creation**
    - Humanity was created with an inherent orientation toward an **eschatological goal** beyond Eden.
    - The **Sabbath rest** prefigured the consummation awaiting obedient humanity.
    - The earthly order was provisional, pointing to a higher, **heavenly reality**.
    - Adam’s original state was not the intended final state for humanity.
    - "The original creation order was not static but pointed forward to a consummation beyond probation." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenant of Works as Eschatological**
    - The **covenant of works** was structured around a probation with an eschatological reward.
    - Obedience would have led to **glorification**, not mere perpetuation of Edenic life.
    - The threat of death and promise of life were both eschatological in scope.
    - The **tree of life** symbolized the higher life to be attained.
    - "The probation was not simply a test of obedience but a gateway to eschatological advancement." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Image of God and Royal Priesthood**
    - Humanity’s identity as **image of God** includes a royal-priestly vocation with eschatological implications.
    - The **dominion mandate** is oriented toward consummating God’s kingdom.
    - The image is dynamic, involving movement toward **glorification**.
    - Eschatological anthropology sees the image fulfilled in the **Last Adam**.
    - "Man’s image-bearing is not static but is to be consummated in conformity to the glorified Son." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Typology and Two-Adam Structure**
    - Adam is a **type** whose destiny is fulfilled in Christ, the **eschatological Adam**.
    - The first Adam’s failure and the second Adam’s obedience frame human destiny.
    - Typology links the original creation to the **new creation**.
    - Anthropology is inseparable from Christology in its eschatological fulfillment.
    - "The destiny forfeited by the first Adam is realized in the second Adam, who secures the eschatological inheritance." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Heavenly Kingdom as Human Destiny**
    - The ultimate goal for humanity is participation in the **heavenly kingdom**.
    - Earthly life is preparatory and anticipatory of the **consummate Sabbath rest**.
    - Anthropology is teleological, oriented toward **transformation and glorification**.
    - The resurrection is the realization of humanity’s eschatological purpose.
    - "The hope of man is not a return to Eden but entrance into the heavenly city." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in its integration of **covenant theology** and eschatology. His insistence that human nature and destiny are fundamentally oriented toward consummation in Christ has influenced generations of scholars and pastors. Kline’s typological and covenantal readings continue to inform debates on the **image of God**, the **covenant of works**, and the ultimate purpose of humanity in redemptive history.
