# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose **eschatological anthropology** centers on the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ and the inaugurated-yet-not-consummated nature of **redemption**. He emphasizes that human identity and destiny are fundamentally shaped by participation in Christ’s resurrection, with **pneumatology**, **resurrection**, and the **already/not yet** framework as central categories. Gaffin’s work highlights the transformation of human existence in light of **eschatological fulfillment** begun in Christ and applied by the Spirit.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the pivotal event in the realization of eschatological salvation, and so also in the anthropology of the New Testament." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in Biblical and Theological Essays)
- "Eschatology and Anthropology: Observations on Some Recent Studies" (WTJ article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Union with Christ as Eschatological Center**
    - Human identity is redefined through union with the resurrected Christ.
    - This union is both forensic and transformative, affecting the whole person.
    - The believer’s present life is shaped by participation in Christ’s resurrection.
    - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from Christology.
    - "Believers are united with Christ in his resurrection, which inaugurates the new creation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Redemption**
    - Eschatological realities are inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - The believer lives in the tension of present spiritual renewal and future bodily transformation.
    - Anthropology must account for both realized and future aspects of salvation.
    - The resurrection of Christ is the firstfruits, guaranteeing the believer’s future resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the eschatological resurrection, not merely its guarantee." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Pneumatological Transformation**
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s resurrection to believers.
    - Spiritual renewal is the present aspect of eschatological anthropology.
    - The Spirit’s indwelling marks the transition from the old to the new age.
    - The Spirit’s work is both a present possession and a pledge of future consummation.
    - "The Spirit is the bond of union with Christ and the agent of eschatological transformation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Anthropology in Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - Human nature and destiny must be understood within the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - Adam and Christ are representative heads in the history of humanity.
    - The resurrection marks the decisive shift from the old to the new humanity.
    - Anthropology is not static but shaped by the epochs of creation, fall, and redemption.
    - "Paul’s anthropology is inseparable from his redemptive-historical eschatology." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Bodily Resurrection as Fulfillment**
    - Full eschatological anthropology culminates in the bodily resurrection.
    - The body is not discarded but transformed in the final state.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness of creation and the material aspect of humanity.
    - The hope of believers is not disembodied existence but glorified embodiment.
    - "The resurrection body is the consummation of the Spirit’s work in believers." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **eschatological anthropology** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions of Pauline theology, especially regarding **union with Christ** and the role of the Holy Spirit. His emphasis on the **already/not yet** framework has influenced biblical theology and the understanding of Christian identity and hope. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for those seeking to integrate anthropology, soteriology, and eschatology within a redemptive-historical perspective.
