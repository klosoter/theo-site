# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray’s eschatological anthropology is grounded in a robust **Reformed doctrine of man**, emphasizing the unity of **body and soul**, the significance of the **resurrection**, and the consummation of **redemption** in Christ. He insists that true human destiny is realized not in a disembodied state but in the glorified existence of the **new creation**, where believers are fully conformed to the image of Christ.

- "The ultimate hope of the believer is not immortality of the soul but the resurrection of the body." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT)
- "The Imputation of Adam's Sin"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Body and Soul**
   - Humanity is created as a psychosomatic unity, not as a soul temporarily inhabiting a body.
   - The fall and redemption both affect the whole person, not just the immaterial aspect.
   - Eschatological hope involves the restoration of both body and soul.
   - The intermediate state is provisional, awaiting bodily resurrection.
   - "The body is not an appendage to the real self but integral to human identity." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

2. **Centrality of Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is the climax of redemption for the individual and the cosmos.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits and pattern for believers’ resurrection.
   - The future resurrection secures the believer’s ultimate conformity to Christ.
   - Disembodied existence is incomplete and not the final goal.
   - "Resurrection is the consummation of the believer’s salvation." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

3. **Consummation in Union with Christ**
   - Eschatological anthropology is realized through union with the resurrected Christ.
   - Believers are predestined to be conformed to the image of the glorified Son.
   - The benefits of Christ’s work are applied in full at the last day.
   - Glorification is inseparable from participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
   - "Glorification is the final phase of the application of redemption." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Restoration of the Image of God**
   - The image of God, marred by sin, is restored and perfected in the eschaton.
   - Full restoration includes moral, spiritual, and physical renewal.
   - The eschatological state is the realization of humanity’s original purpose.
   - The redeemed will reflect God’s glory in the new creation.
   - "The image of God will be perfectly restored in the glorified state." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

5. **Corporate and Cosmic Dimensions**
   - Eschatological anthropology is not merely individual but corporate, involving the whole people of God.
   - The destiny of humanity is tied to the renewal of the entire creation.
   - The resurrection inaugurates the new heavens and new earth.
   - The glorified community will dwell eternally in fellowship with God.
   - "The redemption of the body is coordinate with the redemption of creation." ("The Epistle to the Romans")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s eschatological anthropology has shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by emphasizing the holistic and embodied nature of redemption. His insistence on the **resurrection of the body** as central to Christian hope has influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to eschatology. Murray’s work continues to inform discussions on the nature of glorification, the destiny of humanity, and the significance of union with Christ in the consummation of salvation.
