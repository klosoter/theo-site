# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich’s eschatological anthropology centers on the existential condition of **humanity** in relation to the **Kingdom of God**, emphasizing the tension between **finite existence** and **ultimate fulfillment**. He interprets **eschatology** not as a future event but as a symbol of the **New Being** realized in Christ, where the **estrangement** of human existence is overcome and **personhood** is fulfilled in unity with the divine.

- "Eschatology is the ultimate answer to the question implied in the existence of man as man." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 3")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology as Symbolic of Ultimate Fulfillment**
    - Eschatological language expresses the **ultimate destiny** of humanity, not literal future events.
    - The **Kingdom of God** is a symbol for the fulfillment of existence and the overcoming of estrangement.
    - Human history is the stage for the realization of the **New Being** in Christ.
    - The eschaton is always present as the depth dimension of every moment.
    - "The end is not a temporal event but the fulfillment of meaning." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

2. **Existential Estrangement and the Human Condition**
    - Humanity is marked by **estrangement** from its essential being and from God.
    - **Sin** is interpreted as separation, which eschatology seeks to overcome.
    - The human longing for reunion with the divine is central to Tillich’s anthropology.
    - Eschatological hope is the anticipation of reunion and healing of this estrangement.
    - "Man is estranged from the ground of his being, from other men, and from himself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **The New Being in Christ**
    - Christ is the manifestation of the **New Being**, the answer to existential estrangement.
    - The New Being is the eschatological reality breaking into history.
    - In Christ, the potential for **reconciliation** and fulfillment is actualized.
    - Eschatological anthropology is realized in participation in the New Being.
    - "In the New Being, the separation is overcome and the eschatological unity is anticipated." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Already/Not Yet Structure of Eschatological Existence**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is both a present reality and a future hope.
    - Human existence is lived in the tension between the **already** and the **not yet**.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is anticipated but never fully possessed in history.
    - This tension shapes ethical and existential decisions in the present.
    - "The Kingdom of God is present where the New Being is manifest, but it is never fully realized in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Personhood and the Fulfillment of Human Potential**
    - Eschatology is concerned with the **actualization of personhood** in unity with the divine.
    - The fulfillment of human potential is possible only in relation to the **Ultimate Concern**.
    - The eschatological vision is the transformation of human existence into participation in the divine life.
    - Human destiny is to be fully a person in communion with God and others.
    - "The ultimate destiny of man is the fulfillment of personhood in the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly influenced **existential theology** and modern understandings of **eschatology** as symbolic and existential rather than merely chronological. His integration of **philosophical anthropology** with Christian doctrine challenged traditional views and offered a dynamic vision of human fulfillment. Tillich’s thought continues to shape discussions on the meaning of **personhood**, estrangement, and the transformative hope of the New Being.
