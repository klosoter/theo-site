# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s eschatological anthropology centers on the **image of God**, the **intermediate state**, and the **resurrection of the body**, all within the framework of **union with Christ** and the **already/not yet** dynamic of redemption. He emphasizes the restoration of humanity in Christ, the conscious existence of the soul after death, and the ultimate glorification of believers at the consummation.

- "We must hold, as has already been stated, that the soul, though delivered from the prison of the body, is not on that account to be considered as enjoying perfect happiness." (Institutes 3.25.9)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Image of God and Its Eschatological Restoration**
    - Humanity was created in the **image of God**, which was marred by the Fall but will be fully restored in the eschaton.
    - Restoration is accomplished through **union with Christ** and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    - The image includes **righteousness, holiness, and knowledge**, which are progressively renewed.
    - Full restoration awaits the **resurrection** and glorification of believers.
    "The image of God was not utterly effaced and destroyed in him, yet it was so corrupted that whatever remains is frightful deformity." (Institutes 1.15.4)

2. **Intermediate State of the Soul**
    - Calvin affirms the **immortality of the soul** and its conscious existence after death.
    - The soul of the believer enjoys **communion with Christ** while awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - The intermediate state is one of **incompleteness**, not final blessedness.
    - The wicked experience conscious separation from God even before final judgment.
    "The souls of the pious, after leaving the body, live with the Lord." (Institutes 3.25.6)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
    - The final hope for believers is the **resurrection of the body** at Christ’s return.
    - This resurrection is a **restoration and transformation** of the whole person.
    - Calvin rejects both **soul sleep** and the notion of a purely spiritual resurrection.
    - The resurrected body will be incorruptible and fitted for eternal communion with God.
    "We must hold, as an undoubted principle, that the resurrection is no less a restoration of the body than of the soul." (Institutes 3.25.8)

4. **Union with Christ as the Ground of Eschatological Hope**
    - All eschatological blessings flow from **union with Christ**.
    - Believers are already raised with Christ spiritually, but await the **full realization** in the future.
    - This union guarantees both **justification** now and **glorification** to come.
    - The Spirit is the bond of this union, applying Christ’s benefits to believers.
    "As long as Christ remains outside of us, and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us." (Institutes 3.1.1)

5. **The Already/Not Yet Tension**
    - Calvin maintains that believers experience a **foretaste** of eschatological realities now.
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated but not yet consummated.
    - Sanctification is real but incomplete, pointing to future perfection.
    - Suffering and struggle persist, but hope is anchored in the **promised consummation**.
    "We are already, as it were, in the kingdom of God, and yet we await its full revelation." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15:24)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s eschatological anthropology has profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, especially in its emphasis on the **integrity of the human person** and the centrality of **union with Christ** for understanding redemption and glorification. His careful articulation of the intermediate state and the resurrection influenced later confessional standards and pastoral theology. Calvin’s balance of the **already/not yet** dynamic continues to inform contemporary discussions on Christian hope and the destiny of humanity.
