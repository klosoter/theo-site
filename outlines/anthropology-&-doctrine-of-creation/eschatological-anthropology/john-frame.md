# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **eschatological anthropology** through his distinctive **tri-perspectivalism**, emphasizing the integration of **creation, redemption, and consummation** in understanding human nature and destiny. He views human beings as fundamentally **covenantal creatures**, whose identity and purpose are shaped by their relationship to God, culminating in the hope of **resurrection** and the **new creation**. Frame insists that eschatology is not merely about future events but is essential for understanding the present meaning and calling of humanity.

- "Eschatology is not just about the future; it is about the fulfillment of God’s purposes for humanity in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Covenantal Image-Bearers**
   - Humanity is created in the **image of God** for covenantal relationship.
   - The image includes knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, oriented toward God’s purposes.
   - The fall distorts but does not erase the image; redemption restores it.
   - Eschatological fulfillment involves the perfected image in union with Christ.
   - "Our destiny as humans is to reflect God’s glory in covenant with him." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Eschatology as Present and Future Reality**
   - Eschatology shapes both the present and future aspects of human existence.
   - The "already/not yet" tension defines Christian anthropology.
   - Believers participate now in the powers of the age to come.
   - The resurrection is both a present spiritual reality and a future bodily hope.
   - "Eschatology is not only about what will happen, but about what is happening now in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Resurrection and New Creation**
   - The resurrection of Christ is the pattern and guarantee of human resurrection.
   - The body is essential to human identity; salvation includes bodily renewal.
   - The new creation is the ultimate context for redeemed humanity.
   - Eschatological anthropology rejects dualism, affirming holistic restoration.
   - "The resurrection is the central hope of Christian anthropology." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Christocentric Consummation**
   - Christ is the true image and the goal of human destiny.
   - Union with Christ defines both present identity and future hope.
   - The consummation is personal and corporate, centered on Christ’s lordship.
   - The church is the community of the new humanity in Christ.
   - "Our eschatological hope is realized in Christ, who is the firstborn from the dead." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Ethical Implications of Eschatological Anthropology**
   - Eschatological hope motivates present obedience and holiness.
   - Human dignity and vocation are grounded in future consummation.
   - The anticipation of judgment and renewal shapes moral responsibility.
   - The Spirit empowers believers to live as citizens of the coming kingdom.
   - "The future shapes our present calling as God’s people." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s **tri-perspectival approach** has significantly influenced Reformed discussions of anthropology and eschatology, integrating doctrinal, ethical, and existential dimensions. His emphasis on the unity of **creation, redemption, and consummation** has encouraged a holistic view of human nature and destiny. Frame’s work continues to shape evangelical theology, especially in its insistence that eschatology is central to understanding both the present and future of humanity in Christ.
