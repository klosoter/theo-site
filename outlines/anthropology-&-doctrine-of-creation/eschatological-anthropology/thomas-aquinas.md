# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed an **eschatological anthropology** rooted in the union of **body and soul**, emphasizing the **resurrection of the body** and the soul’s **beatific vision** of God as humanity’s ultimate end. He argued that the **imago Dei** is fully realized only in the eschaton, where perfected human nature attains its telos in **communion with God**.

- "The ultimate perfection, to which man can attain, consists in the enjoyment of God, which is the reward of virtue." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 5, a. 5)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially III, Supplement, qq. 75–99)
- Summa Contra Gentiles (Book IV, chapters 79–97)
- De Veritate (esp. q. 8, on the resurrection)
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians (esp. ch. 15)
- The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology (ed. Jerry L. Walls, for secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Body-Soul Unity Endures in Eschatology**
   - Human nature is essentially a composite of **body and soul**.
   - The soul’s natural state is to be united with the body, even after death.
   - The **resurrection** restores the fullness of human nature.
   - Disembodied souls in the intermediate state are incomplete.
   - "The soul is not the whole man, but only part of man; my soul is not I." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 4)

2. **The Beatific Vision as Final End**
   - The ultimate fulfillment of human nature is the **direct vision of God**.
   - This vision is possible only through supernatural grace.
   - The beatific vision perfects both intellect and will.
   - Full participation in the divine life is eschatological.
   - "Final and perfect happiness can consist in nothing else than the vision of the Divine Essence." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 3, a. 8)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
   - The resurrection is necessary for the completion of human destiny.
   - The resurrected body will be **glorified**, incorruptible, and perfectly suited to the soul.
   - Bodily resurrection affirms the goodness of creation.
   - The resurrection is both individual and cosmic in scope.
   - "The soul is naturally united to the body, and therefore it is unnatural for the soul to be without the body." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 79)

4. **Imago Dei Perfected in the Eschaton**
   - The **image of God** in humanity is oriented toward eschatological fulfillment.
   - Full likeness to God is achieved only in the state of glory.
   - The restoration of the imago Dei involves both moral and ontological transformation.
   - The eschaton brings the image to its intended perfection.
   - "The image of God, in its principal signification, namely the intellectual nature, remains even in the damned." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 93, a. 8)

5. **Intermediate State and Final Judgment**
   - Souls exist consciously after death, awaiting resurrection.
   - The **particular judgment** occurs immediately after death; the **general judgment** at the end of time.
   - The intermediate state is provisional, not the final destiny.
   - The final state involves both **reward and punishment** in body and soul.
   - "The soul separated from the body is not a complete man, but only a part of man." (Summa Theologiae Supplement, q. 93, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s **eschatological anthropology** profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian understandings of the **resurrection**, the **beatific vision**, and the enduring significance of the **imago Dei**. His synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian doctrine provided a durable framework for later theological reflection on human destiny. Aquinas’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **human nature**, the afterlife, and the ultimate purpose of creation.
