# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s eschatological anthropology centers on the dynamic relationship between **human personhood**, **divine revelation**, and the **future consummation** of creation. He rejects both a purely naturalistic and a dualistic view of humanity, emphasizing that true human existence is realized only in relation to God and oriented toward the **eschaton**. For Brunner, the meaning and destiny of humanity are inseparable from the **Christ-event** and the promise of **resurrection**.

- "Man is truly man only in the light of his destiny, which is revealed in Christ." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Eternal Hope
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Christian Doctrine of God
- Revelation and Reason

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Relational Anthropology**
   - Humanity is defined by its relationship to God, not by autonomous selfhood.
   - The **imago Dei** is realized in personal encounter and response to divine address.
   - Human existence is fundamentally dialogical, grounded in revelation.
   - Alienation from God distorts true humanity.
   - "Man is a being who stands in relation to God, and only in this relation does he become what he is." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of Human Existence**
   - Human life is oriented toward a divinely promised future, not merely temporal existence.
   - The **eschaton** is the fulfillment of human destiny, revealed in Christ.
   - Anthropology cannot be separated from eschatology; the meaning of humanity is future-oriented.
   - The resurrection is central to understanding human hope and identity.
   - "The meaning of man is not in what he is, but in what he is to become in the consummation." (The Eternal Hope)

3. **Rejection of Dualism**
   - Brunner opposes a strict body-soul dualism, affirming the unity of the human person.
   - The whole person, not just the soul, is destined for resurrection.
   - Human existence is psychosomatic, integrating spiritual and physical aspects.
   - Salvation and consummation involve the renewal of the entire person.
   - "The biblical idea of man is not dualistic, but unites body and soul in one living being." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

4. **Christological Determination of Humanity**
   - Christ is the true image and destiny of humanity.
   - Human nature finds its fulfillment and restoration in union with Christ.
   - The **incarnation** and **resurrection** of Christ reveal the eschatological goal for all humanity.
   - Anthropology must be interpreted in light of the Christ-event.
   - "In Christ, the true destiny and meaning of man is disclosed and fulfilled." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Hope in Resurrection and New Creation**
   - Human hope is grounded in the promise of resurrection and participation in the new creation.
   - The future transformation of humanity is a divine act, not human achievement.
   - The resurrection affirms the value of embodied existence.
   - Eschatological fulfillment is communal, involving the restoration of all creation.
   - "Christian hope is hope for the resurrection of the whole man and the renewal of all things." (The Eternal Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s eschatological anthropology has significantly shaped modern **Reformed theology** by emphasizing the relational and future-oriented nature of human existence. His integration of **Christology** and **eschatology** into anthropology challenged both liberal and existentialist reductions of the human person. Brunner’s thought continues to influence discussions on the unity of body and soul, the meaning of the **imago Dei**, and the centrality of resurrection hope in Christian doctrine.
