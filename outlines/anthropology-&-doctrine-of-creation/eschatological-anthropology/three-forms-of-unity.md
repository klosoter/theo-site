# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a **Reformed anthropology** that is deeply shaped by **eschatological hope**. Humanity is created in the **image of God**, fallen into **sin and misery**, but destined for **restoration and glorification** through union with Christ and the consummation of all things. This eschatological orientation frames human identity, purpose, and destiny within the broader narrative of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**.

- "We look for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." (Belgic Confession, Art. 37)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14, 15, 17, 37
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 6, 57–58
- The Canons of Dort (1619), especially Heads III/IV, V
- The Ecumenical Creeds (as referenced in the Three Forms)
- Lyle D. Bierma, *An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism* (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity Created for Eschatological Communion**
   - Humanity is made in the **image of God** with a destiny oriented toward eternal fellowship.
   - The original state included not only righteousness but the promise of **eternal life** upon obedience.
   - Eschatological hope is not an add-on but integral to human purpose from creation.
   - The **Sabbath rest** is a sign of humanity’s final destiny in God.
   - "God created man good and in His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 6)

2. **The Fall and Eschatological Disruption**
   - The fall brought **spiritual death** and alienation from God, disrupting humanity’s eschatological goal.
   - Sin introduced misery, mortality, and the loss of original righteousness.
   - The eschatological hope is not obliterated but now requires **redemption**.
   - Human inability to restore themselves highlights the need for divine intervention.
   - "By the disobedience of Adam, original sin is extended to all mankind." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

3. **Redemption and Restoration in Christ**
   - Christ, as the **second Adam**, restores and surpasses the original eschatological destiny.
   - Believers are united to Christ and share in his resurrection life.
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the down payment of the future inheritance.
   - The process of sanctification is oriented toward final glorification.
   - "Christ is in heaven as our Head, and we as members are on earth; but our flesh will be raised by the power of Christ, reunited with our soul, and made like Christ’s glorious body." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 57)

4. **Intermediate State and the Hope of Resurrection**
   - At death, the soul immediately enjoys **communion with Christ**.
   - The body awaits resurrection, when it will be glorified and reunited with the soul.
   - The intermediate state is a foretaste, not the fullness, of eschatological blessing.
   - The final resurrection is central to human hope and identity.
   - "My soul after this life shall be immediately taken up to Christ, my Head." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 57)

5. **Consummation: New Creation and Eternal Life**
   - The final state is the **new heavens and new earth**, where righteousness dwells.
   - Humanity’s eschatological destiny is **eternal communion with God** in a restored creation.
   - The righteous will enjoy perfect blessedness, while the wicked face eternal separation.
   - The vision of God and unending praise are the ultimate fulfillment of human nature.
   - "We shall be made perfectly blessed, inasmuch as we shall behold God face to face." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 58)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed eschatological anthropology**, emphasizing the inseparable connection between human nature and eschatological destiny. Their teaching has influenced confessional Reformed churches worldwide, providing a framework for understanding human purpose, dignity, and hope in light of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**. Their robust eschatological vision continues to inform theological anthropology and pastoral practice in the Reformed tradition.
