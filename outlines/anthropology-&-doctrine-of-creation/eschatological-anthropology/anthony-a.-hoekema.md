# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema’s approach to **eschatological anthropology** is rooted in a Reformed understanding of the **image of God**, the **holistic unity of body and soul**, and the ultimate **consummation of humanity** in Christ. He emphasizes the continuity between the present and future states of human existence, rejecting both dualistic and purely spiritualized views of the **resurrection**. For Hoekema, the destiny of redeemed humanity is inseparable from the renewal of creation and the fulfillment of God’s redemptive purposes.

- "The final destiny of man is not a disembodied existence in some faraway heaven, but life on a renewed earth." (The Bible and the Future)

## Key Works

- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Created in God’s Image (1986)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- "Body, Soul, and Spirit" in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Holistic Unity of Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is created as a unified whole, not as a soul trapped in a body.
    - Rejects Greek dualism in favor of a biblical, psychosomatic unity.
    - The resurrection affirms the goodness and permanence of embodied existence.
    - Eschatological hope involves the restoration of the whole person.
    - "Man is not complete without the body; the final state is not reached until the body is raised." (The Bible and the Future)

2. **The Image of God and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The **imago Dei** is both present and eschatologically oriented.
    - Full realization of the image occurs in glorification at Christ’s return.
    - Sanctification is a progressive restoration of the image, culminating in the resurrection.
    - The image of God includes relational, functional, and structural aspects.
    - "The image of God will be perfectly restored in man only in the life to come." (Created in God’s Image)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Resurrection**
    - There is real continuity between present and resurrected bodies.
    - Discontinuity exists in the transformation to incorruptibility and glory.
    - Personal identity is preserved through resurrection.
    - The resurrection body is spiritual in quality, not in substance.
    - "The resurrection body is the same body, but changed, glorified, and made immortal." (The Bible and the Future)

4. **Intermediate State as Incomplete**
    - The intermediate state is a conscious existence with Christ, but not the final goal.
    - Disembodiment is temporary and abnormal for human beings.
    - The ultimate hope is resurrection, not mere immortality of the soul.
    - The intermediate state affirms continuity of personal identity.
    - "The intermediate state is not the final state; it is a state of expectation." (The Bible and the Future)

5. **Consummation in the New Earth**
    - Final human destiny is embodied life on a renewed earth.
    - The new creation is the arena for perfected human existence.
    - Redemption includes both humanity and the cosmos.
    - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from cosmic renewal.
    - "The new earth will be the home of resurrected believers, who will serve God in glorified bodies forever." (The Bible and the Future)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust articulation of **eschatological anthropology** has shaped Reformed and evangelical discussions on the resurrection, the **image of God**, and the destiny of humanity. His insistence on the holistic unity of body and soul and the centrality of the new earth has countered both dualistic and escapist tendencies in Christian eschatology. Hoekema’s work continues to influence systematic theology, especially in debates over the nature of resurrection and the continuity of personal identity in the age to come.
