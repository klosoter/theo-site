# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos developed a robust **eschatological anthropology** that emphasized the integration of **redemptive history** and **consummation** in the destiny of humanity. He argued that **human nature** and **image of God** are oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment**, with the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** framing humanity’s movement from creation to final glorification.

- "Eschatology precedes soteriology in the order of the divine purpose." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Key Works

- Pauline Eschatology (1930)
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments (1948)
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church (1903)
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology (2014, posthumous translation)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Princeton Theological Review, 1900)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatology is Intrinsic to Anthropology**
    - Humanity was created with an inherent **eschatological orientation** toward glorification.
    - The **image of God** includes not only original righteousness but also the capacity for consummation.
    - The **covenant of works** set before Adam a higher, unconfirmed state—eternal life.
    - Anthropology cannot be separated from the **telos** of redemptive history.
    - "Man was from the outset created with reference to a higher, eschatological destiny." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Redemptive History Shapes Human Destiny**
    - The **history of redemption** unfolds the movement from creation to consummation.
    - Human nature is interpreted in light of the **already/not yet** dynamic.
    - Christ, as the **eschatological man**, fulfills and transforms human destiny.
    - The resurrection is the paradigm of **eschatological anthropology**.
    - "The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of the new humanity." (Pauline Eschatology)

3. **Covenant Structures Define Human Purpose**
    - The **covenant of works** established the original eschatological goal for humanity.
    - The **covenant of grace** restores and surpasses the original destiny lost in Adam.
    - Anthropology is covenantal, not merely metaphysical or philosophical.
    - The **second Adam** secures the eschatological inheritance for the elect.
    - "The eschatological is from the outset bound up with the covenant idea." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Image of God and Eschatological Consummation**
    - The **imago Dei** is dynamic, oriented toward transformation and glorification.
    - Full realization of the image awaits **eschatological consummation** in Christ.
    - Sanctification and glorification are stages in the restoration of the image.
    - Anthropology must be read in light of the **new creation**.
    - "The image of God finds its true fulfillment only in the eschatological state." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Christ as the Eschatological Man**
    - Christ embodies the **eschatological ideal** for humanity.
    - Union with Christ is the means by which believers participate in the new humanity.
    - The Spirit’s work is both **inaugurative** and **consummative** for human nature.
    - The church is the community of the **eschatological new creation**.
    - "Christ is the second Adam, the head of the eschatological humanity." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s **eschatological anthropology** profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, emphasizing the inseparability of **anthropology** and **eschatology** within the framework of redemptive history. His insights influenced generations of theologians, including Herman Ridderbos and Richard B. Gaffin Jr., and remain foundational for understanding the **already/not yet** structure of Christian existence. Vos’s work continues to inform contemporary discussions on the destiny and purpose of humanity in relation to Christ and the consummation of all things.
