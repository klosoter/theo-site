# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin’s eschatological anthropology is rooted in a robust **Reformed scholasticism** that emphasizes the original **integrity of man**, the effects of the **Fall**, and the ultimate **restoration of humanity** in the **consummation**. He maintains a clear distinction between the **state of innocence**, the **state of sin**, and the **state of glory**, arguing that human nature is destined for transformation and perfection in the eschaton through union with Christ. Turretin’s anthropology is thus inseparable from his doctrines of **original righteousness**, **resurrection**, and **beatific vision**.

- "The soul, being immortal, survives the death of the body and awaits the resurrection, when man will be restored to a more perfect state than that from which he fell." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 20.3.8)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Integrity and the Image of God**
   - Humanity was created in a state of **original righteousness** and true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - The **image of God** in man includes both natural faculties (reason, will) and supernatural gifts (righteousness).
   - The original state was mutable, allowing for the possibility of falling.
   - The eschatological goal is the restoration and perfection of this image in Christ.
   - "The image of God, though obscured by sin, is not destroyed but will be perfectly restored in the resurrection." (Institutes, 5.11.5)

2. **Anthropological Consequences of the Fall**
   - The Fall resulted in the loss of original righteousness and the corruption of human nature.
   - Death, both physical and spiritual, entered as a consequence of sin.
   - The faculties of the soul remain, but are now disordered and inclined toward evil.
   - Eschatological anthropology must account for both the ruin and the hope of renewal.
   - "By sin, man lost not the essence of the soul, but its rectitude and order." (Institutes, 9.7.3)

3. **Intermediate State and Immortality of the Soul**
   - The soul survives bodily death and enters an intermediate state awaiting resurrection.
   - The righteous experience conscious blessedness; the wicked, conscious misery.
   - The immortality of the soul is essential for eschatological fulfillment.
   - This state is provisional, not final; the body’s resurrection is necessary for consummation.
   - "The soul is immortal by nature and does not perish with the body, but awaits reunion at the resurrection." (Institutes, 20.3.8)

4. **Resurrection and the Restoration of Humanity**
   - The resurrection is both bodily and spiritual, involving the reuniting of soul and body.
   - The resurrected body will be incorruptible, spiritual, and glorified.
   - Restoration in Christ surpasses the original state, securing immutability and eternal communion with God.
   - The wicked also rise, but to judgment and eternal separation.
   - "The resurrection will restore man to a more excellent state than that from which he fell." (Institutes, 20.6.13)

5. **Consummation: Beatific Vision and Final State**
   - The ultimate end of humanity is the **beatific vision**—direct, unmediated communion with God.
   - Perfect conformity to Christ is achieved, and all faculties are rightly ordered.
   - The eschatological state is one of immutability, glory, and eternal blessedness.
   - Anthropology finds its telos in the glorification of the whole person, body and soul.
   - "In the state of glory, man will be confirmed in goodness and enjoy God forever." (Institutes, 20.7.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s eschatological anthropology profoundly shaped **Reformed orthodoxy**, providing a systematic account of human destiny grounded in the doctrines of **creation, fall, and redemption**. His careful distinctions between the various states of humanity influenced later Reformed theologians and confessional documents. Turretin’s emphasis on the **beatific vision** and the restoration of the image of God continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of glorification and the ultimate purpose of humanity in union with Christ.
