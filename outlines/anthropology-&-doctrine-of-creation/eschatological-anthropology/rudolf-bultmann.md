# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann’s approach to **eschatological anthropology** is grounded in his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation of the New Testament. He reinterprets traditional eschatological categories in light of **Heideggerian existentialism**, emphasizing the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** and the call to authentic existence rather than future-oriented apocalyptic events.

- "The real meaning of eschatology is not the expectation of a future event, but the understanding of existence in the presence of God." ("New Testament and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann" (1960)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Eschatology**
   - Interprets biblical eschatology as mythological language expressing existential truths.
   - Rejects a literal, future-oriented **apocalyptic** framework.
   - Seeks to uncover the existential significance behind eschatological symbols.
   - Emphasizes the present encounter with God over speculative future events.
   - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Existential Interpretation of Human Existence**
   - Draws on **Heidegger’s philosophy** to interpret human beings as beings-toward-death.
   - Views eschatology as a call to authentic existence in the present.
   - Human existence is defined by decision, responsibility, and openness to the divine.
   - Anthropology is inseparable from the individual's response to the **kerygma**.
   - "What matters is not a future event but the possibility of decision here and now." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

3. **Rejection of Dualistic Anthropology**
   - Denies a strict body-soul dualism in favor of a holistic view of the person.
   - Human beings are unified, historical, and situated in the world.
   - Resurrection and eternal life are understood existentially, not as physical realities.
   - The self is constituted through relationship with God, not through metaphysical substance.
   - "Man does not have a soul, he is a soul." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Eschatology as Present Encounter**
   - Eschatological reality is realized in the proclamation and acceptance of the **kerygma**.
   - The decisive moment is the present, not a future consummation.
   - Salvation is experienced as liberation from inauthentic existence now.
   - The future is significant only as it impinges upon present decision.
   - "Eschatology means the presence of eternity in time." ("History and Eschatology")

5. **Faith as Existential Response**
   - Faith is not assent to doctrinal propositions but an existential trust and openness.
   - The human response to the **kerygma** is the locus of transformation.
   - Anthropology is shaped by the individual's acceptance or rejection of God’s call.
   - Authentic existence is marked by freedom, responsibility, and hope.
   - "Faith is the abandonment of oneself to the God who is present." ("Existence and Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s **eschatological anthropology** has profoundly shaped modern theology, especially in the realms of **existentialist interpretation** and the dialogue between theology and philosophy. His emphasis on the present encounter with God and the existential dimension of faith challenged traditional apocalyptic and dualistic frameworks. While his approach has been critiqued for its radical reinterpretation of biblical categories, it remains influential in discussions of **hermeneutics**, **biblical anthropology**, and the relationship between history and faith.
