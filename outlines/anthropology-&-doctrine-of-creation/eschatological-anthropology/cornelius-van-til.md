# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s approach to **eschatological anthropology** is rooted in his commitment to the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **covenantal structure** of human existence. He insists that human destiny, identity, and knowledge are always defined in relation to the **eschatological purposes of God**, with the image of God in man oriented toward consummation in Christ. Van Til’s **presuppositional apologetics** frames anthropology as inherently teleological, with every aspect of human life directed toward either covenantal blessing or curse in the unfolding of redemptive history.

- "Man was created as a covenant being, and his destiny was to be realized in terms of the covenantal relationship to God." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Anthropology is Covenantally Eschatological**
    - Humanity is created in covenant with God, with an inherent orientation toward an eschatological goal.
    - The image of God in man is not static but points toward fulfillment in Christ.
    - The fall and redemption are understood within the context of an unfolding covenantal drama.
    - Eschatology is not an addendum but integral to understanding human nature and destiny.
    - "Man’s very being is teleological, pointing beyond itself to its fulfillment in God’s plan." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction Shapes Human Destiny**
    - Human beings are always dependent, derivative, and analogical in their existence and knowledge.
    - The absolute distinction between God and man governs anthropology and eschatology.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in God’s sovereign initiative, not human autonomy.
    - Any attempt at autonomous self-realization is a distortion of true eschatological anthropology.
    - "The creature can never become the Creator; his destiny is always to reflect, not to rival, God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Redemptive History Determines Human Identity**
    - Human identity is defined by participation in the history of redemption, not by abstract philosophical categories.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is eschatologically charged, dividing humanity into two destinies.
    - Christ as the last Adam is the telos of human nature and history.
    - Anthropology must be read through the lens of the unfolding covenantal narrative.
    - "History is the arena in which man’s eschatological destiny is worked out under God’s providence." (Christian-Theistic Ethics)

4. **Presuppositional Epistemology and Eschatological Orientation**
    - All human knowledge is covenantally conditioned and oriented toward an ultimate end.
    - Unbelief suppresses the truth of God and distorts the eschatological meaning of humanity.
    - True knowledge of self and destiny is possible only through **revelation**.
    - The antithesis in epistemology mirrors the eschatological division of humanity.
    - "Man’s knowledge is either covenantally obedient or covenantally rebellious, with eternal consequences." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Consummation in Christ as the Fulfillment of Humanity**
    - The image of God finds its fulfillment and restoration in union with Christ.
    - Eschatological anthropology centers on participation in the resurrected and glorified humanity of Christ.
    - The church is the eschatological community, embodying the new humanity.
    - Final destiny is realized corporately in the new creation, not merely individually.
    - "The consummation of man’s destiny is found only in Christ, the true image and the firstborn of the new creation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s **eschatological anthropology** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its emphasis on the **covenantal structure** of human existence and the teleological orientation of all anthropology. His insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief has influenced generations of theologians and apologists. Van Til’s thought continues to challenge both secular and Christian anthropologies to account for humanity’s destiny within the context of redemptive history and the consummation in Christ.
