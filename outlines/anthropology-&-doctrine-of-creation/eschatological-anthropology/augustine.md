# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s eschatological anthropology is grounded in his understanding of **original sin**, the **imago Dei**, and the ultimate **resurrection of the body**. He emphasizes the transformation of human nature through **grace**, culminating in the restoration and glorification of humanity at the **consummation** of history, where the redeemed will enjoy eternal communion with God.

- "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (City of God, XXII.21)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity Created for Eternal Communion**
   - Humanity was created in the **image of God** with the capacity for eternal fellowship.
   - The original state included both **bodily and spiritual integrity**.
   - Eschatological fulfillment restores and perfects this original design.
   - The telos of human existence is **beatific vision**.
   - "Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our heart is restless until it rests in Thee." (Confessions I.1)

2. **The Corruption and Restoration of Human Nature**
   - **Original sin** disrupted humanity’s destiny and corrupted both soul and body.
   - Only through **divine grace** can human nature be healed and restored.
   - The resurrection involves not merely soul survival but bodily renewal.
   - The eschaton brings the full restoration of the **imago Dei**.
   - "By the mercy of God, through the grace of the Mediator, man is delivered from the body of this death." (City of God, XIII.3)

3. **Resurrection of the Body**
   - The body is not discarded but transformed in the resurrection.
   - The resurrected body will be **incorruptible, spiritual, and glorified**.
   - Bodily resurrection is essential for the fullness of human personhood.
   - The unity of body and soul is preserved in the eschatological state.
   - "The flesh shall rise again, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible." (Enchiridion 84)

4. **The Two Cities and Ultimate Destiny**
   - Humanity is divided between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**.
   - The destinies of the two cities are determined by their loves and ultimate ends.
   - The redeemed will enjoy eternal life; the lost, eternal separation from God.
   - Eschatological anthropology is inseparable from the doctrine of **final judgment**.
   - "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to the contempt of God; love of God, even to the contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

5. **Beatific Vision and Perfected Will**
   - The ultimate fulfillment of humanity is the **vision of God**.
   - In the eschaton, the human will is perfectly aligned with God’s will.
   - Sin and the possibility of falling away are removed in the perfected state.
   - The soul’s joy is completed in unmediated communion with the Triune God.
   - "There we shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise." (City of God, XXII.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s eschatological anthropology profoundly shaped **Western Christian thought** on the destiny of humanity, the resurrection, and the nature of eternal life. His synthesis of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation** provided a framework for later theological reflection on the human person in relation to God’s ultimate purposes. The enduring influence of his doctrine of the **beatific vision** and the resurrection of the body continues to inform both Catholic and Protestant eschatologies.
