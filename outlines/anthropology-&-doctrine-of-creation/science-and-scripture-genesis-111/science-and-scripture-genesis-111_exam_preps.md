### TITLE
Reading Genesis 1–11 Under Christ’s Lordship: Literal History, Theological Architecture, and Scientific Challenge

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how to confess Genesis 1–11 as truthful, covenantal history within **classical theism** and **Reformed hermeneutics**, while facing modern scientific reconstructions of origins.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Herman Bavinck, John H. Walton.
- Key traditions: patristic exegesis, Reformed scholastic and confessional theology, Old Princeton, contemporary evangelical and Reformed biblical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: literal six days and age of earth within Reformed theology, genre and **mythic** language, extent of the flood, historical Adam.
  - External: higher criticism and myth theory, evolutionary naturalism, liberal and neo-orthodox readings of Genesis.
  - Contemporary: human origins and population genetics, ancient Near Eastern backgrounds, the cultural mandate and ecological ethics.
- Defended position: Genesis 1–11 is **covenantal, temple-structured, literal history**, given in highly ordered, analogical narrative that establishes the real creation of all things in six days, a real Adam as federal head, a global flood, and a stable framework for but not subservient to natural science.

### ESSAY
To defend Genesis 1–11 in a Westminster oral examination, you must show that you can hold together three things without capitulation or evasion: the **ontological claims** about God and the world that these chapters make, the **covenantal and redemptive-historical structure** of the narrative, and the serious challenge posed by modern scientific and critical reconstructions of origins. Put differently, the question is not merely what Genesis 1–11 says, but how we know what kind of discourse it is and how we normatively relate it to external claims from science and critical scholarship while remaining within a confessional commitment to **Scripture’s inerrancy** and **sufficient clarity**.

Any adequate account must begin with God, not with science. Genesis 1 opens not with a phenomenological description but with a metaphysical assertion: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” This presupposes **creation ex nihilo**, **divine aseity**, and **divine sovereignty** over all time and space. Genesis 1–11 is thus not primitive science but sovereign testimony from the Creator about the origin and ordering of the world and of the covenantal history that climaxes in Christ. That theological starting point already sets limits on how “science” may correct or norm Scripture: because of **divine inspiration**, Genesis 1–11 has a magisterial rather than ministerial role. But to say that does not yet settle how its literary form relates to chronology, phenomenology, and accommodation; that is where our decisive figures enter.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430), though separated from us by the absence of modern science, is decisive for the conceptualization of the relation between Genesis, truth, and learned opinion. In his Confessions and more extensively in The Literal Meaning of Genesis, Augustine wrestles with how to read the “days,” the creation of light before the luminaries, and the formation of Adam. He defends **creation ex nihilo**, an originally good world, and a real historical fall in Adam. Yet he suggests that the six days might not be temporal periods like ours but a literary ordering that reflects angelic knowledge and the logical structuring of creation. He defends rigorously that Genesis is to be read literally, but he defines “literal” as “according to the intention of the author,” which he thinks may involve non-chronological ordering. He famously warns Christians not to make dogmatic claims about astronomy or cosmology from Genesis where the text does not intend to teach such matters, lest unbelievers who know these matters by experience and reason mock Scripture and reject its central saving claims.

Examiners will press: does Augustine’s appeal to accommodation and his non-chronological days open the door for modern concordism or for wholesale re-reading of Genesis 1–11 to fit evolutionary science? Here one must be precise. Augustine’s use of **accommodation** is always bounded by what he believes Scripture truly asserts. He will not allow Genesis to be reduced to myth, nor Adam and Eve to be reduced to symbols. He insists on a historical first pair and a historical fall that propagates sin to their descendants. His willingness to consider non-24-hour days stems from exegesis of the text and a metaphysics of God’s timeless act, not from pressure by an external scientific paradigm. That is a crucial distinction: Genesis 1–11 must be interpreted according to internal textual and theological features, and only then may one ask how that reading relates to external knowledge claims.

Calvin (1509–1564) as the fountainhead of **Reformed hermeneutics** and **federal theology** further sharpens the status of Genesis 1–11. In his Commentary on Genesis and the Institutes, he develops what later Reformed theology will call **the covenant of works**, which presupposes a historical Adam placed under a probationary command. For Calvin, Adam is not a mythic Everyman but the real first father of the human race, whose disobedience plunges his descendants into **original sin**. The genealogy of Genesis 5 and the narrative of Genesis 3 are taken as plain history. Calvin is particularly important for the relation of Genesis to science because of his doctrine of **accommodation** and his concern for the **simple sense** of Scripture for unlearned readers.

Calvin insists that Moses “accommodated his discourse to the received custom” of people without specialized knowledge. Sun, moon, and stars are described phenomenologically, not in technical astronomical terms. Yet for Calvin, the six days are “distinct periods of time” and the order of events is a real sequence, not a purely literary device. When examiners ask, “Does Calvin allow you to treat Genesis 1 as merely a poetic temple text detached from actual chronology?” you must answer: no. Calvin reads Genesis as historical narrative with rich theological content. He understands **anthropomorphic** and **phenomenological** language, but he will not move major historical assertions into the realm of symbol. His hermeneutic refuses both naive literalism and liberal demythologization. That Calvin reads Genesis 1–11 as history does not mean he gives it to science; it means that for him, history itself is already theological, and Genesis is its inspired account.

Old Princeton, represented by B. B. Warfield (1851–1921), brings the discussion into the modern scientific frame. Warfield is pivotal because he represents a conservative, inerrantist effort to reconcile Genesis and evolutionary theory without surrendering the core of Reformed **federal theology**. In his essays on evolution and creation, Warfield defends **biblical inerrancy**, a historical Adam, and the doctrine of original sin, yet he entertains what we would now call theistic evolution, suggesting that God may have used evolutionary processes to produce the human body into which he specially created and infused the soul. He regards Genesis 2 as teaching a special divine act with respect to Adam, but he is willing to think of Genesis 1 as compatible with longer ages and non-literal days.

Examiners will probe: did Warfield open the door for the erosion of historical Adam and therefore of **federal headship** and **penal substitutionary atonement**? There are two points to make. First, Warfield himself explicitly affirms a single historical pair, Adam and Eve, from whom all humans descend, and on whose disobedience the guilt and corruption of the race depend. Second, his method is inductive: begin with what Scripture actually teaches and hold that firmly, then within that nonnegotiable circle consider how far the scientific picture can be integrated as a secondary explanatory model. That method is sound. The problem in much later theistic evolution is not Warfield’s principle of integrating science ministerially, but the abandonment of the nonnegotiables he maintained. Genesis 3 reduced to myth or Adam dissolved into a representative of a large population is not Warfield but a betrayal of his own constraints.

Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) stands as the most theologically integrative figure on this topic. In his Reformed Dogmatics and his shorter works on creation and science, Bavinck holds unmoved to **classical theism**, **divine simplicity**, and **organic inspiration**, and yet engages modern science, geology, and evolutionary theory with unusual breadth. For Bavinck, Genesis 1–2 gives a real account of the origin of the world and of humanity, but does so in a “pictorial, anthropomorphic” form suitable to its covenantal purpose. He accepts the earth’s great age and is open to reading the days as non-literal, but he vigorously defends a historical Adam as the common ancestor and covenant head of humanity. Bavinck sees Genesis 1–11 as the overture to the entire history of redemption: creation, fall, flood, dispersion, and Abrahamic election.

Bavinck is instructive precisely because he refuses both rationalist harmonization and sceptical demythologization. When confronted with evolutionary biology, he acknowledges empirical findings but resists naturalistic metaphysics. Science may describe secondary causes, but it cannot overturn the theological affirmations of Genesis about **imago Dei**, human uniqueness, sin, and the teleology of creation. When examiners challenge: “If geology and cosmology suggest billions of years and an evolutionary history of life, does Bavinck permit you to reinterpret Genesis 1–11 so radically that they cease to function as history?” you should argue that for Bavinck, the genre of Genesis is best described as sacred history: history with a didactic, typological shaping, but not less than history. The flood may be narrated with cosmic imagery, but it refers to a real, catastrophic judgment on the world. Babel’s tower may employ **mythic** motifs, but it narrates a real divine intervention in human language and culture. Bavinck’s decisive contribution is his insistence on the inseparability of dogmatics and exegesis: metaphysics without text is speculative, but exegesis without metaphysics collapses under external pressures.

John H. Walton (b. 1952) must be treated because he represents a major contemporary evangelical proposal that has significantly influenced debates on Genesis and science. In The Lost World of Genesis One and related works, Walton argues that Genesis 1 is a temple inauguration text, focused on assigning functions within a cosmic sacred space, rather than an account of material origins. Drawing on ancient Near Eastern backgrounds, he claims that “create” in Genesis 1 is primarily about ordering and role-assignment, not ex nihilo origination. Genesis 1–2 are said to teach that God is the Creator, that humans bear **imago Dei**, and that the world is his temple, but not to specify how or when material structures arose. This approach ostensibly allows believers to accept mainstream evolutionary accounts of material origins while preserving biblical theology.

Examiners will put pressure here: does Walton’s functional reading allow Genesis 1–11 to retain status as history in any strong sense, and does it protect the doctrines of historical Adam and original sin? There are serious concerns. First, the text itself repeatedly links divine speech to the coming-to-be of entities, not merely their functions. “Let the earth bring forth living creatures” naturally reads as an origin statement. Second, other parts of Scripture, such as Psalm 33 and Hebrews 11, treat creation as a divine fiat bringing realities into existence. Third, Walton’s approach can tend toward treating Genesis 1 as almost non-empirical, such that it is insulated from any conflict with science by making very few ontological claims about the material world. That seems out of step with the strong ontological assertions of the opening verse and the emphatic distinction between Creator and creation. Walton’s sensitivity to **ancient Near Eastern backgrounds** and temple imagery is a real gain, but his sharp separation of function from ontology and his reluctance to affirm specific historical and chronological content in Genesis undercut the confidence with which the church can confess these chapters as **publicly assertive truth** about the world.

At this point, the internal debates within the Reformed and broader evangelical traditions come into clear focus. One axis of dispute concerns the days of Genesis 1 and the age of the earth. Young-earth six-day creationists insist that **ordinary providence** and the straightforward reading of the text require six consecutive, 24-hour days and a recent creation, often tying this closely to confessional fidelity. Other Reformed theologians, following Augustine, Calvin’s nuanced phenomenology, Warfield, and Bavinck, allow for non-24-hour days, literary structuring, and a much older earth while holding firmly to inerrancy, a historical Adam, and a global or nearly global flood. In an oral defense, you must make clear that the Reformed confessions specify that God created all things “in the space of six days” but do not define the exact nature of those days, leaving legitimate room for intramural debate so long as the supernatural, historical, and divine-initiative character of creation is upheld.

A second internal debate concerns the nature of the flood. Some argue for a strictly global deluge that covered the entire globe in modern geographic terms, others for a massive but regionally focused judgment that functioned as a de facto destruction of “the world” known to Noah. The text uses universal language, yet it also often uses universal terms phenomenologically. What is not negotiable is that the flood is a supernatural judgment in real space and time, that it resets the covenantal order with a renewed mandate to Noah, and that Peter can appeal to it in 2 Peter 3 as a type of the coming universal judgment. Any reading that renders the flood a local, minor event shielded from geological detection by appealing to genre is suspect.

The external debates pit a confessional reading of Genesis 1–11 against two main rival frameworks: historical-critical myth theory and evolutionary naturalism. Nineteenth and twentieth century higher criticism, influenced by Gunkel and others, tended to classify Genesis 1–11 as “myth” or “saga,” arising from Israel’s adaptation of ancient Near Eastern cosmogonies. Its function was said to be identity formation, not truthful assertion about events. On this view, there is no historical Adam, no actual global flood, no single origin of humanity, and the narratives are theological projections. From the other direction, evolutionary naturalism treats the scientific reconstruction of cosmic and biological history as exhaustive and excludes divine agency by methodological fiat. It concedes that Genesis may have religious value, but insists that the real story of the world is told by physics, geology, and biology, with no reference to **providence** or **teleology**.

In responding, you must keep the categories distinct. To historical-critical myth theory, the response is fundamentally hermeneutical and canonical. Genesis 1–11 is not a free-standing set of etiological legends but the foundational section of the Pentateuch, woven into genealogies and legal codes, and assumed as history by later biblical authors and by Christ himself. Paul’s argument in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 presupposes a historical Adam whose disobedience is the ground of universal condemnation and whose typological relation to Christ undergirds **federal representation**. Jesus’ appeal to “the beginning of creation” and to Noah in his eschatological discourse treats these narratives as history. To say that the genre is richly literary and temple-shaped does not allow us to deny the referential backbone of the text. The church’s rule of faith has always treated Genesis 1–11 as describing real divine acts in time and space, even as it has debated details of chronology and description.

To evolutionary naturalism, the response is primarily theological and philosophical. If **divine aseity** and **creation ex nihilo** are true, then any scientific account that refuses to acknowledge the Creator as the ultimate cause is at best partial and at worst idolatrous. Science as the study of God’s ordinary providence has real ministerial authority, but the metaphysical claim that there is nothing beyond nature is a religious confession, not a deliverance of data. Moreover, the explanatory scope of evolutionary theory for specifically human realities remains contested. Features like rationality, moral awareness, and religious consciousness, which Genesis grounds in **imago Dei**, resist reduction to blind selection. A Reformed account will affirm that genuine empirical evidence about processes and time scales in God’s world must be taken seriously, but that no empirical theory can overturn the Creator’s testimony about the origins and purposes of that world.

The contemporary debates on human origins and population genetics must be faced candidly. Some genetic models suggest that the human population was never as small as two individuals in the distant past, challenging the idea of descent from a single couple. Various proposals have arisen to reconcile this with Scripture: Adam as the elected representative of a larger population, Adam and Eve as two of many first humans, or Adam and Eve as late Neolithic figures into whose world God speaks covenantally. Each of these proposals faces serious theological costs. If Adam is merely one among many and others lack his guilt, it is hard to maintain universal condemnation in Adam as Paul asserts. If Adam’s historicity is reduced to literary representation, then Christ’s historical obedience and resurrection lose the typological backbone Paul presupposes.

The position I defend, in line with Augustine’s and Bavinck’s dogmatic instincts and Calvin’s exegetical sobriety, is that Genesis 1–11 is **covenantal, temple-structured, literal history**. It narrates real divine actions in time and space through a genre that is elevated, highly patterned, and theologically saturated. The six days are best read as God’s workdays forming a creational week that grounds our own, though one may acknowledge analogical features and avoid dogmatism on the exact mechanics. Adam and Eve are the first human pair, specially created by God, the sole progenitors of the human race, and the federal head and helper whose fall corrupts their descendants. The flood is a real, epochal, global judgment that reconfigures the earth, even if our current geological models cannot easily map it. Babel narrates an actual divine act of judgment on human pride and the diversification of languages.

This position allows one to affirm modern science where it reports stable, repeatable features of God’s ordinary providence, while resisting its extrapolations into origins where divine speech and extraordinary acts are primary. It requires the courage to say that on some questions, such as the age of the earth or certain reconstructions of deep-time biological history, our exegesis of Genesis and our broader dogmatic system commit us to revising or at least bracketing prevailing scientific narratives. That is not anti-intellectual; it is a recognition that because of **the noetic effects of sin** and the methodological naturalism of modern science, Scripture must function as the supreme norm.

Finally, Genesis 1–11 cannot be isolated from other loci. The doctrine of **providence** flows directly from God’s covenantal ordering of creation in these chapters. The **cultural mandate** grounds Christian ethics, including ecological responsibility and technological development. The **Sabbath** ordinance in Genesis 2 shapes Christian worship and eschatology. The seed promise in Genesis 3:15 inaugurates the history of redemption that culminates in Christ as the last Adam and true temple. In an oral defense, you must be able to move fluidly from Genesis 1–11 to Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology, showing that a compromised reading of these foundational chapters will distort the entire system of doctrine. To deny a historical Adam is not an isolated exegetical move; it is to destabilize the federal structure of the gospel itself.

When examiners press, “Are you prepared to say that if genetic models contradict a single-couple origin, then the models must be wrong or limited?” you must have the courage to answer yes, while explaining that models are theory-laden interpretations of data, and our commitment to **Scripture’s perspicuity and authority** in matters it addresses is nonnegotiable. When they ask, “Does your view of Genesis 1–11 make science impossible or irrelevant?” you should answer no, because the same God who speaks in Scripture ordains the regularities that science describes. But science must know its place; it is a servant, not a judge, of the Creator’s own account of his works.

Thus, a confessional, Christ-ruled reading of Genesis 1–11 receives these chapters as truthful covenant history, recognizes their elevated and temple-structured form, and engages science critically rather than deferentially. Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, Bavinck, and Walton each contribute lenses and questions. Yet at the end of the day, the church must side with those who allow Scripture’s own literary and theological character, rather than external pressure, to define the meaning of the beginning.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Genesis 1–11 is **covenantal, temple-structured, literal history** that truthfully narrates God’s creation, the first humans, the fall, the flood, and Babel, in elevated, analogical narrative that establishes the framework for all later redemptive history.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: literal but non-chronological days, strong on historical Adam and fall, early articulation of **accommodation** within strict commitment to truthfulness.
  - Calvin: historical-grammatical reading, six real days and real Adam, robust **accommodation** and phenomenological language without demythologizing.
  - Warfield: Old Princeton inerrantist, open to theistic evolution of the body while insisting on historical Adam, original sin, and **federal headship**.
  - Bavinck: integrative Reformed dogmatician, affirms historical Adam and sacred history of Genesis 1–11, engages science while maintaining **creation ex nihilo** and **imago Dei**.
  - Walton: ANE-focused reading, functional and temple inauguration emphasis, tends to minimize material origins and chronological claims.
- Debates:
  - Internal: nature of the days and age of earth, global versus regional flood, degree of literary shaping, and the status of Adam as sole progenitor.
  - External: historical-critical myth readings and evolutionary naturalism versus **inerrant**, canonical, redemptive-historical exegesis.
  - Contemporary: human population genetics and historical Adam, ANE backgrounds and genre, ecological and cultural mandate implications.
- Defended position: Genesis 1–11 gives a real, divinely inspired history of the origins and early world, with a real first couple and fall, a catastrophic global flood, and a covenantal structure; its elevated, temple-shaped form does not negate but enriches its historical truth, and it normatively governs how Christians assess scientific claims about origins.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Are the six days 24-hour days? They are real divine workdays grounding our week, with analogical features, but I do not make their exact temporal duration a dogmatic test, so long as creation remains a supernatural, historical work of God.
  - Is Adam the sole progenitor of all humans? Yes, Adam and Eve are the first human pair, from whom all humans descend, and Adam functions as federal head whose sin is imputed to all.
  - How do you respond to genetic models that deny a bottleneck of two? Models are theory-laden and revisable; where they conflict with Scripture’s clear teaching, we treat them as limited or mistaken.
  - Is Genesis 1–11 myth or history? It is sacred, theologically shaped history that may employ **mythic** imagery but asserts real events and divine acts.
  - Does your view make science impossible? No, it subordinates science to **Scripture’s authority**, affirming science’s ministerial role in describing God’s ordinary providence while refusing to let it overrule revealed origins.
