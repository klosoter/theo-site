# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that man is constituted by both **body and soul** in an inseparable union. He maintains that the **image of God** is expressed in this composite being, and that the integrity of human nature depends on the harmonious relationship between the **material** and **immaterial** aspects of the person.

- "Man is not man except as composed of soul and body; nor is the soul the whole man, but only a part, although the principal part." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.7.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 5–10)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Soul (in Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature as a True Union of Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is essentially a composite of **material body** and **immaterial soul**.
    - The soul is the **form** of the body, giving life and identity to the person.
    - Neither body nor soul alone constitutes the full human person.
    - The union is **natural** and not accidental, designed by God in creation.
    - "The soul is not the whole man, but only a part, although the principal part." (Institutes 5.7.2)

2. **The Image of God in Psychosomatic Unity**
    - The **image of God** is primarily in the soul, especially in **reason** and **righteousness**.
    - Yet, the body participates as the instrument of the soul’s faculties.
    - The whole person, body and soul, is created in God’s image.
    - The restoration of the image in redemption involves both aspects.
    - "The image of God is placed principally in the soul, but not exclusively." (Institutes 5.10.2)

3. **Rejection of Dualistic Anthropology**
    - Turretin opposes Platonic or Gnostic separations of body and soul.
    - The body is not a prison but a good creation, essential to human nature.
    - Death is an unnatural rupture, not the soul’s liberation.
    - The hope of resurrection affirms the goodness of the body.
    - "The separation of soul and body is not natural, but penal and violent." (Institutes 5.7.8)

4. **Unity Maintained in Life and Death**
    - In life, the soul and body function in mutual dependence.
    - At death, the soul survives but awaits reunion with the body.
    - Full human existence is restored only in the resurrection.
    - The intermediate state is incomplete, not the final goal.
    - "The soul, separated from the body, does not constitute a perfect man." (Institutes 5.7.8)

5. **Implications for Sin and Redemption**
    - Sin affects both body and soul, corrupting the whole person.
    - Redemption in Christ restores psychosomatic unity.
    - Sanctification involves bodily discipline as well as spiritual renewal.
    - The resurrection consummates salvation in both body and soul.
    - "Christ came to redeem not only souls, but also bodies." (Institutes 13.2.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust defense of **psychosomatic unity** shaped Reformed anthropology, countering both medieval dualism and later Enlightenment reductionism. His careful distinctions influenced subsequent Reformed confessions and systematic theologies, ensuring that the **integrity of human nature** remained central in discussions of the **image of God**, sin, and redemption. Turretin’s work continues to serve as a foundational resource for those articulating a holistic, biblically grounded view of human beings.
