# Nancey Murphy (1951–)

Nancey Murphy is a leading advocate for **non-reductive physicalism** in theological anthropology, emphasizing the **psychosomatic unity** of the human person. She challenges traditional **dualistic** views, arguing that humans are best understood as **embodied beings** whose mental and spiritual capacities emerge from their physical constitution, while still affirming the reality of the **soul** and **spiritual life** within a physicalist framework.

- "We are our bodies; there is no additional metaphysical element such as a mind or soul or spirit." (Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?)

## Key Works

- Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies? (1998)
- Whatever Happened to the Soul? Scientific and Theological Portraits of Human Nature (co-edited, 1998)
- Theology in the Age of Scientific Reasoning (1990)
- On the Moral Nature of the Universe (with George F.R. Ellis, 1996)
- Did My Neurons Make Me Do It? Philosophical and Neurobiological Perspectives on Moral Responsibility and Free Will (with Warren S. Brown, 2007)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Non-reductive Physicalism**
    - Asserts that humans are wholly physical beings, but mental and spiritual properties are not reducible to biology.
    - Rejects both **substance dualism** and strict materialist reductionism.
    - Emphasizes the emergence of higher-level capacities from complex physical systems.
    - Maintains that spiritual life is realized in and through bodily existence.
    "Nonreductive physicalism is the view that while humans are composed only of matter, this matter is organized in such a way that it gives rise to all the capacities attributed to the soul." (Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?)

2. **Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Argues that human beings are an integrated unity of body and mind, not a composite of separable parts.
    - Draws on biblical anthropology, especially the Hebrew concept of **nephesh**.
    - Sees mental, spiritual, and physical aspects as inseparable in human experience.
    - Opposes dualistic interpretations that fragment the human person.
    "The biblical view is that human beings are animated bodies, not incarnated souls." (Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?)

3. **Compatibility with Neuroscience**
    - Engages contemporary neuroscience to inform **theological anthropology**.
    - Argues that advances in brain science support a physicalist understanding of personhood.
    - Maintains that cognitive and spiritual functions are grounded in neural processes.
    - Sees no conflict between scientific findings and robust theological claims about human nature.
    "Neuroscience has made it increasingly difficult to maintain a dualist view of human nature." (Whatever Happened to the Soul?)

4. **Holistic Salvation and Resurrection**
    - Interprets **resurrection** as the reconstitution of the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of personal identity through bodily existence.
    - Argues that Christian hope is for the transformation of the entire person.
    - Rejects notions of disembodied existence as ultimate destiny.
    "Christian hope is for the resurrection of the body, not the immortality of the soul." (Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?)

5. **Ethical and Moral Responsibility**
    - Affirms that physicalist anthropology upholds genuine moral agency.
    - Argues that moral responsibility is compatible with neural determinacy and complexity.
    - Sees human freedom as emerging from, not threatened by, physical processes.
    - Maintains that ethical life is fully embodied and socially embedded.
    "Our moral and spiritual capacities are realized in and through our physical being." (Did My Neurons Make Me Do It?)

## Legacy and Impact

Murphy’s advocacy for **non-reductive physicalism** has significantly shaped contemporary debates in theology and science, especially regarding the nature of the human person. Her work challenges traditional **dualism** and has encouraged theologians to integrate findings from neuroscience and philosophy into Christian anthropology. By emphasizing **psychosomatic unity**, she has contributed to a more holistic understanding of salvation, resurrection, and moral responsibility within the Reformed tradition and beyond.
