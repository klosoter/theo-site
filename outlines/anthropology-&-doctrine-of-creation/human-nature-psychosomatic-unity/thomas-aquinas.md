# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulates a robust doctrine of **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, holding that the human person is a single substance composed of both **body and soul**. For Aquinas, the **soul** is the **form of the body**, and true human existence requires the integration of both material and immaterial aspects, rejecting any dualistic separation. This unity grounds his understanding of **personhood**, **resurrection**, and the **imago Dei**.

- "The soul is united to the body as its form, and thus man is one being, not two." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Soul as the Form of the Body**
    - The **soul** is not a separate substance but the substantial form that actualizes the body.
    - Human beings are not composites of two substances, but a single substance with two principles: **matter** and **form**.
    - The soul gives life, unity, and identity to the body.
    - The **intellectual soul** is unique in being both subsistent and the form of the body.
    - "The soul is united to the body as its form, and thus man is one being, not two." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

2. **Psychosomatic Unity and Personhood**
    - True **personhood** arises from the unity of body and soul, not from either alone.
    - The human person is a rational animal, defined by this composite nature.
    - The separation of soul from body (as in death) is unnatural and temporary.
    - Full human flourishing and moral action require both bodily and spiritual faculties.
    - "A man is not a soul only, but something composed of soul and body." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 4)

3. **Imago Dei in the Composite**
    - The **image of God** is found in the rational soul, but expressed through the whole person.
    - Both body and soul participate in the image, as the body is ordered to the soul’s rationality.
    - The unity of body and soul reflects the unity of God’s creative act.
    - Human dignity is rooted in this psychosomatic unity, not in the soul alone.
    - "The image of God is found in man according as he is a rational being, and this consists in his soul and body." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 93, a. 4)

4. **Resurrection and the Integrity of Human Nature**
    - The doctrine of **resurrection** presupposes the necessity of the body for complete human existence.
    - The soul separated from the body is incomplete and awaits reunion.
    - Final beatitude requires the restoration of the psychosomatic unity.
    - The resurrection body will be spiritualized, but still truly material and united to the soul.
    - "The soul is naturally united to the body, and it is against its nature to be without the body." (Summa Contra Gentiles IV, ch. 79)

5. **Rejection of Platonic Dualism**
    - Aquinas rejects the Platonic idea that the soul is imprisoned in the body.
    - The body is not a mere vessel, but essential to human identity.
    - The soul’s operations (e.g., intellect, will) are rooted in bodily faculties.
    - Salvation and sanctification involve the whole person, not just the soul.
    - "It is not the soul alone that is man, but the soul and the body together." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s account of **psychosomatic unity** has profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian anthropology, providing a metaphysical foundation for doctrines like the **resurrection** and the **imago Dei**. His synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology set the standard for later discussions of human nature, influencing Reformed, Lutheran, and modern philosophical theology. The Thomistic view remains a central reference point in debates about the nature of the soul, embodiment, and personal identity.
