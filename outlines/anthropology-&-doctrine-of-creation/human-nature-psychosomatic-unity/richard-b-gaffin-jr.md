# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, rejecting any dualistic separation between body and soul. He insists that Scripture presents humans as a unified whole, created in the **image of God**, and that redemption in Christ encompasses both the physical and spiritual aspects of humanity.

- "Scripture views man as a unity, a psychosomatic whole, not as a soul imprisoned in a body." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith" (contributor)
- "The Glory of God and Paul’s Soteriology" (in The Glory of God)
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humans are created as a unified whole, not as separate entities of body and soul.
    - The **image of God** is expressed in the totality of human existence.
    - Biblical anthropology resists Greek dualism and affirms the integration of physical and spiritual.
    - Redemption in Christ restores the whole person, not just the soul.
    - "Man is not a soul imprisoned in a body but a living being in whom body and soul are inseparably joined." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Resurrection as Restoration of the Whole Person**
    - The resurrection of Christ is the pattern for human resurrection, involving both body and spirit.
    - Final salvation includes the transformation and glorification of the body.
    - The hope of believers is not disembodied existence but renewed, embodied life.
    - The **eschatological consummation** is psychosomatic, not merely spiritual.
    - "The resurrection is the redemption of the whole person, body and soul." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Rejection of Platonic Dualism**
    - Gaffin critiques Platonic and Gnostic tendencies to devalue the body.
    - He insists that biblical teaching affirms the goodness of creation, including the material.
    - The soul is not inherently superior to the body; both are integral to human identity.
    - Salvation is not escape from the body but its renewal.
    - "Paul’s anthropology is not dualistic but holistic." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Union with Christ and Human Nature**
    - Union with Christ encompasses all aspects of human existence.
    - Sanctification and glorification involve both inner renewal and bodily transformation.
    - The Spirit’s work is not limited to the soul but extends to the body.
    - The **ordo salutis** is grounded in the believer’s union with the resurrected Christ.
    - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality, embracing the whole person." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Implications for Christian Life and Ethics**
    - Christian living involves stewardship of both body and soul.
    - Bodily life and physical existence have enduring theological significance.
    - Worship, service, and ethics are embodied practices.
    - The church’s ministry addresses holistic human needs, not just spiritual concerns.
    - "The Christian life is lived in the body, awaiting its final redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in Pauline studies and systematic theology. His rejection of dualism and emphasis on the resurrection have influenced discussions on the **image of God**, eschatology, and the nature of salvation. Gaffin’s work continues to inform theological education and pastoral practice, encouraging a holistic view of human nature that is faithful to Scripture and central to Reformed doctrine.
