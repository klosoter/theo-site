# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann emphasizes the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, rejecting dualistic separations between **body and soul**. For Moltmann, human beings are fundamentally embodied, relational creatures whose identity and destiny are shaped by their participation in **creation**, **community**, and the **eschatological hope** of resurrection.

- "Man does not have a body; he is body, and he does not have a soul; he is soul." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation (1991)
- God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God (1985)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Man: Christian Anthropology in the Conflicts of the Present (1971)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity of the Human Person**
    - Rejects anthropological dualism; affirms that humans are an inseparable unity of **body and soul**.
    - Human existence is always embodied and situated within the material world.
    - The soul is not a separate substance but the life of the body in relation to God.
    - Human dignity and identity are rooted in this holistic unity.
    - "The human being is a psychosomatic unity, not a soul imprisoned in a body." (Man: Christian Anthropology)

2. **Relationality and Community**
    - Human nature is fundamentally relational, shaped by **community** and social interaction.
    - The **image of God** is realized in relationship, not in isolated individuals.
    - Sin and alienation are disruptions of relational wholeness.
    - Redemption restores both personal and communal relationships.
    - "Human beings are created for fellowship, not for isolation." (God in Creation)

3. **Creation and Embodiment**
    - Human beings are creatures within the broader context of **creation**.
    - Embodiment is a gift, not a limitation, and is essential to human vocation.
    - The material world is affirmed as good and destined for renewal.
    - **Ecological responsibility** is a theological imperative.
    - "To be human is to be a body in the world, open to God and to others." (The Spirit of Life)

4. **Eschatological Hope and Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection of the body** is central to Christian hope, affirming the value of embodied existence.
    - **Eschatology** envisions the transformation, not the abandonment, of creation and humanity.
    - The future of humanity is bodily participation in the new creation.
    - Rejects notions of disembodied immortality.
    - "The resurrection of the dead means the redemption of the whole person, body and soul." (The Coming of God)

5. **Pneumatology and Human Life**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the source of life, animating and sustaining human existence.
    - Spirit and body are integrally related; the Spirit is not opposed to materiality.
    - Spiritual life is embodied life, lived in the power of the Spirit.
    - The Spirit anticipates and enables the renewal of all creation.
    - "The Spirit is the power of life, the breath of creation, and the guarantee of resurrection." (The Spirit of Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly influenced contemporary theological anthropology, especially in ecumenical and liberationist circles. His integration of **creation, eschatology, and pneumatology** has encouraged a holistic view of human nature that resists both reductionist materialism and dualistic spiritualism. Moltmann’s work continues to shape discussions on embodiment, ecological responsibility, and the communal dimensions of salvation.
