# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline understood **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, emphasizing the inseparable integration of **body and soul** within the framework of **covenant theology**. He argued that humanity’s original constitution in the **image of God** involved both material and immaterial aspects, which together participate in the covenantal relationship with God and the created order.

- "Man is a psychosomatic unity, a living soul, whose bodily existence is essential to his image-bearing function." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- By Oath Consigned
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humanity is created as an indivisible whole, integrating **body and soul**.
    - The **image of God** is expressed in this unified constitution.
    - Both physical and spiritual aspects are essential for covenantal function.
    - Dualism is rejected in favor of a holistic anthropology.
    - "The biblical view is not of a soul imprisoned in a body but of man as a living soul, a psychosomatic unity." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Context of Human Nature**
    - Human nature is defined by its role in the **covenant of works**.
    - The psychosomatic unity is necessary for fulfilling covenantal responsibilities.
    - The **covenant relationship** encompasses the whole person, not just the soul.
    - The fall and redemption affect both body and soul together.
    - "The covenant order is not just spiritual but embraces the totality of human existence." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Image of God as Functional and Structural**
    - The **imago Dei** is not merely spiritual but includes the physical.
    - Human dominion and representation are exercised through psychosomatic unity.
    - The body is essential for mediating God’s rule in creation.
    - The structural unity undergirds humanity’s functional calling.
    - "Man’s body is not an appendage but integral to his image-bearing vocation." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Eschatological Consummation of Human Nature**
    - The resurrection affirms the enduring value of the body.
    - Final redemption restores and glorifies the psychosomatic unity.
    - The new creation is populated by embodied, not disembodied, humans.
    - Eschatology underscores the holistic destiny of humanity.
    - "The hope of resurrection is the hope of restored psychosomatic unity in glory." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Anti-Dualism and Biblical Anthropology**
    - Kline opposes Greek-influenced dualism in Christian anthropology.
    - He insists on the biblical pattern of integrated human existence.
    - The soul without the body is an abnormal, interim state.
    - True human life is always embodied, both now and in the age to come.
    - "Scripture knows no man who is not a living soul, a unity of body and spirit." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped Reformed anthropology, especially in covenantal and eschatological contexts. His rejection of dualism and insistence on the embodied nature of the **image of God** have influenced contemporary discussions on human dignity, resurrection, and the nature of salvation. Kline’s covenantal framework continues to inform theological anthropology in both academic and ecclesial settings.
