# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **human nature** through the lens of **existentialist interpretation** and **demythologization**, emphasizing the **psychosomatic unity** of the human person. He rejected dualistic conceptions, insisting that the **body** and **soul** are not separable substances but rather aspects of the whole person as encountered in existence before God.

- "Man does not have a body; he is body, and he does not have a soul; he is soul." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)

- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity of the Person**
    - Human beings are fundamentally a unity of **body** and **soul**, not a composite of separable parts.
    - The biblical view, for Bultmann, resists Greek dualism and affirms the integration of the physical and spiritual.
    - Existence is always embodied; there is no "pure soul" apart from bodily life.
    - The self is disclosed in concrete, historical existence.
    - "The New Testament does not know of a soul in the sense of a spiritual substance distinct from the body." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Human Nature**
    - Human nature is best understood through **existential categories** such as authenticity, decision, and self-understanding.
    - The question of what it means to be human is inseparable from the question of existence before God.
    - Theological anthropology is not about metaphysical composition but about existential orientation.
    - The human person is defined by relationships and choices, not by static substances.
    - "What the New Testament says about man is not a doctrine of man but an existential understanding of human existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
    - Bultmann critiques the influence of **Greek philosophy** on Christian anthropology.
    - He insists that biblical language about "body" and "soul" is not metaphysical but functional and relational.
    - The person is not a soul trapped in a body but a unified being-in-the-world.
    - Death is not the liberation of the soul but the end of the whole person’s earthly existence.
    - "The body is not the prison of the soul, but the soul is the life of the body." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Demythologization and Human Nature**
    - Demythologization seeks to interpret biblical statements about human nature in existential terms.
    - Mythological language about the soul must be translated into categories of personal existence.
    - The focus is on the meaning of being human in relation to God, not on speculative anthropology.
    - The **resurrection** is not about the reanimation of a body but about the transformation of existence.
    - "Demythologizing means interpreting the mythological statements about human nature in terms of existential understanding." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Human Nature in Relation to God**
    - Human existence is fundamentally **relational**, defined by openness or resistance to God.
    - Sin, faith, and salvation are existential realities, not changes in metaphysical status.
    - The human person is always a "being-in-the-world" and "being-before-God."
    - Anthropology is inseparable from theology; to be human is to be addressed by God.
    - "Man is not an independent substance, but exists only in relation—to God, to others, to himself." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s emphasis on **psychosomatic unity** and existential interpretation reshaped modern discussions of theological anthropology. His rejection of substance dualism influenced both biblical scholarship and contemporary theology, challenging traditional views of the **body-soul relationship**. While controversial, his approach forced theologians to reconsider the meaning of human existence in light of biblical revelation and existential philosophy. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the integration of **biblical anthropology** and modern thought.
