# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm a robust doctrine of **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**. Humanity is created as a single, integrated being of **body and soul**, both of which are good and essential to true human existence. This unity is foundational for understanding the image of God, the fall, and redemption in Christ.

- "God created man good, and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise Him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (Articles 12, 14, 15, 36)
- Heidelberg Catechism (Questions 6, 57, 58)
- Canons of Dort (Main Points I–III/IV)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, "The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is created by God as a union of **material body** and **immaterial soul**.
    - Both aspects are essential to the image of God and human identity.
    - The soul is not preexistent or divine, but created by God.
    - The body is not a prison, but integral to human vocation and destiny.
    - "We believe that God created man of dust from the ground and made and formed him after His own image and likeness—good, righteous, and holy." (Belgic Confession Art. 14)

2. **Goodness of Created Human Nature**
    - Human nature, in its original state, was wholly good and without corruption.
    - Both body and soul were created for communion with God.
    - The fall corrupted the whole person, not just the body or soul.
    - Redemption involves the restoration of the whole human being.
    - "God created man good, and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

3. **Unity and Integrity of the Person**
    - The person is not a soul trapped in a body, but a unified being.
    - The **psychosomatic unity** is preserved in both creation and redemption.
    - Death is an unnatural separation, not the liberation of the soul.
    - The hope of resurrection affirms the value of both body and soul.
    - "Our souls, after this life, shall immediately be taken up to Christ, our Head... and this my flesh, raised by the power of Christ, shall be reunited with my soul, and made like unto the glorious body of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 57–58)

4. **Image of God in Body and Soul**
    - The image of God encompasses the whole person, not just the soul.
    - True knowledge, righteousness, and holiness are expressed through both body and soul.
    - The fall distorted the image in both aspects, requiring comprehensive renewal.
    - The restoration in Christ is holistic, involving the entire person.
    - "He created man good, and after His own image, in true righteousness and holiness." (Belgic Confession Art. 14)

5. **Eschatological Hope for the Whole Person**
    - The resurrection of the body is essential to Christian hope.
    - Eternal life is embodied, not merely spiritual or disembodied.
    - The final state is a renewed psychosomatic unity in the presence of God.
    - The intermediate state is temporary, awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - "I believe that... this my flesh, raised by the power of Christ, shall be reunited with my soul, and made like unto the glorious body of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 58)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology, emphasizing the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature against dualistic or reductionist tendencies. Their teaching on the integrated dignity of body and soul continues to inform Reformed views on creation, redemption, and eschatology. This holistic understanding remains foundational for contemporary discussions on human identity, the image of God, and the hope of resurrection.
