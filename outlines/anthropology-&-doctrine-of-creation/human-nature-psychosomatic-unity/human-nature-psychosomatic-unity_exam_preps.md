### ESSAY
To defend the doctrine of human **psychosomatic unity** under examination, one must keep three tensions constantly in view: first, against disembodied spiritualism, that the human is not a trapped soul but a living body animated by a rational soul; second, against reductive materialism, that this body is more than organized matter, for it is informed by a genuinely immaterial principle; and third, against vague relational accounts, that this unity has a created, intelligible structure deeply implicated in sin, grace, and eschatology. The thesis to be defended is that Scripture and the best trajectories of the Christian tradition commit us to a robust **hylomorphic dualism**: the human person is one substance composed of **body and soul** as form and matter, such that the surviving soul in the intermediate state is an incomplete human, oriented toward bodily resurrection. This preserves both **psychosomatic unity** and a real **spiritual ontology**.

Gregory of Nyssa is an indispensable starting point, because he stands at the patristic intersection of biblical exegesis, anti-Platonic polemic, and proto-hylomorphic reflection. In his On the Making of Man, Gregory resists any notion of the body as a prison-house, pressing the claim that the human is constituted as a unity by God’s creative intention. He affirms that the soul is created by God and not preexistent, rejecting Platonist myths. Yet he is thoroughly committed to an immaterial rational soul, created together with the body, giving life and unity to the organism. He deploys a kind of functional **holism**: the soul is present whole and entire in every part of the body, not as a spread-out fluid but as a simple, nonspatial principle of life that uses bodily organs as instruments. Examiners often press at this point: does Gregory lapse back into Platonism when he speaks of the soul’s survival and its capacity to exist apart from the body after death? The response is that for Gregory, disembodied existence is a state of deprivation and waiting. The soul can subsist without the body, but cannot be called a full human without the body. He explicitly ties salvation to the resurrection of the body and sees bodily resurrection as the restoration of proper psychosomatic unity. His conceptual contribution is the integration of biblical resurrection hope with an anti-Gnostic but still clearly dualist account of soul and body that is already moving toward a **hylomorphic** pattern: the soul as the form of a living, organized body, yet capable, by divine preservation, of existing during the interval between death and resurrection.

Thomas Aquinas develops this into a precise ontology. In the Summa Theologiae and the disputed questions On the Soul, he argues that the human soul is the substantial form of the body. By **form**, he means that which makes a potentially living body actually alive, rational, and unified. Aquinas’s hylomorphism decisively reframes Christian anthropology, and examiners will probe its coherence. On Aquinas’s view, the human is neither a mere aggregate of body and soul nor a soul that only accidentally uses a body. Rather, one subsistent substance results from the union of immaterial rational soul and prime matter organized as a living organism. Aquinas insists that all human powers except intellection are acts of the composite: seeing, imagining, desiring, moving are activities of the embodied organism. Even intellect, though it is an immaterial power, normally operates in dependence on bodily phantasms. This is precisely what it means to be a **psychosomatic unity**: human cognition, affect, and volition are essentially embodied.

Yet Aquinas simultaneously maintains the soul’s capacity to subsist apart from the body after death. This is the pressure point. An examiner might ask whether this breaks his own definition of soul as the form of the body. Aquinas’s answer is subtle: the soul is by nature the form of the body; it is ordered to inform matter. But because the intellectual soul has operations not reducible to bodily organs, it must have a subsistent being that does not entirely perish with bodily dissolution. However, in this separated state the soul is not a complete substance of the same species as man. It is a subsisting part, designated by Aquinas as an incomplete substance. This matches the doctrine of the intermediate state: the separated soul continues in personal identity by divine preservation and intellectual operation, yet longs for reunion with its body to be again a whole human. Aquinas thus offers the canonical metaphysical articulation of **psychosomatic unity**: real dualism of immaterial soul and material body, yet one human substance in which embodiment is not accidental but essential.

John Calvin, often mistakenly read as a Cartesian dualist avant la lettre, in fact sustains a robustly biblical, resurrection-oriented **psychosomatic** anthropology shaped by both patristic and medieval heritage but reconfigured through **federal theology** and his doctrine of union with Christ. In the Institutes, especially book 1 chapter 15, Calvin affirms that the human soul is a spiritual essence, created by God, endowed with understanding and will, distinct from the body and capable of existing without it. He is happy to speak of the body as the “tabernacle” or “organ” of the soul, and explicitly denounces the Sadducean and materialist views that deny the soul’s persistence. Examiners may press: does Calvin thereby reduce the body to an external instrument and so undermine **psychosomatic unity**? The better reading is that Calvin, like Gregory and Aquinas, sees the body as essential to the created constitution of man. His sharp language about the soul’s nobility and the body’s frailty must be read in polemical context against those who deny spiritual realities. Within his broader system, anthropology is tied to union with the incarnate Christ, who redeems the whole man, body and soul, and to resurrection as the consummation of salvation. In his comments on 1 Corinthians 15, Calvin emphasizes that salvation is incomplete until bodies are raised.

Calvin’s decisive contribution is to embed **psychosomatic unity** in a redemptive-historical and covenantal framework. Under Adam as federal head, both body and soul are corrupted and subject to death. Under Christ, the second Adam, both are renewed, culminating in the resurrection body. The intermediate state, in which believers are “with Christ” yet await the resurrection, exhibits precisely the Aquinas-style pattern: the soul survives as an incomplete human state but not as the telos of God’s design. Calvin’s pastoral emphasis makes a key point for examiners: this anthropology grounds Christian hope not in escape from embodiment but in the redemption of our embodied existence.

Karl Barth introduces a different angle, one that must be critically engaged rather than followed. In Church Dogmatics III.2, Barth resolutely attacks all forms of substance dualism. He fears that any talk of a “soul” as an immaterial substance introduces a second independent center besides the living person addressed by God, and opens the door to a metaphysical account detached from revelation. Barth’s own view speaks of the human as “soul–body” or “psyche–soma” as two aspects of a single existence in covenant with God. He explicitly rejects a separable soul and reinterprets biblical talk of soul and spirit in relational and functional terms. For Barth, to be human is to be this concrete bodily history summoned by the Word, in whom inner and outer, spiritual and bodily, are not two parts but one differentiated unity.

Barth’s critique bears weight in its rejection of speculative psychology and its emphasis that we know human nature from the revelation of the true man, Jesus Christ. Yet his reluctance to grant any ontological distinction beyond what is empirically given tends to flatten or evacuate the classical affirmation of a **spiritual substance**. Examiners may ask: does Barth leave room for a meaningful intermediate state or any coherent account of personal survival between death and resurrection? His followers often construe survival as an act of God’s remembering or reconstituting the person, rather than the ongoing existence of a subsistent soul. This position tends toward either a form of monism or an existentialist reconstruction and sits uneasily with traditional affirmations of Christ’s descent to the departed and the conscious communion of believers with Christ prior to the last day. Barth thus helps frame the contemporary internal debate: Can one preserve **psychosomatic unity** and resurrection hope without positing a real, though incomplete, postmortem existence of the soul?

Nancey Murphy represents a contemporary external–internal challenge from within the Christian fold, drawing heavily on philosophy of mind and neuroscience. Advocating a nonreductive physicalism, she argues that humans are purely physical organisms whose mental and spiritual capacities are higher-level properties or functions of the brain and body, rather than activities of an immaterial soul. Her nonreductive qualifier attempts to avoid crude materialism by insisting that mental properties are not reducible to physics or chemistry and that human persons can be causally efficacious at their own level. She urges that the biblical hope of resurrection does not require an immortal soul, but the faithfulness of God to re-create or transform the embodied person. For Murphy, Christian theology should relinquish talk of a substantial **soul** as a relic of Greek metaphysics and align itself with contemporary neuroscience’s correlation of mental life with brain states.

Her position crystallizes the modern pressure against classical dualism. It invites examiners to ask: If everything we empirically observe about consciousness tracks with brain activity, why posit a soul? Does a substantial immaterial principle violate **divine simplicity** by introducing a secondary, quasi-divine substance? Or does it posit occult causes contrary to scientific parsimony? The classical response, drawing on Aquinas and refined by contemporary Thomists and analytic dualists, stresses that correlation is not identity and that whole domains of human experience, such as intentionality, first-person awareness, and the semantic content of thoughts, are not plausibly reducible to physical properties. **Psychosomatic unity** does not mean that only one kind of thing exists, but that two distinct principles, material and immaterial, compose one natural substance. The human soul is not a “little god” rivaling the Creator, but a finite, dependent, created form whose existence and operations are entirely contingent on God’s conserving causality. Scientific explanation of brain processes uses a different, complementary level of description, and there is no contradiction in affirming both.

Within the Christian tradition, there have been internal debates about how to specify this unity. Broadly, one can distinguish between **substance dualism** of an Augustinian or Cartesian type, where soul and body are two distinct substances in a close union, and **hylomorphic** dualism of Thomistic type, where soul and body are two co-principles of one substance. The position defended here is that the hylomorphic model better secures **psychosomatic unity** while retaining a robustly immaterial soul. Cartesian models, especially in their modern form, lend themselves to the “ghost in the machine” picture that undervalues the body and makes embodiment an accident. They also face acute interaction problems: if two completely distinct substances, one extended and one nonextended, interact, how do they causally influence each other? Hylomorphism, by contrast, locates causation within the single composite: what acts and suffers is the unified human being. The soul, as form, is not a separate agent pushing particles around, but the intrinsic principle by which the organism acts as a whole. This both honors biblical depiction of humans as acting bodily agents and responds to critiques that traditional dualism posits mysterious cross-substance causal links.

Another internal debate concerns the **intermediate state**. Traditional Reformed and catholic theology have affirmed that believers, when they die, are “with Christ” and conscious, while awaiting the resurrection of the body. Critics often claim that this commits us to a quasi-Platonic valorization of disembodiment, that if conscious existence without a body is possible and blessed, embodiment must be nonessential. The hylomorphic dualist can respond that “possible” does not entail “natural” or “ideal.” The separated soul’s existence is possible because God conserves it and can sustain intellectual operation without bodily organs, but this state is contrary to the soul’s nature as form of a body. The intermediate state is accordingly a state of blessed yet incomplete existence. This squares with scriptural tension: Paul can say he desires to depart and be with Christ, which is better, and yet that he longs for the redemption of the body and speaks of groaning for the adoption, the resurrection. Biblical imagery of “sleep” acknowledges the unnaturalness of death, while promises of being with the Lord affirm ongoing personal existence. **Psychosomatic unity** thus underwrites, rather than undermines, the doctrine of bodily resurrection as the completion of salvation.

Engaging external debates, Christian **psychosomatic unity** stands opposed both to ancient Gnostic and Manichaean disparagement of the body and to modern materialist reductionism. Gnostic patterns treat salvation as escape from embodiment, rendering the body irrelevant or evil. A Christian hylomorphic dualism rejects this by insisting that nature as such is good and that the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ redeem and transfigure our embodied state. Salvation is not the liberation of the soul from the body, but the deliverance of the whole human from sin and death. Modern physicalism, by contrast, dissolves the spiritual dimension into neural networks and emergent properties. Against this, Christian theology insists on **analogical knowledge** of God and of spiritual realities: we cannot directly inspect the soul, but we reason analogically from effects to causes, recognizing that some features of our mental life, such as openness to God, moral responsibility, and transcendent intentionality, require more than physical description. The doctrine of the image of God, centrally involved in this locus, demands a principle capable of knowing and loving God. While the image is not reducible to the rational soul in a narrow sense, it presupposes a subject with capacities that transcend the merely material.

Contemporary debates in philosophy of mind, such as between nonreductive physicalism, emergentism, and various forms of substance dualism, sharpen our articulation. Nonreductive physicalism rightly resists crude reduction and emphasizes systemic and relational aspects of personhood. Yet it often fails to explain how truly novel properties can emerge from purely physical substrates without either collapsing into panpsychism or smuggling in irreducibly mental realities under other names. Emergent dualism, which posits that an immaterial, substantial self emerges from but is ontologically distinct from the physical brain, gestures toward the classical position but grounds the soul too heavily in contingent physical organization, making its persistence across bodily death metaphysically obscure. The classical Christian thesis is different: the soul is not a late-coming emergent but the first actuating principle of the organism, given in God’s creative bestowal of life. Neuroscience can and should describe the bodily side of our mental life, but it remains silent on what it is like to be a subject, on the unity of consciousness, and on the very “I” that has experiences. **Psychosomatic unity** insists that this “I” is neither an ethereal ghost detached from neurons nor a mere pattern in the brain, but the one human person whose being is a composite of soul and body.

This doctrine has implications across loci. In **Christology**, the human nature assumed by the Son must be a true **psychosomatic unity**: a rational soul and a true body. Apollinarianism, which in effect denied Christ a human rational soul, is rejected precisely on this ground. One must therefore maintain that the Word assumed not only a body but the full rational soul that is the form of that body. In **soteriology**, the redemption of the human requires the healing and elevation of both body and soul. The sacraments, especially baptism and the Lord’s Supper, address us as embodied souls: visible words that nourish faith and seal promises to senses and intellect together. In **ecclesiology**, the church as a visible, gathered body is not a mere external shell of an invisible spiritual reality; it is the embodied form of the people of God, whose spiritual worship is fully bodily. In **ethics**, the doctrine of **psychosomatic unity** undergirds the dignity of bodies: sexual ethics, medical decisions, and care for the suffering cannot treat the body as extrinsic to the person but as integral to who the person is.

One common examiner challenge is whether affirming an immaterial soul compromises **divine simplicity** by positing created spiritual substances that seem to compete with God’s unique immateriality. The answer is to distinguish between divine and created being. God is simple, uncomposed, pure act. The human soul, by contrast, is composite with faculties, dependent, and in potency to God. Its immateriality is not an absolute, aseity-like independence, but a relative immateriality with respect to matter. It is still wholly contingent. The multiplicity of finite immaterial souls no more compromises divine uniqueness than does the multiplicity of finite material creatures. Another challenge is pastoral: does this doctrine devalue disability or bodily brokenness by implying that the “real person” is the soul? Here the hylomorphic emphasis is especially important. If the soul is the form of this body, then bodily vulnerability and limitation belong to the concrete way this person exists in a fallen world. Resurrection is not the exchange of bodies but their transformation into glory. The doctrine thus affirms that those with severe bodily or cognitive impairments are fully human persons, not “less” human for their damaged embodiment.

In sum, **psychosomatic unity** as classically understood holds that the human is a single, embodied rational creature, whose being is constituted by the composite of immaterial soul and material body. Gregory of Nyssa anticipates this by integrating biblical resurrection hope with anti-Platonism. Aquinas gives it its most rigorous metaphysical articulation in **hylomorphic dualism**, preserving both unity and real spiritual substance. Calvin embeds it in a covenantal, resurrection-focused framework, affirming the intermediate state without surrendering the centrality of embodiment. Barth’s relational and christological reorientation highlights important concerns about speculation but risks lapsing into monism. Murphy’s nonreductive physicalism seeks to accommodate neuroscience but fails to account adequately for the soul’s ontological distinctness and the coherence of personal survival. Faced with internal and external debates, the most defensible position is to affirm a real, immaterial soul as the subsisting form of the human body, insist that human flourishing is by nature embodied and consummated only in the resurrection, and interpret all spiritual life, from regeneration to glorification, as God’s work in and upon this **psychosomatic unity**.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Human **psychosomatic unity** is the one human substance composed of immaterial rational soul and material body as form and matter, such that the soul can subsist apart from the body only in an incomplete, unnatural state awaiting resurrection.
- Decisive figures:
  - Gregory of Nyssa: anti-Platonist patristic dualist who affirms soul–body unity and resurrection, with the intermediate state as deprivation.
  - Thomas Aquinas: classic **hylomorphic dualist**; soul as subsisting substantial form of the body, giving an ontological account of unity and the intermediate state.
  - John Calvin: Reformed dualist anchoring body–soul unity in **federal theology**, union with Christ, and resurrection hope.
  - Karl Barth: relational, christologically centered critic of substance dualism, tending toward monism and reinterpreting soul–body in covenantal terms.
  - Nancey Murphy: contemporary nonreductive physicalist, denying a substantial soul and grounding personhood in complex physical embodiment.
- Debates:
  - Internal: substance dualism versus **hylomorphic dualism**; how to construe the intermediate state; the role of body in imaging God and in salvation.
  - External: Platonism and Gnosticism versus biblical resurrection; modern materialism and physicalism versus spiritual **ontology**; Cartesian interactionism versus holistic accounts.
  - Contemporary: nonreductive physicalism and emergentism; analytic substance dualism; neuroscience and consciousness; implications for Christology, ethics, and eschatology.
- Defended position: A Thomistic-style **hylomorphic dualism** in which the human person is a true **psychosomatic unity**, the soul is an immaterial subsisting form essentially ordered to a body, disembodied existence is incomplete, and salvation culminates in bodily resurrection.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - How does your view differ from Cartesian dualism?  
    It affirms a real immaterial soul but locates agency and causation in the one composite human, avoiding a “ghost in the machine” model.
  - Why not adopt nonreductive physicalism?  
    Because it cannot adequately explain consciousness, intentionality, and personal survival without implicitly reintroducing irreducible mental realities.
  - How can the soul exist without the body if it is the body’s form?  
    By divine conservation; it subsists as an incomplete substance contrary to its natural state, awaiting re-embodiment in resurrection.
  - Does an immaterial soul conflict with neuroscience?  
    No, since neural correlates of mental states describe the bodily side of psychosomatic acts, while the soul is the intrinsic principle that makes such acts those of a rational subject.
  - How does this doctrine support the resurrection of the body?  
    It makes resurrection the restoration and glorification of the proper **psychosomatic unity**, so that salvation is not escape from the body but the redemption of the whole man.
