# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg views **human nature** as a dynamic **psychosomatic unity**, rejecting both dualistic and reductively materialist accounts. He insists that the human being is fundamentally a unity of **body and soul**, with personal identity and openness to God realized in the totality of embodied existence. For Pannenberg, this unity is not static but oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment** in the resurrection.

- "The human being is not a soul inhabiting a body, but a living being whose soul is the life of its body." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially ch. 3: "Human Nature")
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Jesus—God and Man
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Essential to Humanity**
    - Human beings are constituted by an inseparable unity of **body and soul**.
    - Rejects both **substance dualism** and reductive materialism as inadequate for biblical anthropology.
    - The soul is not an independent substance but the principle of life animating the body.
    - Human identity is realized in the totality of embodied existence.
    - "The soul is the life of the body, not a substance separable from it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Openness to God as Defining Human Nature**
    - Human beings are fundamentally oriented toward **God** and transcendence.
    - This openness is expressed through both bodily existence and spiritual capacity.
    - The image of God is not a static possession but a dynamic relation.
    - Human fulfillment is found in relationship with God, not in autonomy.
    - "Man is man in his openness to God." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Human Nature**
    - Human nature is not complete in its present state but oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment**.
    - The resurrection of the body is the ultimate realization of psychosomatic unity.
    - Present human existence is provisional, awaiting consummation in Christ.
    - Anthropology must be understood in light of **eschatology**.
    - "The resurrection of the dead is the fulfillment of human destiny as psychosomatic unity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Relationality and Sociality**
    - Human beings are inherently **relational**, constituted in relation to others and to God.
    - Social existence is not accidental but essential to human nature.
    - The self is formed in community and through history.
    - The psychosomatic unity is always lived out in social context.
    - "Personhood is realized only in relation to others." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

5. **Integration of Scientific and Theological Perspectives**
    - Engages with contemporary science, especially biology and psychology, to inform theological anthropology.
    - Sees no fundamental conflict between scientific accounts of human nature and theological claims.
    - Emphasizes the need for theology to address empirical realities of human embodiment.
    - Theological anthropology must be credible in dialogue with modern knowledge.
    - "Theology must take seriously the findings of the sciences in its understanding of man." (Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s robust account of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly shaped modern theological anthropology, especially in ecumenical and interdisciplinary discussions. His integration of **eschatology** and anthropology has influenced both Protestant and Catholic thought, challenging dualistic tendencies and affirming the embodied nature of human existence. Pannenberg’s work continues to be a touchstone for those seeking a holistic, biblically grounded, and scientifically informed doctrine of humanity.
