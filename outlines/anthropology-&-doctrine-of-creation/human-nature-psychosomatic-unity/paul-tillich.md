# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **human nature** as a dynamic **psychosomatic unity**, rejecting dualistic separations between body and soul. He emphasized the **existential** and **ontological** dimensions of the human person, arguing that the unity of body and mind is foundational for understanding **personhood**, **estrangement**, and the possibility of **redemption**.

- "Man is body-soul-spirit in unity, not a soul in a body or a spirit in a soul." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology," Vol. 2 (especially Part III: Existence and the Christ)
- "The Courage to Be"
- "The Protestant Era"
- "Love, Power, and Justice"
- "The Interpretation of History"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Ontological Structure**
    - Human beings are fundamentally a unity of **body** and **soul**, not two separate substances.
    - The **ontological** structure of humanity is rooted in the inseparability of the physical and spiritual.
    - This unity is essential for understanding human existence and alienation.
    - The psychosomatic unity grounds the possibility of **personal identity** and selfhood.
    - "The unity of body and soul is not accidental but essential to man's being." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

2. **Existential Estrangement and Human Nature**
    - Human existence is marked by a tension between essential unity and existential estrangement.
    - Estrangement affects both the **psychological** and **somatic** aspects of the person.
    - Sin is understood as the disruption of the psychosomatic unity.
    - Redemption involves the healing of this existential split.
    - "Estrangement is separation within unity, not the destruction of unity." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
    - Tillich opposes classical **substance dualism** (body vs. soul) in favor of a holistic anthropology.
    - He critiques both materialistic reductionism and spiritualistic abstraction.
    - The human person cannot be reduced to either physical or mental components.
    - True understanding of humanity requires integrating both dimensions.
    - "The soul is not a thing beside the body; it is the dimension of depth in the bodily existence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

4. **Spirit as the Unifying Principle**
    - The **spirit** is not a separate substance but the principle that unifies body and soul.
    - Spirit enables self-transcendence and participation in the **Ground of Being**.
    - Human openness to the divine is rooted in this spiritual dimension.
    - The spirit actualizes the psychosomatic unity in personal existence.
    - "Spirit is the unity of the centered self, embracing both body and soul." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

5. **Implications for Christology and Redemption**
    - The psychosomatic unity of human nature is crucial for understanding the **Incarnation**.
    - In Christ, the unity of divine and human natures is realized without confusion or separation.
    - Redemption restores the fractured psychosomatic unity of fallen humanity.
    - The resurrection affirms the value and destiny of the whole person, body and soul.
    - "The New Being in Christ is the healing of the split between body and soul." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has deeply influenced modern theological anthropology, especially in existential and philosophical theology. His rejection of dualism and emphasis on the **ontological unity** of the human person have shaped discussions on embodiment, personhood, and the relationship between theology and psychology. Tillich’s framework continues to inform contemporary debates on the nature of humanity, sin, and redemption within and beyond the Reformed tradition.
