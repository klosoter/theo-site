# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that humans are created as a unified whole of **body and soul**. He rejected any dualistic separation that would diminish the importance of either aspect, emphasizing that both are integral to the **imago Dei** and to the experience of **sin** and **redemption**.

- "Man is not a soul only, nor a body only, but both, and both together constitute the whole man." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- The Bondage of the Will
- Small Catechism
- Large Catechism
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humans are created as a single entity, comprising both **body and soul**.
    - The **imago Dei** is expressed in the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Both body and soul are affected by the **Fall** and require **redemption**.
    - The unity is maintained in both creation and eschatological resurrection.
    - "The soul is not the whole man, but only the chief part of him; as the eye is not the whole man, but only the chief part of the man." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Body and Soul in Sin and Salvation**
    - Both body and soul are corrupted by **original sin**.
    - **Justification** and **sanctification** involve the whole person.
    - The resurrection promises the renewal of both body and soul.
    - The Christian life is lived out bodily, not just spiritually.
    - "Sin has so corrupted the whole man, body and soul, that nothing sound remains in him." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Rejection of Platonic Dualism**
    - Luther opposes the Platonic idea that the soul is inherently good and the body inherently evil.
    - He insists on the goodness of the body as part of God's creation.
    - The body is not a prison for the soul but an essential aspect of human identity.
    - Salvation is not escape from the body but its restoration.
    - "The philosophers have taught that the soul is the man, but Moses and Christ teach otherwise." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Imago Dei and Human Dignity**
    - The **image of God** is reflected in the unity of body and soul.
    - Human dignity is grounded in this holistic view of personhood.
    - Both body and soul are to be honored and cared for.
    - The restoration of the image of God in Christ encompasses the whole person.
    - "God made man of body and soul, and both are included in the image of God." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Eschatological Hope for the Whole Person**
    - The resurrection involves the **reuniting of body and soul**.
    - Eternal life is embodied, not merely spiritual.
    - The hope of the Christian is for the redemption of the whole person.
    - The psychosomatic unity is perfected in the new creation.
    - "We look for the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting." (Small Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** shaped Protestant anthropology, countering both medieval dualism and later reductionist views. His teaching influenced Reformation confessions and contributed to the ongoing theological emphasis on the **integrity of human nature** in both creation and redemption. Luther’s holistic vision remains foundational for discussions of the **imago Dei**, human dignity, and the resurrection in contemporary theology.
