# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that humans are created as an inseparable union of **body and soul**. He rejects both **dualistic** and **materialistic** reductions, emphasizing that the human person is a single, integrated being whose spiritual and physical aspects are mutually constitutive. This unity is foundational for Bavinck’s understanding of the **image of God**, **original righteousness**, and the scope of **redemption**.

- "Man is not a soul that has a body, nor a body that has a soul, but a single, undivided human nature which is at once both body and soul." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- "The Origin, Essence, and Purpose of Man" (in Our Reasonable Faith)
- Essays on Religion, Science, and Society

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humanity is created as a single, unified being of **body and soul**.
    - The soul is not preexistent nor separable from the body in essence.
    - Both aspects are essential for the full expression of the **image of God**.
    - The unity is not a mixture but an organic, divinely-ordered relationship.
    - "The human being is a psychophysical unity, not a duality." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.558)

2. **Rejection of Dualism and Materialism**
    - Bavinck opposes Platonic and Cartesian dualism that separates soul and body.
    - He also rejects materialist views that reduce humans to physical processes.
    - Both errors distort the biblical view of human nature.
    - True anthropology maintains the integrity of both spiritual and physical dimensions.
    - "Scripture knows nothing of a dualism in which the soul is everything and the body nothing." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.559)

3. **The Image of God in the Whole Person**
    - The **imago Dei** is expressed in the totality of human existence.
    - Both body and soul participate in reflecting God’s character.
    - The image is not restricted to rationality or spirituality alone.
    - Redemption and glorification will restore the whole person, not just the soul.
    - "The image of God embraces the whole person, body and soul together." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.554)

4. **Sin and Death Affect the Whole Person**
    - The fall corrupted both the spiritual and physical aspects of humanity.
    - Death is the unnatural separation of body and soul, a result of sin.
    - Redemption must address both dimensions to restore true humanity.
    - The resurrection promises the reunification and renewal of body and soul.
    - "Sin has disrupted the unity of human nature, but grace restores it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.139)

5. **Eschatological Restoration of Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Final salvation includes the resurrection of the body and the perfection of the soul.
    - The future state is not disembodied existence but glorified psychosomatic unity.
    - The new creation affirms the goodness of both body and soul.
    - Christian hope is anchored in the holistic renewal of human nature.
    - "The resurrection is the restoration of the human being to its full, original unity." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.720)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped Reformed anthropology, providing a bulwark against both reductionist and dualistic tendencies. His theology has influenced contemporary discussions on the **image of God**, embodiment, and the scope of redemption. Bavinck’s integrated vision continues to inform debates on human dignity, ethics, and the resurrection, making his contributions foundational for modern systematic theology.
