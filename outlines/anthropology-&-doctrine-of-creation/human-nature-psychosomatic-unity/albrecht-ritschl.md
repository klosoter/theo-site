# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl approached **human nature** through the lens of **ethical personalism** and **community**, emphasizing the **psychosomatic unity** of the person. He rejected dualistic anthropology, insisting that the human being is an indivisible whole whose spiritual and bodily aspects are integrated within the context of **religious experience** and the **Kingdom of God**.

- "The soul is not a substance existing apart from the body, but the unity of the powers which are realized in the living body." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- The Christian Doctrine of Faith (Unterricht in der christlichen Religion)
- Theology and Metaphysics (Theologie und Metaphysik)
- A Critical History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
    - Human beings are not composed of two separate substances, but are a unified whole.
    - The soul is understood functionally, not as an immaterial entity distinct from the body.
    - Dualistic anthropology is seen as a product of Greek philosophy, not biblical revelation.
    - True human nature is realized in the integration of bodily and spiritual life.
    - "The soul is not a substance existing apart from the body, but the unity of the powers which are realized in the living body." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Ethical Personalism**
    - The person is defined by ethical relations, especially within the community.
    - Human nature is actualized in moral action and responsibility.
    - The unity of body and soul serves the realization of ethical vocation.
    - The image of God is found in the capacity for ethical love and fellowship.
    - "Personality is not a metaphysical quality, but an ethical one." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Human nature is best understood through the experience of faith.
    - The psychosomatic unity is oriented toward religious self-consciousness.
    - The individual's relation to God shapes the meaning of bodily and spiritual life.
    - Religious experience is inseparable from the totality of human existence.
    - "Religion is the determination of the self by the relation to God." (The Christian Doctrine of Faith)

4. **Community and the Kingdom of God**
    - Human nature is inherently social, fulfilled in community.
    - The psychosomatic unity finds its telos in participation in the Kingdom of God.
    - Ethical relations within the community reflect the unity of body and soul.
    - The church is the context in which true human nature is realized.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the highest good for the individual and the community." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Historical-Critical Method**
    - Anthropological claims are grounded in historical and critical study, not speculative metaphysics.
    - Human nature is understood in light of the historical development of Christian doctrine.
    - The psychosomatic unity is interpreted through the lens of Jesus’ historical person.
    - Theological anthropology must be responsive to contemporary knowledge of the human person.
    - "Theology must be freed from metaphysical presuppositions and grounded in historical reality." (Theology and Metaphysics)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s emphasis on **psychosomatic unity** and ethical personalism influenced modern Protestant theology’s move away from substance dualism. His approach shaped the development of **liberal theology**, especially in its focus on community, moral action, and the historical Jesus. Ritschl’s legacy persists in discussions of **theological anthropology** that prioritize the integration of body and soul within the context of religious and ethical life.
