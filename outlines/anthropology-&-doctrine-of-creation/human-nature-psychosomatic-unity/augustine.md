# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine articulates a view of **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, insisting that humans are composed of both **body and soul** in an inseparable relationship. He maintains that the **soul** is the form of the body, and that true human identity and moral responsibility require the integration of both physical and spiritual aspects. This unity is foundational to his doctrines of **creation**, **sin**, and **resurrection**.

- "For man is neither the soul alone nor the body alone, but both together." (City of God, XIII.24)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- On the Morals of the Catholic Church (De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae)
- On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Body-Soul Unity**
    - Humans are created as a composite of **body and soul**, not as two separate substances.
    - The **soul** is the animating principle, but the body is essential to full human existence.
    - The unity is so profound that neither body nor soul alone constitutes the human person.
    - This unity is rooted in the **doctrine of creation** and reflects the goodness of God's design.
    - "The soul, therefore, is not the whole man, but the better part of man; yet the body also is not the whole man, but the inferior part of man; and both together are the whole man." (City of God, XIII.24)

2. **The Soul as the Form of the Body**
    - The **soul** gives life and form to the body, shaping its identity.
    - The body without the soul is dead and ceases to be a true human body.
    - The soul is incorporeal but intimately present in every part of the body.
    - This relationship is analogous to the way God is present to creation.
    - "The soul is not diffused through the body as air is in a jar, but is present as a whole in every part of the body." (On the Trinity, VI.6)

3. **Goodness of the Material Body**
    - Augustine rejects any **dualistic** denigration of the body.
    - The body is created good and is an integral part of human nature.
    - Sin does not originate from the body but from the disordered will of the soul.
    - The **resurrection of the body** affirms its enduring value in God's redemptive plan.
    - "For the flesh is not evil, but the evil is in the perversion of the will." (City of God, XIV.5)

4. **Unity and the Problem of Sin**
    - The fall affects both body and soul, disrupting their harmonious unity.
    - **Original sin** is transmitted through the unity of body and soul.
    - The psychosomatic unity means that both physical and spiritual aspects are corrupted by sin.
    - Redemption involves the restoration of both body and soul in Christ.
    - "Both the soul and the body of man were made by God, and both are corrupted by sin." (City of God, XIII.3)

5. **Resurrection and Eschatological Restoration**
    - The final hope is the **resurrection of the body** and the reconstitution of the psychosomatic unity.
    - Eternal life is not disembodied existence but the perfected union of body and soul.
    - The resurrection body will be spiritual, incorruptible, and fully united to the soul.
    - This affirms the enduring significance of the body in the divine purpose.
    - "The body shall be spiritual, yet truly a body, not fleshless, but subject to the spirit." (City of God, XXII.21)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s doctrine of **psychosomatic unity** profoundly shaped Western Christian anthropology, influencing both medieval and Reformation thought. His insistence on the essential goodness of the body and its integral role in human nature provided a bulwark against dualistic tendencies in later theology. The Augustinian framework remains foundational for discussions of **original sin**, **resurrection**, and the holistic nature of redemption in both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
