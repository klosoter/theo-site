# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper emphasized the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that humans are created as integrated beings of **body and soul**. He rejected both dualistic and reductionistic views, arguing that the **image of God** is expressed in the whole person, and that the material and spiritual aspects of humanity are inseparable in both creation and redemption.

- "Man is not a soul without a body, nor a body without a soul, but a human being, in whom both are united." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

- Lectures on Calvinism (1898)
- Created in God’s Image (De Mensch, 1888; English translation)
- Wisdom & Wonder: Common Grace in Science & Art

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Created Order**
    - Humanity is constituted by the inseparable union of **body and soul**.
    - This unity reflects the **original design** of God in creation.
    - Both aspects are essential for the full expression of the **imago Dei**.
    - Any division or elevation of one aspect over the other distorts biblical anthropology.
    - "The soul without the body is not man, nor is the body without the soul." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Rejection of Dualism and Materialism**
    - Kuyper opposes Greek-influenced **dualism** that devalues the body.
    - He also rejects **materialism** that denies the spiritual aspect of humanity.
    - Both errors undermine the biblical teaching of human wholeness.
    - True anthropology must affirm the dignity and necessity of both body and soul.
    - "The Scriptures know of no man who is merely spirit, nor of a man who is merely matter." (Created in God’s Image)

3. **Imago Dei in the Whole Person**
    - The **image of God** is not limited to the soul or intellect.
    - It is manifested in the entire person, including physical, rational, and moral faculties.
    - The unity of body and soul is essential for reflecting God’s image.
    - Redemption in Christ restores the whole person, not just the soul.
    - "The image of God is not a property of the soul alone, but of the entire human being." (Created in God’s Image)

4. **Sin and the Disruption of Unity**
    - The fall introduces disorder into the psychosomatic unity.
    - Sin affects both the body and the soul, leading to alienation and death.
    - Redemption aims at the restoration of this unity in Christ.
    - The resurrection of the body is essential for the consummation of salvation.
    - "Sin did not destroy the unity of man, but disturbed the harmony between body and soul." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

5. **Common Grace and Human Nature**
    - **Common grace** preserves the integrity of human nature after the fall.
    - This grace restrains the effects of sin on both body and soul.
    - It allows for cultural development and scientific inquiry into human nature.
    - The ongoing value of the psychosomatic unity is affirmed in all spheres of life.
    - "Common grace maintains the world and man in their existence, despite the curse of sin." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped Reformed anthropology, providing a holistic alternative to both dualistic and reductionistic models. His insights influenced later Neo-Calvinist thought and contributed to a renewed appreciation for the **imago Dei** as encompassing the whole person. Kuyper’s emphasis on the unity of body and soul continues to inform contemporary discussions on theology, science, and human dignity.
