# Kevin J. Vanhoozer (1957– )

Kevin J. Vanhoozer emphasizes the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, arguing that humans are embodied agents whose identity and vocation are integrally tied to both **body and soul**. He resists both reductive materialism and dualistic anthropology, instead advocating for a **holistic** understanding of the human person as a **theological actor** within the drama of redemption. For Vanhoozer, this unity is essential for understanding **imago Dei**, human vocation, and participation in the **theodramatic** narrative.

- "Human beings are psychosomatic unities: embodied agents whose bodies are not mere containers for souls but essential to their personal identity and vocation." ("Remythologizing Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Human beings are fundamentally unified, not divided into separable parts.
    - Both **body and soul** are essential for personhood and vocation.
    - Rejects Cartesian dualism in favor of a scriptural, holistic anthropology.
    - Emphasizes the embodied nature of human existence in the drama of redemption.
    - "The Bible presents human beings as psychosomatic unities, not as souls trapped in bodies." ("Remythologizing Theology")

2. **Imago Dei as Embodied Participation**
    - The **image of God** is expressed through embodied action and relationality.
    - Human vocation involves representing God as embodied agents in creation.
    - Embodiment is not incidental but central to imaging God.
    - The drama of redemption is enacted through embodied human participation.
    - "To be made in the image of God is to be called to participate bodily in the theodrama." ("The Drama of Doctrine")

3. **Theological Anthropology and Theodrama**
    - Human beings are actors in God's redemptive drama, requiring both body and soul.
    - The **theodramatic** framework situates human identity within God's narrative.
    - Embodied action is necessary for faithful participation in the divine script.
    - Doctrine guides the performance of embodied, holistic discipleship.
    - "Doctrine is direction for fitting participation in the drama of redemption, which requires our whole selves." ("Faith Speaking Understanding")

4. **Critique of Reductionism and Dualism**
    - Rejects materialist reductionism that denies the soul or spiritual dimension.
    - Opposes dualisms that separate body and soul into unrelated substances.
    - Argues for a **holistic** view that affirms both spiritual and physical realities.
    - Sees reductionism and dualism as distortions of biblical anthropology.
    - "Neither materialism nor dualism does justice to the biblical vision of the human person." ("Remythologizing Theology")

5. **Embodied Agency and Vocation**
    - Human agency is exercised through embodied practices and relationships.
    - Vocation is lived out in the world through bodily presence and action.
    - The church as a community of embodied agents enacts God's purposes.
    - Ethical and spiritual formation involves the whole person, not just the mind or soul.
    - "Our bodies are not obstacles to spirituality but the very means by which we serve God and neighbor." ("Faith Speaking Understanding")

## Legacy and Impact

Vanhoozer’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussions of theological anthropology. His canonical-linguistic and theodramatic approaches have encouraged theologians to recover the importance of embodiment for understanding **imago Dei**, vocation, and discipleship. By integrating biblical, philosophical, and doctrinal insights, Vanhoozer has provided a robust alternative to both reductionist and dualist accounts of human nature, influencing both academic theology and practical ministry.
