# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that humans are created as an inseparable union of **body and soul**. He rejects any dualistic denigration of the body, emphasizing that both aspects are essential to the **imago Dei** and to the fullness of human existence before God.

- "We are composed of two elements, body and soul; yet so that the soul is not man, nor the body, but both together are man." (Institutes 1.15.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 1, chapters 14–15)
- Commentary on Genesis (especially on Genesis 2:7)
- Sermons on Job
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)
- Calvin’s Doctrine of Man by Charles Partee

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Body-Soul Unity**
    - Humans are created as a union of **material** and **immaterial** elements.
    - The **soul** is not the whole person, nor is the body; both are necessary for true humanity.
    - The **imago Dei** is expressed in the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Calvin opposes Platonic or Gnostic tendencies that devalue the body.
    - "The soul is not man, but the soul with the body is man." (Institutes 1.15.2)

2. **Dignity of the Body**
    - The body is created good and is an essential part of human nature.
    - Bodily existence is not a prison but a gift from God.
    - The body participates in the **image of God** in a derivative sense.
    - The resurrection affirms the enduring value of the body.
    - "Let us remember that our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 6:19)

3. **Unity in Life and Death**
    - The unity of body and soul is normative in this life.
    - Death is an unnatural separation, a result of the Fall.
    - The hope of **resurrection** is the restoration of psychosomatic unity.
    - The intermediate state is provisional, not the final destiny of humanity.
    - "For it is not natural that the soul should be separated from the body." (Institutes 3.25.8)

4. **Anthropology and the Imago Dei**
    - The **image of God** encompasses the whole person.
    - Rationality, morality, and spirituality are rooted in the soul but expressed through the body.
    - The restoration of the image in Christ involves both body and soul.
    - The body is included in the scope of redemption.
    - "The image of God extends to everything in which the nature of man surpasses that of all other species." (Institutes 1.15.3)

5. **Ethical Implications of Unity**
    - Care for the body is a spiritual duty.
    - Bodily actions are morally significant and reflect the state of the soul.
    - Worship and service to God involve both body and soul.
    - The Christian hope includes the **renewal of the whole person**.
    - "We are not our own: let not our reason nor our will, therefore, sway our plans and deeds." (Institutes 3.7.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** has profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology, countering both medieval dualism and later materialist reductions. His insistence on the dignity of the body and its role in the **imago Dei** influenced subsequent Protestant thought, especially regarding the resurrection and Christian ethics. Calvin’s balanced view continues to inform contemporary discussions on human nature, embodiment, and the holistic scope of redemption.
