# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield affirmed the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, emphasizing that humans are created as an inseparable union of **body and soul**. He rejected both dualistic and materialistic reductions, insisting that the **image of God** is expressed in the whole person. Warfield’s approach integrates **biblical anthropology** with a robust commitment to the **doctrine of creation**, highlighting the essential unity and dignity of human beings.

- "Man is not a soul merely, nor a body merely, but a soul-body—a spiritual organism." ("The Divine Image in Man," Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Essential to Humanity**
   - Humanity is constituted by the inseparable union of **body and soul**.
   - Both physical and spiritual aspects are necessary for the full expression of the **image of God**.
   - Warfield opposes any form of **dualism** that would denigrate the body.
   - The unity is rooted in the **doctrine of creation**, not a result of later development.
   - "Man is a unit, not a duality; he is not a soul inhabiting a body, but a soul-body." ("The Divine Image in Man")

2. **The Image of God in the Whole Person**
   - The **imago Dei** is not limited to the soul but encompasses the entire person.
   - Both rational and moral faculties, as well as bodily existence, reflect God's image.
   - The **image of God** is not lost but marred by the Fall, affecting both body and soul.
   - Restoration in Christ involves the renewal of the whole person.
   - "The image of God is stamped upon the whole man, not upon his soul alone." ("The Divine Image in Man")

3. **Rejection of Materialism and Dualism**
   - Warfield critiques materialist reductionism that denies the soul’s reality.
   - He also rejects Platonic dualism that devalues the body.
   - Both errors undermine the biblical view of human nature.
   - True Christian anthropology maintains the dignity of both body and soul.
   - "Neither materialism nor dualism can do justice to the biblical conception of man." ("The Christian Doctrine of Man")

4. **Theological Anthropology Rooted in Scripture**
   - Warfield grounds his understanding of human nature in **biblical revelation**.
   - He draws on both Old and New Testament texts to support psychosomatic unity.
   - Scripture presents death as the unnatural separation of body and soul.
   - The resurrection hope affirms the restoration of the whole person.
   - "The Bible knows nothing of a man who is not both body and soul." ("The Divine Image in Man")

5. **Eschatological Consummation of Human Unity**
   - The final state is the resurrection of the body, not mere immortality of the soul.
   - Full redemption involves the reunification and glorification of body and soul.
   - The Christian hope is bodily resurrection, affirming the goodness of creation.
   - This eschatological vision underscores the enduring significance of psychosomatic unity.
   - "The Christian hope is not the immortality of the soul merely, but the resurrection of the body." ("The Christian Doctrine of Man")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped Reformed anthropology, providing a robust alternative to both dualistic and materialistic tendencies. His insistence on the **image of God** in the whole person continues to inform contemporary discussions on human dignity, embodiment, and resurrection. Warfield’s careful exegesis and theological synthesis remain influential in both academic and ecclesial contexts, especially within confessional Reformed traditions.
