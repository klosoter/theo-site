# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, emphasizing that humans are created as integrated wholes of **body and soul**. He rejects any dualistic separation that would undermine the biblical teaching of the **image of God** and insists that human persons are fundamentally unified in their physical and spiritual aspects.

- "Scripture presents man as a unitary being, a psychosomatic unity, not a soul imprisoned in a body." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- Perspectives on the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Humanity is created as a unified whole, not as separate substances.
    - Both **body and soul** are essential to human identity.
    - The unity is grounded in the **creation narrative** and the doctrine of the **image of God**.
    - Dualistic anthropology is seen as inconsistent with biblical teaching.
    - "The Bible does not teach that the soul is more important than the body, but that both together constitute the human person." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Greek Dualism**
    - Frame critiques Platonic and Cartesian dualisms as foreign to Scripture.
    - He argues that such dualisms distort the biblical view of human nature.
    - The biblical worldview affirms the goodness of the material body.
    - Redemption includes the resurrection of the body, not just the soul’s immortality.
    - "Greek philosophy often devalued the body, but Scripture affirms its goodness and necessity." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Holistic Image of God**
    - The **imago Dei** encompasses both physical and spiritual aspects.
    - Human dominion and covenant relationship require embodied existence.
    - The whole person reflects God’s character and authority.
    - Frame emphasizes the relational and functional dimensions of the image.
    - "Man’s body and soul together bear the image of God and are called to serve Him." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Redemption and Resurrection**
    - Salvation is not escape from the body but the renewal of the whole person.
    - The resurrection affirms the value of embodied existence.
    - Sanctification involves both spiritual and physical transformation.
    - Eschatological hope is for a new creation, not disembodied souls.
    - "The resurrection of the body is central to biblical hope, showing that God redeems the whole person." (Doctrine of God)

5. **Ethical Implications of Unity**
    - Moral decisions must consider the whole person, not just spiritual concerns.
    - Frame’s **triperspectivalism** integrates normative, situational, and existential perspectives, reflecting human unity.
    - Care for the body is a spiritual responsibility.
    - Ethical issues like sexuality, health, and death are addressed holistically.
    - "Christian ethics must address both the spiritual and physical dimensions of human life." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has reinforced a holistic anthropology within Reformed theology, countering both secular materialism and unbiblical dualism. His work has influenced evangelical discussions on the **image of God**, ethics, and the doctrine of resurrection. Frame’s integration of biblical exegesis and philosophical analysis continues to shape contemporary systematic theology, especially in matters concerning the nature and destiny of human beings.
