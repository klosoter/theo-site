# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth understood **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, rejecting any dualistic separation between body and soul. For Barth, the human being is a single, indivisible reality whose **bodily existence** is essential to its **creaturely** and **covenantal** identity before God.

- "Man is not soul only, but soul and body, and therefore a unity of the two." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics III/1: The Doctrine of Creation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: A Biography (Eberhard Busch)
- The Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Human beings are created as a unified whole, not as a composite of separable parts.
    - The **body** and **soul** are interdependent and mutually constitutive.
    - Barth opposes both materialistic reductionism and spiritualistic dualism.
    - The unity of body and soul reflects the integrity of the human person before God.
    - "The human being is not a soul that has a body, but a living soul in a living body." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

2. **Creatureliness and Dependence on God**
    - Human psychosomatic unity is grounded in the act of **divine creation**.
    - Creaturely existence is marked by dependence on God for both body and soul.
    - The unity of human nature is a sign of humanity’s status as a creature, not as an autonomous being.
    - Barth emphasizes the distinction between Creator and creature in all anthropological reflection.
    - "Man’s being is grounded in the fact that he is created by God and exists before God." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

3. **Covenantal Relationality**
    - Human nature is constituted in relationship with God and with other humans.
    - The psychosomatic unity enables genuine **encounter** and **responsibility** in covenant.
    - Barth sees human relationality as essential, not accidental, to human existence.
    - The unity of body and soul serves the purpose of communion and fellowship.
    - "To be human is to be in encounter, in correspondence, in relationship." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

4. **Christological Anthropology**
    - Jesus Christ is the true and complete human, embodying perfect psychosomatic unity.
    - Human nature finds its meaning and destiny in conformity to Christ.
    - The incarnation affirms the goodness and necessity of bodily existence.
    - Barth’s anthropology is inseparable from his doctrine of **revelation** in Christ.
    - "In Jesus Christ, true humanity is revealed as unity of body and soul in obedience to God." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

5. **Rejection of Dualism**
    - Barth critiques both ancient and modern forms of anthropological dualism.
    - He insists that salvation and resurrection involve the whole person, not just the soul.
    - The hope of **resurrection** is bodily, affirming the psychosomatic unity in eschatology.
    - Dualistic views distort the biblical witness to the nature and destiny of humanity.
    - "The separation of soul and body is a sign of death, not of true life." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly shaped modern theological anthropology, especially in Reformed and ecumenical contexts. His rejection of dualism and emphasis on the integrity of the human person have influenced discussions on embodiment, resurrection, and relationality. Barth’s Christological focus continues to challenge theologians to ground their understanding of human nature in the revelation of Jesus Christ. His insights remain central to contemporary debates on the nature of humanity before God.
