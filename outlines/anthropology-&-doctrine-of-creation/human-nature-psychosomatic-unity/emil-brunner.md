# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner emphasized the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, rejecting both dualistic and materialistic reductions. He argued that humans are created as a unified whole of **body and soul**, with neither aspect existing independently, and that this unity is essential for understanding the **imago Dei** and true human existence before God.

- "Man does not have a body and a soul; he is both in one." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- The Mediator
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Essential to Humanity**
    - Human beings are fundamentally a unity of **body and soul**, not a composite of separable parts.
    - Brunner opposes both **dualism** (which splits body and soul) and **materialism** (which denies the soul).
    - The **imago Dei** is realized in the whole person, not in any single aspect.
    - True human existence is always embodied and relational.
    - "The human being is not a soul in a body, but a living unity of body and soul." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Relational Nature of Human Existence**
    - Human nature is defined by relationship: to God, to others, and to the world.
    - The **I-Thou** encounter is central to understanding personhood.
    - Isolation of body or soul destroys the meaning of human existence.
    - The psychosomatic unity enables genuine encounter and responsibility.
    - "Man is person only in encounter, and this encounter is always psychosomatic." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Sin as Disruption of Unity**
    - Sin distorts the harmony of body and soul, leading to alienation.
    - The fall results in a fractured self, but does not destroy the essential unity.
    - Redemption restores the psychosomatic unity intended by God.
    - The effects of sin are both spiritual and physical, affecting the whole person.
    - "Sin is the breaking up of the unity of man’s being, but not its annihilation." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Resurrection and the Whole Person**
    - Brunner affirms the **bodily resurrection** as essential to Christian hope.
    - Salvation is not escape from the body but the renewal of the whole person.
    - The future life is not disembodied existence but restored psychosomatic unity.
    - The doctrine of resurrection underscores the value of the body in God’s plan.
    - "The resurrection of the body means the redemption of the whole man." (Dogmatics, Vol. II)

5. **Critique of Greek and Modern Anthropologies**
    - Brunner rejects Greek dualism for separating soul and body.
    - He critiques modern reductionism for denying the spiritual dimension.
    - Biblical anthropology, for Brunner, insists on the inseparability of body and soul.
    - True knowledge of humanity comes only from **revelation**, not philosophy.
    - "The Bible knows nothing of a soul that can exist apart from the body." (Man in Revolt)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** influenced 20th-century theological anthropology, especially in dialogue with existentialism and personalism. His rejection of both dualism and materialism provided a framework for understanding the **imago Dei** as embodied and relational. Brunner’s work continues to shape discussions on human nature, the meaning of personhood, and the significance of the resurrection in Christian theology.
