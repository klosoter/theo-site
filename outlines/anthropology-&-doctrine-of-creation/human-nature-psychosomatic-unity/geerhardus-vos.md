# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust doctrine of **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, emphasizing the inseparable connection between **body and soul** in the created order. He maintained that the **image of God** is expressed in the whole person, and that redemption in Christ addresses both the spiritual and physical aspects of humanity.

- "The soul is not complete without the body, nor the body without the soul; together they constitute the human nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Pauline Eschatology"
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human nature as psychosomatic unity**
    - Humanity is created as a single, unified being of **body and soul**.
    - The **dichotomy** of body and soul does not imply separation but distinction within unity.
    - The **image of God** is borne by the whole person, not just the immaterial aspect.
    - The unity is essential for understanding both creation and redemption.
    - "Man is not a soul loosely inhabiting a body, but a living unity of both." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Body and soul in the image of God**
    - The **imago Dei** encompasses both material and immaterial aspects.
    - The body participates in expressing the image through dominion and service.
    - The soul reflects the image in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the full realization of human vocation.
    - "The image of God is not confined to the soul, but is reflected in the whole man." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Anthropology shaped by redemptive history**
    - Human nature must be understood in the context of **creation, fall, and redemption**.
    - Sin affects both body and soul, distorting the original unity.
    - Redemption in Christ restores and perfects the psychosomatic unity.
    - Eschatological hope includes the resurrection of the body and renewal of the whole person.
    - "Redemption is not the rescue of the soul from the body, but the renewal of the whole man." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Rejection of dualistic anthropology**
    - Vos opposes **Greek dualism** that devalues the body.
    - Scripture affirms the goodness of the body as part of God's creation.
    - The soul is not inherently superior to the body; both are integral.
    - True spirituality involves the whole person, not just the inner life.
    - "The biblical view is not dualistic, but holistic in its conception of man." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Eschatological consummation of human nature**
    - The final state involves the **resurrection** and glorification of the body.
    - The psychosomatic unity is perfected in the new creation.
    - The hope of believers is bodily and spiritual, not merely immaterial.
    - The destiny of humanity is to serve God as whole persons forever.
    - "The resurrection is the crowning affirmation of the unity and destiny of man as body and soul." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology, providing a biblical alternative to both materialism and dualism. His insistence on the unity of body and soul has influenced generations of theologians, especially in the context of **redemptive history** and eschatology. Vos’s work remains foundational for understanding the holistic nature of salvation and the dignity of the human person in Reformed theology.
