# Anthony Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony Hoekema argued that **human nature** is best understood as a **psychosomatic unity**, rejecting both dualistic and monistic reductions. He emphasized that the **image of God** encompasses the whole person—body and soul—in a unified existence, and that biblical anthropology demands an integrated view of human beings as created, fallen, and redeemed.

- "Man is not to be understood as a soul within a body, nor as a body animated by a soul, but as a psychophysical unity." ("Created in God's Image")

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- "Body and Soul" in Baker's Dictionary of Theology (1960)
- The Christian Looks at Himself (1975)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
   - Rejects both **substance dualism** and reductive materialism.
   - Argues that Scripture presents humans as a unified whole, not as two separable parts.
   - Emphasizes that body and soul are distinct but inseparable aspects of the one person.
   - Insists that the whole person is addressed in redemption and resurrection.
   - "The Bible knows nothing of a man who is complete without his body." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Holistic Image of God**
   - The **imago Dei** is not limited to the soul or rational faculties.
   - Both physical and spiritual aspects are included in bearing God's image.
   - Human dignity and worth are grounded in this holistic image.
   - The restoration of the image in Christ involves the whole person.
   - "The image of God in man must be seen as involving the whole person, not just one part of him." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Unity in Creation and Redemption**
   - Original creation intended humans to exist as unified beings.
   - The Fall affected both body and soul, distorting the whole person.
   - Redemption in Christ targets the restoration of psychosomatic unity.
   - The resurrection affirms the enduring significance of the body.
   - "Redemption is not complete until the body is raised and reunited with the soul." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Critique of Greek Dualism**
   - Warns against reading Platonic dualism into biblical anthropology.
   - Argues that Greek thought led to undervaluing the body in Christian tradition.
   - Stresses that biblical terms like "soul" and "spirit" refer to the person as a whole.
   - Sees dualistic anthropology as undermining the doctrine of resurrection.
   - "The Greek view of man as a soul imprisoned in a body is foreign to Scripture." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Implications for Christian Living**
   - Calls for respect for the body as integral to personhood.
   - Encourages holistic discipleship—spiritual, physical, emotional.
   - Opposes asceticism that denigrates bodily existence.
   - Affirms the goodness of creation and embodied life.
   - "The Christian life must be lived out in the body as well as in the soul." (Created in God's Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly shaped Reformed anthropology, providing a robust alternative to both dualistic and materialist models. His work influenced evangelical discussions on the **image of God**, resurrection, and the value of embodied existence. By rooting his anthropology in Scripture and engaging critically with philosophical traditions, Hoekema helped recover a holistic vision of human nature that continues to inform theological education and pastoral practice.
