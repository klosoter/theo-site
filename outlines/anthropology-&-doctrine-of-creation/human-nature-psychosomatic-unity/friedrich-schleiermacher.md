# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher understood **human nature** as a dynamic **psychosomatic unity**, rejecting dualistic separations between **body and soul**. For Schleiermacher, the essence of humanity lies in the **immediate self-consciousness** and the inseparable interplay of the physical and spiritual dimensions, which together constitute the full reality of the human person.

- "The human being is not a soul that has a body, but a living unity of both." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Schleiermacher: Life and Thought (ed. Richard Crouter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Essential to Humanity**
    - Humanity is fundamentally a unity of **body and soul**, not a mere conjunction of two substances.
    - The **spiritual and physical** are mutually constitutive, each shaping the other.
    - Human self-consciousness arises from the interaction of bodily existence and spiritual awareness.
    - The **image of God** is realized in this integrated unity, not in one aspect alone.
    - "The soul is not present in the body as a thing in a vessel, but the two are one living whole." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Immediate Self-Consciousness**
    - Human nature is defined by **immediate self-consciousness**, the awareness of absolute dependence.
    - This consciousness is not reducible to either bodily or spiritual faculties alone.
    - The experience of selfhood is always embodied and situated.
    - **Religious feeling** emerges from this unified self-consciousness.
    - "Self-consciousness is always at the same time a consciousness of being affected by the world." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
    - Schleiermacher opposes the Cartesian split between **res cogitans** and **res extensa**.
    - He argues that dualism distorts the biblical and experiential reality of human existence.
    - Theological anthropology must avoid abstract separations and attend to lived unity.
    - The soul’s activities are always mediated through the body.
    - "The separation of soul and body is a product of abstraction, not of reality." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Human Dependence on God Expressed in Unity**
    - The sense of **absolute dependence** is experienced through the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Both bodily and spiritual aspects are involved in religious experience.
    - The unity of human nature is the locus of divine revelation and response.
    - Salvation and redemption address the whole person, not just the immaterial aspect.
    - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing, but a modification of feeling, or of immediate self-consciousness." (On Religion)

5. **Implications for Christology and Redemption**
    - Christ’s true humanity requires full **psychosomatic unity**.
    - Redemption involves the restoration of the whole human being, body and soul.
    - The church’s ministry must address both spiritual and physical needs.
    - Eschatological hope includes the resurrection of the body, affirming unity.
    - "The Redeemer is the one in whom the divine and human are united in a living way." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s emphasis on **psychosomatic unity** profoundly shaped modern **theological anthropology**, challenging dualistic paradigms and influencing later Protestant thought. His integration of **self-consciousness** and embodied existence paved the way for existential and phenomenological approaches to human nature. While some critics argue that his focus on feeling risks subjectivism, his holistic vision remains foundational in contemporary discussions of the **image of God** and the nature of personhood.
