# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, emphasizing that humans are created as integrated beings with both **body and soul**. He rejects any dualistic separation, insisting that the **image of God** is expressed in the whole person. Poythress’s approach is shaped by a **multiperspectival** framework, which seeks to honor the complexity and unity of human existence as revealed in **Scripture**.

- "Human beings are not souls inhabiting bodies, but unified creatures in whom body and soul are inextricably intertwined." ("Redeeming Science")

## Key Works

- "Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach" (2006)
- "Philosophy, Science and the Sovereignty of God" (1976)
- "In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach" (2009)
- "Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology" (1987)
- "The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses" (1991)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Human beings are created as a unified whole, not as separate parts.
    - Both **body and soul** are essential to the **image of God**.
    - Scripture presents human nature as fundamentally integrated.
    - Dualistic anthropology is inconsistent with biblical teaching.
    - "The Bible presents man as a unity, not as a composite of separable parts." ("Redeeming Science")

2. **Multiperspectival Analysis of Human Nature**
    - Understanding human nature requires multiple, complementary perspectives.
    - No single aspect (physical, spiritual, rational) exhausts the meaning of personhood.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in anthropology.
    - Each perspective is grounded in the **Trinitarian** nature of God.
    - "We must look at human nature from many angles to do justice to its richness." ("Symphonic Theology")

3. **Body and Soul in Covenant Relationship**
    - The whole person participates in covenant with God.
    - **Redemption** and **sanctification** apply to both body and soul.
    - Bodily resurrection affirms the enduring value of the physical.
    - Sin and grace affect the entire person, not just one aspect.
    - "God’s covenant addresses us as whole persons, not as disembodied souls." ("Redeeming Science")

4. **Image of God Expressed Holistically**
    - The **imago Dei** is not limited to rationality or spirituality.
    - Human dominion, creativity, and relationality involve both body and soul.
    - The body is a positive instrument for expressing God’s image.
    - Christ’s incarnation affirms the goodness of human embodiment.
    - "The image of God is reflected in the totality of human existence." ("Philosophy, Science and the Sovereignty of God")

5. **Scripture as the Norm for Anthropology**
    - Biblical revelation is the ultimate authority for understanding human nature.
    - Scientific and philosophical insights are valuable but must be subordinate to Scripture.
    - Theological method must integrate exegesis with systematic reflection.
    - The unity of human nature is a revealed, not merely a philosophical, truth.
    - "Our doctrine of man must be shaped by the Word of God above all else." ("Redeeming Science")

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s robust affirmation of **psychosomatic unity** has influenced contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in its resistance to dualistic tendencies. His **multiperspectival** approach has encouraged theologians to integrate insights from Scripture, science, and philosophy without compromising biblical authority. By grounding human nature in the **image of God** and the covenantal relationship, Poythress has provided a holistic framework that continues to shape evangelical discussions on anthropology and the doctrine of man.
