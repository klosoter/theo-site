# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge affirmed the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, emphasizing that humans are created as a unified whole of **body and soul**. He maintained that this unity is essential to understanding the **image of God**, the effects of the **Fall**, and the nature of **redemption** in Christ.

- "Man, according to the Scriptures, consists of two distinct principles, the one material, the other immaterial, which together constitute the one individual man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature as Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is constituted by both a **material body** and an **immaterial soul**.
    - The soul is the seat of **personality, reason, and moral agency**.
    - The body and soul are distinct but inseparably joined in earthly existence.
    - This duality is foundational for understanding **human dignity** and responsibility.
    - "The Scriptures teach that man consists of two distinct substances, body and soul." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Psychosomatic Unity in the Image of God**
    - The **image of God** encompasses both the spiritual and physical aspects of humanity.
    - The unity of body and soul reflects the integrity of the divine image.
    - Both faculties are involved in human dominion and moral action.
    - The Fall affected both the body and the soul, distorting but not eradicating the image.
    - "The image of God, therefore, does not belong exclusively either to the soul or to the body, but to the whole man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **The Fall and Its Effects on Unity**
    - Sin disrupted the harmonious relationship between body and soul.
    - **Death** is the unnatural separation of these two components.
    - The effects of the Fall are both spiritual (alienation from God) and physical (mortality).
    - Redemption in Christ promises the restoration of both body and soul.
    - "Death is not the destruction of the soul, but the separation of soul and body." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Resurrection and Restoration**
    - The **resurrection** affirms the enduring significance of the body.
    - Final redemption involves the reunification of body and soul in glorified form.
    - The hope of believers is not disembodied existence but holistic restoration.
    - This underscores the value of the material creation in God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The resurrection is the restoration of man to the integrity of his nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Rejection of Materialism and Dualistic Extremes**
    - Hodge rejects both **materialism** (denial of the soul) and **extreme dualism** (devaluation of the body).
    - He insists on the real, substantial existence of both body and soul.
    - The unity of the two is essential for true human existence and experience.
    - Christian anthropology must avoid reducing humanity to either component.
    - "The Scriptures guard equally against the errors of materialism and of an ultra-spiritualism." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust articulation of **psychosomatic unity** shaped the contours of Reformed anthropology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His careful distinction between body and soul, while maintaining their essential unity, provided a framework for later theological reflection on the **image of God**, the nature of sin, and the hope of resurrection. Hodge’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of human nature, especially within confessional Reformed traditions. His work continues to be a touchstone for debates on the relationship between the physical and spiritual dimensions of humanity.
