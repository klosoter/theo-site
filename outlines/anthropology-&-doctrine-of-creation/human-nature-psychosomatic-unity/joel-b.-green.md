# Joel B. Green (1956– )

Joel B. Green is a prominent advocate for understanding **human nature** as a **psychosomatic unity**, challenging traditional **dualistic anthropology**. He argues that humans are fundamentally integrated beings, with no sharp division between **body** and **soul**, and that this unity is essential for interpreting **biblical anthropology** and **salvation**.

- "Human persons in the Bible are not composed of separable parts, but are understood as whole beings in relationship to God and others." ("Body, Soul, and Human Life")

## Key Works

- Body, Soul, and Human Life: The Nature of Humanity in the Bible
- Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics (editor)
- Neuroscience, Psychology, and Religion: Illusions, Delusions, and Realities about Human Nature (with Malcolm Jeeves)
- Seized by Truth: Reading the Bible as Scripture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Argues that the Bible presents humans as unified beings, not as a composite of separable parts.
    - Rejects the **body-soul dualism** prevalent in much of Western theology.
    - Emphasizes the integration of physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of personhood.
    - Interprets key biblical terms (e.g., "soul," "spirit," "body") as describing the whole person from different perspectives.
    "The Bible does not teach a dualistic anthropology but rather a holistic view of human nature." (Body, Soul, and Human Life)

2. **Holistic Salvation**
    - Maintains that **salvation** involves the restoration of the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Connects redemption to bodily resurrection and embodied existence.
    - Critiques views of salvation that focus solely on the immaterial aspect of humanity.
    - Stresses the importance of community and relationality in the process of salvation.
    "Salvation is not about escaping the body but about the transformation of embodied existence." (Body, Soul, and Human Life)

3. **Engagement with Neuroscience**
    - Integrates findings from neuroscience to support a non-dualistic understanding of human nature.
    - Argues that scientific insights affirm the inseparability of mind and body.
    - Uses neuroscience to critique traditional theological categories that separate soul and body.
    - Advocates for a dialogue between theology and science in understanding personhood.
    "Neuroscience challenges us to rethink the traditional body-soul dichotomy." (Neuroscience, Psychology, and Religion)

4. **Scriptural Interpretation and Anthropology**
    - Reads Scripture with attention to its ancient Near Eastern and Second Temple Jewish context.
    - Argues that biblical authors did not operate with a Greek dualistic anthropology.
    - Highlights the narrative and relational dimensions of **biblical anthropology**.
    - Sees biblical language about "soul" and "spirit" as functional, not ontological.
    "Biblical anthropology is best understood in terms of function and relationship, not substance." (Body, Soul, and Human Life)

5. **Ethical Implications of Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Connects anthropology to ethical living, emphasizing embodied practices.
    - Argues that moral formation is inseparable from physical and communal realities.
    - Critiques ethical systems that neglect the body or material conditions.
    - Calls for a holistic approach to discipleship and spiritual formation.
    "Christian ethics must take seriously the embodied nature of human life." (Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Joel B. Green has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **biblical anthropology**, especially within evangelical and Reformed circles. His advocacy for **psychosomatic unity** has influenced debates on the nature of the soul, resurrection, and the integration of science and theology. Green’s work challenges dualistic assumptions and encourages a more holistic approach to theology, ethics, and pastoral care. His contributions continue to inform conversations about what it means to be human in light of Scripture and modern science.
