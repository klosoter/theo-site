# John Cooper (1951– )

John Cooper is a leading contemporary advocate of **holistic dualism**, emphasizing that human beings are a **psychosomatic unity**—an integrated whole of body and soul—rather than reducible to either purely physical or purely spiritual components. He critiques both **reductive physicalism** and **platonic dualism**, arguing that the biblical view upholds the essential unity of personhood while affirming the real distinction between **body** and **soul**.

- "Human beings are not simply bodies, nor are they simply souls; rather, they are embodied souls or ensouled bodies—a psychosomatic unity." ("Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting")

## Key Works

- Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting: Biblical Anthropology and the Monism-Dualism Debate (2000)
- "Biblical Anthropology and the Body-Soul Problem" in In Search of the Soul: Four Views of the Mind-Body Problem (2005)
- "The Current Body-Soul Debate: A Case for Dualistic Holism" (Trinity Journal, 1999)
- "Scripture and Philosophy on the Unity of Body and Soul" (in Whatever Happened to the Soul?, 1998)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Human beings are created as a unified whole, not as two separable substances.
    - The **body** and **soul** are distinct but integrally related aspects of personhood.
    - Scripture consistently presents humans as embodied souls, not as souls trapped in bodies.
    - The unity is essential for understanding both creation and redemption.
    - "The Bible presents human beings as a psychosomatic unity, not as a mere aggregate of parts." (Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting)

2. **Holistic Dualism over Reductive Physicalism**
    - Rejects the view that humans are only physical beings with no immaterial aspect.
    - Argues that **consciousness** and personal identity cannot be explained solely by physical processes.
    - Maintains that the soul is real and essential for human existence.
    - Upholds the importance of the body without denying the soul’s reality.
    - "Neither materialism nor dualism alone does justice to the biblical data; a holistic dualism is required." (Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting)

3. **Critique of Platonic and Cartesian Dualism**
    - Opposes the idea that the soul is inherently superior to or imprisoned by the body.
    - Emphasizes the goodness of the body in creation and resurrection.
    - Rejects the notion of salvation as escape from the body.
    - Stresses that biblical dualism is not anti-physical.
    - "The biblical view is not a dualism of antagonism but of distinction within unity." (Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting)

4. **Intermediate State and Personal Continuity**
    - Affirms the soul’s conscious existence apart from the body between death and resurrection.
    - Insists this state is provisional and incomplete, awaiting bodily resurrection.
    - Personal identity is preserved by the soul, but full humanity requires embodiment.
    - The hope of resurrection underscores the value of psychosomatic unity.
    - "The intermediate state is an abnormal condition, awaiting the restoration of full psychosomatic unity." (Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting)

5. **Redemption and Eschatological Restoration**
    - Salvation includes the redemption of both body and soul.
    - The resurrection is the reuniting of soul and body in glorified form.
    - Full human flourishing is realized only in embodied existence.
    - The Christian hope is not disembodied immortality but renewed psychosomatic unity.
    - "Christian hope is not for the immortality of the soul alone, but for the resurrection of the body and the restoration of the whole person." (Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting)

## Legacy and Impact

Cooper’s articulation of **holistic dualism** has significantly shaped evangelical and Reformed discussions on **human nature**, providing a robust alternative to both reductive physicalism and traditional dualism. His work has influenced debates on the mind-body problem, the intermediate state, and the meaning of resurrection. By grounding his anthropology in both Scripture and philosophical analysis, Cooper has helped clarify the importance of psychosomatic unity for Christian theology and ethics.
