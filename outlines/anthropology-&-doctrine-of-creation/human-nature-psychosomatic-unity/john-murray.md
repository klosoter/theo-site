# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray affirmed the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, emphasizing that humans are created as a unified whole of **body and soul**. He rejected any dualistic separation that would diminish the integrity of either aspect, insisting that the **image of God** is expressed in the totality of human existence. Murray’s approach is rooted in a robust **Reformed anthropology**, highlighting the significance of both physical and spiritual dimensions in the constitution of man.

- "Man is not a soul dwelling in a body, but a unitary being, body and soul together." ("Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2")

## Key Works

- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially in discussions of anthropology)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "The Nature of Sin" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humans are created as a single, unified being of body and soul.
    - The **image of God** encompasses both physical and spiritual aspects.
    - Dualism that separates body and soul is contrary to biblical teaching.
    - The whole person, not just the soul, is the subject of redemption.
    - "The dichotomy between body and soul is not to be construed as a division of man into two separate entities." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Body and Soul in the Image of God**
    - The **imago Dei** is not limited to the soul but includes the body.
    - Human dignity and worth are grounded in this comprehensive image-bearing.
    - Both faculties are essential for fulfilling God’s mandate.
    - The body is not a mere vessel but integral to human identity.
    - "The image of God in man is not to be restricted to the soul or spirit." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Holistic Redemption**
    - Salvation in Christ addresses both spiritual and physical aspects of humanity.
    - The resurrection of the body affirms the value of the physical.
    - Sanctification involves the whole person, not just the inner life.
    - Eschatological hope includes bodily renewal.
    - "Redemption is not complete until the body is redeemed." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Sin and the Whole Person**
    - Sin affects both body and soul, corrupting the entire person.
    - The fall resulted in total depravity, impacting all human faculties.
    - Restoration in Christ reverses the effects of sin on both aspects.
    - Ethical conduct must be embodied, not merely internal.
    - "Sin is not confined to the soul; it pervades the whole man." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Anthropology Rooted in Scripture**
    - Murray’s doctrine of man is grounded in biblical exegesis.
    - He resists philosophical constructs that distort biblical teaching.
    - The unity of human nature is derived from creation accounts.
    - Scriptural anthropology shapes his understanding of salvation and ethics.
    - "Our conception of man must be governed by the witness of Scripture." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, providing a robust alternative to both materialist and dualist models. His insistence on the integrity of body and soul has influenced discussions on the **image of God**, sanctification, and eschatology within confessional theology. Murray’s biblical rigor and clarity continue to inform debates on human nature, ensuring that the whole person remains central in theological reflection and pastoral practice.
