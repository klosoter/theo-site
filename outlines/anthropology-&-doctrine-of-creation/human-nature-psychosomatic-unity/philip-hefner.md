# Philip Hefner (1932–)

Philip Hefner approaches **human nature** as a dynamic **psychosomatic unity**, emphasizing the inseparability of the **biological** and **spiritual** dimensions of the person. He is best known for his concept of the **created co-creator**, which frames humans as both products of evolution and responsible agents within creation, integrating insights from **theological anthropology** and **science**.

- "We are best understood as psychosomatic unities, not as souls inhabiting bodies, but as beings whose spiritual and physical dimensions are inseparable." ("The Human Factor")

## Key Works

- "The Human Factor: Evolution, Culture, and Religion" (1993)
- "Technology and Human Becoming" (2003)
- "Biocultural Evolution and The Created Co-Creator" (Zygon, 1984)
- "The Created Co-Creator: What It Means to Be Human" (Zygon, 1991)
- "Religion and the Scientific Future" (co-edited, 1971)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Rejects dualistic separations of **body** and **soul**.
    - Argues that human identity is constituted by the integration of **biological** and **spiritual** aspects.
    - Draws on both **theological** and **scientific** perspectives to support this unity.
    - Sees the human as a single, embodied subject in relationship with God and creation.
    - "The psychosomatic unity of the human being is a fundamental presupposition for understanding ourselves as created co-creators." ("The Human Factor")

2. **The Created Co-Creator**
    - Humans are both products of **evolution** and responsible agents in the world.
    - Theological anthropology must account for human creativity and responsibility.
    - The concept bridges **science** and **theology** in understanding human vocation.
    - Emphasizes that human agency is exercised within the limits of creatureliness.
    - "We are created by God to be co-creators in the ongoing process of creation." ("The Human Factor")

3. **Integration of Science and Theology**
    - Advocates for a dialogue between **evolutionary biology** and **Christian doctrine**.
    - Human psychosomatic unity is illuminated by scientific insights into human origins.
    - Theology must be informed by contemporary understandings of human nature.
    - Rejects any theology that ignores empirical realities of human embodiment.
    - "Theology and science together provide a fuller picture of what it means to be human." ("The Human Factor")

4. **Embodiment and Spirituality**
    - Spiritual life is always embodied; there is no disembodied spirituality.
    - Practices and experiences of faith are mediated through the body.
    - Human **spirituality** is shaped by our biological and cultural evolution.
    - Embodiment is essential to understanding human relationship with God.
    - "Our spirituality is always lived out in and through our bodies." ("Technology and Human Becoming")

5. **Human Responsibility in Creation**
    - Human psychosomatic unity grounds ethical responsibility in the world.
    - Humans are called to responsible participation in the ongoing creation.
    - Ethical action is shaped by our embodied, relational existence.
    - Theological anthropology must address ecological and technological challenges.
    - "Our vocation as co-creators calls us to responsible action within creation." ("The Created Co-Creator")

## Legacy and Impact

Hefner’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly influenced contemporary **theological anthropology**, especially in conversations bridging theology and science. His concept of the **created co-creator** has become a foundational idea for those seeking to integrate evolutionary theory with Christian doctrine. Hefner’s work continues to shape discussions on embodiment, human responsibility, and the relationship between faith and scientific understanding. His legacy endures in both academic theology and the broader dialogue on what it means to be human in a scientific age.
