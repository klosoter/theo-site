# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer emphasized the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, rejecting both dualistic and reductionistic accounts. He argued that the human person is a unified whole, created in the **image of God**, where the **spiritual** and **bodily** aspects are inseparable and mutually constitutive. This holistic anthropology shapes his understanding of **sin**, **redemption**, and the **resurrection**.

- "The Bible does not speak of man as a soul that has a body, but as a living unity, a psychosomatic being." (Man: The Image of God)

## Key Works

- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Return of Christ (Studies in Dogmatics)
- General Revelation (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Faith and Justification

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Humanity is fundamentally a unified being, not a composite of separable parts.
    - The **body** and **soul** are distinct but never independent in biblical anthropology.
    - Dualistic or purely materialistic views distort the biblical witness.
    - The unity of human nature is essential for understanding both **creation** and **redemption**.
    - "The biblical view of man is that of a unity, a psychosomatic being, not a duality of separable substances." (Man: The Image of God)

2. **Image of God as Relational and Holistic**
    - The **imago Dei** encompasses the whole person, not just the soul or rational faculties.
    - Human dignity and vocation are rooted in this holistic image.
    - The image is expressed in relationality—with God, others, and creation.
    - Sin affects the entire person, not just one aspect.
    - "The image of God is not a part of man, but man himself in his totality." (Man: The Image of God)

3. **Sin and the Distortion of Unity**
    - Sin disrupts the unity of human nature, leading to alienation and fragmentation.
    - Both spiritual and bodily dimensions are corrupted by the fall.
    - Redemption in Christ addresses the whole person, restoring unity.
    - The psychosomatic unity is essential for understanding the depth of human depravity.
    - "Sin is not a matter of the body alone or the soul alone, but of the whole man." (Sin)

4. **Resurrection and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The resurrection affirms the enduring significance of the body.
    - Eschatological hope is for the restoration of the whole person, not just the soul.
    - The psychosomatic unity is perfected in the resurrection life.
    - The continuity of identity depends on the unity of body and soul.
    - "The resurrection is the revelation of the unity of man in the new creation." (The Return of Christ)

5. **Critique of Dualism and Reductionism**
    - Berkouwer rejects both Greek-influenced dualism and modern reductionism.
    - He insists that biblical anthropology cannot be reduced to either extreme.
    - Theological reflection must respect the scriptural emphasis on unity.
    - Both body and soul are integral to human existence and destiny.
    - "We must beware of every attempt to split man into parts or to reduce him to one aspect." (Man: The Image of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has significantly influenced Reformed anthropology, providing a corrective to both dualistic and materialistic tendencies in modern theology. His holistic approach to the **image of God** and human nature has shaped discussions on sin, redemption, and eschatology within the broader Reformed tradition. Berkouwer’s work continues to be a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded, integrative understanding of the human person.
