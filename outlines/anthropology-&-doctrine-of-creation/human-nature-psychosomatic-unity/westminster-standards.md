# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **Reformed anthropology** that affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, teaching that humans are created as a unified whole consisting of both **body and soul**. This unity is foundational for understanding the image of God, the effects of the Fall, and the hope of **bodily resurrection**. The Standards consistently reject any notion of the body or soul as inherently evil, emphasizing the goodness of both in God's original creation.

- "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls...do immediately return to God who gave them." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 4, 6, 32)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 17, 22, 37, 86)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 10, 22, 37)
- The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context (Chad Van Dixhoorn)
- The Theology of the Westminster Standards: Historical Context and Theological Insights (J.V. Fesko)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Body and Soul**
    - Humans are created with both a material body and an immaterial soul.
    - Both aspects are essential to the full image of God in man.
    - The soul is immortal, but the body is also integral to human identity.
    - The unity of body and soul is not accidental but by divine design.
    - "After God had made all other creatures, he created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls, endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after his own image." (WCF 4.2)

2. **Psychosomatic Unity in the Image of God**
    - The image of God encompasses the whole person, not just the soul.
    - Original righteousness, knowledge, and holiness are expressed through both body and soul.
    - The body is not a prison for the soul but a good creation.
    - The unity is foundational for ethical and spiritual responsibilities.
    - "God created man...after his own image, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (WSC 10)

3. **The Fall and Its Effects on the Whole Person**
    - Sin corrupts both body and soul, affecting the entire human nature.
    - Death is the separation of body and soul, a result of the Fall.
    - Both body and soul are subject to misery and death due to sin.
    - Redemption in Christ addresses the whole person, not just the soul.
    - "By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body." (WCF 6.2)

4. **Intermediate State and the Hope of Resurrection**
    - At death, the soul is separated from the body but remains conscious.
    - The body returns to dust, awaiting resurrection.
    - The final hope is the reunion of body and soul in glorification.
    - The resurrection affirms the enduring value of the body.
    - "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other." (WCF 32.2)

5. **Ethical Implications of Psychosomatic Unity**
    - Human dignity is rooted in the unity of body and soul.
    - Care for the body is a moral responsibility, not merely a physical concern.
    - Worship and service involve both bodily actions and spiritual devotion.
    - The sacraments signify and seal grace to both body and soul.
    - "The bodies of the just...shall be made like unto his glorious body." (WLC 87)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed anthropology**, providing a robust framework for understanding human nature as a psychosomatic unity. Their teaching has influenced confessional documents, pastoral care, and Christian ethics within Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. By grounding human dignity and hope in the unity of body and soul, the Standards continue to inform contemporary discussions on the image of God, resurrection, and holistic redemption.
