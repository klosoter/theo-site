# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til emphasized the **psychosomatic unity** of human nature, insisting that humans are created as a unified whole of **body and soul** in the image of God. He rejected all forms of dualism that would separate the material and immaterial aspects of humanity, grounding his view in the **Reformed doctrine of creation** and the **covenantal structure** of human existence.

- "Man is a unit, a rational-moral being, created in covenant with God, and his body and soul are not to be separated in thought or in fact." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Psychosomatic Unity as Image of God**
    - Humanity is created as a unified whole, reflecting the **image of God** in both body and soul.
    - The unity of human nature is essential for true covenantal relationship with God.
    - Both physical and spiritual aspects are integral to human identity and vocation.
    - Any division between body and soul undermines the biblical anthropology.
    - "The whole man, body and soul, stands in covenant relation to God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Greek Dualism**
    - Van Til critiques Platonic and Cartesian dualism as unbiblical.
    - He argues that dualism distorts the **doctrine of creation** and the nature of redemption.
    - The biblical worldview maintains the goodness of the material as well as the spiritual.
    - Dualism leads to false views of salvation and sanctification.
    - "The Greek notion of the soul as a prisoner in the body is foreign to Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenantal Structure of Human Existence**
    - Human nature is defined by its **covenantal relationship** with God.
    - Both body and soul are involved in covenant obedience or disobedience.
    - The fall and redemption affect the whole person, not just one aspect.
    - The psychosomatic unity is essential for understanding sin and salvation.
    - "Man’s whole being is involved in the covenantal relationship with God." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Epistemological Implications**
    - Human knowledge is possible only as a unified act of the whole person.
    - Both rational (soul) and empirical (body) faculties are involved in knowing God and the world.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** impact both body and soul.
    - True knowledge is covenantal and presupposes psychosomatic unity.
    - "All human knowledge is covenantal and involves the whole man." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

5. **Redemption and Eschatology**
    - Redemption in Christ restores the unity of body and soul.
    - The resurrection affirms the enduring significance of the body.
    - Eschatological hope is for the renewal of the whole person, not just the soul.
    - The psychosomatic unity is consummated in the new creation.
    - "The resurrection of the body is the final vindication of man’s psychosomatic unity." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **psychosomatic unity** has shaped Reformed anthropology, especially in its rejection of dualistic tendencies and its emphasis on the covenantal nature of human existence. His influence persists in contemporary discussions on the image of God, the doctrine of creation, and the holistic nature of redemption. Van Til’s thought continues to inform debates on the relationship between theology, philosophy, and science within the Reformed tradition.
