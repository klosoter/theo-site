# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **days of creation** with careful exegetical restraint, emphasizing the primacy of **Scriptural authority** and the need to interpret **Genesis 1** within its own literary and theological context. He did not advocate for a rigidly literalistic or concordist reading, but insisted that the **creation account** must be understood in light of the **analogy of Scripture** and the **Creator-creature distinction**.

- "We must be on our guard against reading into the text of Scripture what is not there and equally against failing to recognize what is there." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Nature and Authority of Scripture" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "The Interpretation of Genesis 1:1–2" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "The Creation Account" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "The Christian Faith and the Modern World" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- Romans (NICNT Commentary; relevant for theological method)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Scriptural Authority**
    - Scripture is the ultimate norm for interpreting the **days of creation**.
    - Exegesis must be governed by the **analogy of Scripture**.
    - Human speculation must not override the plain teaching of the text.
    - The **inerrancy** and **clarity** of Scripture are foundational.
    - "The authority of Scripture is paramount and must not be compromised by extraneous considerations." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Recognition of Literary Form**
    - Genesis 1 must be read with sensitivity to its literary structure.
    - The text uses **repetition** and **pattern** to communicate theological truths.
    - The genre does not demand a simplistic literalism.
    - The days may have a unique character distinct from ordinary solar days.
    - "The literary form of Genesis 1 is unique and must be respected in interpretation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is foundational to understanding creation.
    - The mode of divine action in creation is not bound to creaturely categories.
    - God’s acts in creation are sovereign and mysterious.
    - The text resists reduction to naturalistic explanation.
    - "We must beware of interpreting the acts of creation in terms of processes with which we are familiar." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **Openness on the Length of the Days**
    - Murray did not insist on a 24-hour interpretation of the days.
    - He allowed for the possibility of non-literal days, given exegetical and theological considerations.
    - The text’s primary concern is theological, not chronological.
    - The **framework** or analogical view is not excluded by the text.
    - "The question as to the length of the days is not one that can be dogmatically settled by appeal to the text alone." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

5. **Theological Centrality of Creation**
    - The doctrine of creation is foundational for all **Reformed theology**.
    - The creation account establishes God’s sovereignty and purpose.
    - The **Sabbath** pattern is rooted in the creation week.
    - The narrative sets the stage for **redemptive history**.
    - "The doctrine of creation is basic to the whole fabric of biblical revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful, exegetically grounded approach to the **days of creation** has influenced generations of Reformed theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. His emphasis on **Scriptural authority** and the Creator-creature distinction provided a model for theological humility and fidelity. Murray’s work continues to shape contemporary discussions on creation, especially among those seeking to uphold biblical inerrancy while engaging with questions of science and hermeneutics.
