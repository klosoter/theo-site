# John H. Walton (1952– )

John H. Walton is known for his distinctive interpretation of the **days of creation** in Genesis 1, arguing that the text is primarily concerned with **functional ontology** rather than **material origins**. He contends that the biblical account reflects an **ancient Near Eastern worldview**, emphasizing **cosmic temple inauguration** and the assignment of functions rather than a literal, sequential account of material creation.

- "Genesis 1 is about God bringing order and assigning functions, not about making material things." ("The Lost World of Genesis One")

## Key Works

- The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate (2009)
- Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology (2011)
- The NIV Application Commentary: Genesis (2001)
- The Lost World of Adam and Eve (2015)
- Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament (2006)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Functional Ontology of Creation**
   - Genesis 1 describes the assignment of functions, not the creation of material substances.
   - The focus is on how God orders the cosmos for human habitation.
   - Material existence is assumed, but the text highlights purpose and role.
   - This view aligns with ancient Near Eastern parallels.
   - "The key issue is not the material origins of the cosmos but its functions as ordered by God." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

2. **Ancient Near Eastern Context**
   - Genesis 1 must be read in light of its cultural and literary environment.
   - Ancient cosmologies often emphasize function and order over material manufacture.
   - The biblical text engages with, but also transforms, surrounding worldviews.
   - Understanding the original audience is crucial for interpretation.
   - "We must read Genesis as an ancient document, not impose modern questions upon it." (Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology)

3. **Cosmic Temple Inauguration**
   - The seven days of creation parallel ancient temple dedication ceremonies.
   - Creation is depicted as God establishing his cosmic temple, with the seventh day as his enthronement.
   - The Sabbath rest signifies God taking up residence in his creation.
   - This motif underscores the purpose and sacredness of the cosmos.
   - "The cosmos is being set up as God’s temple, and the seven days are about its inauguration." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

4. **Non-Literal Chronology**
   - The days of Genesis 1 are not intended as literal 24-hour periods.
   - The structure is literary and theological, not scientific or historical.
   - The sequence of days serves to communicate order and function.
   - This approach avoids unnecessary conflict with scientific accounts of origins.
   - "The seven days are a literary device to communicate theological truths, not a chronology of material events." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

5. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
   - God is the ultimate source and sustainer of all functions and order in creation.
   - The text affirms **divine sovereignty** over the cosmos, regardless of the mechanism of material origins.
   - The focus on function does not diminish God’s creative authority.
   - This perspective maintains the theological integrity of **creation ex nihilo**.
   - "God’s sovereignty is evident in his assignment of roles and purposes throughout creation." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

## Legacy and Impact

Walton’s interpretation of the **days of creation** has significantly influenced evangelical discussions on **hermeneutics** and the relationship between **science and faith**. His emphasis on **ancient Near Eastern context** and functional ontology has challenged traditional readings and encouraged a broader engagement with biblical backgrounds. Walton’s work continues to shape debates on Genesis, offering a framework that seeks to honor both the authority of Scripture and the findings of modern science.
