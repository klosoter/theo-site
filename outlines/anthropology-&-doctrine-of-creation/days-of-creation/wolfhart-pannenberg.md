# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **days of creation** not as literal 24-hour periods but as theological constructs pointing to the **eschatological** and **historical** nature of God's creative activity. He emphasized the **revelatory** and **teleological** dimensions of the creation narrative, viewing it as foundational for understanding **God’s relationship to history** and the unfolding of **divine purpose** in time.

- "The biblical doctrine of creation is not concerned with the temporal beginning of the world, but with the world’s dependence on God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as Revelation of God’s Sovereignty**
    - The creation account reveals **God’s lordship** over all reality.
    - The days structure is a literary device to communicate **order and purpose**.
    - Creation is not a closed past event but an ongoing act of God.
    - The narrative points to the **eschatological fulfillment** of creation.
    - "Creation is the presupposition of the history of God with the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Non-Literal Interpretation of the Days**
    - The "days" are not scientific or chronological markers.
    - They serve to structure the narrative theologically, not historically.
    - The focus is on the **meaning** of creation, not its temporal mechanics.
    - Pannenberg critiques fundamentalist readings as missing the theological point.
    - "The days of creation are not to be understood as literal days of twenty-four hours." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Integration of Creation and History**
    - Creation is the foundation for understanding **history as the arena of God’s action**.
    - The days motif anticipates the unfolding of history toward its **eschatological goal**.
    - God’s creative work is inseparable from his providential guidance of history.
    - The creation narrative is a proleptic sign of the **new creation**.
    - "The creation story is a prefiguration of the consummation of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Dialogue with Science**
    - Pannenberg insists on the compatibility of **theology and scientific cosmology**.
    - The doctrine of creation addresses the world’s **contingency**, not its scientific origins.
    - The days of creation should not be read as competing with scientific accounts.
    - Theology must engage with contemporary scientific understandings of time and origins.
    - "Theology must not compete with science in explaining the origins of the world." (Theology and the Philosophy of Science)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Creation**
    - The meaning of creation is found in its **destiny**, not merely its beginning.
    - The days structure points forward to the **Sabbath rest** as a sign of fulfillment.
    - Creation is oriented toward the **future consummation** in Christ.
    - The narrative invites hope in the ultimate realization of God’s purpose.
    - "The true meaning of creation is revealed only in its eschatological fulfillment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **days of creation** has influenced contemporary theology by emphasizing the **eschatological** and **historical** dimensions of the doctrine of creation. His insistence on integrating theology with scientific insights has encouraged a non-fundamentalist, dialogical stance in modern systematic theology. Pannenberg’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between **creation, revelation, and history** within both academic and ecclesial contexts.
