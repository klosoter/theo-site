# Edward J. Young (1907–1968)

Edward J. Young was a leading advocate for the **literal, historical interpretation** of the **days of creation** in Genesis 1. He argued that the **six days** were ordinary, consecutive, 24-hour days, upholding the **inerrancy of Scripture** and the **historical reliability** of the Genesis account against both **framework** and **day-age** theories.

- "The days of Genesis 1 are to be understood as days of ordinary length." (Studies in Genesis One)

## Key Works

- Studies in Genesis One
- An Introduction to the Old Testament
- Thy Word is Truth
- The Book of Isaiah (3 vols.)
- "The Days of Genesis: First Article" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal, Consecutive Days**
    - The six days of creation are six consecutive, normal days.
    - Each day consists of an evening and a morning, indicating a 24-hour period.
    - The narrative structure of Genesis 1 supports a chronological sequence.
    - Rejects symbolic or figurative interpretations of the days.
    - "There is no evidence that the author of Genesis regarded the days as anything other than ordinary days." (Studies in Genesis One)

2. **Historical Reliability of Genesis**
    - Genesis 1 is a trustworthy historical account, not myth or allegory.
    - The text intends to communicate real events in time and space.
    - Upholds the unity and coherence of the biblical creation narrative.
    - Opposes higher critical approaches that undermine historicity.
    - "Genesis is not myth, but sober history." (Studies in Genesis One)

3. **Defense of Scriptural Inerrancy**
    - Scripture is without error in all that it affirms, including creation.
    - The doctrine of inerrancy demands a faithful reading of the text.
    - Attempts to harmonize Genesis with extra-biblical theories risk compromising biblical authority.
    - The plain sense of the text should be maintained unless context demands otherwise.
    - "We must not allow the opinions of men to determine our interpretation of the Word of God." (Studies in Genesis One)

4. **Rejection of the Framework Hypothesis**
    - The framework view undermines the historical sequence of the creation week.
    - Genesis 1 presents a real chronology, not a literary or thematic structure.
    - The structure of the text is not merely poetic or symbolic.
    - The Sabbath commandment in Exodus 20:11 presupposes literal days.
    - "The framework hypothesis is not supported by the text itself." (Studies in Genesis One)

5. **Theological Significance of Creation Order**
    - The order of creation events is theologically meaningful and intentional.
    - The sequence reflects God's wisdom and purpose in creation.
    - The pattern of work and rest grounds the Sabbath ordinance.
    - The creation account reveals the sovereignty and power of God.
    - "The order of creation is not arbitrary, but divinely ordained." (Studies in Genesis One)

## Legacy and Impact

Edward J. Young's robust defense of the **literal days of creation** has profoundly shaped conservative Reformed and evangelical approaches to Genesis. His scholarship remains a touchstone for those upholding the **historicity** and **inerrancy** of the biblical creation account. Young’s work continues to influence debates on the interpretation of Genesis, providing a rigorous exegetical foundation for the traditional view of the **six-day creation**.
