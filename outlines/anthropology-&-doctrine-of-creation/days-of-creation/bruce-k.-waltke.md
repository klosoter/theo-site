# Bruce K. Waltke (1930– )

Bruce K. Waltke approaches the **days of creation** in Genesis as a literary framework rather than a sequence of literal, consecutive 24-hour periods. He emphasizes the **theological intent** of the text, focusing on **God’s sovereignty** and the **polemic against pagan cosmologies** rather than providing a scientific chronology. Waltke’s reading seeks to harmonize **Scripture’s authority** with insights from **modern science**.

- "The days are not intended to be a chronological account but a literary device to teach theological truths." ("Genesis: A Commentary")

## Key Works

- "Genesis: A Commentary" (2001)
- "An Old Testament Theology: An Exegetical, Canonical, and Thematic Approach" (2007)
- "The Literary Genre of Genesis, Chapter 1" (Crux, 1975)
- "The Creation Account in Genesis 1:1–3: Part III: The Initial Chaos Theory and the Precreation Chaos Theory" (Bibliotheca Sacra, 1975)
- "The Hermeneutics of Genesis 1 as Applied to the Creation Debate" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1988)

   - Rejects a strict concordist reading that demands scientific alignment.
   - "The framework view best accounts for the literary features of the text." ("Genesis: A Commentary")

2. **Theological Primacy over Scientific Detail**
   - Maintains that Genesis 1 teaches **theological truths** about God and creation, not scientific processes.
   - Stresses the **polemic** against ancient Near Eastern myths.
   - Affirms the **sovereignty and transcendence of God** as central.
   - Encourages reading Genesis in its ancient literary and cultural context.
   - "Genesis 1 is not a scientific treatise but a theological proclamation." ("An Old Testament Theology")

3. **Affirmation of Scripture’s Authority**

4. **Compatibility with Modern Science**
   - Accepts the legitimacy of scientific findings regarding the age of the earth.
   - Sees no necessary conflict between **biblical revelation** and **general revelation**.
   - Argues that the framework view allows Christians to engage with science honestly.
   - Warns against forcing Scripture into a modern scientific mold.
   - "The Bible does not teach science, but it is not in conflict with true science." ("Genesis: A Commentary")

5. **Anti-Mythological Polemic**
   - Highlights Genesis 1 as a **polemic** against pagan creation stories.
   - Emphasizes the uniqueness of **Yahweh** as Creator.
   - Notes the absence of conflict or theogony in the biblical account.
