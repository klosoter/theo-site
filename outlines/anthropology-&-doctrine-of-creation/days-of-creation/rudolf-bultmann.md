# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **days of creation** not as literal, historical events but as **mythological expressions** within the biblical text. He argued that the **Genesis creation account** reflects an ancient worldview and must be **demythologized** to uncover its existential significance for modern readers, rather than interpreted through a scientific or literalist lens.

- "The cosmology of the biblical story is essentially mythical in character." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - The biblical creation narrative is a mythological framework, not a scientific account.
    - Demythologization seeks to interpret the existential meaning behind the myth.
    - The days of creation symbolize the order and meaning God imparts to existence.
    - Modern readers must translate mythological language into existential categories.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Rejection of Literalism**
    - The Genesis days are not literal 24-hour periods.
    - Literal readings obscure the existential message of the text.
    - The focus should be on the theological, not chronological, significance.
    - Creation narratives are products of their ancient cultural context.
    - "We cannot use electric light and radio, and in the event of illness avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means, and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament." (New Testament and Mythology)

3. **Existential Interpretation**
    - The creation account addresses human existence and meaning.
    - The text’s value lies in its existential challenge to the reader.
    - Creation is about humanity’s relationship to God, not cosmological origins.
    - The days structure conveys order and purpose, not temporal sequence.
    - "What matters is not the objective historical or cosmological facts, but the existential understanding of human existence before God." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Historical Relativity of Biblical Worldview**
    - The biblical worldview is conditioned by its historical context.
    - Ancient cosmology (e.g., six-day creation) is not binding for modern faith.
    - Faith must be disentangled from outdated cosmological assumptions.
    - The enduring message is theological, not scientific.
    - "The world picture of the New Testament is a mythical world picture." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Centrality of Kerygma**
    - The proclamation (kerygma) is the core of Christian faith, not the creation days.
    - The creation narrative serves as a vehicle for the kerygma.
    - Faith is grounded in the existential encounter with the Word, not in cosmological details.
    - The days of creation are subordinate to the message of Christ.
    - "The real question is not the mythological world picture but the truth of the proclamation." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **days of creation** profoundly influenced modern biblical hermeneutics by insisting on the need for **demythologization**. His existential interpretation shifted the focus from literalist readings to the theological and existential significance of biblical texts. While controversial, his work continues to shape debates on the relationship between **science and faith**, and the interpretation of **myth** in Scripture. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in the ongoing conversation about the relevance of ancient cosmologies for contemporary Christian theology.
