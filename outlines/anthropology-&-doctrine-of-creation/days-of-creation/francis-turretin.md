# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading voice in **Reformed orthodoxy**, staunchly defending a **literal, historical interpretation** of the **days of creation**. He insisted that the six days in Genesis were real, consecutive, 24-hour periods, grounding his view in the **clarity and sufficiency of Scripture** and the **analogy of Scripture** over against allegorical or philosophical reinterpretations.

- "We think that the days of creation were true and natural days, consisting of twenty-four hours, which the sacred writer distinguishes from the night." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.16.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 1, Topic 5, Questions 16–17)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (Richard Muller, ed., referencing Turretin)
- Reformed Dogmatics (Heppe, referencing Turretin’s views)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal Six-Day Creation**
    - The six days in Genesis are understood as six consecutive, natural days of 24 hours.
    - Turretin rejects allegorical or figurative interpretations of the creation days.
    - The plain sense of the text is to be maintained unless compelling reasons dictate otherwise.
    - The six-day pattern grounds the **Sabbath commandment** in Exodus 20:11.
    "We do not deny that God could have created all things in a moment, but he chose to do so in six days to teach us order and to establish the week." (Institutes, 5.16.6)

2. **Analogy of Scripture**
    - Scripture interprets Scripture; ambiguous passages are clarified by clearer ones.
    - The narrative structure of Genesis is confirmed by references elsewhere in the Bible.
    - The fourth commandment (Exodus 20:11) is cited as evidence for literal days.
    - The analogy of Scripture guards against speculative exegesis.
    "The law itself interprets the history, and the history the law." (Institutes, 5.16.7)

3. **Rejection of Allegorical and Philosophical Interpretations**
    - Turretin critiques those who spiritualize or allegorize the days of creation.
    - He warns against subordinating biblical teaching to philosophical or scientific theories.
    - Moses wrote for the common people, not for philosophers or the learned elite.
    - Allegorical readings undermine the authority and clarity of **divine revelation**.
    "We must not accommodate the sacred text to the opinions of philosophers." (Institutes, 5.16.8)

4. **Doctrine of Divine Accommodation**
    - God accommodates his revelation to human understanding.
    - The creation account is written in accessible language for all people.
    - Anthropomorphic language is used to communicate divine actions.
    - This accommodation does not diminish the truthfulness or historicity of the account.
    "Scripture speaks according to the capacity of the common people." (Institutes, 5.16.8)

5. **Defense of Scriptural Clarity and Sufficiency**
    - The creation account is clear and sufficient for faith and practice.
    - Turretin resists the need for external authorities to interpret Genesis.
    - He affirms the perspicuity of Scripture in matters necessary for salvation and doctrine.
    - The sufficiency of Scripture is a bulwark against rationalism and skepticism.
    "The Scriptures are so perspicuous in necessary things that they can be understood by all." (Institutes, 2.15.13)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of a **literal six-day creation** became a standard position in later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional statements and theological education for centuries. His insistence on the **clarity and sufficiency of Scripture** continues to inform debates on creation within conservative Reformed circles. Turretin’s careful exegesis and polemical rigor established a model for engaging both internal and external challenges to biblical doctrine. His work remains a touchstone for those advocating a traditional understanding of the **days of creation**.
