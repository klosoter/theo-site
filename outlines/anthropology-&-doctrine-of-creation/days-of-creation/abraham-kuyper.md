# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached the **days of creation** with a commitment to the authority of **Scripture** while also recognizing the complexity of interpreting **Genesis 1**. He advocated for a **framework interpretation**, emphasizing the theological rather than strictly chronological nature of the creation account, and sought to harmonize **Reformed doctrine** with emerging scientific insights. Kuyper maintained that the **sovereignty of God** is evident in both the act and order of creation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority in Creation**
    - Upholds the **inerrancy** and **sufficiency** of Scripture in matters of origins.
    - Argues that Genesis 1 is divinely inspired and authoritative for doctrine.
    - Rejects purely naturalistic or materialistic readings of the creation account.
    - Insists that exegesis must respect the **redemptive-historical** context.
    - "The Word of God remains the only reliable source for our knowledge of the beginning." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Framework Interpretation of the Days**
    - Suggests the days of creation are a **literary framework** rather than literal 24-hour periods.
    - Sees the structure of Genesis 1 as emphasizing order and purpose, not chronology.
    - Argues that the text’s primary aim is theological, not scientific.
    - Maintains that the framework view upholds the **sovereignty of God** in creation.
    - "The six days are not to be understood as solar days, but as God’s own division of His creative work." (Principles of Sacred Theology)

3. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - Asserts that God’s **sovereignty** governs both the act and order of creation.
    - Emphasizes that creation is a sovereign, free act of God, not a process bound by natural necessity.
    - Insists that all creation reflects God’s kingship and providence.
    - Connects the doctrine of creation to the broader Reformed emphasis on divine lordship.
    - "Creation is the royal work of the Sovereign, who calls all things into being by His word." (Lectures on Calvinism)

4. **Engagement with Science**
    - Encourages respectful dialogue between **theology** and **science**.
    - Warns against both uncritical acceptance and outright rejection of scientific theories.
    - Argues that scientific findings must be interpreted in light of biblical revelation.
    - Sees the doctrine of **common grace** as allowing for genuine discovery in the natural world.
    - "Science and faith are not enemies, but must each remain within their God-given boundaries." (Common Grace)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Reading**
    - Reads Genesis 1 within the broader **redemptive-historical** narrative.
    - Sees the creation account as foundational for understanding **covenant** and **redemption**.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s creative and redemptive work.
    - Argues that the days of creation point forward to God’s ultimate purposes in Christ.
    - "The history of creation is inseparable from the history of redemption." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s approach to the **days of creation** provided a mediating position within the Reformed tradition, balancing fidelity to **Scripture** with openness to scientific inquiry. His framework interpretation influenced later Reformed theologians and contributed to ongoing discussions about the relationship between **faith and science**. Kuyper’s emphasis on the **sovereignty of God** and the theological purpose of Genesis 1 continues to shape contemporary debates on creation within confessional circles.
