# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine approached the **days of creation** in Genesis with a distinctive emphasis on the **non-literal, allegorical interpretation** of Scripture. He argued that the **six days** represent a logical or **theological ordering** of creation rather than a sequence of **literal 24-hour periods**, highlighting the **timelessness of God's creative act**.

- "What kind of days these were it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how much more to say!" (The Literal Meaning of Genesis, IV.33)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)
- On the Trinity
- On Genesis: A Refutation of the Manichees

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Non-literal interpretation of the days**
    - The "days" in Genesis are not literal 24-hour periods.
    - Augustine sees the days as a logical framework for understanding creation.
    - He emphasizes the **figurative and allegorical** meaning of the text.
    - This approach allows for the **eternality and immutability of God**.
    - "But at least we know that it is different from the ordinary day with which we are familiar." (The Literal Meaning of Genesis, IV.27)

2. **Instantaneous creation**
    - Augustine teaches that God created all things simultaneously.
    - The six days represent an ordering for human comprehension.
    - Creation is an act of **divine will**, not a temporal process.
    - The sequence is pedagogical, not chronological.
    - "He created all things together, not in six days, but simultaneously." (The City of God, XI.6)

3. **Accommodation to human understanding**
    - Scripture uses language suited to human limitations.
    - The days serve as a didactic tool for finite minds.
    - Divine truths are expressed in **anthropomorphic terms**.
    - The narrative structure is for human benefit, not divine necessity.
    - "Scripture speaks in a way that is accessible to our weakness." (The Literal Meaning of Genesis, I.19)

4. **Affirmation of creation ex nihilo**
    - Augustine insists on **creation out of nothing**.
    - The days do not imply pre-existing matter or eternal forms.
    - God's creative act is sovereign and absolute.
    - The temporal sequence does not compromise divine omnipotence.
    - "For God did not create the world in time, but with time." (Confessions, XI.14)

5. **Integration of creation with Trinitarian theology**
    - The act of creation is attributed to the **Triune God**.
    - The Word (Logos) is central in the creative process.
    - The Spirit's role is present in the ordering and sustaining of creation.
    - The days reflect the unity and diversity within the Godhead.
    - "The Trinity, one God, made all things, not in time, but with time." (The City of God, XI.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s interpretation of the **days of creation** profoundly shaped the Western Christian tradition, especially in the development of **non-literal hermeneutics** and the doctrine of **creation ex nihilo**. His approach influenced medieval and Reformation theologians, providing a framework for reconciling **Scripture and reason**. Augustine’s emphasis on the **timelessness of God’s creative act** continues to inform contemporary discussions on creation and the interpretation of Genesis.
