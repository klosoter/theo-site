# Wayne Grudem (1948–)

Wayne Grudem is a leading evangelical theologian who defends a **literal, historical interpretation** of the **days of creation** in Genesis 1, insisting these are six consecutive, 24-hour days. He grounds his view in the **grammatical-historical method** and upholds the **authority of Scripture** as the decisive standard in matters of origins, while engaging respectfully with alternative evangelical perspectives.

- "The most straightforward reading of Genesis 1–3, and the one that I think the original readers would have understood, is that God created the universe in six consecutive days." (Systematic Theology, 2nd ed.)

- Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith
- "Creation: Distinguishing Among Several Different Views" (in Theistic Evolution: A Scientific, Philosophical, and Theological Critique)
- Christian Beliefs: Twenty Basics Every Christian Should Know

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal Six-Day Creation**
    - Argues that the Hebrew word "yom" in Genesis 1 most naturally refers to a 24-hour day.
    - Sees the sequence of **evening and morning** as supporting literal days.
    - Rejects the **framework hypothesis** and **day-age theory** as inconsistent with the text.
    - Emphasizes the historical nature of Genesis 1–3 as foundational for Christian doctrine.
    "The six days of creation were six literal days, not long ages or a literary framework." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Scripture’s Clarity and Authority**
    - Upholds the **perspicuity** of Scripture, asserting Genesis 1 is clear in its meaning.
    - Maintains that **Scripture**, not science, has the final authority in interpreting origins.
    - Warns against reinterpreting the text to fit contemporary scientific theories.
    - Affirms the sufficiency of Scripture for understanding the doctrine of creation.
    "We must not allow scientific theories to override the clear teaching of Scripture." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Affirmation of Historical Adam and Eve**
    - Insists that Genesis presents Adam and Eve as real, historical individuals.
    - Connects the historicity of Adam and Eve to the reliability of the creation account.
    - Argues that denying a historical Adam undermines the doctrine of **original sin**.
    - Sees the genealogies in Scripture as supporting a literal reading of Genesis.
    "If Adam and Eve did not exist, then the entire history of redemption unravels." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Creation Ex Nihilo**
    - Teaches that God created all things out of nothing by His word.
    - Emphasizes the distinction between **Creator and creature**.
    - Rejects any notion of pre-existing matter or eternal universe.
    - Sees the creation days as marking the beginning of time and material reality.
    "God created the universe out of nothing; it did not exist before he spoke it into being." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Engagement with Evangelical Alternatives**
    - Recognizes that some evangelicals hold to the **analogical days** or **framework view**.
    - Critiques these positions as exegetically and theologically weak.
    - Encourages charitable dialogue but urges fidelity to the text.
    - Stresses the importance of doctrinal clarity on creation for the church’s witness.
    "While some evangelicals differ, I believe the six-day view best fits the biblical evidence." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Wayne Grudem’s defense of a **literal six-day creation** has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on Genesis and origins. His systematic and accessible articulation of this position has influenced pastors, students, and lay readers. Grudem’s insistence on the **authority of Scripture** and doctrinal clarity has made his writings a standard reference in debates over creation within the Reformed and broader evangelical community.
