# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive interpretation of the **days of creation**, arguing that the Genesis account employs a **literary framework** rather than a strictly chronological sequence. He maintained that the **creation week** is a **theological structure** designed to communicate covenantal truths about **God’s sovereignty** and the **sabbath**, rather than to provide a literal, sequential timeline of cosmic origins.

- "The seven days are not presented as ordinary solar days, but as a literary device for organizing the account of creation." ("Because It Had Not Rained," Westminster Theological Journal 20)

## Key Works

- "Because It Had Not Rained: A Note on Genesis 2:5–6 and Genesis 1:1–2:3" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1958)
- "Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony" (Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, 1996)
- The Structure of Biblical Authority (1972)
- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview (2000)
- Genesis: A New Commentary (posthumous, 2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Literary Framework Interpretation**
    - Genesis 1 is structured as a literary, not chronological, framework.
    - The **days** are arranged topically to highlight theological themes.
    - The narrative’s structure serves to exalt **God’s kingship** and **covenant order**.
    - The framework view avoids conflict with scientific accounts of origins.
    - "The creation week is a literary structure, not a literal chronology." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Non-Sequential Days**
    - The days of creation are not intended to be understood as consecutive 24-hour periods.
    - The text employs **analogical language** to communicate divine activity.
    - The arrangement of days (forming and filling) is thematic, not temporal.
    - This approach preserves the integrity of **biblical authority** without demanding concordism.
    - "The days are not to be pressed into a sequential, temporal mold." ("Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony")

3. **Theological Emphasis on Sabbath**
    - The **seventh day** functions as the climax, emphasizing **sabbath rest**.
    - The sabbath motif points to **eschatological fulfillment** in God’s redemptive plan.
    - The structure underscores the covenantal relationship between God and creation.
    - The sabbath is a sign of God’s completed work and ongoing sovereignty.
    - "The sabbath day is the goal and crown of the creation week." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Accommodation to Ancient Near Eastern Context**
    - Genesis employs **ancient Near Eastern literary conventions**.
    - The account polemically reinterprets pagan cosmogonies to assert **Yahweh’s supremacy**.
    - The text communicates truth in a form accessible to its original audience.
    - The framework view recognizes the genre and intent of the biblical author.
    - "Genesis 1 is a polemical adaptation of ancient Near Eastern cosmology." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty and Authority**
    - The creation account exalts **God’s absolute sovereignty** over all things.
    - The literary structure serves to highlight God’s **covenant lordship**.
    - The framework interpretation upholds the **inerrancy** and **authority** of Scripture.
    - The focus is on God’s purposes, not on the mechanics of material origins.
    - "The purpose of the creation narrative is to reveal the sovereignty of the Creator." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s **framework interpretation** has significantly influenced Reformed and evangelical discussions on the doctrine of creation, providing a robust alternative to both young-earth and concordist readings. His approach has shaped seminary curricula, especially at Westminster and related institutions, and has encouraged a more nuanced engagement with **biblical authority** and science. While controversial among some conservatives, Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate theological, literary, and historical insights in the interpretation of Genesis.
