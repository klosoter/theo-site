- Defended position: A robust **analogical days** view in which God creates the world in an indivisible **simple act**, sovereignly ordering history, while Genesis 1 uses a six‑day, work‑week and Sabbath pattern as a real, covenantal temporal framework analogically corresponding to God’s work but not specifying a chronological metric for physical processes.

### ESSAY
The question of the “days of creation” in Genesis 1 is never merely a question about chronology. Under sustained examination it becomes a test case for one’s entire doctrine of **revelation**, **creation**, **providence**, and even **eschatology**. To define the issue carefully, we must ask: what is the relation between God’s **eternal decree** and his **temporal execution** of that decree, and how does the Genesis narrative describe that execution in creaturely terms? I will argue that the days are a divinely ordained, covenantal temporal framework, analogically corresponding to God’s work and rest, grounded in real history and temporality, yet not designed to serve as a modern chronological metric for the timing of physical processes. This **analogical days** view safeguards **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**, honors the literary structure of the text, and protects the unity of Scripture, while remaining open to legitimate scientific investigation of created processes under the lordship of Christ.

The patristic period already shows that the question of the days could not be resolved by a flat literalism. Basil of Caesarea in his Homilies on the Hexaemeron represents an early, textually serious attempt to read the days as ordered stages of divine creative activity. Preaching to catechize his congregation, Basil insists that God’s word is historically concrete and that the days are to be received as real divisions in God’s creative work. He reads Genesis 1 as a consecutive sequence where God successively forms and adorns the world, and Basil uses the six days to structure Christian contemplation of the cosmos. His account is not a modern young‑earth literalism, but he is a crucial ancestor of views that emphasize the straightforward temporal sequence and normal “evening and morning” language as indicating calendrical days.

Examiners may press whether Basil’s emphasis on literal sequence implies a denial of God’s timelessness. The answer is that Basil does not resolve the metaphysical problem of how an immutable God produces temporal effects; he simply takes the text’s ordered presentation at face value and uses it homiletically. In this sense, Basil shows the church’s early instinct that the six‑day pattern is more than a loose metaphor. Yet patristic exegesis does not uniformly support a single, strict reading, and this is most visible in Augustine.

Augustine of Hippo, particularly in his De Genesi ad litteram, is the first decisive figure to conceptualize the relation between God’s instantaneous creative act and the six‑day narrative with real metaphysical rigor. Strikingly, Augustine insists that he is offering a “literal” interpretation of Genesis. For him, literal does not mean crudely physicalistic, but rather consonant with the realities described by the text, including God’s eternity. He argues that God created all things simultaneously in a single act and that the “days” describe an ordered logical unfolding of the causal potencies God implanted in creation. Genesis 1, on this view, narrates a temporal sequence that corresponds to the ontological ordering of created realities rather than to a stopwatch chronology.

Augustine’s motivation is profoundly doctrinal. He is determined to preserve **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. If God is eternally complete in his being and knowledge, Augustine reasons, then he does not learn, decide, or move from one mental state to another across six literal days. The “evening and morning” cannot signify fluctuations in God, but must mark either creaturely states of knowledge or stages in the created order. Augustine’s contemplative “days” thus are not mere allegory; they are his attempt to harmonize the text with a classical doctrine of God and a robust doctrine of creation’s **seminal reasons**. This anticipates later Reformed instincts that Genesis 1 uses **analogical knowledge**, expressing real divine action in terms suited to human understanding.

At this point examiners will likely challenge: does Augustine evacuate the text of historical content? The answer is no, if we understand “history” correctly. Augustine certainly does not imagine that Genesis 1 is describing fictional or merely mental events. Creation happened, and temporal processes now unfold in the world God made. But for Augustine, God’s initial creative act is not sprawled across six chronological slices; instead, his single creative command is narrated in sixfold form to display the ordered structure of the world and to ground human work and rest. His exegesis is not without problems, but it decisively introduces the question: are the “days” identical with the temporal metric of created processes, or do they function as a revealed ordering pattern of God’s work?

The Reformation inherits this Augustinian concern for doctrinal coherence and the patristic attention to the text’s concrete language. John Calvin is the pivotal Reformation figure here. In his Genesis commentary and the Institutes, Calvin insists that Moses wrote “in a popular style” and that God “lisps” to us as nurses do with infants. This doctrine of **accommodation** governs Calvin’s approach to the days. He defends the historicity and objectivity of God’s creative work, yet warns against speculative curiosity about the manner and order of creation that goes beyond what the Spirit intended to teach.

Calvin generally reads the six days as a real temporal sequence by which God ordered the world, and he stresses that God could have created the world instantly but chose to work in six days to instruct us. Here Calvin aligns with Basil in affirming real temporal succession in God’s creative work, but he integrates this conviction with a more explicit theology of accommodation. “Evening and morning” and the numbered days are, for Calvin, patterns selected to structure human labor and Sabbath rest. They are reliable, but they aim at piety more than scientific description.

The potential internal tension in Calvin is one examiners often surface: does his emphasis on temporal sequence sit comfortably with his strong affirmation of divine sovereignty and simplicity? Calvin does not spell out a metaphysical account as Augustine does. Instead, he is content to affirm that God really acts in time while remaining eternally who he is. The days, then, are both historical divisions and pedagogical frameworks. This dual emphasis laid the groundwork for later Reformed articulations that seek to avoid both rationalistic harmonization and skepticism about the text’s historical character.

Reformed scholasticism codified the six days in confessional language. The Westminster Confession speaks of God creating “in the space of six days,” a phrase that has been contested in contemporary debates. Historically, the phrase distinguishes Reformed orthodoxy from notions of eternal creation and from views that deny any real temporality to God’s creative act. The divines rejected, for example, any notion that the world was coeternal with God. But they did not specify the duration or metric of those “six days” in terms of modern chronology. Some Westminster divines, influenced by Augustine and medieval sources, were open to non‑crude readings, though it is clear that a straightforward six‑day sequence was the common view.

B. B. Warfield at Old Princeton shows how the Reformed tradition wrestled with the rise of modern science. Warfield is a decisive figure not only because of his stature, but because he shows that a high view of Scripture and openness to old‑earth cosmology are not inherently at odds. He vigorously defended **inerrancy** and the full historicity of Genesis while also exploring the possibility that God may have created through evolutionary processes. On the days of creation, Warfield leaned toward non‑literal interpretations, influenced by Augustine’s instantaneous creation view and sensitive to exegetical subtleties. He argued that the authority of Genesis 1 lies in its theological claim that God is the sovereign, personal Creator, not in a particular scientific timetable.

The examiner may press: did Warfield capitulate to external scientific pressure? A fair reading shows that he was neither a rationalist nor a biblicist. He maintained that Scripture is the norming norm for all knowledge, but that Scripture itself must set its own interpretive agenda. If the genre and structure of Genesis 1 do not intend to offer a scientific chronology, then pressing the text into that role is itself a form of unbelief, even if well‑intentioned. Warfield’s approach exposes a crucial internal debate within Reformed circles: is fidelity to the Confession and Scripture measured by adherence to a particular chronology, or by loyalty to Scripture’s own claims about what it is and what it intends?

Warfield also sharpened the external debate with naturalistic evolutionism. He distinguished between evolution as a providentially governed process under divine decree and evolution as a metaphysical claim denying creation ex nihilo and divine purpose. This distinction remains crucial. A Reformed theologian is bound to reject any external framework that denies **creation ex nihilo**, **divine providence**, or **the image of God**, but is not compelled in advance to reject every scientific model of process as such. The question is how those models relate to the analogical portrayal of God’s work in Genesis 1.

In the late twentieth century, Henri Blocher and John Frame exemplify two distinct but related Reformed attempts to articulate a coherent doctrine of the days. Blocher, in works such as In the Beginning, is associated with the **framework view**, which highlights the literary patterning of Genesis 1. He draws attention to the parallel structure of days 1–3 and 4–6, where God forms realms and then fills them, and to the climactic positioning of the Sabbath. For Blocher, the chapter is a highly stylized, polemical narrative against pagan cosmologies, designed to present God as the sovereign monarch who orders time, space, and life. The “days” function as a literary architectonic rather than a chronological report. They are “days” of divine proclamation, not measured in twenty‑four‑hour cycles.

Blocher stands within the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on **covenantal revelation** and **redemptive‑historical** reading, yet his framework view raises internal debates. Critics, often from young‑earth circles, argue that this reading collapses the historicity of creation into literary artifice and undermines the fourth commandment’s grounding of human Sabbath in God’s own six‑day work. They point to Exodus 20, where God’s six days and one day of rest are presented as the archetype for Israel’s pattern. Blocher responds that typological correspondence does not require isomorphism. Just as the heavenly temple is the archetype of the earthly, though not identical in material, so God’s “week” can be the archetype for Israel’s week without sharing an identical temporal metric. This is a genuinely analogical, not univocal, correspondence.

John Frame, by contrast, articulates an **analogical days** view that builds explicitly on the doctrine of **analogical knowledge** and on a triperspectival method. For Frame, God’s workweek in Genesis 1 is genuinely temporal, but divine temporality is not simply the same as creaturely clock time. God’s relation to time is Lordly; he is both above time and present to it. Thus the “days” are God’s own workdays, sovereignly defined, which serve as the archetype for human days. They are real divine actions in history, narrated in terms of morning and evening, but they are not intended to teach us the precise cadence of physical processes in terms of modern physics.

The key move in Frame is to treat the days as **covenantal accommodation** that is nevertheless historically anchored. Genesis 1, on this view, tells us that God ordered his creative work in a structured sequence that corresponds analogically to our workweek, culminating in a sanctified rest that grounds the Sabbath command. The nature of that sequence is clear theologically and covenantally, but its exact physical metric is not disclosed. This allows us to affirm, with the Confession, that God created “in the space of six days,” while recognizing that “space of six days” is itself defined by God’s narrative ordering, not by importing external scientific or philosophical definitions of “day.”

At this point the examiner might object: is this not a way of slipping progressive creationism or theistic evolution in through the back door, while keeping traditional language? The response must be principled, not tactical. The analogical days view is not a strategy for making room for any specific scientific model; it is a recognition that Genesis 1 itself, as a highly structured, liturgical, royal proclamation, signifies more than a mere journalistic record. It presents creation in temple categories, with God’s rest on the seventh day as his royal enthronement over the cosmos. To reduce the text to a narrow chronological report is to miss its richest theological claims and its integration with **Sabbath theology**, **Christology** as new creation, and **eschatology**. The analogical reading, in this sense, intensifies rather than diminishes commitment to Scripture’s authority by letting Scripture interpret its own literary forms.

Yet the analogical days view also guards against an opposite error seen in some historical‑critical and ANE‑comparative scholarship, which treats Genesis 1 as mere myth or liturgy floating free of history. External debates here often involve appeals to Enuma Elish and other ancient cosmologies, suggesting that Genesis is simply Israel’s version of a creation myth and hence not about “what really happened.” A Reformed analogical reading rejects this dichotomy. Genesis 1 is indeed in conversation with pagan myths, subverting them by insisting on one Creator, creation ex nihilo, and the goodness of the material world, but its polemic force rests on the reality of what God has done. Analogical description does not imply unreality; it indicates that creaturely language, by necessity, speaks of God’s real acts proportionally, not exhaustively.

The internal Reformed debates over the days therefore often reduce to competing accounts of analogy, accommodation, and the intended referent of the narrative. Young‑earth literalists tend to treat the days as univocal with our weekdays, emphasizing the clarity of Scripture and warning that any deviation opens the door to capitulation to science. Framework and analogical proponents stress the text’s own literary and canonical signals and argue that insistence on a modern chronological reading is itself an imposition. The confessional phrase “in the space of six days” has become a flashpoint, but historically and theologically it need not settle the question in favor of a modern calendar‑day model. It affirms real temporality and ordered sequence, while leaving the precise nature of that “space” to be known analogically.

Where does this leave us in contemporary debates shaped by cosmology, geology, and evolutionary biology? The analogical days position I defend maintains several non‑negotiable anchors. First, God created all things out of nothing by the word of his power in the beginning, thereby denying any eternal matter or independent process. Second, Adam and Eve are historical persons, the first human pair, created in the image of God, from whom the human race descends. Third, sin enters history through the fall of a real Adam, and death as a judicial curse is tied to this fall. Fourth, God orders time and history toward Sabbath rest in Christ, so that the pattern of work and rest in Genesis 1–2 is intrinsically eschatological.

Within these anchors, the analogical days view allows for serious, critical engagement with scientific theories. It neither preordains that the universe must be young nor that it must be old. Instead, it insists that whatever model we construct must be subordinated to, and corrected by, Scripture’s theological claims. This posture differs from both concordism, which tries to “find” Big Bang cosmology or evolutionary sequences inside the days, and from liberal accommodationism, which allows scientific paradigms to redefine Christian doctrine.

An examiner might push further: does the analogical days view blur the line between special and general revelation by allowing science too much say? The right response is to insist on the principled priority of special revelation for matters of doctrine while rejecting the notion that general revelation is inherently untrustworthy. Because God is the author of both, genuine conflict is always apparent rather than real, arising from misinterpretation of one or the other. The analogical days view is not driven by fear of science but by a careful reading of Scripture’s form and function. It is precisely because Genesis 1 is covenantal proclamation and not a laboratory notebook that we refuse to force it into a modern scientific mold.

Finally, the doctrine of the days connects deeply to **Sabbath** and **eschatology**. Hebrews 4 and Revelation’s visions of new creation present Christ as the one who brings God’s people into the eternal rest that the seventh day anticipates. The weekly Sabbath is a sign and foretaste of this eschatological Sabbath. On any reading, the six and one pattern in Genesis is typological, pointing beyond itself to a consummation. The analogical days view underscores that typology without trading away historicity. God truly worked, truly ordered creation in a structured sequence, and truly entered into covenantal rest, not because he was tired but because he delighted to dwell with his creation as King. The days are, therefore, not a dispensable prelude to a scientific story, but the foundational pattern in which God teaches his people to understand time, work, and rest under his lordship.

In oral examination, one must be ready to state plainly: the days of creation are God’s own covenantally ordered workdays, historically real and analogically described, which ground the pattern of human labor and Sabbath, display God’s sovereignty over time and history, and resist both rationalistic literalism and skeptical mythologizing. To defend this is to defend not only a reading of Genesis 1, but a coherent Reformed doctrine of God, creation, and eschatological hope.

- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Does your view affirm real temporality in creation? Yes, God truly acts in time, ordering creation in a real sequence he himself characterizes as six days and a seventh rest.
  - How do you read “in the space of six days” confessionally? As affirming real temporal succession in God’s work, without specifying a modern chronological metric for each day.
  - Does analogical days undermine the fourth commandment? No, it grounds the Sabbath in God’s archetypal workweek, which corresponds analogically, not univocally, to our seven‑day week.
  - How do you avoid capitulation to naturalistic evolution? By rejecting any model that denies **creation ex nihilo**, providence, historical Adam, and the image of God, and by letting Scripture, not science, set doctrinal boundaries.
  - Is Genesis 1 mythic or historical on your view? It is historical, covenantal proclamation that describes God’s real acts in highly structured, analogical language, not myth in the sense of non‑history.
