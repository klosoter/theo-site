# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin approached the **days of creation** with a strong commitment to the **clarity and authority of Scripture**, emphasizing that Moses accommodated his account to common understanding. Calvin maintained that the **six days** in Genesis 1 are a real, historical framework, but he also warned against speculative interpretations that go beyond the text. His focus was on the **sovereignty of God** as Creator and the **purposeful order** of creation, rather than on satisfying scientific curiosity.

- "He who would learn astronomy and other recondite arts, let him go elsewhere." (Commentary on Genesis 1:6)

## Key Works

- Commentary on the First Book of Moses Called Genesis
- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I, chapters 14–16)
- Sermons on Genesis
- Calvin: Commentaries (ed. Joseph Haroutunian, for selections on creation)
- John Calvin’s Doctrine of Creation (secondary, Paul Helm)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Clarity and Accommodation**
   - Scripture speaks in a manner accessible to ordinary people.
   - Moses wrote Genesis to instruct, not to satisfy scientific curiosity.
   - The language of the **days** is accommodated to human understanding.
   - The purpose is to reveal God as Creator, not to provide a scientific account.
   - "For the sake of the unlearned, Moses does not enter into subtle speculations." (Commentary on Genesis 1:6)

2. **Historical Reality of the Six Days**
   - The six days are presented as real, sequential periods.
   - Calvin rejects allegorical or purely figurative readings of the days.
   - He affirms the historicity of the creation narrative.
   - The order of creation reflects God’s wisdom and providence.
   - "Let us rather conclude that God himself took the space of six days, for the purpose of accommodating his works to the capacity of men." (Commentary on Genesis 1:5)

3. **God’s Sovereignty and Purposeful Order**
   - Creation unfolds according to God’s sovereign will.
   - The structure of the days demonstrates divine order and intentionality.
   - Each day’s work is purposeful, displaying God’s wisdom.
   - The sequence moves from formlessness to fullness, reflecting divine design.
   - "God did not make all things at once, but distributed his work into six days, to teach us to rest in his providence." (Commentary on Genesis 1:5)

4. **Rejection of Speculation**
   - Calvin warns against idle speculation about the mechanics of creation.
   - He insists on focusing on what Scripture reveals, not philosophical theories.
   - Theological humility is required when approaching the mysteries of creation.
   - The intent is to foster reverence, not curiosity.
   - "It is vain to contend about the order or the manner in which these things were done." (Commentary on Genesis 1:2)

5. **Creation as Revelation of God’s Glory**
   - The creation narrative reveals God’s majesty and goodness.
   - The days of creation are structured to lead to worship and trust.
   - The world is a theater of God’s glory, manifest from the beginning.
   - The Sabbath rest points to the goal of creation: communion with God.
   - "The world was no doubt made, that it might be the theatre of the divine glory." (Institutes I.5.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s approach to the **days of creation** shaped Reformed exegesis by emphasizing both the **historical reality** and the **accommodated language** of Genesis 1. His insistence on the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture influenced later debates on creation and science, providing a model for theological humility and reverence. Calvin’s framework continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between **Scripture and natural philosophy** within the Reformed tradition.
