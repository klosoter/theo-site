# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets the **days of creation** as a theological proclamation, not a literal or scientific chronology, emphasizing the **eschatological orientation** and **Trinitarian character** of creation. For Moltmann, the Genesis account points to the **future fulfillment** of creation in **new creation** and underscores the ongoing relationship between God, humanity, and the world.

- "The creation narratives are not intended to be a report about the past, but a proclamation of the future of creation." (God in Creation)

## Key Works

- God in Creation: An Ecological Doctrine of Creation (1985)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981)
- Science and Wisdom (2003)

## Key Theological Commitments

   - The **days of creation** point forward to the **Sabbath rest** as the goal of creation.
   - Creation is oriented toward its fulfillment in **new creation**.
   - The Genesis account is read through the lens of **promise and hope**.
   - The structure of the days signifies the unfolding of God’s purpose, not a literal timetable.
   - "Creation is a project with a goal, and the goal is the Sabbath, the feast of creation." (God in Creation)

2. **Non-Literal Interpretation of Genesis**
   - The days are understood as **symbolic** and **theological categories**.
   - Moltmann rejects a **scientific or chronological reading** of Genesis 1.
   - The narrative functions as a **confession of faith** in God the Creator.
   - The text invites participation in the ongoing work of creation.
   - "The biblical creation narratives are not meant to be read as scientific cosmology." (God in Creation)

3. **Trinitarian Creation**
   - Creation is the work of the **Triune God**—Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - The days reflect the **dynamic relationality** within the Godhead.
   - The Spirit’s presence in creation is ongoing and life-giving.
   - The **Trinitarian framework** shapes the meaning of time and history in creation.
   - "Creation is the history of the triune God’s self-communication." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Creation and Ecology**
   - The days of creation highlight the **interconnectedness** of all creatures.
   - Moltmann links the Genesis account to **ecological responsibility**.
   - The Sabbath principle calls for the **preservation and flourishing** of creation.
   - Humanity’s vocation is to participate in God’s care for the world.
   - "The Sabbath is the feast of creation, and it is the ecological principle of creation." (God in Creation)

5. **Creation and Redemption United**
   - The **days of creation** anticipate the **redemption** and renewal of all things.
   - Moltmann sees no separation between **creation and salvation history**.
   - The eschatological hope for new creation is rooted in the original creation narrative.
   - The church is called to witness to both creation and new creation.
   - "The beginning and the end of creation belong together in the hope of the resurrection." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s interpretation of the **days of creation** has significantly shaped contemporary **ecological theology** and broadened the scope of **eschatological reflection** on creation. His **Trinitarian** and non-literal approach has challenged traditional readings and encouraged theological engagement with science and environmental ethics. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire dialogue on the relationship between **creation, redemption, and hope** in systematic theology.
