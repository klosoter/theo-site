# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached the **days of creation** by integrating **Aristotelian philosophy** with **Christian doctrine**, emphasizing the **literal sense** of Scripture while allowing for **allegorical interpretations**. He affirmed that the six days in **Genesis** represent a real temporal sequence, but also explored their deeper **theological significance** within the framework of **divine providence** and **order**.

- "The six days, as understood by Augustine, signify the six ages of the world, but according to the literal sense, they denote six natural days." (Summa Theologiae I, q.74, a.2 ad 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part I, Questions 65–74
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book II, Chapters 16–21
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book II, Distinction 12
- Expositio super Genesim ad Litteram (Literal Commentary on Genesis)
- Aquinas on Creation (ed. Steven Baldner and William Carroll)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal and Spiritual Senses of Scripture**
    - Affirms the **literal sense** as foundational for understanding the days of creation.
    - Recognizes **spiritual senses** (allegorical, moral, anagogical) as valid and complementary.
    - Sees the six days as both a historical sequence and a typological framework.
    - Emphasizes that **Scripture** accommodates human understanding through temporal language.
    - "Nothing of Holy Scripture perishes, but all has a spiritual sense, even where it seems to have only a literal one." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10 ad 1)

2. **Order and Distinction in Creation**
    - Argues that the six days reflect **divine order** and the distinction of created things.
    - Each day marks a new level of **complexity** and **perfection** in creation.
    - The sequence demonstrates **God’s wisdom** in structuring the cosmos.
    - The days serve as a pedagogical tool for human comprehension of **creation’s hierarchy**.
    - "The work of the six days was ordered according to a certain progression of perfection." (Summa Theologiae I, q.73, a.1)

3. **Compatibility with Philosophical Reason**
    - Engages **Aristotelian cosmology** to explain the nature and sequence of creation.
    - Maintains that **faith and reason** are harmonious in interpreting the days.
    - Uses philosophical categories to clarify the distinction between **creation ex nihilo** and formation.
    - Sees the temporal sequence as compatible with the **instantaneous act of creation**.
    - "God created all things together as regards their substance, but distributed them in order as regards their operation." (Summa Theologiae I, q.74, a.2)

4. **Distinction between Creation and Formation**
    - Differentiates between the **creation** of matter and the subsequent **formation** of the cosmos.
    - Holds that all things were created simultaneously in their **substance**.
    - The six days represent the ordering and adornment of what was created.
    - This distinction preserves the **doctrine of creation ex nihilo** while explaining the biblical narrative.
    - "Creation is the production of the substance of things, but formation is the ordering of them." (Summa Theologiae I, q.66, a.1 ad 1)

5. **Accommodation to Human Understanding**
    - Asserts that **Scripture** uses the language of days to accommodate human limitations.
    - The division into days aids in grasping the **sequence and purpose** of creation.
    - God’s eternal act is presented in temporal terms for pedagogical reasons.
    - The six days serve as a framework for **theological reflection** on creation’s meaning.
    - "Scripture, in order to instruct the ignorant, relates divine works as performed in time and by means of bodily agents." (Summa Theologiae I, q.67, a.4 ad 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s treatment of the **days of creation** shaped subsequent **scholastic theology** by balancing the **literal sense** of Genesis with philosophical and allegorical interpretations. His careful distinction between **creation** and **formation** influenced later debates on the relationship between science and Scripture. Aquinas remains a foundational figure for both Catholic and broader Christian understandings of **creation**, providing a model for integrating **faith and reason** in theological exegesis.
