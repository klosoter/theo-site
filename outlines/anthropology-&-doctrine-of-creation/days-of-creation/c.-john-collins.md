# C. John Collins (1954– )

C. John Collins is a leading evangelical Old Testament scholar who has argued that the **days of creation** in Genesis 1 should be understood as a **literary framework** rather than as a strict chronological account. He emphasizes the **theological intent** of the text, focusing on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **goodness of creation**, while engaging critically with both **literalist** and **concordist** readings.

- "The days are not meant to be a chronology of material origins, but a literary device to communicate theological truths." ("Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary")

## Key Works

- Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary (2006)
- Science and Faith: Friends or Foes? (2003)
- Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care (2011)
- Reading Genesis Well: Navigating History, Poetry, Science, and Truth in Genesis 1–11 (2018)
- “How Old Is the Earth? Anthropomorphic Days in Genesis 1” (Westminster Theological Journal, 1994)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literary Framework Interpretation**
    - Genesis 1 uses **literary structure** to convey meaning, not a literal sequence of 24-hour days.
    - The **framework** highlights the forming and filling pattern (days 1–3 and 4–6).
    - The text’s **genre** is not modern scientific narrative but ancient Near Eastern theological literature.
    - The focus is on **God’s sovereignty** and purpose in creation, not on material chronology.
    - "The arrangement of the days is a literary device to teach us about God and his world." (Genesis 1–4)

2. **Theological Priority over Chronology**
    - The primary aim is to communicate **theological truths** about God as Creator.
    - The **days** serve to structure the account for theological reflection, not scientific detail.
    - The **Sabbath** (day 7) is central, pointing to the goal of creation and human vocation.
    - The narrative counters **pagan cosmologies** by emphasizing monotheism and order.
    - "Genesis 1 is more about who made the world and why, than about how long it took." (Genesis 1–4)

3. **Compatibility with Scientific Findings**
    - The **framework view** allows for an old earth and does not conflict with mainstream science.
    - Collins affirms the **historicity** of Adam and Eve while allowing for non-literal days.
    - He rejects **young-earth creationism** as exegetically unnecessary.
    - The text’s **ancient context** must inform our interpretation.
    - "We need not force the Bible into a modern scientific mold, nor science into a biblical one." (Science and Faith)

4. **Emphasis on Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - The narrative establishes **God’s transcendence** and the dependent status of creation.
    - The **days** function to show God’s orderly work and intentionality.
    - Human beings are set apart as **image bearers**, culminating the creation week.
    - The account opposes **mythological** readings by grounding creation in God’s word.
    - "Genesis 1 is about the distinction between the Creator and his creation." (Genesis 1–4)

5. **Hermeneutical Sensitivity to Genre and Context**
    - Proper interpretation requires attention to **literary form** and **ancient Near Eastern context**.
    - The days should not be read with **modern literalism** but with genre awareness.
    - The narrative uses **anthropomorphic language** to communicate divine action.
    - The **structure** of the passage is key to understanding its message.
    - "We must let the text set its own agenda, not impose ours upon it." (Reading Genesis Well)

## Legacy and Impact

Collins’s work has significantly shaped evangelical discussions on the **days of creation**, providing a robust alternative to both strict literalism and concordism. His **literary framework** approach has influenced scholars, pastors, and lay readers seeking to integrate biblical faith with scientific understanding. By emphasizing the **theological depth** and literary artistry of Genesis 1, Collins has contributed to a more nuanced and faithful reading of Scripture within the Reformed tradition.
