# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the **days of creation** within the framework of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the theological rather than strictly chronological significance of the Genesis account. He maintained that the **creation narrative** communicates foundational truths about **God’s sovereignty**, **covenant**, and the **structure of redemptive history**, rather than providing a literalistic timetable.

- "The narrative of creation is not intended to teach us the duration of the process, but the fact and order of the divine acts." 

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Volume 1: Theology Proper
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Mosaic Origin of the Pentateuchal Codes" (Princeton Theological Review)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Theological Primacy of the Creation Account**
    - The Genesis narrative is primarily a **theological document** rather than a scientific or chronological record.
    - The structure of the creation week reveals **God’s sovereignty** and order.
    - The account serves as the foundation for **covenant theology** and the rest of redemptive history.
    - The days function as a literary framework to communicate divine purpose.
    - "The interest of the narrative lies not in the time consumed, but in the fact and order of the creative acts." (Reformed Dogmatics)

2. **Analogical Nature of the Days**
    - The "days" are best understood as **analogical** to human workdays, not necessarily identical in length.
    - The pattern of six days followed by rest establishes a **theological rhythm** for human life.
    - The analogy points to the **Sabbath principle** and God’s lordship over time.
    - This view avoids unnecessary conflict with scientific findings.
    - "The days of creation are God’s workdays, analogous but not identical to ours." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Affirmation of Historical Adam and Creation**
    - Vos upheld the **historicity of Adam** and the reality of creation as a divine act.
    - The narrative’s theological intent does not negate its grounding in real events.
    - Adam’s creation is pivotal for **federal headship** and the doctrine of sin.
    - The creation account is foundational for understanding **redemption**.
    - "The historicity of Adam is essential to the structure of biblical theology." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Rejection of Purely Mythical or Allegorical Readings**
    - Vos rejected views that treat Genesis 1 as mere **myth** or allegory.
    - The narrative conveys real divine acts in history, though with literary shaping.
    - The text’s theological depth does not undermine its truthfulness.
    - The account is not a product of ancient Near Eastern mythology.
    - "Genesis is not myth, but a divinely inspired record of real beginnings." (Reformed Dogmatics)

5. **Integration with Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics**
    - The creation account is the starting point for **redemptive history**.
    - The structure of the days anticipates later **covenantal patterns**.
    - Vos’s approach links creation to consummation in biblical theology.
    - The days of creation are part of the unfolding **history of revelation**.
    - "Creation stands at the headwaters of the stream of redemptive history." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s approach to the **days of creation** shaped subsequent Reformed discussions by emphasizing the **theological and redemptive-historical dimensions** of Genesis 1. His analogical understanding influenced later theologians to avoid unnecessary conflict between Scripture and science while maintaining biblical authority. Vos’s work remains foundational for those seeking to integrate **biblical theology** with **systematic theology** in the doctrine of creation.
