# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the **days of creation** with a commitment to the **inerrancy of Scripture** while allowing for a degree of interpretive flexibility regarding the **genre of Genesis 1**. He argued that the **Westminster Standards** do not require a literal 24-hour day view and was open to the possibility of **theistic evolution** as compatible with **Reformed orthodoxy**. Warfield maintained that the authority of Scripture is not compromised by non-literal readings of the creation days, provided the **doctrine of creation ex nihilo** and **divine sovereignty** are preserved.

- "It is not necessary to suppose that the days spoken of are intended to be solar days." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "On the Antiquity and the Unity of the Human Race" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Idea of Revelation and Theories of the Universe" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "Genesis 1 and the Modern Science of Geology" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "Calvin’s Doctrine of Creation" (in Calvin and Calvinism)
- Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 1 & 2 (ed. Meeter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Inerrancy and Authority**
    - Scripture is wholly trustworthy and without error in all it affirms.
    - The authority of Genesis 1 is not diminished by questions of chronology or genre.
    - Theological truth is not dependent on a literalistic reading of the creation days.
    - The Bible’s purpose is to teach **theological truths**, not scientific details.
    - "The question of the length of the days of creation is not a question of fundamental importance." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Openness to Non-Literal Days**
    - The Hebrew word "yom" can signify periods longer than 24 hours.
    - The literary structure of Genesis 1 allows for non-literal interpretation.
    - The **Westminster Confession** does not bind interpreters to a particular view of the days.
    - The framework accommodates both old earth and young earth readings.
    - "There is nothing in the word 'day' itself which demands the literal interpretation." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Compatibility with Theistic Evolution**
    - Evolutionary theory, properly understood, does not necessarily contradict **creation ex nihilo**.
    - God’s providence can operate through secondary causes, including evolutionary processes.
    - The image of God and the soul’s origin remain supernatural acts.
    - Theistic evolution must not undermine the historicity of Adam or the fall.
    - "I do not think that there is any necessary antagonism between evolution and Christianity." (Selected Shorter Writings)

4. **Doctrine of Creation Ex Nihilo**
    - God alone is the source of all that exists.
    - Creation is a free act of God, not a process of emanation or necessity.
    - The material universe had a definite beginning by divine fiat.
    - The mode or duration of creation does not affect the fact of divine origination.
    - "The doctrine of creation ex nihilo is the foundation of all true religion." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

5. **Reformed Confessional Fidelity**
    - The **Westminster Standards** are authoritative but allow for interpretive diversity on non-essential matters.
    - The essentials of the faith are preserved regardless of the length of the creation days.
    - The Reformed tradition values both doctrinal precision and exegetical humility.
    - Warfield sought to uphold confessional integrity while engaging contemporary science.
    - "The Westminster divines were not dogmatic on the subject of the creation days." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s nuanced approach to the **days of creation** influenced generations of Reformed theologians to engage science without compromising **biblical authority**. His openness to non-literal interpretations provided a model for evangelical engagement with modern science, especially regarding **theistic evolution**. Warfield’s legacy endures in debates over Genesis 1, where his commitment to both **orthodoxy** and intellectual rigor remains a touchstone for Reformed scholarship.
