# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **days of creation** with a strong emphasis on the **theological intent** of Genesis rather than a literalist or scientific reading. He argued that the **doctrine of creation** should focus on the **sovereignty of God** and the **goodness of creation**, cautioning against conflating biblical revelation with specific cosmological models. Berkouwer maintained that the **hermeneutical context** and the **redemptive-historical framework** are crucial for understanding the meaning of the creation days.

- "The confession of creation is not a cosmological theory, but a confession of faith in God as Creator." (Studies in Dogmatics: Creation)

## Key Works

- Studies in Dogmatics: Creation
- Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture
- Studies in Dogmatics: Man: The Image of God
- General Revelation (Studies in Dogmatics)
- "The Providence of God" (chapter in Studies in Dogmatics: The Providence of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Theological Meaning over Chronology**
   - The Genesis account is primarily a **confessional statement** about God, not a scientific chronology.
   - The days of creation serve to emphasize **God’s sovereignty** and **order**.
   - Literalist readings risk obscuring the **theological message**.
   - The focus is on the **Creator-creature distinction**.
   - "The question is not how long creation took, but what it means that God is Creator." (Creation)

2. **Rejection of Concordism**
   - Berkouwer warns against harmonizing Genesis with modern science.
   - He sees attempts at concordism as **misdirected apologetics**.
   - The biblical text is not intended as a scientific manual.
   - The **authority of Scripture** is not dependent on scientific accuracy.
   - "The intention of the biblical writer is not to provide a scientific account of origins." (Creation)

3. **Hermeneutical Sensitivity**
   - Interpretation must respect the **genre** and **context** of Genesis.
   - The days are part of a **literary structure** conveying theological truths.
   - The text’s ancient Near Eastern context shapes its presentation.
   - **Dogmatic conclusions** should not be based on a wooden literalism.
   - "We must be careful not to impose our questions on the biblical text." (Creation)

4. **Centrality of the Creator-Creation Relationship**
   - The doctrine of creation highlights **God’s lordship** and **purpose**.
   - The days structure underscores the **goodness** and **orderliness** of creation.
   - The narrative points to the **dependence** of all things on God.
   - Creation is the foundation for understanding **redemption**.
   - "Creation is the presupposition of redemption." (Creation)

5. **Openness to Scientific Inquiry**
   - Berkouwer affirms the legitimacy of scientific investigation.
   - He insists that faith and science address different questions.
   - The **integrity of revelation** is not threatened by scientific discovery.
   - Christians need not fear scientific advances regarding origins.
   - "Faith in creation does not demand a rejection of scientific insight." (Creation)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to the **days of creation** has influenced Reformed theology by encouraging a **theological reading of Genesis** that avoids unnecessary conflict with science. His emphasis on the **confessional nature of creation** has provided a framework for engaging modern questions without compromising biblical authority. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold the **doctrine of creation** within a robust, redemptive-historical context.
