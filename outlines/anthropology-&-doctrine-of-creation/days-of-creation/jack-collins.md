# Jack Collins (1954– )

Jack Collins approaches the **days of creation** in Genesis as a literary framework, emphasizing the importance of genre and authorial intent in interpreting the text. He argues that the **creation days** are not intended as a literal, sequential account of material origins, but rather as a **theological narrative** that communicates foundational truths about God, creation, and humanity within the context of **biblical theology**.

- "The days are part of an artistic arrangement, not a literalistic chronology." ("Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary")

## Key Works

- Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary
- Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?
- Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care
- Reading Genesis Well: Navigating History, Poetry, Science, and Truth in Genesis 1–11
- “How Old Is the Earth? Anthropomorphic Days in Genesis 1” (Presbyterion, 1994)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genre Sensitivity in Genesis 1**
    - Genesis 1 is best read as an **exalted prose narrative** with literary features.
    - The text employs **figurative language** to convey theological meaning.
    - Recognizes the importance of **ancient Near Eastern context** for interpretation.
    - Rejects both strict literalism and pure myth approaches.
    - "The literary features of Genesis 1 are essential for understanding its message." (Genesis 1–4)

2. **Days as Analogical, Not Identical to Human Days**
    - The “days” are **God’s workdays**, not ordinary 24-hour periods.
    - The analogy communicates real events in a **non-literal temporal framework**.
    - Emphasizes the **Creator-creature distinction** in the use of time.
    - The seventh day’s lack of an evening/morning formula supports a non-literal reading.
    - "The days are God’s workdays, not ours." (Genesis 1–4)

3. **Affirmation of Historical Adam and Creation**
    - Maintains the **historicity of Adam and Eve** as crucial for biblical theology.
    - The narrative framework does not negate real events in the past.
    - Distinguishes between the **literary form** and the **historical referent**.
    - Upholds the **unity of Scripture** in its teaching on origins.
    - "We must distinguish between the literary presentation and the historical reality." (Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?)

4. **Compatibility with Scientific Inquiry**
    - The framework view allows for **integration with scientific findings** about the earth’s age.
    - Rejects the notion that Genesis 1 is a scientific account of material origins.
    - Encourages **dialogue between theology and science**.
    - Sees no necessary conflict between **biblical authority** and mainstream science.
    - "Genesis 1 does not specify the age of the earth." (Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?)

5. **Theological Emphasis on God’s Sovereignty and Purpose**
    - The structure of the creation week highlights **God’s sovereignty** and order.
    - The narrative centers on **God’s purpose** in creation, not chronology.
    - The Sabbath motif points to **eschatological rest** and fulfillment.
    - The account is foundational for **covenant theology** and human vocation.
    - "The main point is what God is doing, not how long it took." (Genesis 1–4)

## Legacy and Impact

Jack Collins has significantly shaped evangelical discussions on the **days of creation** by advocating a literary and theological reading that respects both the authority of Scripture and the findings of science. His work has provided a robust alternative to both young-earth creationism and non-historical readings of Genesis. Collins’s approach has influenced scholars, pastors, and students seeking to integrate **biblical theology** with contemporary questions about origins. His emphasis on genre, analogy, and theological purpose continues to inform debates within the Reformed tradition and beyond.
