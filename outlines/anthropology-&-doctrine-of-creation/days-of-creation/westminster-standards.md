# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards affirm a **literal, historical account** of the **six days of creation** as described in Genesis 1, emphasizing God's sovereign act of creating all things ex nihilo in the space of six days. The Standards maintain that the **creation days** are ordinary, consecutive days, underscoring the **goodness of creation** and the **Creator-creature distinction** foundational to Reformed theology.

- "It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal power, wisdom, and goodness, in the beginning, to create, or make of nothing, the world, and all things therein whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days; and all very good." (Westminster Confession of Faith IV.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter IV: Of Creation
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Q&A 15–17
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q&A 9
- The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652 (for historical context)
- Robert Letham, The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation ex nihilo in Six Days**
    - God created all things out of nothing by the word of his power.
    - The act of creation was completed in six consecutive days.
    - Each day is understood as a real, historical day, not a metaphor or epoch.
    - The six-day structure underscores the order and intentionality of God's work.
    - "In the beginning, it pleased God...to create...the world...in the space of six days; and all very good." (WCF IV.1)

2. **Trinitarian Agency in Creation**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all active in the work of creation.
    - Creation manifests the glory of God's eternal power, wisdom, and goodness.
    - The Trinitarian involvement affirms the unity and diversity within the Godhead.
    - This commitment grounds the doctrine of creation in the broader framework of Reformed **Trinitarian theology**.
    - "It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost...to create...the world." (WCF IV.1)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God alone is uncreated, eternal, and independent.
    - All created things are contingent and dependent on God's will.
    - The six days of creation reinforce the ontological gap between Creator and creature.
    - This distinction is foundational for understanding **covenant theology** and human responsibility.
    - "God...created, or made of nothing, the world, and all things therein." (WCF IV.1)

4. **Goodness and Order of Creation**
    - Everything God made was "very good," reflecting his character.
    - The six-day structure highlights the orderliness and purposefulness of creation.
    - The goodness of creation is affirmed against dualistic or Gnostic tendencies.
    - The doctrine supports the inherent value and dignity of the created order.
    - "And all very good." (WCF IV.1)

5. **Historical Adam and Eve**
    - Humanity was created on the sixth day as male and female.
    - Adam and Eve were created in God's image, with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - The historical creation of Adam and Eve is essential for the doctrines of **original sin** and **federal headship**.
    - The Standards reject mythological or purely symbolic readings of the creation account.
    - "After God had made all other creatures, he created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls..." (WSC Q&A 10)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the doctrine of creation, setting a confessional benchmark for the interpretation of the **days of creation** as ordinary, historical days. Their articulation of the six-day creation framework has influenced subsequent confessions, catechisms, and theological debates within Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The Standards continue to serve as a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between Scripture and science, the nature of biblical authority, and the doctrine of creation in the modern church.
