# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **days of creation** not as literal, historical periods but as expressions of religious consciousness and the unfolding of divine order. He emphasized the **dependence of the world on God** and interpreted the Genesis account as a symbolic narrative reflecting the **feeling of absolute dependence** and the development of human understanding of the divine. For Schleiermacher, the creation narrative is primarily a **confessional statement** rather than a scientific or chronological report.

- "The doctrine of creation is not a cosmological theory, but a religious affirmation of the world’s dependence on God." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as Religious Consciousness**
    - The Genesis account is a symbolic expression of humanity’s awareness of God as Creator.
    - The narrative is not intended to provide scientific or historical information.
    - Creation is understood through the lens of **religious feeling** and dependence.
    - The days of creation reflect stages in the development of religious consciousness.
    - "The doctrine of creation is a religious proposition, not a physical one." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Literal Chronology**
    - The six days are not literal 24-hour periods.
    - The structure serves a didactic and confessional purpose.
    - Schleiermacher resists harmonizing Genesis with scientific cosmology.
    - The focus is on the meaning of creation, not its temporal sequence.
    - "The days are not to be taken as measures of time, but as forms of religious representation." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Dependence of the World on God**
    - Creation signifies the absolute dependence of all things on God’s will.
    - The world’s existence is contingent and grounded in divine causality.
    - The doctrine of creation affirms God as the ongoing ground of being.
    - The narrative points to the continuous relationship between Creator and creation.
    - "All that is, is only through the creative activity of God." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Integration with Modern Science**
    - Schleiermacher encourages openness to scientific discoveries about origins.
    - Theological interpretation should not conflict with empirical knowledge.
    - The creation account is compatible with evolving scientific understanding.
    - Faith and science address different questions about origins.
    - "The doctrine of creation is not endangered by any cosmological theory." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Creation as Confessional Statement**
    - The Genesis narrative is a declaration of faith in God as Creator.
    - It functions liturgically and theologically within the community.
    - The days of creation serve to structure worship and confession.
    - The account shapes the believer’s attitude toward the world and God.
    - "The creation narrative is a confession of the world’s relation to God, not a chronicle of its beginnings." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **days of creation** profoundly influenced modern theology by shifting focus from literalism to the **religious and confessional meaning** of the biblical text. His method paved the way for later theological engagement with science and historical criticism. By emphasizing the symbolic and experiential dimensions of creation, Schleiermacher helped shape the trajectory of liberal Protestant thought and the ongoing dialogue between faith and modern knowledge.
