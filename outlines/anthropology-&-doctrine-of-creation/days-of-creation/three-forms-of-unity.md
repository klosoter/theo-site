# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of creation** that affirms God as the sovereign Creator of all things, ex nihilo, in the space of six days. While not specifying the precise nature of the **days of creation**, these confessions emphasize the historicity of **Genesis 1**, the goodness of the created order, and the distinction between Creator and creature. Their formulations provide a theological framework for understanding the **doctrine of creation** within the broader context of **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "We believe that the Father by the Word, that is, by his Son, has created of nothing the heaven, the earth, and all creatures as it seemed good to him, giving to every creature its being, shape, form, and several offices to serve its Creator." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Article 12 ("The Creation of All Things, Especially the Angels")
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Day 9 (Q&A 26)
- Canons of Dort (esp. Head I, on divine sovereignty)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation ex nihilo by the Triune God**
   - God created all things out of nothing, by His Word and Spirit.
   - The act of creation is attributed to the Father, through the Son, in the power of the Spirit.
   - Creation is distinct from God, upholding the **Creator-creature distinction**.
   - All creatures are given their being, form, and purpose by divine will.
   - "We believe that the Father by the Word, that is, by his Son, has created of nothing the heaven, the earth, and all creatures as it seemed good to him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

2. **Affirmation of the Six Days of Creation**
   - The confessions reference the six days as the period in which God created all things.
   - The language of "six days" is used without explicit allegorization or denial of historicity.
   - The structure of Genesis 1 is treated as a reliable account of God's creative work.
   - The confessions avoid speculative detail about the nature or length of the days.
   - "He has made heaven and earth, with all that is in them, in six days." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 26)

3. **Goodness and Order of Creation**
   - All things were created good and for the glory of God.
   - The original creation reflects divine wisdom, order, and purpose.
   - The created order is not inherently corrupt but was subjected to futility after the Fall.
   - Humanity is given a unique place and calling within creation.
   - "He also upholds and governs them by his eternal counsel and providence." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 26)

4. **Rejection of Dualism and Naturalistic Accounts**
   - The confessions reject any notion of eternal matter or dualistic origins.
   - Creation is not the result of chance or necessity, but of God's free and sovereign will.
   - The world is not self-existent or self-sustaining apart from God.
   - The confessions oppose views that undermine the supernatural character of creation.
   - "He has created all things, when it seemed good to Him, by His infinite power." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

5. **Theological Function of Creation in Redemptive History**
   - The doctrine of creation grounds the reality of the Fall and the need for redemption.
   - Creation establishes the context for God's covenant dealings with humanity.
   - The created order anticipates its renewal in Christ and the new creation.
   - The confessions connect creation to providence and eschatological hope.
   - "He so governs them that nothing happens without His appointment." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 27)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided a foundational articulation of the **Reformed doctrine of creation**, shaping confessional identity and theological discourse in the Dutch Reformed tradition and beyond. Their careful yet non-speculative language regarding the **days of creation** has allowed for a measure of exegetical flexibility while maintaining a strong commitment to the historicity and goodness of creation. These confessions continue to inform contemporary debates on creation, evolution, and the interpretation of Genesis within Reformed churches worldwide.
