# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed the **days of creation** with a strong commitment to the **authority of Scripture** and the **organic unity of revelation**. He affirmed the historicity and theological significance of **Genesis 1**, while allowing for interpretive flexibility regarding the nature of the **six days**. Bavinck’s approach upheld **orthodox doctrine** while thoughtfully engaging with scientific developments.

- "The creation days are the workdays of God; they are ordinary days, but with this difference, that they are the workdays of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Volume 2: God and Creation
- In the Beginning: Foundations of Creation Theology
- "Creation or Development?" (in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- Philosophy of Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Authority and Accommodation**
   - Scripture speaks truly and authoritatively about creation.
   - The language of Genesis is **accommodated** to human understanding.
   - The text’s primary aim is theological, not scientific.
   - Bavinck resists both rationalism and biblicism in interpretation.
   "Scripture is not a manual for natural science but a book for religion." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

2. **Historical Reality of Creation**
   - The creation account refers to real, historical events.
   - Bavinck affirms the **goodness** and **order** of the created world.
   - The narrative is not mythological or merely symbolic.
   - The **six days** are connected to the rhythm of human work and rest.
   "The creation days are not to be identified with our days, but neither are they to be separated from them." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

3. **Theological Purpose of the Days**
   - The structure of the days serves a **didactic** and **liturgical** function.
   - The week pattern points to the **Sabbath** and covenantal rest.
   - The days highlight God’s sovereignty and wisdom in creation.
   - The narrative order is more about **theological meaning** than strict chronology.
   "The week of creation is the archetype of our workweek." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

4. **Openness to Non-Literal Interpretations**
   - Bavinck allows for the possibility that the days are not 24-hour periods.
   - He acknowledges the ancient church’s diversity on this issue.
   - The text’s genre and intent permit some interpretive flexibility.
   - He warns against dogmatism where Scripture is not explicit.
   "The question whether the days of creation are to be taken as ordinary days or as periods of time cannot be answered with absolute certainty." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

5. **Integration of Faith and Science**
   - Bavinck insists on the **unity of truth** between revelation and scientific discovery.
   - He encourages respectful engagement with contemporary science.
   - The doctrine of creation is not threatened by scientific findings about the earth’s age.
   - He maintains the primacy of **theological interpretation** over scientific speculation.
   "Faith in creation and the results of science are not irreconcilable." (Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s treatment of the **days of creation** has shaped Reformed theology by modeling a robust commitment to **Scriptural authority** alongside intellectual engagement with science. His balanced approach has influenced later theologians seeking to avoid both rigid literalism and unwarranted accommodation. Bavinck’s emphasis on the theological meaning of Genesis 1 continues to inform contemporary discussions on creation, **hermeneutics**, and the doctrine of revelation.
