# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **days of creation** not as literal historical events but as **mythological symbols** expressing the relationship between **God** and the **structure of reality**. For Tillich, the Genesis account reveals profound truths about **being**, **nonbeing**, and the **creative ground** of existence, rather than providing a scientific chronology.

- "The creation stories are not reports of events which happened once upon a time; they are symbolic expressions of the relation between God and the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as Symbolic Myth**
    - The Genesis days are **mythological** representations, not literal time periods.
    - Myths convey existential truths about **God’s creative activity**.
    - The narrative structure points to the **depth dimension** of reality.
    - Creation stories articulate the **relation of God to being**.
    - "The creation myth expresses the dependence of everything on the creative ground." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **God as Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the **ground of all being**.
    - Creation is the emergence of finite being from **nonbeing**.
    - The days of creation symbolize the **ontological dependence** of the world.
    - The creative act is ongoing, not confined to a temporal sequence.
    - "God is the creative ground and the creative meaning of all being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Rejection of Literalism**
    - Tillich opposes **literalist readings** of Genesis.
    - Literalism reduces the depth of **biblical symbolism**.
    - The days of creation are not scientific or historical accounts.
    - The power of the text lies in its **symbolic and existential meaning**.
    - "To treat the creation story as a report of events is to destroy its religious meaning." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Creation and Existential Anxiety**
    - The creation myth addresses the **anxiety of nonbeing**.
    - It reassures humanity of the **order and meaning** in existence.
    - The days structure reflects the **overcoming of chaos** by divine order.
    - Creation is the foundation for **human courage to be**.
    - "The myth of creation answers the question of the ultimate origin and meaning of existence." (The Interpretation of History)

5. **Continuing Creation**
    - Creation is not a finished act but a **continuous process**.
    - The divine creative power is present in every moment.
    - The days of creation point to the **perpetual newness** of being.
    - The world’s existence is a constant **participation in God’s creativity**.
    - "Creation is not an event which happened once but the continuous dependence of all existence on the creative ground." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of the **days of creation** has profoundly influenced modern **theological hermeneutics**, encouraging a move away from literalism toward symbolic and existential readings of Scripture. His emphasis on **God as the ground of being** reshaped discussions about creation, ontology, and the relationship between faith and science. Tillich’s approach continues to inform contemporary theology, especially in dialogues about the compatibility of Christian doctrine with scientific cosmology.
