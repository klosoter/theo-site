# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the **days of creation** not as literal, sequential 24-hour periods but as **theological symbols** expressing the relationship between **God as Creator** and the unfolding of **salvation history**. He emphasized the compatibility of **doctrinal creation** with scientific understandings, situating the Genesis account within the broader context of **revelation** and **anthropological theology**.

- "The biblical account of creation is not a scientific treatise, but a theological affirmation of God as the ground of all being." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 5: "God, Christ, Mary and Grace"
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 4: "More Recent Writings"
- Spirit in the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as Theological Event**
    - Creation is fundamentally a **theological reality**, not a scientific chronology.
    - The Genesis "days" are **symbolic expressions** of divine action.
    - The narrative affirms **God’s transcendence** and immanence.
    - The focus is on the **relationship** between Creator and creation.
    - "The creation narratives are confessions of faith, not scientific explanations." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 5)

2. **Compatibility with Scientific Cosmology**
    - Rahner accepts the findings of **modern science** regarding the universe’s origins.
    - He sees no contradiction between **evolutionary theory** and **doctrinal creation**.
    - The "days" represent stages or aspects, not literal time periods.
    - Theological truth is not diminished by **scientific explanation**.
    - "The Christian doctrine of creation is not endangered by the scientific account of the world’s evolution." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Revelation through Symbolic Language**
    - **Scripture** uses symbolic and mythic language to convey **transcendent truths**.
    - The Genesis account communicates **theological meaning** rather than historical detail.
    - The "days" function as **hermeneutical keys** for understanding God’s creative will.
    - Rahner stresses the importance of **interpreting revelation** within its literary context.
    - "The language of the Bible is that of faith, not of empirical science." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

4. **Anthropological Orientation**
    - Creation is understood in relation to **human existence** and destiny.
    - The "days" narrative points to the **origin and vocation of humanity**.
    - Rahner’s **transcendental anthropology** frames creation as the condition for human openness to God.
    - The doctrine of creation grounds the possibility of **grace** and **revelation**.
    - "Creation is the presupposition for the possibility of God’s self-communication to man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Creation finds its **ultimate meaning** in Christ.
    - The "days" anticipate the **eschatological fulfillment** in the new creation.
    - Rahner links the doctrine of creation to **Christology** and **eschatology**.
    - The created order is oriented toward **redemption** and consummation in Christ.
    - "The world’s creation is already oriented toward its fulfillment in Christ." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to the **days of creation** has shaped contemporary Catholic theology by integrating **doctrinal creation** with scientific cosmology and emphasizing the symbolic, revelatory character of Genesis. His influence is evident in post-Vatican II discussions on **faith and science**, and his anthropological focus has encouraged a more existential reading of the creation narratives. Rahner’s legacy endures in ongoing efforts to articulate a theologically robust, scientifically informed doctrine of creation.
