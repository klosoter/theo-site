# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth approached the **days of creation** in Genesis not as a literal, chronological account but as a **saga** or **mythic narrative** that conveys theological truth about **God as Creator** and the relationship between **creation and covenant**. He emphasized the **sovereignty of God** and the **freedom of divine action**, seeing the creation days as a literary framework to express the order and purposefulness of God's creative work rather than a scientific timetable.

- "The creation story is saga, not history; it is not a report of events, but a proclamation of the divine work." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation Days as Saga**
    - The Genesis account is a **saga** that communicates theological, not scientific or historical, truth.
    - The six days serve as a **literary framework** to structure the narrative of creation.
    - Barth resists concordist or literalist readings, focusing on the text's function within **revelation**.
    - The days point to the **orderliness** and **purpose** of God's creative act.
    - "The question is not one of chronology or cosmology, but of the meaning of creation as God's work." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

2. **Primacy of Divine Freedom**
    - God is absolutely **free** in His act of creation, unconstrained by time or material necessity.
    - The days of creation reflect God's **sovereign ordering** rather than a temporal process.
    - Barth rejects any notion that God is bound to the created order or its measurements.
    - The narrative underscores the **distinction between Creator and creature**.
    - "God creates in freedom, and the days are a sign of His sovereign ordering, not a record of temporal succession." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

3. **Revelation over Historicity**
    - The creation narrative is **revelatory**, not a historical or scientific report.
    - Its purpose is to reveal the **relationship between God and the world**.
    - Barth emphasizes the **theological message** over the factual details of the text.
    - The days serve as a vehicle for **divine self-disclosure**.
    - "The biblical creation story is a witness to revelation, not a chronicle of events." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

4. **Creation and Covenant**
    - Barth closely links **creation** with **covenant**, seeing the days as preparatory for God's relationship with humanity.
    - The structure of the days points toward the **Sabbath**, which signifies fellowship between God and man.
    - The narrative anticipates the **goal of creation**: communion with God.
    - The days are oriented toward the **eschatological fulfillment** of God's purposes.
    - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant, and the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

5. **Anthropological Focus**
    - The creation days culminate in the creation of **humanity**, highlighting the unique place of man in God's plan.
    - Barth sees the narrative as oriented toward the **human vocation** and responsibility before God.
    - The days of creation are structured to emphasize the **dignity and calling** of human beings.
    - The Sabbath rest points to the **destiny of humanity** in fellowship with God.
    - "The creation of man is the goal of the creation narrative, and the days serve to lead up to this climax." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth's interpretation of the **days of creation** has profoundly influenced modern **theological hermeneutics**, especially in Reformed and ecumenical circles. By emphasizing the **theological** rather than scientific or historical character of Genesis 1, he provided a framework for engaging with contemporary science without abandoning biblical authority. His approach continues to shape discussions on **creation, revelation, and the doctrine of God** in systematic theology. Barth’s legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue between faith and reason, particularly regarding the interpretation of **Scripture**.
