# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame addresses the **days of creation** from a distinctively **Reformed** and **presuppositional** standpoint, emphasizing the supreme authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **God’s lordship**. He advocates an **analogical days** or **literary framework** approach, arguing that the Genesis account’s primary purpose is to reveal **God’s covenantal relationship** with creation rather than to provide a scientific chronology.

- "The days are God’s workdays, not necessarily identical to human workdays, but analogous to them." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Creation" in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)
- "Science, Theology, and the Bible" (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture’s Authority and Clarity**
    - Scripture is the ultimate standard for interpreting the **days of creation**.
    - The text is clear in its theological intent, even if not in scientific detail.
    - The **inerrancy** of Scripture is maintained, regardless of interpretive approach.
    - Hermeneutics must respect both the **historical** and **literary** context.
    "Scripture is to be interpreted by Scripture, and its authority is not diminished by our lack of scientific precision." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Analogical Days View**
    - The creation days are God’s workdays, analogous but not identical to human days.
    - The analogy highlights **God’s sovereignty** and the pattern for human work and rest.
    - The text’s focus is on **God’s acts** and purposes, not on temporal mechanics.
    - This view avoids unnecessary conflict with scientific findings.
    "The days are not necessarily of ordinary length, but serve as a literary framework for God’s creative activity." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Covenantal Lordship**
    - God’s lordship is expressed in His creative acts and the ordering of time.
    - The structure of the creation week reflects **God’s covenantal relationship** with His people.
    - The Sabbath commandment is rooted in the pattern of creation days.
    - The narrative’s primary function is theological, not scientific.
    "The creation week is a model for our work and rest, grounded in God’s lordship." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Respect for Literary Form**
    - The **Genesis** account employs literary devices and structure.
    - Recognizes the presence of **framework** elements in the text.
    - The genre of Genesis 1 is not strictly historical narrative nor myth.
    - Literary form serves theological communication.
    "Genesis 1 is a highly structured account, designed to teach us about God and our world." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Integration with Science**
    - Scripture and science address different questions and should not be set in opposition.
    - The analogical view allows for flexibility in understanding the age of the earth.
    - Scientific findings should not override the authority of **Scripture** but can inform interpretation.
    - Christians should approach scientific claims with discernment and humility.
    "We must not let scientific theories dictate our exegesis, but neither should we ignore what God reveals in nature." (The Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to the **days of creation** has provided a mediating position within Reformed theology, balancing a high view of **biblical authority** with sensitivity to literary and scientific concerns. His analogical days view has influenced evangelical discussions, offering a robust theological alternative to both strict literalism and non-historical readings. Frame’s emphasis on **God’s lordship** and covenantal structure continues to shape contemporary debates on creation and hermeneutics.
