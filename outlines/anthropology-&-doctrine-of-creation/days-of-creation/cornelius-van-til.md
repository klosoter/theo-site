# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **days of creation** within the broader context of a **Reformed doctrine of revelation** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. He emphasized that the interpretation of **Genesis 1** must be governed by a consistently **theistic epistemology**, rejecting both rationalistic and purely naturalistic readings. For Van Til, the **days** are to be understood analogically, reflecting the incomprehensibility of God’s creative act and the necessity of **Scripture’s self-attesting authority**.

- "We must interpret the days of creation in terms of the system of truth set forth in Scripture as a whole, not in terms of extrabiblical scientific theory." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-creature distinction governs interpretation**
    - God’s act of creation is fundamentally different from creaturely acts.
    - Human understanding of the **days** is analogical, not univocal.
    - The **incomprehensibility of God** means our knowledge is always dependent and derivative.
    - The text must not be forced into categories derived from autonomous human reason.
    - "We must ever keep in mind the absolute difference between God’s eternity and man’s temporality." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Scripture’s self-attesting authority**
    - The Bible is the ultimate standard for interpreting the **days of creation**.
    - All external evidence or scientific theory must be subordinate to Scripture.
    - The **self-authenticating character of revelation** is central to Van Til’s hermeneutic.
    - Attempts to harmonize Genesis with secular science risk undermining biblical authority.
    - "The Bible must be its own interpreter, and its authority must not be subjected to the judgment of science." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Analogy and anthropomorphic language**
    - The language of Genesis 1 is **anthropomorphic** and analogical.
    - The “days” are not to be pressed into a strictly literal or figurative mold.
    - God accommodates revelation to human capacity, using time-bound language.
    - The analogical nature of revelation preserves both divine mystery and human understanding.
    - "The days of creation are to be understood in the light of God’s condescension to reveal himself in terms we can grasp." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Rejection of autonomous science as interpretive norm**
    - Science, when operating on autonomous principles, cannot serve as a norm for biblical interpretation.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** distort human reasoning apart from revelation.
    - The authority of Scripture is not contingent on scientific verification.
    - The Christian worldview provides the only coherent foundation for interpreting both nature and Scripture.
    - "It is only on the presupposition of the truth of Christian theism that science itself is possible." (Christian Apologetics)

5. **Redemptive-historical context of creation**
    - The doctrine of creation is inseparable from the broader **redemptive-historical** narrative.
    - The days of creation are foundational for understanding **covenant history**.
    - The structure of Genesis 1 points forward to God’s purposes in redemption.
    - Creation and redemption are unified under the sovereign plan of God.
    - "The creation account is not isolated but is the beginning of the history of redemption." (Essays in Christian Education)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **days of creation** has shaped Reformed apologetics by insisting on the primacy of **Scripture’s authority** and the necessity of interpreting Genesis within a consistently theistic framework. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and analogical knowledge has influenced debates over the relationship between science and faith. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing commitment among many Reformed theologians to uphold the self-attesting nature of biblical revelation in discussions of origins.
