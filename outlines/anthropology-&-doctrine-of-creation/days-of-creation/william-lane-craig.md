# William Lane Craig (1949– )

William Lane Craig approaches the **days of creation** through the lens of **philosophical theology**, emphasizing the importance of **hermeneutics** and **genre analysis** in interpreting **Genesis 1**. He argues that the creation account is best understood as **mytho-historical literature**, not as a straightforward **chronological narrative**, and thus the "days" should not be read as literal 24-hour periods.

- "The evidence suggests that the days of Genesis 1 are not intended to be taken as literal, consecutive, 24-hour days." ("In Quest of the Historical Adam")

## Key Works

- "In Quest of the Historical Adam: A Biblical and Scientific Exploration"
- "Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics"
- "The Kalam Cosmological Argument" (relevant for his broader doctrine of creation)
- "Time and Eternity: Exploring God's Relationship to Time"
- Numerous articles and debates on the interpretation of Genesis 1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Genre of Genesis 1 is Mytho-Historical**
    - Genesis 1 employs literary and symbolic features distinct from straightforward historical narrative.
    - The text uses **archetypal imagery** and **figurative language** to convey theological truths.
    - The structure and repetition in the account point to a **non-literal framework**.
    - This genre identification shapes how the "days" are to be interpreted.
    - "Genesis 1–11 exhibits traits that are characteristic of mytho-history." ("In Quest of the Historical Adam")

2. **Non-Literal Interpretation of the Days**
    - The "days" function as a literary device rather than as markers of actual time periods.
    - The sequence is designed to communicate **theological order** and **purpose** in creation.
    - The text is not making scientific claims about the age or process of the universe.
    - This view allows for compatibility with **modern cosmology** and **evolutionary science**.
    - "The days are part of a literary structure, not a chronological account." ("In Quest of the Historical Adam")

3. **Affirmation of Divine Creation ex nihilo**
    - God is the ultimate source and cause of all that exists.
    - The doctrine of **creation ex nihilo** is upheld regardless of the days' interpretation.
    - The focus remains on God's sovereignty and intentionality in creation.
    - The precise mechanism or timing is secondary to the affirmation of divine agency.
    - "What is essential is that God is the Creator, not how long He took." ("Reasonable Faith")

4. **Integration of Science and Scripture**
    - Scientific discoveries about the universe's age and development are not in conflict with Genesis 1.
    - The Bible and science address different kinds of questions—**theological** vs. **empirical**.
    - Hermeneutical humility is necessary when interpreting ancient texts in light of modern knowledge.
    - This approach seeks to avoid unnecessary conflict between faith and reason.
    - "We must not force the text to say what it was never intended to say scientifically." ("Reasonable Faith")

5. **Historical Adam and Theological Significance**
    - While Genesis 1 is mytho-historical, Craig maintains the importance of a **historical Adam** for **original sin** and **redemption**.
    - The days of creation are not essential for affirming Adam's historicity.
    - The theological message of human origins is preserved even with a non-literal reading of the days.
    - This distinction allows for doctrinal continuity with **Pauline theology**.
    - "The historicity of Adam is separable from the literalness of the creation days." ("In Quest of the Historical Adam")

## Legacy and Impact

Craig's approach to the **days of creation** has influenced evangelical discussions by encouraging a nuanced reading of **Genesis 1** that respects both **biblical authority** and scientific evidence. His advocacy for the **mytho-historical genre** has provided a framework for reconciling faith with contemporary cosmology. While some traditionalists critique his non-literal stance, Craig's work has broadened the conversation on **hermeneutics** and the doctrine of creation within the wider Christian academy.
