# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed a **literal, historical interpretation** of the **days of creation** in Genesis, emphasizing the clarity and reliability of the biblical text. He insisted that the **six days** were actual, consecutive, 24-hour periods, reflecting his commitment to the **perspicuity of Scripture** and opposition to allegorical or philosophical reinterpretations.

- "We assert that Moses spoke in the literal sense, not allegorically or figuratively, i.e., that the world, with all its creatures, was created within six days, as the words read." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis, Chapters 1–5
- Disputations on Creation (various disputations, 1536–1545)
- Table Talk (collected posthumously, relevant remarks on Genesis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Literal Six-Day Creation**
    - The **days of creation** are six actual, consecutive, 24-hour days.
    - Moses’ account in Genesis is to be taken at face value, not as allegory.
    - Rejects attempts to harmonize Genesis with philosophical or scientific speculation.
    - Upholds the **historicity** of the creation narrative as foundational to Christian doctrine.
    - "We must understand that these days were actual days, according to their ordinary usage, just as we now reckon them." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Perspicuity and Authority of Scripture**
    - Scripture is clear and should be interpreted according to its plain sense.
    - The biblical account of creation is trustworthy and sufficient.
    - Human reason and philosophy must submit to the authority of the Word.
    - Allegorical interpretations undermine the reliability of Scripture.
    - "Scripture must be received as it stands; we must not call into question what is plainly set forth." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Rejection of Allegorical and Philosophical Readings**
    - Opposes allegorizing the days of creation or reading them as mere symbols.
    - Critiques Church Fathers and contemporaries who spiritualize the text.
    - Maintains that philosophical approaches (e.g., Aristotle) distort biblical truth.
    - Insists on the primacy of the biblical narrative over extra-biblical speculation.
    - "It is not for us to fashion a Moses according to our own ideas, but to accept him as he speaks." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Doctrine of Creation ex nihilo**
    - God created all things out of nothing by His Word.
    - The creation days mark the orderly unfolding of God’s creative work.
    - Creation is a demonstration of God’s power and sovereignty.
    - The sequence of days reflects divine wisdom and intentionality.
    - "God created all things out of nothing, and He did so in the order and manner revealed in Genesis." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Theological Significance of Creation’s Order**
    - The order of creation days reveals God’s providence and purpose.
    - Humanity’s creation on the sixth day highlights human dignity and vocation.
    - The Sabbath rest on the seventh day establishes a pattern for worship and rest.
    - The structure of the creation week undergirds Christian understanding of time and work.
    - "The order of creation is not accidental, but is filled with meaning for our faith and life." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s **literal interpretation** of the days of creation shaped subsequent **Protestant exegesis** and reinforced the authority of Scripture over tradition and philosophy. His stance influenced later Lutheran and Reformed theologians, contributing to debates on the relationship between **science and faith**. While later interpreters have differed on the nature of the creation days, Luther’s insistence on the **clarity and sufficiency of Scripture** remains a foundational principle in confessional Protestant theology.
