# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl approached the **days of creation** not as literal, historical events but as expressions of the **religious and ethical meaning** embedded in the biblical text. He emphasized the **value-judgments** and **community-forming function** of Scripture, arguing that the Genesis account serves to orient the believing community toward God’s sovereignty and purpose, rather than to provide scientific or metaphysical information.

- "The biblical narrative is not a scientific account, but a religious declaration of the world’s dependence on God." (The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation, Vol. 3
- Instruction in the Christian Religion
- Theology and Metaphysics (secondary: Wilhelm Herrmann, The Communion of the Christian with God)
- Ritschl’s lectures on Dogmatics (as edited by Otto Ritschl)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Value-Judgments**
    - The **days of creation** are interpreted through the lens of their religious value, not as empirical history.
    - Scripture’s authority is rooted in its capacity to shape the moral and spiritual life of the community.
    - The Genesis account is a vehicle for expressing the dependence of all things on God.
    - Scientific or metaphysical readings are subordinate to the text’s ethical and communal function.
    - "The religious value of the creation narrative lies in its affirmation of God as the ground of all reality." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Ritschl opposes speculative metaphysics in theology, including literal cosmologies.
    - The creation days are not to be harmonized with scientific theories or philosophical systems.
    - Theological focus must remain on the practical implications for faith and life.
    - The meaning of creation is grasped through its impact on the believer’s relationship with God.
    - "We must not confuse the religious purpose of the text with the aims of natural science." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Community-Forming Function of Scripture**
    - The Genesis narrative serves to unify the Christian community around a shared confession of God as Creator.
    - The structure of the creation week reflects order and purpose for communal worship and life.
    - The text’s primary function is to foster trust and obedience, not to provide chronology.
    - The days symbolize God’s providential ordering of time for human flourishing.
    - "The creation story is a confession of faith, not a scientific treatise." (Instruction in the Christian Religion)

4. **Christocentric Orientation**
    - All doctrines, including creation, are interpreted in light of the revelation of God in Christ.
    - The meaning of creation is ultimately revealed in the person and work of Jesus.
    - The days of creation point forward to the fulfillment of God’s purpose in redemption.
    - Theological interpretation is governed by the centrality of Christ for faith and doctrine.
    - "The knowledge of God as Creator is inseparable from the knowledge of God in Christ." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Historical Relativity of Biblical Cosmology**
    - The biblical account reflects the cosmological understanding of its ancient context.
    - Ritschl affirms the legitimacy of modern scientific discoveries alongside the religious message of Genesis.
    - The days of creation are not a barrier to engaging with contemporary science.
    - The enduring significance of Genesis lies in its theological, not scientific, claims.
    - "The form of the creation narrative is conditioned by its time, but its truth is eternal." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s approach to the **days of creation** shaped the trajectory of modern Protestant theology by prioritizing the **religious and ethical meaning** of Scripture over literal or scientific readings. His influence contributed to the development of **liberal theology** and the demythologizing movement, encouraging theologians to interpret biblical cosmology in light of its function for faith and community. While later critics challenged his sharp distinction between faith and history, Ritschl’s emphasis on the formative power of biblical narratives remains significant in contemporary theology.
