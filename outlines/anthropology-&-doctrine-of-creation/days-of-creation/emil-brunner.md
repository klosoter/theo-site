# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **days of creation** as a theological narrative rather than a literal, chronological account, emphasizing the **revelatory** and **mythopoetic** character of the Genesis text. He argued that the creation account conveys profound truths about **God’s sovereignty**, **humanity’s place in creation**, and the **Creator-creature distinction**, rather than providing a scientific or historical sequence of events.

- "The creation story is not a scientific account, but a confession of faith in the Creator." (Dogmatics, Vol. II)

## Key Works

- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Christian Doctrine of God
- Man in Revolt
- Revelation and Reason
- The Divine Imperative

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation Account as Theological Narrative**
    - The Genesis days are not intended as literal, historical days.
    - The narrative serves to reveal **God’s relationship** to the world.
    - Brunner stresses the **confessional** nature of the text.
    - The account is **mythopoetic**, expressing truth through story.
    - "The days of creation are not a chronology, but a proclamation of God as Creator." (Dogmatics, Vol. II)

2. **Revelation over Scientific Explanation**
    - Scripture’s purpose is to reveal **God’s will** and character, not scientific facts.
    - The creation days communicate theological meaning, not cosmological data.
    - Brunner distinguishes between **revelation** and **information**.
    - He resists concordist readings that harmonize Genesis with science.
    - "The Bible is not a textbook of natural science, but the witness to God’s revelation." (Dogmatics, Vol. II)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - The creation account upholds the absolute distinction between **God** and the created order.
    - The six days structure emphasizes God’s sovereign initiative.
    - Brunner rejects any notion of creation as emanation or necessity.
    - The text affirms the **contingency** and dependence of creation.
    - "Creation means that the world is not God, but God’s work." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

4. **Humanity’s Place in Creation**
    - The narrative climaxes with the creation of humanity in God’s image.
    - Brunner sees the days as a literary device to highlight human uniqueness.
    - The text teaches **human responsibility** within creation.
    - The Sabbath points to humanity’s vocation in relation to God.
    - "Man is set at the center of creation, not as its master, but as its steward." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**
    - The structure of the days underscores God’s **sovereign freedom**.
    - Each day’s creative act is by divine fiat, not by natural process.
    - Brunner emphasizes God’s lordship over time and matter.
    - The account resists all forms of **pantheism** or naturalism.
    - "God creates by His Word, and by His Word alone." (Dogmatics, Vol. II)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of the **days of creation** influenced later neo-orthodox and Reformed theologians who sought to uphold the **theological authority of Scripture** without binding it to literalist or concordist readings. His emphasis on the **revelatory function** of the creation narrative contributed to ongoing discussions about the relationship between faith and science. Brunner’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of **biblical theology** and modern cosmology.
