# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge addressed the **days of creation** by affirming the **infallibility of Scripture** while allowing for non-literal interpretations of **Genesis 1**. He maintained that the **Mosaic account** was not intended to teach science, and that the "days" could represent long periods, provided the **doctrine of creation ex nihilo** and the **special creation of humanity** were preserved.

- "It is of course admitted that the Scriptures were not intended to teach science, either natural or metaphysical." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (especially chapters on Creation and Genesis)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- "The Mosaic Account of Creation" (Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review, 1859)
- What is Darwinism?

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scripture is authoritative but not a science textbook**
    - The Bible is **infallible** in all it teaches, but its purpose is not to provide scientific detail.
    - The **Mosaic narrative** uses language suited to its original audience.
    - Theological truths, not scientific mechanisms, are the focus of Genesis 1.
    - Apparent conflicts with science often arise from misreading either Scripture or nature.
    "The Bible gives us the fact, but not the process, of creation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Days of creation may be figurative or represent long periods**
    - The Hebrew word "yom" can mean an ordinary day or an indefinite period.
    - The context of Genesis allows for the interpretation of "days" as **epochs**.
    - The sequence of creation is more important than the duration of each "day."
    - This view does not undermine the **divine origin** of the cosmos.
    "There is nothing in the first chapter of Genesis to forbid the assumption that the word 'day' may designate a period of indefinite duration." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Doctrine of creation ex nihilo is non-negotiable**
    - God created all things out of nothing by his sovereign will.
    - Any interpretation of Genesis must affirm **creation ex nihilo**.
    - The origin of matter is not explained by natural processes.
    - The creative acts of God are distinct from subsequent providence.
    "The Scriptures teach that the universe owes its existence to the will of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Special creation of humanity**
    - Humanity is uniquely created in the **image of God**.
    - The creation of Adam and Eve is a historical event, not a myth or allegory.
    - Human origins cannot be explained by evolution from lower forms.
    - The spiritual and moral nature of humanity is divinely imparted.
    "The record of the creation of man is not a mere poetic or mythical representation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Harmony between Scripture and true science**
    - Genuine scientific discovery cannot contradict **biblical truth**.
    - Apparent discrepancies are due to human misunderstanding.
    - The church should not fear scientific investigation.
    - Theological interpretation must be open to established facts of nature.
    "Science has its province, and the Bible has its province; and the two cannot come into collision if rightly understood." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s approach to the **days of creation** shaped the **Old Princeton** tradition, encouraging a careful distinction between the authority of Scripture and the findings of science. His willingness to allow for non-literal days, while upholding the **doctrine of creation** and the **special creation of humanity**, provided a mediating position in later debates over Genesis and evolution. Hodge’s influence persists in Reformed discussions on **hermeneutics** and the relationship between faith and science.
