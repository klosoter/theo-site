# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther leaned toward **traducianism** in his understanding of the **origin of the soul**, believing that both body and soul are propagated from parents rather than the soul being created directly by God at conception. He saw this as consistent with the doctrine of **original sin** and the transmission of human corruption. However, Luther did not treat the issue as dogmatic, acknowledging some mystery and refraining from rigidly condemning **creationism**.

- "I am inclined to the opinion that the soul, like the body, is derived from the parents." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans
- Disputation on the Human Nature (1536)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1–5
- Table Talk

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Traducianism as the probable view**
   - Luther favored the idea that both body and soul are propagated from parents.
   - He saw traducianism as supporting the doctrine of **original sin**.
   - He believed this view best explained the universality of human corruption.
   - Luther acknowledged that Scripture does not decisively settle the question.
   - "I am strongly of the opinion that the soul, like the body, is derived from the parents." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Original sin’s transmission**
   - Traducianism aligns with Luther’s emphasis on the inherited nature of sin.
   - He argued that if the soul were created directly, it would be difficult to explain the soul’s corruption.
   - The propagation of both body and soul accounts for the total depravity of humanity.
   - This view supports the necessity of **justification by faith**.
   - "If the soul were created pure by God, how could it be infected with original sin?" (Table Talk)

3. **Openness to mystery and humility**
   - Luther admitted the limits of human knowledge regarding the soul’s origin.
   - He refrained from making traducianism a dogma of the faith.
   - He allowed for the possibility that God could create souls directly if He willed.
   - Luther encouraged humility and caution in speculative theology.
   - "Let us not be too rash in defining what Scripture has not clearly revealed." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Creationism not condemned**
   - Luther did not anathematize those who held to **creationism**.
   - He recognized that many church fathers and contemporaries favored creationism.
   - He saw both views as having some scriptural and philosophical support.
   - Luther prioritized unity in essentials over division on speculative matters.
   - "I do not condemn those who hold that the soul is created by God at each conception." (Table Talk)

5. **Theological anthropology rooted in Scripture**
   - Luther’s views on the soul were shaped by his reading of **Genesis** and **Pauline epistles**.
   - He emphasized the unity of body and soul in the human person.
   - His anthropology was always subordinate to the authority of Scripture.
   - He saw the doctrine’s importance for understanding **human nature** and **redemption**.
   - "Scripture teaches that man is wholly corrupted, both in body and soul." (Commentary on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s cautious preference for **traducianism** influenced later Lutheran theology and discussions of **original sin**. His refusal to dogmatize the issue set a precedent for humility in speculative matters within Protestant anthropology. While not a central theme of his theology, Luther’s approach shaped the way subsequent theologians balanced **biblical authority** with philosophical reasoning on the origin of the soul. His legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue between traducianism and creationism in Christian thought.
