# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin addressed the question of the **origin of the human soul** within the broader context of **Reformed anthropology**. He carefully weighed the merits of both **traducianism** (the soul is propagated from the parents) and **creationism** (the soul is created directly by God), ultimately favoring **creationism** as more consistent with the **immortality** and **spirituality** of the soul, as well as the doctrine of **original sin**. Turretin’s nuanced approach sought to uphold both the integrity of the soul and the justice of God in the propagation of human nature.

- The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology (secondary: essays on anthropology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Soul’s Immateriality and Immortality**
    - The soul is a **spiritual and immaterial substance**, not composed of parts.
    - Its **immortality** is grounded in its nature as created directly by God.
    - Traducianism risks materializing the soul by making it dependent on physical generation.
    - Creationism better preserves the soul’s **distinctness** from the body.
    - "The soul cannot be educed from the potentiality of matter, but must be created by God." (Institutes, 5.13.9)

2. **Immediate Creation of Each Soul**
    - God creates each individual soul at the moment of conception or birth.
    - This act is a continuation of God’s creative work, not a new kind of creation.
    - The soul’s origin is not mediated by parental agency.
    - This view maintains the **dignity** and **uniqueness** of each person.
    - "The soul is not ex traduce, but is immediately created by God." (Institutes, 5.13.9)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Turretin affirms that **original sin** is transmitted through the **covenantal union** of the race, not by the physical propagation of the soul.
    - The soul, though created pure, is united to a corrupted nature and thus becomes guilty.
    - Creationism does not undermine the doctrine of original sin.
    - The justice of God is maintained in the imputation of Adam’s sin.
    - "Although the soul is created pure, it is united to a depraved body and so becomes polluted." (Institutes, 5.13.13)

4. **Rejection of Traducianism’s Difficulties**
    - Traducianism cannot account for the soul’s **simplicity** and **spirituality**.
    - It risks introducing materialistic or semi-pelagian implications.
    - The propagation of the soul would imply divisibility, which is contrary to its nature.
    - Traducianism does not adequately explain the soul’s immortality.
    - "The soul, being indivisible and spiritual, cannot be propagated as the body is." (Institutes, 5.13.10)

5. **Theological and Scriptural Foundations**
    - Turretin appeals to **Scripture** (e.g., Ecclesiastes 12:7; Zechariah 12:1) to support creationism.
    - He emphasizes the **analogy of faith** and the consensus of the orthodox church.
    - The creation of souls is consistent with God’s ongoing providence.
    - The doctrine safeguards the **Creator-creature distinction**.
    - "God is said to form the spirit of man within him, which cannot be said of the body." (Institutes, 5.13.11)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s defense of **creationism** became a standard position in later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping subsequent theological anthropology. His careful distinction between the **origin of the soul** and the **transmission of original sin** influenced both confessional documents and later dogmatic works. Turretin’s nuanced engagement with both traducianism and creationism continues to serve as a reference point for discussions on the nature of the soul in Reformed theology.
