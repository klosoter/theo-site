# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin addressed the question of the **origin of the soul** within the broader context of **anthropology** and **original sin**. He rejected **traducianism**—the view that the soul is propagated by the parents—favoring instead **creationism**, the belief that each soul is directly created by God. Calvin’s stance was shaped by his commitment to the **sovereignty of God** and the **goodness of creation**, while also maintaining the reality of **human depravity**.

- "We must hold, therefore, that souls are not derived from the substance of the parents, but are created by God and at the same time infused into the bodies, so as to be ready for their habitation as soon as they are formed." (Institutes 2.13.4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Souls are individually created by God**
    - Calvin insists that each human soul is a unique creation of God, not transmitted by human parents.
    - He distinguishes the **creation of the soul** from the **generation of the body**.
    - This view upholds the **spiritual nature** of the soul, which cannot be divided or propagated.
    - Calvin sees this as consistent with the **dignity of humanity** as God’s image-bearers.
    - "It ought not to be doubted that the soul of man is created anew for each individual." (Institutes 2.13.4)

2. **Traducianism undermines the soul’s spirituality**
    - Calvin critiques traducianism for implying that the soul is material or divisible.
    - He argues that the soul, being **immortal** and **spiritual**, cannot be transmitted through physical means.
    - Traducianism, in his view, confuses the distinction between **body and soul**.
    - He maintains that only God can create a spiritual substance.
    - "It is certain that the soul is not derived from the substance of the parents." (Institutes 2.13.4)

3. **Original sin is transmitted, not the soul’s substance**
    - Calvin affirms the **transmission of original sin** but denies that this requires the transmission of the soul’s substance.
    - He explains that **corruption** is passed on through natural generation, not by the soul itself being sinful.
    - The soul, though created pure, becomes tainted as it is united to a fallen body.
    - This preserves both the **justice of God** and the reality of human depravity.
    - "The soul, though created pure, is forthwith soiled by the impurity of the flesh to which it is joined." (Institutes 2.13.5)

4. **God’s sovereignty in the creation of souls**
    - Calvin’s doctrine is rooted in the **sovereignty of God** over all creation, including each individual soul.
    - He emphasizes that God’s creative act is ongoing and particular to every human being.
    - This view reinforces the **dependence of humanity** on God for both body and soul.
    - It also highlights the **goodness of creation** despite the reality of sin.
    - "God does not cease to create souls, but as he once created the world, so he now creates souls daily." (Commentary on Genesis 2:7)

5. **Theological caution and humility**
    - Calvin warns against speculative anthropology not grounded in Scripture.
    - He acknowledges the mystery involved in the union of soul and body.
    - Calvin urges theologians to avoid dogmatism where Scripture is silent.
    - He prioritizes **biblical exegesis** and **doctrinal humility** in anthropological questions.
    - "Let us not be ashamed to be ignorant of what God has not revealed." (Institutes 2.13.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s defense of **creationism** over **traducianism** shaped the mainstream Reformed understanding of the **origin of the soul**. His arguments influenced later Protestant confessions and systematic theologies, reinforcing the distinction between **body and soul** and the direct creative activity of God. Calvin’s careful exegesis and theological caution set a standard for subsequent discussions of **anthropology** in the Reformed tradition. His approach continues to inform debates on human nature, original sin, and the image of God.
