# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **traducianism vs. creationism** through his existential and demythologizing lens, focusing less on metaphysical speculation and more on the **meaning of human existence** before God. He was skeptical of traditional doctrines concerning the **origin of the soul**, viewing them as mythological constructs that distract from the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with the divine. For Bultmann, the significance of human nature lies not in its metaphysical origin but in its openness to **faith** and **authentic existence**.

- "The question of the origin of the soul is irrelevant to the existential self-understanding of man before God." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann"
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Anthropological Doctrines**
   - Traditional debates like **traducianism** and **creationism** are seen as mythological and not essential to Christian faith.
   - The focus is on interpreting biblical anthropology existentially, not metaphysically.
   - The language of soul and spirit in Scripture is symbolic of human openness to God.
   - The existential situation of humanity is theologically decisive, not the mechanics of soul-origination.
   - "Mythological conceptions must be interpreted so as to disclose their existential meaning." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Primacy of Kerygma Over Metaphysics**
   - The proclamation of Christ is central, not speculative anthropology.
   - The origin of the soul does not affect the call to faith and decision.
   - Theological reflection should serve the proclamation, not abstract speculation.
   - The New Testament's concern is with the new life in Christ, not with the soul's metaphysical beginnings.
   - "The kerygma does not proclaim a theory about man, but a call to decision." ("Existence and Faith")

3. **Existential Understanding of Human Nature**
   - Human beings are defined by their relationship to God, not by their soul's origin.
   - Authentic existence is found in response to the divine call, not in metaphysical status.
   - The existential encounter with God is the locus of theological anthropology.
   - The question of how the soul is transmitted is secondary to the question of how one stands before God.
   - "Man is not a substance but a possibility, a being confronted by God." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Rejection of Speculative Anthropology**
   - Bultmann rejects both **traducianism** and **creationism** as speculative and unhelpful.
   - He urges theologians to move beyond ancient cosmologies and anthropologies.
   - Theological anthropology should be grounded in existential analysis, not metaphysical speculation.
   - The New Testament's interest is in the human condition, not in the soul's origin.
   - "We cannot return to a pre-scientific worldview; theology must speak to modern man." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

5. **Scripture as Existential Address**
   - Biblical texts about human origin are interpreted as existential address, not scientific or metaphysical statements.
   - The meaning of creation is found in the call to authentic existence, not in the mechanics of soul-creation.
   - The doctrine of the soul must be reinterpreted in light of the existential situation.
   - The focus is on the individual's response to God's word, not on ontological origins.
   - "Scripture speaks to us as those who must decide, not as those who must speculate." ("History and Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to **anthropology** and the origin of the soul redirected theological discussion away from metaphysical debates like **traducianism** and **creationism** toward existential and hermeneutical concerns. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional doctrines, urging theologians to focus on the existential meaning of biblical texts. While controversial, his work has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in the interpretation of human nature and the relevance of ancient doctrinal debates for contemporary faith.
