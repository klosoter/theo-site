# John D. Currid (1951– )

John D. Currid, an Old Testament scholar, addresses the debate between **traducianism** and **creationism** primarily through his exegetical work on **Genesis** and the doctrine of **anthropology**. Currid leans toward a **creationist** understanding of the soul, emphasizing God's direct involvement in the creation of each human soul, while recognizing the historical and theological significance of the traducianist position within the broader **Reformed tradition**.

- "The text of Genesis 2:7 emphasizes the unique and direct act of God in the creation of man, distinguishing him from the rest of creation." (Genesis, Evangelical Press)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Soul’s Divine Origin**
   - Argues that **Genesis 2:7** presents the soul as a direct creation by God.
   - Emphasizes the distinction between the creation of humans and animals.
   - Sees the **imago Dei** as rooted in God’s immediate creative act.
   - Rejects any notion that the soul is merely a product of human generation.
   - "God’s breathing into Adam is a unique, unrepeatable act that sets humanity apart." (Genesis, Vol. 1)

2. **Critical Engagement with Traducianism**
   - Recognizes the historical presence of traducianism in Christian thought.
   - Notes its appeal in explaining the transmission of **original sin**.
   - Points out exegetical weaknesses in using Genesis to support traducianism.
   - Maintains that Scripture does not explicitly teach the propagation of the soul.
   - "While traducianism addresses certain theological concerns, it lacks clear biblical warrant." (Genesis, Vol. 1)

3. **Theological Priority of Scriptural Exegesis**
   - Prioritizes careful reading of the **Hebrew text** in doctrinal formulation.
   - Warns against imposing philosophical systems onto biblical anthropology.
   - Highlights the importance of the **creation account** for understanding human nature.
   - Advocates for doctrines that arise organically from the biblical narrative.
   - "Our doctrine of man must be shaped by the text, not by external philosophical constructs." (Genesis, Vol. 1)

4. **Doctrine of the Imago Dei**
   - Connects the direct creation of the soul to the uniqueness of the **image of God**.
   - Argues that the imago Dei is not reducible to physical or biological descent.
   - Sees the soul’s divine origin as essential for human dignity and responsibility.
   - Maintains that the image of God is foundational for biblical anthropology.
   - "The image of God in man is inseparable from God’s immediate creative act." (Genesis, Vol. 1)

5. **Rejection of Materialistic Anthropology**
   - Opposes views that reduce human beings to purely physical entities.
   - Emphasizes the spiritual dimension as essential to human identity.
   - Affirms the ongoing relevance of the soul’s creation for Christian doctrine.
   - Warns against naturalistic explanations for the origin of the soul.
   - "A biblical anthropology demands recognition of the soul’s supernatural origin." (Genesis, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

John D. Currid’s exegetical rigor and commitment to **biblical anthropology** have influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on the origin of the soul. His careful analysis of Genesis has reinforced the **creationist** position within evangelical scholarship, while also engaging respectfully with the traducianist tradition. Currid’s work continues to shape debates on human nature, the imago Dei, and the relationship between Scripture and doctrine.
