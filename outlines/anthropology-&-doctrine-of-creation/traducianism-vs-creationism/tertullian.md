# Tertullian (c. 155–c. 220)

Tertullian was a pivotal early Christian thinker who strongly advocated for **traducianism**, the doctrine that the **soul** is propagated along with the body from the parents, rather than being created directly by God at each conception (**creationism**). He developed this view to explain the transmission of **original sin** and to maintain the unity of human nature, setting his position apart from later **creationist** perspectives.

- "The soul, as well as the flesh, is born in the ordinary course of generation." (A Treatise on the Soul, ch. 19)

## Key Works

- A Treatise on the Soul (De Anima)
- Apology
- Against Marcion
- On the Resurrection of the Flesh
- Theological Dictionary of the Early Church (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Traducianism of the Soul**
    - The **soul** is transmitted from parents to children through natural generation.
    - This view preserves the unity of **body and soul** in human nature.
    - Traducianism explains how **original sin** is inherited by all humanity.
    - It opposes the idea that God creates each soul ex nihilo at conception.
    - "For as the soul is generated along with the body, so is it also infected with the same taint." (De Anima, ch. 40)

2. **Unity of Human Nature**
    - Human beings are a composite of **body and soul** from conception.
    - Both aspects are equally involved in the transmission of human life.
    - The unity supports the doctrine of the **resurrection of the flesh**.
    - Sin affects the whole person, not just the body or soul in isolation.
    - "The flesh is the very condition on which salvation hinges." (On the Resurrection of the Flesh, ch. 8)

3. **Opposition to Creationism**
    - Tertullian rejects the view that God creates each soul directly at conception.
    - He argues that creationism undermines the doctrine of **original sin**.
    - Creationism, in his view, risks making God the author of sinful souls.
    - He maintains that traducianism better fits the biblical narrative of human descent.
    - "If the soul comes from God alone, how can it be tainted by Adam's sin?" (De Anima, ch. 20)

4. **Doctrine of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is transmitted through both body and soul.
    - Traducianism provides a mechanism for the universal reach of sin.
    - This doctrine undergirds the need for **redemption** in Christ.
    - The inherited corruption affects every human from conception.
    - "The corruption of our nature is handed down from the first man." (De Anima, ch. 41)

5. **Anthropological Realism**
    - Tertullian emphasizes the real, substantial existence of the soul.
    - The soul is not a mere abstraction but has a definite origin and propagation.
    - This realism supports his arguments for bodily resurrection and judgment.
    - The soul’s propagation is as natural as the body’s, reinforcing human solidarity.
    - "The soul has a corporeal substance of its own kind." (De Anima, ch. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Tertullian’s defense of **traducianism** shaped early Western Christian anthropology and influenced later debates on the origin of the soul. While his view was eventually overshadowed by **creationism** in the Latin tradition, his arguments for the unity of body and soul and the transmission of **original sin** continued to inform theological discussions. His work remains a foundational reference for understanding early Christian perspectives on human nature and the soul’s origin.
