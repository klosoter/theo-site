# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. addresses the question of **human origins** and the **transmission of the soul** with careful attention to the implications for **original sin**, **anthropology**, and **Christology**. While not dogmatic, Gaffin leans toward **traducianism** as most consistent with a **federal understanding of Adam** and the unity of the human race, yet he recognizes the strengths and weaknesses of both traducianism and **creationism** within the Reformed tradition.

- "The traducianist view, in my judgment, best safeguards the unity of the human race and the transmission of original sin, but the exegetical evidence is not decisive." (Perspectives on the Doctrine of Original Sin)

## Key Works

- "Perspectives on the Doctrine of Original Sin" (in *Three Views on Creation and Evolution*)
- "The Usefulness of the Fourfold State" (in *The Pattern of Sound Doctrine*)
- "Anthropology" lectures (Westminster Theological Seminary)
- "Resurrection and Redemption" (for implications on anthropology and union with Christ)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight" (for theological method and anthropology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Human Race**
   - Emphasizes the **solidarity of humanity in Adam** as crucial for understanding original sin.
   - Argues that traducianism best accounts for the **organic unity** of the race.
   - Sees the unity of body and soul as essential for a biblical anthropology.
   - Warns that creationism may unintentionally undermine the federal headship of Adam.
   - "The unity of the human race is not merely biological but encompasses the whole person, body and soul." (Anthropology lectures)

2. **Transmission of Original Sin**
   - Holds that the mode of the soul’s origin affects how **original sin** is transmitted.
   - Suggests traducianism provides a more coherent account of inherited guilt and corruption.
   - Notes that creationism can struggle to explain the justice of imputed sin.
   - Maintains that the Reformed tradition must uphold both the reality and universality of original sin.
   - "Traducianism seems to offer the most satisfactory explanation for the transmission of sin from Adam to his posterity." (Perspectives on the Doctrine of Original Sin)

3. **Exegetical Caution**
   - Recognizes that **Scripture does not decisively settle** the traducianism vs. creationism debate.
   - Urges humility and restraint in dogmatizing on the soul’s origin.
   - Stresses the importance of theological synthesis over speculative anthropology.
   - Encourages engagement with the best arguments from both positions.
   - "Neither traducianism nor creationism can claim unambiguous biblical support." (Anthropology lectures)

4. **Christological Safeguards**
   - Insists that any position must preserve the **sinlessness of Christ**.
   - Notes that traducianism must avoid implying Christ inherits a sinful nature.
   - Affirms the necessity of the **virgin birth** for the uniqueness of Christ’s humanity.
   - Stresses that both views must account for the incarnation’s uniqueness.
   - "The traducianist must carefully distinguish the transmission of sin in ordinary generation from the miraculous conception of Christ." (Perspectives on the Doctrine of Original Sin)

5. **Theological Method and Reformed Tradition**
   - Advocates for a **systematic theological approach** grounded in Reformed confessions.
   - Values historical theology in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each view.
   - Sees the debate as secondary to the central doctrines of **federal headship** and **union with Christ**.
   - Encourages ongoing dialogue within the bounds of confessional orthodoxy.
   - "The Reformed tradition allows for both traducianism and creationism, provided the essentials of original sin and redemption are maintained." (The Pattern of Sound Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s careful engagement with the traducianism vs. creationism debate has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **anthropology** and **original sin**. His emphasis on the unity of the human race and the theological implications for **federal headship** have influenced both academic and pastoral approaches to the doctrine of man. By modeling exegetical caution and confessional fidelity, Gaffin has encouraged a balanced and humble approach to unresolved theological questions within the church.
