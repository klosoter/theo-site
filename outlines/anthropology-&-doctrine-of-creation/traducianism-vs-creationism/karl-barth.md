# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth rejected both **traducianism** and **creationism** as adequate explanations for the origin of the human soul, critiquing their speculative nature and lack of grounding in **revelation**. He emphasized the **relational nature of humanity** and the priority of **divine action** in the creation of each person, situating anthropology within the broader context of **Christology** and the doctrine of **creation**.

- "The question of the origin of the soul is not one that can be answered by philosophical speculation, but only by listening to the witness of Scripture." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics III/1: The Doctrine of Creation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth’s Theological Anthropology (John Webster, secondary)
- Humanity in Karl Barth’s Anthropology (Douglas Harink, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation over speculation**
    - Barth insists that doctrines about the soul’s origin must be grounded in **divine revelation**, not philosophical reasoning.
    - He critiques both traducianism and creationism for relying on metaphysical assumptions.
    - Scripture does not provide a clear answer to the soul’s origin, so dogmatic assertions are unwarranted.
    - Theological anthropology must be shaped by what is revealed in Christ.
    - "We must not allow ourselves to be led astray by the curiosity which seeks to know more than is given us in revelation." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

2. **Humanity as relational being**
    - Barth emphasizes that humans are created for **relationship with God** and with others.
    - The soul is not an isolated substance but is defined by its relational existence.
    - Both traducianism and creationism risk abstracting the soul from its relational context.
    - True anthropology is grounded in the image of God as revealed in Jesus Christ.
    - "Man is not a monad, but a being in encounter." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

3. **Christological anthropology**
    - Barth centers his doctrine of humanity on the person of **Jesus Christ**.
    - The meaning and origin of human existence are found in Christ, not in speculative theories.
    - The doctrine of the soul must be subordinate to the doctrine of Christ.
    - Christ reveals both the nature and destiny of humanity.
    - "In Jesus Christ we see what it means to be truly human." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

4. **Divine act in creation**
    - Each human is created by the **sovereign act of God**.
    - Barth rejects the idea that the soul is transmitted biologically or created independently at conception.
    - The origin of each person is a mystery grounded in God’s creative will.
    - The focus should be on God’s ongoing relationship with each human being.
    - "The creation of man is an act of God’s freedom and grace." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

5. **Critique of dualism**
    - Barth resists any strict **body-soul dualism**.
    - He sees the human as a unified psychosomatic being.
    - Traducianism and creationism both tend to reinforce problematic dualisms.
    - True understanding of humanity must affirm the unity of body and soul in relation to God.
    - "Man is soul and body, not soul without body or body without soul." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of both **traducianism** and **creationism** redirected modern theological anthropology away from speculative metaphysics toward a **Christocentric** and relational understanding of humanity. His emphasis on **revelation** and the unity of body and soul has influenced contemporary discussions on the doctrine of man. Barth’s approach continues to challenge theologians to ground anthropology in the person and work of Christ rather than in philosophical constructs.
