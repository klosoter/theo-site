# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas firmly rejected **traducianism** in favor of **creationism** regarding the origin of the human soul. He argued that each soul is a direct and immediate creation by **God**, emphasizing the **spiritual and immaterial nature of the soul** as incompatible with any form of material transmission from parents. Aquinas’s position is rooted in his broader commitments to **hylomorphism**, **substantial form**, and the **doctrine of creation**.

- "The soul is created by God at the end of human generation." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 118, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, q. 90–118
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book II, ch. 86–89
- De Anima (Commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima)
- De Spiritualibus Creaturis
- Aquinas on Human Nature (Pasnau, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Soul’s Immateriality**
    - The human soul is a **spiritual substance** and thus cannot be generated by material means.
    - The soul’s immateriality precludes it from being transmitted through physical generation.
    - Only **God** can create something immaterial ex nihilo.
    - The soul is the **substantial form** of the body, uniquely created for each individual.
    - "The soul cannot be produced by way of generation, but must be created by God." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 90, a. 2)

2. **Rejection of Traducianism**
    - Traducianism is incompatible with the soul’s **simplicity** and **indivisibility**.
    - The soul does not arise from parental souls, as this would imply division or composition.
    - Traducianism undermines the **unity of the human person** as body and soul.
    - Aquinas critiques traducianism as inconsistent with **Christian anthropology**.
    - "It is impossible for the intellectual soul to be transmitted by way of generation." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 118, a. 2)

3. **Affirmation of Creationism**
    - Each human soul is immediately created by **God** at the moment of conception.
    - Creationism upholds the **dignity** and **uniqueness** of each person.
    - God’s creative act is necessary for the existence of every rational soul.
    - The soul’s origin is distinct from the body’s, which is generated through natural processes.
    - "God alone, Who creates the soul, is the cause of its existence." (Summa Contra Gentiles II, ch. 87)

4. **Hylomorphic Anthropology**
    - The human person is a composite of **body and soul** (hylomorphism).
    - The soul is the **form** of the body, giving it life and identity.
    - The body is generated through natural means, but the soul is not.
    - This anthropology preserves both the **unity** and **distinct origins** of body and soul.
    - "The soul is united to the body as its form, not as a product of generation." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

5. **Doctrine of Divine Causality**
    - Only **God** has the power to create immaterial substances.
    - Human procreation is limited to the generation of the body.
    - The act of creating the soul is a unique exercise of **divine omnipotence**.
    - This doctrine safeguards the **transcendence** of God in the act of creation.
    - "To create belongs to God alone, and especially the creation of the rational soul." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 45, a. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust defense of **creationism** over traducianism became the standard position in **Roman Catholic theology** and influenced later **Scholastic** and **Reformed** discussions on the origin of the soul. His synthesis of **Aristotelian philosophy** and **Christian doctrine** provided a lasting framework for understanding the relationship between body and soul. Aquinas’s arguments continue to shape debates on **anthropology**, **original sin**, and the nature of the human person in both Catholic and broader Christian traditions.
