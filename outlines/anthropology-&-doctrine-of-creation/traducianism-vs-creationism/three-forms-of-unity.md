# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—do not explicitly resolve the debate between **traducianism** and **creationism** regarding the origin of the human soul. However, their formulations on **anthropology**, **original sin**, and the **imago Dei** reflect a theological framework that is compatible with both views, while tending to emphasize the immediate creation of the soul by God. The confessions prioritize the **unity of body and soul**, the transmission of **sinful nature**, and the sovereignty of God in the creation and preservation of human beings.

- "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise Him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14–15
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 6, 7, and 22
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Head III/IV, Articles 1–3
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Immediate Creation of the Soul by God**
   - The confessions describe humanity as created by God, emphasizing His direct act in forming both body and soul.
   - There is no explicit endorsement of **traducianism**; the language supports **creationism** as the default view.
   - The soul is presented as a distinct, spiritual substance, not merely a product of human generation.
   - God’s ongoing providence is affirmed in the continual creation and preservation of souls.
   - "God created man of the dust of the ground, and He made and formed him after His own image and likeness, good, righteous, and holy." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

2. **Transmission of Original Sin**
   - The confessions affirm that **original sin** is propagated to all humanity through Adam.
   - The mechanism of this transmission is not specified, allowing for both traducianist and creationist interpretations.
   - Emphasis is placed on the corruption of human nature, not merely the body or soul alone.
   - The guilt and pollution of sin are said to be inherited from conception and birth.
   - "The corruption of original sin is a depravity of the whole nature and a hereditary disease." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 8)

3. **Unity of Body and Soul**
   - Humanity is described as a unity of **body and soul**, both created good by God.
   - The confessions reject any dualistic denigration of the body or soul.
   - Both aspects of human nature are affected by the Fall and in need of redemption.
   - The resurrection hope includes the restoration of both body and soul.
   - "Man consists of two parts: body and soul; and both are corrupted by sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 6)

4. **Imago Dei and Human Dignity**
   - The **image of God** is affirmed as central to human identity, involving knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - This image is spiritual and moral, not merely physical or material.
   - The loss of the image in the Fall is described as a loss of original righteousness, not of the soul’s substance.
   - Restoration in Christ is the renewal of the image, not the creation of a new soul.
   - "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

5. **Divine Sovereignty in Human Generation**
   - God is acknowledged as sovereign over all aspects of human generation and existence.
   - The confessions stress God’s providential role in the formation of each person.
   - Human procreation is seen as the means, but not the ultimate cause, of the soul’s existence.
   - The mystery of the soul’s origin is left to God’s wisdom, without speculative detail.
   - "We believe that God... still creates and upholds all things by His eternal providence and infinite power." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped Reformed anthropology by providing a robust framework for understanding the **origin of the soul** and the transmission of **original sin** without dogmatizing on traducianism or creationism. Their careful language has allowed for theological diversity within confessional boundaries, while maintaining a strong emphasis on the unity of body and soul and the sovereignty of God. These confessions continue to guide Reformed churches in articulating a biblically grounded doctrine of humanity that resists speculative excess and upholds the dignity of the human person.
