# Origen (c. 184–c. 253)

Origen addressed the origin of the **human soul** within the broader context of his doctrine of **pre-existence**, diverging from both **traducianism** and **creationism** as later defined. He argued that souls were created by God prior to their embodiment, thus rejecting the idea that souls are either transmitted through natural generation or created at the moment of conception. Origen’s position profoundly shaped early Christian debates on the **nature of the soul** and its relationship to the body.

- "Each soul, therefore, having a substance and life of its own, shall be regarded as having been created by God." (De Principiis II.8.3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Doctrine of Pre-existence of Souls**
    - Souls were created by God before the formation of physical bodies.
    - The embodiment of souls is a consequence of their prior actions or choices.
    - This view stands apart from both **traducianism** (soul transmitted by parents) and **creationism** (soul created at conception).
    - The pre-existence of souls is foundational to Origen’s theodicy and anthropology.
    - "God, then, made all things, and souls among them, endowed with free will." (De Principiis II.9.6)

2. **Rejection of Traducianism**
    - Origen denies that the soul is propagated through physical generation.
    - He argues that the soul’s nature is spiritual, not material, and thus not subject to biological transmission.
    - Traducianism is seen as incompatible with the soul’s divine origin and freedom.
    - The soul’s individuality and moral responsibility require a distinct creation.
    - "The soul is not derived from the substance of the parents, but is created by God." (De Principiis II.8.3)

3. **Rejection of Creationism (as Later Defined)**
    - Origen does not affirm that God creates each soul at the moment of conception or birth.
    - He maintains that all souls were created in a primordial act, not successively.
    - The timing of embodiment is determined by divine providence, not by a new act of creation.
    - This differs from later **creationist** views held by Augustine and others.
    - "Souls are not daily created anew, but were created once for all." (De Principiis II.9.7)

4. **Freedom and Moral Responsibility of the Soul**
    - Souls possess **free will** and are responsible for their choices before and after embodiment.
    - The soul’s pre-temporal fall explains its current embodied state.
    - This framework undergirds Origen’s understanding of sin and redemption.
    - The soul’s journey is oriented toward restoration and return to God.
    - "The cause of each one’s descent into a body is his own free act." (De Principiis II.9.7)

5. **Theological Anthropology and the Image of God**
    - The soul, as created by God, bears the **image of God**.
    - Embodiment is not the soul’s original or ideal state.
    - The restoration of the soul involves regaining its original purity and likeness to God.
    - Origen’s anthropology is inseparable from his eschatology and soteriology.
    - "The soul, being made in the image of God, is called to return to its original state." (De Principiis III.6.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Origen’s distinctive doctrine of the **pre-existence of souls** set him apart from later orthodox positions and was eventually condemned, but his arguments against both **traducianism** and **creationism** influenced subsequent theological reflection. His work shaped early debates on the **nature of the soul**, free will, and the relationship between body and spirit. While later theologians such as Augustine and Jerome rejected his views, Origen’s legacy endures in the ongoing discussion of **anthropology** and the origin of the soul in Christian thought.
