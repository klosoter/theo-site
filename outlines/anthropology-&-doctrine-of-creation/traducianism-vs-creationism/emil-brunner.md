# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner addressed the question of **human origins** and the **nature of the soul** within his broader theological anthropology. He rejected both strict **traducianism** and **creationism** as traditionally formulated, instead emphasizing the relational and dynamic character of the **imago Dei** and the unity of body and soul. Brunner argued that the human person is a psychosomatic unity, and that the soul is not a separately created substance but emerges in the context of divine-human relation.

- "The soul is not a substance, but the form of the body’s existence in relation to God." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
   - Brunner denies that the soul is a pre-existing or independently created substance.
   - He sees the human as a **psychosomatic unity**, not a composite of separable parts.
   - The soul is the "form" or relational aspect of bodily existence.
   - This view challenges both **traducianism** and **creationism** as metaphysical explanations.
   - "The soul is not a thing, but the form of the body’s existence in relation to God." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Relational Imago Dei**
   - The image of God is not a static property but a dynamic relationship.
   - Human personhood is constituted in encounter with God, not by transmission or creation of a soul.
   - The **imago Dei** is realized in freedom and responsibility before God.
   - This relational anthropology undercuts the need for a separate act of soul creation.
   - "Man is man only as he stands before God." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Critique of Traducianism**
   - Brunner rejects the idea that the soul is propagated biologically from parents.
   - He argues this view reduces the soul to a natural process, undermining its spiritual character.
   - Traducianism fails to account for the uniqueness of each person’s relation to God.
   - The spiritual dimension cannot be inherited in the same way as physical traits.
   - "The soul cannot be transmitted like a physical property." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Critique of Creationism**
   - Brunner also critiques the notion that God creates each soul ex nihilo at conception or birth.
   - He sees this as too mechanistic and disconnected from the embodied reality of human life.
   - Creationism risks dualism by separating soul from body.
   - The origin of the soul is inseparable from the origin of the whole person.
   - "God does not create souls as isolated entities, but calls persons into being." (Dogmatics II)

5. **Emphasis on Divine Encounter**
   - Human existence is defined by encounter with God, not by metaphysical explanations of soul origin.
   - Theological anthropology must focus on the **divine-human relationship**.
   - The mystery of personhood is grounded in God’s creative and sustaining action.
   - Brunner prioritizes existential and relational categories over speculative metaphysics.
   - "The decisive thing is not how the soul originates, but that man is addressed by God." (Man in Revolt)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **traducianism vs creationism** debate shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation to the **relational and existential dimensions** of human personhood. His emphasis on the **psychosomatic unity** of the human being and the dynamic character of the **imago Dei** influenced later theological anthropology, especially in neo-orthodox and existentialist circles. Brunner’s critique of both traditional views encouraged theologians to reconsider the meaning of the soul in light of the divine-human encounter, rather than as a problem of substance or transmission.
