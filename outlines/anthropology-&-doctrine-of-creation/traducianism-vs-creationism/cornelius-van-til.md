# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til addressed the question of **the origin of the soul**—traducianism versus creationism—within the broader context of **Reformed anthropology** and his commitment to the **Creator-creature distinction**. While Van Til did not write extensively on this specific debate, his presuppositional approach emphasized the necessity of grounding all doctrines, including the origin of the soul, in the **self-attesting revelation of God** and the **covenantal structure** of reality.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-creature distinction is foundational**
   - Maintains that all theological questions, including the soul’s origin, must respect the absolute ontological difference between God and man.
   - Rejects any view that would blur the distinction, such as a materialistic or semi-pantheistic account of the soul’s derivation.
   - Insists that human nature, including the soul, is wholly dependent on God’s sovereign act.
   - Frames anthropology within the context of God’s covenantal lordship.
   - "The Creator-creature distinction is basic to all Christian doctrine." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Doctrine of man is covenantal**
   - Human beings are created as covenantal image-bearers, not autonomous individuals.
   - The soul’s origin must be understood in light of man’s covenantal relationship to God.
   - Both traducianism and creationism must be evaluated for their covenantal implications.
   - Anthropology is inseparable from the doctrine of revelation.
   - "Man is always and everywhere in covenant relation to God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Revelation is the ultimate authority**
   - Scripture alone provides the norm for doctrinal formulation, including the question of the soul’s origin.
   - Human reason is subordinate to the self-attesting revelation of God.
   - Both traducianism and creationism must be tested by biblical teaching, not philosophical speculation.
   - The mystery of the soul’s origin is ultimately subject to God’s revealed will.
   - "We must subject all our thought to the authority of Scripture." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Sin and the transmission of depravity**
   - The doctrine of original sin is central to understanding the soul’s origin.
   - Traducianism is often favored for its explanation of the transmission of depravity, but Van Til insists the real issue is covenantal representation.
   - The imputation of Adam’s sin is a judicial act, not merely a biological or psychological process.
   - The mode of the soul’s origin must not undermine the doctrine of federal headship.
   - "The problem of original sin is not solved by a theory of the soul’s origin, but by the covenantal structure of Scripture." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Presuppositional method shapes anthropology**
   - All doctrines, including the origin of the soul, must be constructed presuppositionally, beginning with the triune God.
   - Rejects any attempt to answer anthropological questions on autonomous philosophical grounds.
   - The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought extends to views of human nature.
   - Theological method determines the acceptability of traducianism or creationism.
   - "We must begin our theology with the self-attesting Christ of Scripture, not with man." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the traducianism versus creationism debate is significant for its insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the necessity of a **covenantal, revelational framework** for anthropology. His presuppositional method has influenced generations of Reformed theologians to approach questions of the soul’s origin with a rigorous commitment to biblical authority and theological method. While he did not resolve the debate, Van Til’s legacy is a robust call to ground all anthropological doctrines in the self-attesting revelation of the triune God.
