# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema addressed the debate between **traducianism** and **creationism** within the context of a Reformed understanding of **anthropology**. He leaned toward **creationism**, emphasizing the direct creation of each human soul by God, while also acknowledging the complexity of the biblical data and the importance of the unity of the human person. Hoekema’s approach sought to uphold the **dignity of the human soul** and the **doctrine of original sin** within a holistic, biblical framework.

- "The most satisfactory view seems to be that the soul of each individual is directly created by God, but that this creation is so closely linked with the process of procreation that the unity of the human person is preserved." (Created in God’s Image, p. 220)

## Key Works

- Created in God’s Image (1986)
- The Christian Looks at Himself (1975)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "Traducianism or Creationism?" in Baker’s Dictionary of Theology (1960)
- Saved by Grace (1989)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Unity of the Human Person**
   - Emphasizes that humans are a psychosomatic unity, not a dualistic composite.
   - Argues that both body and soul are essential to true humanity.
   - Rejects any view that would diminish the importance of either aspect.
   - Sees the unity of personhood as vital for understanding **original sin** and redemption.
   - "Man is not a soul imprisoned in a body, but a unity of body and soul." (Created in God’s Image, p. 209)

2. **Preference for Creationism of the Soul**
   - Holds that each human soul is directly created by God at conception or birth.
   - Sees this view as best preserving the dignity and uniqueness of each person.
   - Argues that creationism avoids the materialistic implications of traducianism.
   - Maintains that God’s ongoing creative activity is consistent with biblical teaching.
   - "The soul cannot be derived from the parents, but must be created by God." (Created in God’s Image, p. 220)

3. **Recognition of Traducianism’s Strengths**
   - Acknowledges that traducianism better explains the transmission of **original sin**.
   - Notes that traducianism emphasizes the solidarity of the human race.
   - Sees some biblical texts (e.g., Hebrews 7:9–10) as supportive of a generational connection.
   - Admits that traducianism avoids the problem of God creating sinful souls.
   - "Traducianism has the advantage of explaining the inheritance of original sin." (Created in God’s Image, p. 219)

4. **Commitment to Biblical Authority**
   - Insists that any view must be grounded in the teaching of Scripture.
   - Critiques both traducianism and creationism where they go beyond biblical data.
   - Urges caution in speculative anthropology.
   - Seeks a position that harmonizes with the overall biblical narrative.
   - "We must be careful not to go beyond what Scripture actually teaches." (Created in God’s Image, p. 218)

5. **Emphasis on the Image of God**
   - Asserts that both body and soul are included in the **imago Dei**.
   - Argues that the image of God is not limited to the soul alone.
   - Maintains that the creation of the soul is part of God’s purpose for humanity.
   - Connects the image of God to the holistic nature of redemption in Christ.
   - "The image of God embraces the whole person, body and soul." (Created in God’s Image, p. 74)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s careful engagement with the traducianism vs creationism debate has shaped contemporary Reformed **anthropology**, especially in his insistence on the unity of the human person and the dignity of the soul. His nuanced preference for creationism, balanced by recognition of traducianism’s strengths, has provided a model for theological humility and biblical fidelity. Hoekema’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a biblically grounded and theologically robust understanding of human origins and the transmission of **original sin**.
