# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading biblical theologian whose work on **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** centers on the interpretation of Genesis 1–2 and its fulfillment in Christ and the church. He emphasizes the **eschatological trajectory** of the **image of God**, arguing that humanity’s original calling to subdue and cultivate the earth finds its ultimate realization in the new creation. Beale’s approach integrates **biblical theology**, **typology**, and the continuity between the **first Adam** and the **last Adam**.

- "Adam’s commission to subdue and rule the earth was a mandate to extend the boundaries of the garden to the ends of the earth." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology", p. 30)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Culture Mandate as Temple Expansion**
   - Humanity’s original vocation is to extend the sacred space of Eden throughout the earth.
   - The **garden-temple** is the archetype for God’s dwelling with humanity.
   - Adam and Eve are portrayed as priest-kings, mediating God’s presence.
   - The mandate is not merely cultural but fundamentally theological and eschatological.
   - "The commission to 'fill the earth and subdue it' is essentially a call to expand the temple of God’s presence." ("The Temple and the Church’s Mission", p. 81)

2. **Image of God and Eschatological Dominion**
   - The **image of God** entails a royal-priestly function tied to dominion.
   - Adam’s failure is rectified in Christ, the true image and last Adam.
   - Dominion is not abolished but reoriented toward new creation in Christ.
   - The church participates in this vocation through union with Christ.
   - "The image of God is restored and consummated in Christ, who fulfills the original mandate." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology", p. 32)

3. **Typological Fulfillment in Christ and the Church**
   - The Old Testament culture mandate is typologically fulfilled in Jesus.
   - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new creation and global temple expansion.
   - The church, as Christ’s body, continues the mission to fill the earth with God’s glory.
   - Typology links Adam, Israel, and the church in a unified redemptive-historical pattern.
   - "Jesus is the last Adam who accomplishes what the first Adam failed to do." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology", p. 33)

4. **Mission as Extension of God’s Presence**
   - The Great Commission echoes the original culture mandate.
   - Evangelism and discipleship are means of extending God’s presence worldwide.
   - The church’s mission is both spiritual and cultural, rooted in biblical theology.
   - The ultimate goal is the consummation of God’s dwelling with humanity in the new creation.
   - "The church’s mission is to expand the temple of God’s presence to the ends of the earth." ("God Dwells Among Us", p. 16)

5. **Continuity and Consummation in New Creation**
   - The original mandate is not abrogated but consummated in the eschaton.
   - New creation is the telos of humanity’s vocation and dominion.
   - The restoration of all things involves the renewal of both humanity and creation.
   - The biblical narrative moves from Eden to the New Jerusalem, fulfilling the culture mandate.
   - "The new creation is the ultimate fulfillment of the commission given to Adam and Eve." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology", p. 34)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s biblical-theological approach has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the **culture mandate** and its fulfillment in Christ and the church. His work has influenced Reformed and evangelical scholarship by highlighting the **temple motif** and the eschatological dimensions of human vocation. Beale’s integration of Old and New Testament themes has provided a robust framework for understanding the continuity of God’s purposes from creation to new creation. His insights continue to inform discussions on mission, vocation, and the role of the church in the world.
