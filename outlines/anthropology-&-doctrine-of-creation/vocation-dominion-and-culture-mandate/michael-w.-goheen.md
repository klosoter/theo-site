# Michael W. Goheen (1952– )

Michael W. Goheen emphasizes the centrality of the **creation mandate** (or **cultural mandate**) in the biblical narrative, viewing **vocation** and **dominion** as essential to humanity’s identity and mission. He interprets the mandate of Genesis 1:26–28 as foundational for understanding the church’s participation in **God’s mission** to renew all of creation, integrating faith and life in every sphere of **culture**.

- "The cultural mandate is not abrogated but finds its fulfillment in the mission of God’s people to bear witness to the coming kingdom in every area of life." (A Light to the Nations)

## Key Works

- The Drama of Scripture: Finding Our Place in the Biblical Story (with Craig Bartholomew)
- Living at the Crossroads: An Introduction to Christian Worldview (with Craig Bartholomew)
- A Light to the Nations: The Missional Church and the Biblical Story
- The Church and Its Vocation: Lesslie Newbigin’s Missionary Ecclesiology (with Timothy Sheridan)
- “The Missional Church: Ecclesiological Implications of the Cultural Mandate” (various articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Cultural Mandate as Foundational**
    - Humanity’s original calling is to exercise **dominion** and develop culture under God’s authority.
    - The mandate is not negated by the fall but is distorted and in need of redemption.
    - The church’s mission is rooted in this original vocation, now reoriented in Christ.
    - All of life—work, art, politics, family—is included in the scope of God’s redemptive purposes.
    - "The cultural mandate is the original commission given to humanity, and it continues to shape the church’s mission in the world." (The Drama of Scripture)

2. **Vocation as Participation in God’s Mission**
    - Every believer’s daily work is a participation in God’s ongoing creative and redemptive activity.
    - Vocation is not limited to church or “spiritual” work but encompasses all legitimate human labor.
    - The Christian’s calling is to witness to the **kingdom of God** in every sphere of life.
    - Work is a means of loving neighbor and stewarding creation.
    - "Our vocation is to be a sign, instrument, and foretaste of the kingdom in all of life." (Living at the Crossroads)

3. **Dominion as Stewardship, Not Exploitation**
    - Dominion means responsible stewardship, not domination or abuse of creation.
    - Humanity is called to care for and develop the earth in ways that reflect God’s character.
    - Ecological responsibility is a theological imperative rooted in the creation mandate.
    - The misuse of dominion is a result of sin, not God’s original intent.
    - "Dominion is a call to serve and preserve, not to exploit or destroy." (A Light to the Nations)

4. **Redemption Restores the Creation Mandate**
    - In Christ, the original mandate is renewed and redirected toward the coming **new creation**.
    - The church is empowered by the Spirit to live out its vocation in anticipation of the kingdom.
    - Redemption does not remove Christians from cultural engagement but sends them into the world.
    - The biblical story moves from creation to new creation, with the cultural mandate as a thread throughout.
    - "Redemption is not the abandonment of creation, but its renewal and fulfillment." (The Drama of Scripture)

5. **Mission as Integral, Not Merely Spiritual**
    - The church’s mission includes both proclamation and demonstration of the gospel in all of life.
    - Social, cultural, and economic engagement are essential aspects of Christian witness.
    - The sacred-secular divide is rejected; all of life is under Christ’s lordship.
    - The church is a community sent to embody God’s purposes for creation.
    - "Mission is not an activity of the church, but the very essence of its identity in the world." (A Light to the Nations)

## Legacy and Impact

Goheen’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of the **missional church** and the integration of faith and culture. His emphasis on the **creation mandate** has encouraged Christians to see their daily work and cultural engagement as central to God’s redemptive plan. By rooting vocation and dominion in the biblical narrative, Goheen has helped recover a holistic vision of Christian mission that bridges the gap between church and world. His writings continue to influence pastors, theologians, and laypeople seeking to live out the gospel in every area of life.
