# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust understanding of the **creation mandate** (or **cultural mandate**) as foundational to human **vocation** and **dominion**. He emphasized that humanity’s calling to exercise **dominion over creation** is rooted in the image of God and persists through redemptive history, finding renewed significance in the context of **covenant theology**.

- "The cultural mandate is not abrogated by the fall but is rather given new direction and purpose in redemption." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Principles of Conduct: Aspects of Biblical Ethics
- The Epistle to the Romans (especially commentary on Romans 8)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- "The Christian Ethic" (essay in Collected Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation Mandate as Enduring**
   - The **cultural mandate** given in Genesis 1:26–28 remains binding for all humanity.
   - The fall did not annul the responsibility to exercise **dominion** and stewardship.
   - Human vocation is fundamentally tied to being made in the **image of God**.
   - The mandate is not merely pre-fall but is reaffirmed in the Noahic covenant.
   - "The mandate to subdue the earth and have dominion over it is not rescinded by sin." (Principles of Conduct)

2. **Vocation and Image of God**
   - Human vocation is grounded in the unique status of humanity as image-bearers.
   - Work and cultural development are intrinsic to human identity.
   - The exercise of dominion is a reflection of God’s sovereignty.
   - The image of God includes ethical, rational, and relational dimensions.
   - "Man’s vocation is inseparable from his being created in the image of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Redemptive Reorientation of Dominion**
   - Redemption in Christ restores and reorients the original mandate.
   - Believers are called to fulfill the cultural mandate in light of the **kingdom of God**.
   - The eschatological hope includes the renewal of creation and human vocation.
   - The church models renewed dominion through service and stewardship.
   - "Redemption does not annul the original mandate but brings it to its true fulfillment." (Principles of Conduct)

4. **Covenant Context of the Mandate**
   - The cultural mandate is situated within the broader framework of **covenant theology**.
   - The Noahic covenant universalizes the mandate after the flood.
   - The Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants further specify the ethical dimensions of vocation.
   - The new covenant in Christ brings the mandate to its eschatological goal.
   - "The cultural mandate is covenantal in character, finding its continuity and fulfillment in God’s redemptive purposes." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Ethical Implications for Culture**
   - Christian engagement with culture is a moral obligation, not optional.
   - Work, science, and the arts are legitimate spheres of dominion under God’s law.
   - The antithesis between believer and unbeliever shapes cultural activity but does not negate common grace.
   - The Christian’s vocation is to witness to Christ’s lordship in every sphere.
   - "The Christian ethic demands responsible stewardship in all cultural endeavors." (Principles of Conduct)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s articulation of the **cultural mandate** has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions on vocation, work, and the Christian’s role in society. His insistence on the enduring validity of the creation mandate, coupled with a strong covenantal framework, has influenced generations of theologians and ethicists. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate **biblical theology** with practical engagement in culture and the world.
