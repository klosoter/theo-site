# Craig Bartholomew (1961– )

Craig Bartholomew is a leading voice in the recovery of a robust, biblical theology of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate**. He emphasizes the integral relationship between **creation**, **human flourishing**, and the call to participate in God’s purposes for the world, arguing that the **Genesis mandate** grounds Christian engagement with all spheres of life.

- "The cultural mandate is not abrogated but rather reaffirmed and transformed in Christ." ("Where Mortals Dwell")

## Key Works

- Where Mortals Dwell: A Christian View of Place for Today
- The Drama of Scripture (with Michael Goheen)
- Living at the Crossroads (with Michael Goheen)
- Beyond the Modern Age (with Bob Goudzwaard)
- Introducing Biblical Hermeneutics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation as Foundational for Vocation**
    - Human vocation is rooted in the **imago Dei** and the goodness of creation.
    - The **culture mandate** in Genesis 1:26–28 calls humanity to steward and develop creation.
    - Creation is not merely a backdrop but the arena of God’s redemptive work.
    - The affirmation of creation shapes Christian engagement with work, culture, and society.
    - "Creation is the context within which all human vocation unfolds." (Where Mortals Dwell)

2. **Vocation as Participation in God’s Mission**
    - All of life is to be lived **coram Deo**, before the face of God.
    - Vocation is not restricted to church or ministry but encompasses all legitimate work.
    - Human work participates in God’s ongoing care and development of creation.
    - The **missio Dei** frames vocation as service to God’s kingdom purposes.
    - "Our work is a means by which God’s purposes are worked out in the world." (The Drama of Scripture)

3. **Dominion as Responsible Stewardship**
    - Dominion is not domination but **stewardship** and care for creation.
    - Humanity is called to reflect God’s character in exercising authority over the earth.
    - Abuse of creation is a distortion of the original mandate.
    - Stewardship includes ecological, social, and cultural dimensions.
    - "True dominion is always exercised in the service of life and flourishing." (Where Mortals Dwell)

4. **Culture Mandate and Redemption**
    - The **culture mandate** persists after the Fall and is renewed in Christ.
    - Redemption does not negate creation but restores and fulfills its purposes.
    - Christian cultural engagement is grounded in both creation and redemption.
    - The church is called to witness to the renewal of all things in Christ.
    - "In Christ, the original calling to cultivate and care for the earth is reaffirmed and transformed." (Living at the Crossroads)

5. **Holistic Vision of Human Flourishing**
    - Human flourishing involves spiritual, social, and material dimensions.
    - The biblical vision resists dualism between sacred and secular.
    - Vocation is integral to personal and communal well-being.
    - The **kingdom of God** encompasses all areas of life, not just the religious sphere.
    - "God’s kingdom vision embraces the whole of creation and every aspect of human life." (The Drama of Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Bartholomew’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the **theology of vocation** and the integration of faith and culture. His emphasis on the **culture mandate** and holistic stewardship has influenced evangelical approaches to work, ecology, and public life. By rooting Christian mission in the narrative of creation and redemption, he has provided a compelling framework for engaging the world in light of God’s purposes. His scholarship continues to inspire renewed attention to the biblical foundations for human calling and cultural engagement.
