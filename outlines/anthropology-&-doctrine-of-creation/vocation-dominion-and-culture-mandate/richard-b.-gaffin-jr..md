# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of **redemptive history** and **union with Christ**. He emphasizes that the original mandate given to humanity in Genesis is reframed and fulfilled in the work of Christ, and that Christian vocation is now shaped by participation in the new creation. For Gaffin, the believer’s engagement with culture is inseparable from the eschatological reality inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection.

- "The cultural mandate is not abrogated but is now to be carried out in the context of Christ’s redemptive work and the coming new creation." (Creation and Consummation)

## Key Works

- "Creation and Consummation" in *Living in the Light of the Resurrection*
- *Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology*
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on the Structure of Biblical Ethics" in *Theonomy: A Reformed Critique*
- *By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation*
- "The Sabbath: A Sign of Hope" in *Pressing Toward the Mark*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Reframing of the Culture Mandate**
   - The original **dominion mandate** is not set aside but is transformed by Christ’s redemptive work.
   - Human vocation is now oriented toward the **eschatological new creation**.
   - The mandate is fulfilled in Christ, who is the true image and last Adam.
   - Christian cultural activity is to be understood within the already/not yet tension of the kingdom.
   - "The first Adam’s task finds its realization only in the second Adam’s accomplishment." (Creation and Consummation)

2. **Union with Christ as the Foundation of Vocation**
   - Believers’ vocation is grounded in their **union with Christ**.
   - All legitimate human work participates in the resurrection life of Christ.
   - Vocation is not merely secular but is sanctified by the Spirit.
   - The Christian’s calling is both present and anticipatory of the consummation.
   - "Union with Christ is the central reality from which all Christian vocation flows." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Dominion**
   - Dominion is now defined by service and suffering in imitation of Christ.
   - The resurrection redefines the goal of human labor and cultural engagement.
   - The ultimate fulfillment of dominion awaits the consummation at Christ’s return.
   - Present cultural efforts are provisional and point forward to the new creation.
   - "Our present labors are not in vain because they are caught up in the resurrection hope." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity with the Original Mandate**
   - There is continuity: the creation mandate still applies to humanity.
   - There is discontinuity: the Fall and redemption in Christ reshape its meaning and application.
   - The church’s mission is not identical with the original cultural mandate.
   - The focus shifts from earthly dominion to participation in Christ’s heavenly reign.
   - "The church’s calling is not to bring in the kingdom but to witness to its coming in Christ." (Theonomy and Eschatology)

5. **Sabbath as a Sign of Eschatological Rest**
   - The Sabbath points to the ultimate rest and fulfillment of the culture mandate.
   - Christian vocation is lived in anticipation of this eschatological rest.
   - The Sabbath is both a sign of creation and of new creation in Christ.
   - Observance of the Sabbath shapes the believer’s approach to work and culture.
   - "The Sabbath is a sign that our work finds its meaning in God’s completed work in Christ." (The Sabbath: A Sign of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s redemptive-historical approach has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions on the **culture mandate**, vocation, and dominion. His emphasis on **union with Christ** and the eschatological transformation of human calling has influenced generations of pastors and theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. Gaffin’s work continues to challenge simplistic views of Christian cultural engagement, urging the church to see all of life in light of Christ’s resurrection and the coming new creation.
