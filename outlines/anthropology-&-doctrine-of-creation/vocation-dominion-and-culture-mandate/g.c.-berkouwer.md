# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** with a strong emphasis on the relationship between **creation**, **human responsibility**, and **redemption**. He argued that the **imago Dei** grounds humanity’s calling to exercise stewardship over creation, but insisted that this mandate must be understood in light of the reality of **sin** and the hope of **restoration in Christ**.

- "The calling of man is not an autonomous task, but one that is always related to the Creator and the meaning of creation." (Man: The Image of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Vocation as Derived from the Imago Dei**
    - Humanity’s **vocation** is rooted in being created in the image of God.
    - The image of God entails both relational and functional aspects, including stewardship.
    - Human calling is always oriented toward God and His purposes.
    - The fall distorts but does not erase the original vocation.
    - "The image of God is not a static possession but a calling to reflect God’s will in the world." (Man: The Image of God)

2. **Dominion as Responsible Stewardship**
    - Dominion is not autonomous rule but **responsible stewardship** under God’s authority.
    - The **culture mandate** is fulfilled through service, not exploitation.
    - Human dominion is always accountable to the Creator’s intent for creation.
    - Redemption in Christ reorients dominion toward its true purpose.
    - "Dominion is not the right to rule as one pleases, but the responsibility to serve according to God’s command." (Man: The Image of God)

3. **The Culture Mandate in Light of Sin**
    - The **culture mandate** is affected by the entrance of sin into the world.
    - Human efforts at culture-building are marked by both potential and distortion.
    - The mandate remains, but is now subject to frustration and futility.
    - Redemption does not abolish the mandate but renews its direction.
    - "Sin does not destroy the mandate, but it does make its fulfillment problematic and in need of grace." (Sin)

4. **Redemption and the Renewal of Vocation**
    - Christ’s work restores the true meaning of human vocation and dominion.
    - The **renewal of creation** is integral to the gospel’s scope.
    - Believers are called to live out the culture mandate in anticipation of final restoration.
    - Redemption is cosmic, affecting all aspects of human calling.
    - "Redemption in Christ is not an escape from creation, but the renewal of man’s calling within it." (General Revelation)

5. **Providence and the Ongoing Significance of Creation**
    - God’s providence sustains the ongoing relevance of the culture mandate.
    - Human history unfolds under God’s sovereign guidance.
    - The significance of daily work and cultural engagement is affirmed.
    - Eschatological hope shapes present obedience in vocation and dominion.
    - "Providence means that God’s purpose for creation continues, even in a fallen world." (The Providence of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** helped shape Reformed discussions on the relationship between creation, fall, and redemption. His insistence on the enduring significance of the **imago Dei** and the need for responsible stewardship continues to influence contemporary theology. By integrating the doctrines of sin and redemption into the discussion of culture, Berkouwer provided a balanced framework for understanding Christian engagement with the world. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a theologically robust approach to human calling in the context of God’s redemptive plan.
