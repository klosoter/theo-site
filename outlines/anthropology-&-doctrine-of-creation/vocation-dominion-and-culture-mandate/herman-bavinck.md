# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust theology of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** as integral to the Christian life within the created order. He emphasized that humanity, as the image of God, is called to exercise responsible stewardship over creation, fulfilling the original mandate given in Genesis. Bavinck saw the **cultural mandate** not only as a pre-fall ordinance but as a continuing obligation, renewed and transformed in Christ.

- "The mandate to subdue the earth and have dominion over it is not abrogated by sin but is reaffirmed and deepened in Christ." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Culture Mandate as a Creation Ordinance**
    - The command to "fill the earth and subdue it" is foundational to human identity.
    - This mandate is rooted in humanity’s creation in the **image of God**.
    - It encompasses all spheres of life: work, family, science, and art.
    - The cultural mandate persists after the fall, though now affected by sin.
    - "The cultural mandate is not a temporary or secondary matter, but belongs to the essence of humanity as created by God." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 2)

2. **Vocation as Divine Calling**
    - Every legitimate occupation is a sphere of service to God.
    - **Vocation** is not limited to church ministry but includes all lawful work.
    - Work is a means of fulfilling the cultural mandate and loving neighbor.
    - God providentially orders each person’s place and task in society.
    - "In every calling, man is to serve God and neighbor, and thus fulfill his purpose." ("Essays on Religion, Science, and Society")

3. **Dominion as Stewardship, Not Exploitation**
    - Human dominion is a reflection of God’s kingship, exercised with responsibility.
    - Dominion involves care, preservation, and development of creation.
    - Abuse or neglect of creation is a violation of the divine mandate.
    - Stewardship is both a privilege and a duty, grounded in **creation theology**.
    - "Man is not the owner but the steward of the earth, responsible to God for its use." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 2)

4. **Redemption and the Renewal of the Mandate**
    - The work of Christ restores and renews the original cultural mandate.
    - Redemption does not negate creation but brings its purposes to fulfillment.
    - Christians are called to engage culture as agents of renewal and hope.
    - The eschatological hope includes the restoration of creation’s order.
    - "Grace restores nature, not by abolishing it, but by cleansing it from sin and bringing it to its true fulfillment." ("Reformed Dogmatics," vol. 3)

5. **Integration of Faith and Culture**
    - Faith is not restricted to the private or ecclesiastical sphere.
    - The Christian worldview shapes all cultural endeavors and institutions.
    - There is no dualism between sacred and secular in Bavinck’s thought.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief runs through all of culture.
    - "Christianity seeks to penetrate and sanctify all of life, not to withdraw from it." ("Essays on Religion, Science, and Society")

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s theology of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** has profoundly shaped Reformed approaches to culture, work, and public life. His insistence on the enduring validity of the cultural mandate has influenced Neo-Calvinist thought and inspired movements for Christian engagement in all spheres of society. Bavinck’s vision continues to challenge Christians to embrace their callings as stewards and culture-builders, integrating faith with every aspect of human endeavor.
