# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the original calling of humanity to exercise stewardship over creation under the sovereignty of God. He affirmed the enduring relevance of the **imago Dei** and the **creation mandate** (Genesis 1:28), while insisting that all human cultural activity must be subordinated to the redemptive work of Christ and the authority of Scripture.

- "Man is made in the image of God, and his vocation is to represent God in the world, ruling over it in God's name and for God's glory." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "Biblical and Theological Studies" (especially essays on creation and the image of God)
- "The Divine Origin of the Bible" (touches on the authority underlying human vocation)
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology" (discusses the unity of creation and redemption)
- "Calvin and Calvinism" (explores Calvin's view of vocation and dominion)
- "The Religious Life of Theological Students" (reflects on the calling and purpose of Christian vocation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Vocation as Divine Calling**
   - Human vocation is rooted in the **imago Dei** and God's original purpose for humanity.
   - All legitimate work is a response to God's command and is to be done for His glory.
   - The Christian's calling is both general (to serve God in all of life) and particular (in specific vocations).
   - Vocation is not secular or sacred in itself, but is sanctified by its orientation to God.
   - "Every lawful calling is a sphere in which the Christian may serve God." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Dominion as Stewardship**
   - Dominion over creation is not autonomous rule, but stewardship under God's authority.
   - The **creation mandate** is a charge to cultivate, preserve, and develop the world responsibly.
   - Human dominion is always accountable to the Creator and must reflect His character.
   - Abuse or neglect of creation is a distortion of the original mandate.
   - "Man is not the owner, but the steward of the world." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **The Culture Mandate Endures**
   - The command to "fill the earth and subdue it" remains in force after the Fall.
   - Redemption in Christ restores and reorients the culture mandate, not abolishing it.
   - Christian engagement in culture is a means of witnessing to God's lordship over all things.
   - The church must not withdraw from cultural activity, but participate as salt and light.
   - "The Christian is called to bring every thought and activity captive to Christ." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

4. **Integration of Creation and Redemption**
   - Warfield saw no dichotomy between the **creation mandate** and the work of redemption.
   - Christ's redemptive work renews the image of God and empowers true vocation.
   - The ultimate goal is the restoration of all things under Christ's lordship.
   - The Christian's cultural activity anticipates the consummation of God's kingdom.
   - "Creation and redemption are not antagonistic, but mutually interpretive." (The Idea of Systematic Theology)

5. **Scripture as Norm for Cultural Engagement**
   - All human cultural activity must be evaluated by the authority of Scripture.
   - The Bible provides principles for work, stewardship, and engagement with the world.
   - Warfield warned against both secularism and unbiblical withdrawal from culture.
   - The Christian's approach to vocation and dominion is shaped by the Word of God.
   - "The Scriptures furnish the only safe guide for the Christian in the world." (The Divine Origin of the Bible)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield's articulation of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** provided a robust theological foundation for later Reformed engagement with culture and work. His insistence on the unity of creation and redemption influenced neo-Calvinist thinkers and helped shape the doctrine of Christian stewardship. Warfield's legacy endures in discussions of the Christian's role in society, emphasizing that all of life is to be lived coram Deo, under the authority of Christ and His Word.
