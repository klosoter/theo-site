# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **culture mandate** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing humanity’s original calling to exercise **dominion over creation** as part of the **imago Dei**. He maintained that the ongoing fulfillment of the **creation mandate** remains integral to Christian life, even after the Fall, though now reframed by **redemption** in Christ.

- "The dominion over the creatures was given to man in the state of innocence, not only for necessity, but also for the exercise of virtue and the glory of God." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.10.6)

## Key Works

- Selected Questions on the Creation and Providence of God (in Institutes)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Creation Mandate is Perpetual**
   - The **culture mandate** given in Genesis 1:28 is not abrogated by the Fall.
   - Humanity remains called to **fruitfulness**, **multiplication**, and **dominion** over the earth.
   - The mandate is now fulfilled under the shadow of sin, requiring grace for its proper exercise.
   - The **imago Dei** grounds humanity’s ongoing responsibility toward creation.
   "The command to subdue the earth and have dominion is not merely ceremonial, but moral and perpetual." (Institutes, 5.10.7)

2. **Dominion is Delegated and Accountable**
   - Human dominion is a stewardship, not autonomous sovereignty.
   - All authority over creation is derived from God’s original grant.
   - Abuse of dominion is a violation of the divine order and purpose.
   - Dominion is exercised for the **glory of God** and the good of creation.
   "Man is not the lord of creation in his own right, but as a minister and steward of God." (Institutes, 5.10.8)

3. **Vocation Encompasses All of Life**
   - Every lawful calling is a sphere for serving God and neighbor.
   - The distinction between sacred and secular vocations is rejected.
   - Work is an expression of obedience to the creation mandate.
   - Vocation is dignified by its orientation to God’s providential purposes.
   "All honest callings are to be esteemed as divine vocations, in which men may serve God." (Institutes, 8.14.5)

4. **The Fall Corrupts but Does Not Erase the Mandate**
   - Sin distorts humanity’s exercise of dominion and vocation.
   - The creation mandate persists, but is now subject to frustration and futility.
   - Redemption in Christ restores the proper orientation to work and culture.
   - The Christian’s vocation is both a means of sanctification and witness.
   "Although the image of God was obscured by sin, the obligation to labor and cultivate remains." (Institutes, 5.10.9)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of the Mandate**
   - The ultimate realization of the culture mandate awaits the new creation.
   - Present obedience anticipates and participates in the coming restoration.
   - The redeemed exercise of dominion is a foretaste of eschatological glory.
   - The church models renewed humanity’s vocation in the world.
   "In the state of glory, the dominion of the saints will be perfected, as was intended from the beginning." (Institutes, 20.6.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **culture mandate** shaped later Reformed understandings of vocation, work, and the Christian’s engagement with society. His insistence on the enduring validity of the creation mandate influenced both Protestant social thought and the development of a theology of work. Turretin’s careful distinction between stewardship and autonomy in dominion continues to inform contemporary discussions on creation care and human responsibility. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the integration of faith and all of life.
