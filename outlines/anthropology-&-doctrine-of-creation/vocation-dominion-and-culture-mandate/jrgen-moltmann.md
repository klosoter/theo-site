# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of eschatological hope and the coming **Kingdom of God**. He reinterprets human vocation not as domination over creation but as participatory stewardship, emphasizing the renewal of creation and the anticipation of God's future. Moltmann’s theology challenges anthropocentric readings, calling the church to a transformative engagement with culture grounded in the promise of **new creation**.

- "The dominion of man over nature is not a license to exploit, but a commission to care for and anticipate the liberation of creation." ("God in Creation")

## Key Works

- "God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God"
- "Theology of Hope"
- "The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology"
- "Ethics of Hope"
- "The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Vocation**
   - Human vocation is defined by the anticipation of the **new creation**.
   - The church is called to embody signs of the coming **Kingdom of God** in the present.
   - Vocation is not static but oriented toward the future fulfillment of God’s promises.
   - Christian action in the world is shaped by hope in God’s ultimate renewal.
   - "Christian vocation is participation in the coming reality of God." ("Theology of Hope")

2. **Dominion as Stewardship, Not Exploitation**
   - Dominion is reinterpreted as responsible care for creation, not domination.
   - Humanity is called to serve creation’s flourishing in anticipation of its liberation.
   - The misuse of dominion leads to ecological crisis and alienation from God’s purposes.
   - True dominion reflects God’s own loving rule and self-giving.
   - "To rule means to serve the community of creation." ("God in Creation")

3. **Culture Mandate within the Spirit’s Renewal**
   - The **culture mandate** is fulfilled through the Spirit’s work in renewing all things.
   - Human creativity is a participation in God’s ongoing creation.
   - The Spirit empowers cultural transformation toward justice and peace.
   - The mandate is eschatologically oriented, aiming at the reconciliation of all things.
   - "The Spirit of God is the power of life, the source of renewal for creation and culture." ("The Spirit of Life")

4. **Critique of Anthropocentrism**
   - Moltmann rejects human-centered readings of Genesis, emphasizing the community of creation.
   - All creatures share in God’s purposes and are included in the hope of redemption.
   - The culture mandate is not a license for human supremacy but a call to relationality.
   - The church must resist cultural patterns that degrade creation.
   - "Creation is not for man alone, but for the glory of God and the community of all creatures." ("God in Creation")

5. **Hope as Motivation for Cultural Engagement**
   - Hope in the **resurrection** and **new creation** motivates transformative action.
   - Christian vocation involves resisting structures of oppression and ecological destruction.
   - The church is a sign and instrument of God’s future within history.
   - Cultural engagement is shaped by the vision of God’s promised future.
   - "Hope’s power is the power to begin anew, to anticipate the future in the present." ("Theology of Hope")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **creation care**, ecological ethics, and the church’s cultural engagement. By grounding the **culture mandate** in eschatological hope and the Spirit’s renewal, he offers a corrective to both secular and triumphalist Christian approaches. His work continues to inspire movements for justice, peace, and environmental stewardship, challenging the church to embody the hope of the coming **Kingdom** in every sphere of life.
