# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a robust doctrine of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** within the framework of **Reformed theology**. He emphasized that humanity’s original calling, as expressed in the creation account, was to exercise **stewardship** over creation under the sovereignty of God, integrating work and cultural development with the pursuit of God’s glory.

- "Man was made in the image of God, and invested with dominion over the earth, that he might subdue it and have it in subjection." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Image of God and Human Vocation**
    - Humanity is created in the **image of God**, which grounds human dignity and purpose.
    - The image includes rationality, morality, and the capacity for relationship with God.
    - Human vocation is to reflect God’s character through work and cultural engagement.
    - The **imago Dei** is not lost but marred by the Fall, retaining the basis for vocation.
    - "The image of God, in which man was created, consisted in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Dominion as Stewardship, Not Autonomy**
    - Dominion over creation is a delegated authority, not absolute ownership.
    - Humans are called to cultivate, preserve, and develop the earth responsibly.
    - Dominion is exercised under God’s law and for His glory.
    - Abuse or neglect of creation is a violation of the original mandate.
    - "Man’s dominion is not independent; it is always subordinate to the will of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **The Culture Mandate as a Continuing Obligation**
    - The command to "fill the earth and subdue it" remains binding after the Fall.
    - Cultural development—arts, sciences, and social order—is part of humanity’s calling.
    - Redemption in Christ restores and reorients the culture mandate toward God’s kingdom.
    - The church supports believers in fulfilling their cultural responsibilities.
    - "The original command to subdue the earth has never been revoked." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Work as a Means of Glorifying God**
    - All lawful vocations are honorable and avenues for serving God.
    - Work is not a result of the Fall but part of the original creation order.
    - Faithfulness in daily labor is a spiritual duty.
    - The distinction between sacred and secular work is ultimately artificial.
    - "Every occupation, if pursued in obedience to God, is a sphere for the exercise of religion." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Providence and the Ordering of Human Society**
    - God’s providence governs all aspects of human life, including vocation and culture.
    - Social institutions (family, government, economy) are ordained by God for human flourishing.
    - Christians are called to participate in society with integrity and justice.
    - The ultimate goal of culture is the manifestation of God’s glory in the world.
    - "All things are under the control of God, and are designed to promote his glory and the good of his people." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **culture mandate** shaped generations of Reformed thought on work, society, and the Christian’s role in the world. His emphasis on **dominion as stewardship** provided a theological foundation for later discussions on faith and culture, influencing both ecclesiastical and public spheres. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed engagement with questions of vocation, creation care, and the integration of faith and daily life.
