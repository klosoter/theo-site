# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline offered a distinctive interpretation of the **cultural mandate**, emphasizing its covenantal context and eschatological orientation. He argued that **vocation** and **dominion** were originally granted to humanity as part of the **creation covenant**, but that the Fall fundamentally altered the exercise and fulfillment of these tasks. For Kline, the **kingdom of God** and the **redemptive work of Christ** reframe the believer’s engagement with culture, subordinating the original mandate to the purposes of redemption.

- "The cultural mandate was not abrogated by the fall, but it is now fulfilled only through the redemptive kingdom." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Cultural Mandate as Covenant Administration**
    - The **cultural mandate** is embedded within the original creation covenant.
    - Humanity’s call to **dominion** and stewardship is a function of covenantal representation.
    - The mandate is not merely a general human task but is theologically situated in God’s sovereign purposes.
    - The exercise of dominion is always under divine authority and law.
    - "Man’s cultural task is a function of his covenantal status before God." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Eschatological Reorientation after the Fall**
    - The Fall introduces a distinction between the **common grace order** and the **redemptive order**.
    - The original mandate is not annulled but is now eschatologically fulfilled in Christ.
    - Human vocation in the post-Fall world is marked by frustration and futility apart from redemption.
    - The ultimate realization of dominion awaits the consummation of the kingdom.
    - "The hope of dominion is now realized only in the eschatological kingdom." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Two Kingdoms and Common Grace**
    - Kline distinguishes between the **common grace realm** (civil, cultural) and the **redemptive kingdom**.
    - The cultural mandate continues in the common grace sphere, but is not redemptive in itself.
    - The church’s primary calling is not cultural transformation but gospel proclamation.
    - Believers participate in both realms but must not confuse their purposes.
    - "The common grace order is not the kingdom of God, but the context for its advance." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Typology and the Sabbath Goal**
    - The original mandate pointed forward to a **Sabbath consummation**—rest in God’s completed kingdom.
    - Adam’s failure to achieve this goal necessitated a second Adam.
    - The typological structure of Scripture frames vocation and dominion as anticipations of Christ’s work.
    - The Sabbath rest is both the pattern and the promise for redeemed humanity.
    - "The Sabbath is the sign of the kingdom goal of the cultural mandate." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Dominion**
    - Jesus, as the true image and last Adam, fulfills the original mandate.
    - Believers’ vocation is now defined by union with Christ and participation in his reign.
    - Cultural activity is relativized and reoriented by the cross and resurrection.
    - The church’s mission is eschatological, not merely cultural.
    - "Christ is the one who brings the dominion mandate to its eschatological realization." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and eschatological approach to the **cultural mandate** has profoundly influenced Reformed biblical theology, especially in debates over the relationship between church and culture. His articulation of the **two kingdoms** doctrine and his emphasis on typology have shaped contemporary discussions on vocation, dominion, and the Christian’s role in society. While sometimes controversial, Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robustly biblical and covenantal framework for understanding human calling in the world.
