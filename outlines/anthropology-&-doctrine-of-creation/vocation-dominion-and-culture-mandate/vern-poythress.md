# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through a robustly biblical and Reformed lens, emphasizing the continuity between the original **creation mandate** and the Christian’s calling in Christ. He integrates **multiperspectivalism** to show how human work, stewardship, and cultural engagement reflect God’s purposes for creation and redemption. Poythress insists that all human activity is to be understood in light of God’s sovereignty and the lordship of Christ over every sphere.

- "The cultural mandate is not abrogated but transformed and fulfilled in Christ." (Redeeming Science)

## Key Works

- Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach (2006)
- Redeeming Sociology: A God-Centered Approach (2011)
- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses (1991)
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology (1987)
- “A Biblical View of Work” (Westminster Theological Journal, 1981)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Culture Mandate as Foundational**
   - The **creation mandate** of Genesis 1:28 grounds human responsibility for the world.
   - Dominion is not autonomous but exercised as stewardship under God’s authority.
   - Human vocation is integrally tied to imaging God in work and creativity.
   - The mandate persists after the Fall, though now affected by sin and requiring redemption.
   - "God’s command to fill and subdue the earth is a continuing obligation for humanity." (Redeeming Science)

2. **Christocentric Transformation of Vocation**
   - The work of Christ fulfills and transforms the original mandate.
   - Christian vocation is reoriented toward service in the kingdom of God.
   - Redemption restores and redirects human dominion toward God’s glory.
   - All cultural activity is to be submitted to the lordship of Christ.
   - "In Christ, the cultural mandate is renewed and finds its true direction." (Redeeming Science)

3. **Multiperspectival Approach to Human Calling**
   - Vocation is understood through normative (God’s law), situational (context), and existential (person) perspectives.
   - No single perspective exhausts the meaning of human work or dominion.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in understanding culture and vocation.
   - Multiperspectivalism encourages humility and dependence on Scripture.
   - "We must look at human calling from multiple angles to appreciate its fullness." (Symphonic Theology)

4. **Integration of Science, Culture, and Faith**
   - Scientific and cultural endeavors are legitimate expressions of the creation mandate.
   - Faith and obedience shape the way Christians engage in all spheres of life.
   - There is no sacred/secular divide; all work is under God’s sovereignty.
   - The pursuit of knowledge and culture is an act of worship and service.
   - "Science and culture are arenas for fulfilling the mandate God has given." (Redeeming Science)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Dominion**
   - The ultimate fulfillment of the culture mandate awaits the new creation.
   - Present efforts are provisional and anticipate the consummation in Christ.
   - Human dominion is perfected only in union with Christ and his kingdom.
   - Hope in the new creation motivates faithful cultural engagement now.
   - "Our present work points forward to the restoration and perfection of all things in Christ." (Redeeming Science)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the **culture mandate**, vocation, and the integration of faith with all of life. His **multiperspectivalism** has provided a flexible yet rigorous framework for understanding human calling in relation to God’s purposes. By emphasizing Christ’s lordship over every sphere, Poythress has encouraged Christians to pursue cultural engagement as a form of worship and stewardship. His influence is evident in the ongoing development of a holistic, theologically grounded approach to work, science, and culture within evangelical and Reformed circles.
