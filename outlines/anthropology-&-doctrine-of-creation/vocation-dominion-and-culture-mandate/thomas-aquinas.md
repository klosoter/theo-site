# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas grounds **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** in his synthesis of **natural law** and **creation theology**. He teaches that humans, created in the **image of God**, are called to exercise rational stewardship over creation, fulfilling their purpose through work, governance, and the cultivation of society in accordance with divine order.

- "Man is by nature a social animal, and so he naturally desires to live in a community." (Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q.94, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I-II, Q.94; II-II, Q.57–Q.66)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Regno (On Kingship)
- Commentary on Aristotle’s Politics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Vocation as Participation in Divine Order**
   - Humans are created to reflect God’s wisdom and goodness through their actions.
   - Vocation encompasses both contemplation (knowing God) and action (serving creation).
   - Every person has a specific role within the broader order of creation.
   - The fulfillment of vocation leads to both temporal and eternal flourishing.
   - "To live well is to work well, to show a good activity." (Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q.57, a.5)

2. **Dominion Rooted in the Image of God**
   - Human dominion over creation is derived from being made in God’s image.
   - Dominion is not absolute but is exercised under God’s ultimate sovereignty.
   - Proper dominion involves stewardship, not exploitation, of the created order.
   - The exercise of dominion is oriented toward the common good.
   - "The image of God in man is especially found in his mind, which is ordered to rule over the body and over other creatures." (Summa Theologiae, I, Q.93, a.4)

3. **The Culture Mandate as Natural Law**
   - The command to subdue the earth is embedded in the natural law accessible to all.
   - Human reason discerns the moral order and directs cultural activity accordingly.
   - The development of arts, sciences, and society fulfills the divine intention for creation.
   - The culture mandate is universal, binding on all people by virtue of their nature.
   - "The natural law is nothing else than the rational creature’s participation in the eternal law." (Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q.91, a.2)

4. **Work as a Means of Sanctification**
   - Labor is a fundamental aspect of human dignity and purpose.
   - Through work, humans cooperate with God in the ongoing ordering of creation.
   - Work is both a necessity of fallen existence and a means of spiritual growth.
   - The fruits of labor should serve both personal needs and the needs of others.
   - "By work man not only provides for his own needs but also for those of others." (Summa Theologiae, II-II, Q.187, a.3)

5. **Society and the Common Good**
   - Human flourishing is inseparable from life in community.
   - Laws and institutions should promote justice and the common good.
   - Political authority is ordained by God to order society toward virtue.
   - The culture mandate is realized through social cooperation and governance.
   - "The good of the many is more divine than the good of the individual." (Summa Contra Gentiles, III, 17)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s integration of **natural law**, vocation, and dominion has profoundly shaped Christian understandings of human purpose and the culture mandate. His thought provides a foundational framework for later Catholic social teaching and continues to influence discussions on the relationship between faith, work, and society. By rooting the call to cultivate and govern creation in both reason and revelation, Aquinas remains a central figure in debates about the theological basis for human cultural activity.
