# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm a robust doctrine of **vocation** grounded in the **creation mandate**. These confessions teach that human beings, created in the **image of God**, are called to exercise **dominion** over creation and to serve God in all spheres of life, including cultural activity. The documents emphasize that all legitimate work and cultural engagement are means by which believers glorify God and fulfill their original purpose.

- "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise Him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation Mandate as Foundational**
    - Humanity is created in the **image of God** to reflect His character in the world.
    - The mandate to "fill the earth and subdue it" is affirmed as a continuing obligation.
    - Work and cultural activity are seen as intrinsic to human purpose, not merely post-Fall necessities.
    - The confessions connect the creation mandate to the call to glorify God in all things.
    - "He has given them dominion over all creatures." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

2. **Vocation as Service to God**
    - All lawful vocations are dignified and serve as arenas for obedience to God.
    - Believers are called to serve God not only in worship but also in daily work.
    - The Catechism teaches that good works are the fruit of faith and gratitude.
    - Vocation is a means of loving neighbor and advancing the common good.
    - "That each one must serve his neighbor with the gifts he has received." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 55)

3. **Dominion Under God’s Sovereignty**
    - Human dominion is always exercised as stewardship, not autonomous rule.
    - The confessions stress that all authority and power are derived from God.
    - Dominion is to be exercised in righteousness and justice, reflecting God’s character.
    - Abuse of dominion is a result of the Fall and is contrary to the original mandate.
    - "He governs them so that they serve man, in order that man may serve God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 12)

4. **Cultural Engagement as a Christian Duty**
    - Christians are called to engage culture in a way that honors God’s law.
    - The confessions reject monastic withdrawal, affirming life in the world.
    - Cultural pursuits (arts, sciences, government) are legitimate and good.
    - The Lord’s Prayer petitions for God’s will to be done "on earth as it is in heaven," implying cultural transformation.
    - "Grant that everyone may carry out the duties of his office and calling as willingly and faithfully as the angels in heaven." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 124)

5. **Redemption Restores the Mandate**
    - Christ’s redemption renews believers in the image of God, enabling true obedience.
    - Good works and cultural activity are possible only by the Spirit’s regeneration.
    - The confessions teach that the restoration of the image includes renewed knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - Redemption does not abolish the creation mandate but empowers its fulfillment.
    - "We are renewed by the Holy Spirit after the image of God, that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for His blessing." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 86)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate**, emphasizing the integration of faith and life. Their teaching has encouraged generations of believers to pursue all lawful callings as service to God and neighbor, fostering a distinctive Reformed approach to cultural engagement. These confessions continue to inform contemporary discussions on the Christian’s role in society, grounding such engagement in the doctrines of creation, providence, and redemption.
