# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the integration of **lordship**, **covenant responsibility**, and the **normative, situational, and existential perspectives**. He sees the **cultural mandate** as an abiding call for humanity to exercise **godly dominion** under Christ’s lordship, shaping all of life—including work and culture—in obedience to God’s Word.

- "God calls us to serve him in every area of life, and that includes our work, our culture, and our stewardship of the world." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God
- "Toward a Theology of Work" (in The Doctrine of the Christian Life)
- Perspectives on the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Approach to Vocation**
   - Vocation is understood through the **normative** (God’s commands), **situational** (context and creation), and **existential** (the person called) perspectives.
   - All legitimate work is a response to God’s lordship and a means of fulfilling the cultural mandate.
   - The Christian’s calling integrates worship, obedience, and service in every sphere of life.
   - Frame rejects any sacred/secular divide, insisting all vocations are under Christ’s authority.
   - "There is no area of life where God’s norms do not apply." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Dominion as Covenant Stewardship**
   - Dominion is not autonomous rule but **covenantal stewardship** under God’s authority.
   - Humanity’s dominion is derivative, reflecting God’s kingship and care for creation.
   - The exercise of dominion is accountable to God’s revealed will in Scripture.
   - Abuse of dominion is a distortion of the original mandate and contrary to biblical ethics.
   - "Our dominion is always under God’s dominion." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **The Culture Mandate as Perpetual Obligation**
   - The **culture mandate** (Genesis 1:28) remains binding after the Fall, though affected by sin.
   - Christians are called to engage and transform culture in obedience to Christ.
   - The mandate is fulfilled in Christ, who restores and reorients human vocation.
   - Cultural development is a means of glorifying God and loving neighbor.
   - "The cultural mandate is not abrogated but fulfilled in Christ." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Integration of Ethics and Worship**
   - All cultural activity is fundamentally ethical and an act of worship.
   - Work and vocation are arenas for loving God and neighbor according to biblical norms.
   - Frame emphasizes that ethical obedience is inseparable from true worship.
   - The Christian’s life in the world is a holistic response to God’s grace and command.
   - "Obedience in our work is part of our worship." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Christ’s Lordship Over All of Life**
   - Christ’s lordship extends to every sphere, including work, culture, and society.
   - No aspect of human life is religiously neutral; all is claimed by Christ.
   - The Christian’s vocation is to serve Christ in every calling and context.
   - Frame’s theology insists on the comprehensive scope of redemption and obedience.
   - "Jesus is Lord of every area of life, not just the so-called religious ones." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **triperspectivalism** and his insistence on the unity of ethics, worship, and vocation have significantly shaped contemporary Reformed thought on the **culture mandate**. His work has encouraged Christians to see all of life—including work, cultural engagement, and stewardship—as lived under Christ’s comprehensive lordship. Frame’s influence is evident in the integration of theology and practical living, challenging the sacred/secular divide and equipping believers for faithful presence in the world.
