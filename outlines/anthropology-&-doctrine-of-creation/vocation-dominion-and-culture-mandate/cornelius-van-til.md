# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of **Reformed epistemology** and **covenantal theology**. He emphasized that human cultural activity must be understood as a response to God’s original command in creation, always in the context of the antithesis between belief and unbelief. For Van Til, all human endeavors—including work, science, and culture—are fundamentally religious and must be interpreted within the framework of **redemptive history**.

- "All cultural activity is, at bottom, religious activity." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- Christian-Theistic Ethics
- Essays on Christian Education
- A Christian Theory of Knowledge
- Common Grace and the Gospel

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Culture Mandate is Theologically Grounded**
    - The **creation mandate** is rooted in God’s sovereign command to humanity in Genesis.
    - Human vocation is not autonomous but derivative of God’s lordship.
    - Cultural activity is a form of obedience or disobedience to God’s covenant.
    - The mandate is inseparable from the broader context of **redemptive history**.
    - "Man’s task is to interpret and subdue the world in obedience to God’s command." (Christian-Theistic Ethics)

2. **Antithesis Shapes Cultural Engagement**
    - There is a fundamental divide between the regenerate and unregenerate in their approach to culture.
    - All cultural activity is shaped by either submission to or rebellion against God.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** distort human vocation apart from grace.
    - Christian cultural engagement must be self-consciously distinct from secular approaches.
    - "There is no neutrality; every act of culture is either for or against Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Vocation as Covenant Service**
    - Work is a means of fulfilling humanity’s covenantal responsibilities.
    - Every vocation is an arena for serving God’s kingdom purposes.
    - The sacred-secular divide is rejected; all legitimate work is spiritual.
    - Vocation is a sphere for manifesting the lordship of Christ.
    - "Every calling is to be performed as service to the covenant God." (Essays on Christian Education)

4. **Dominion is Stewardship, Not Autonomy**
    - Human dominion is always under God’s authority, not independent.
    - Stewardship implies responsibility and accountability to the Creator.
    - Dominion is exercised in dependence on God’s revelation.
    - The abuse of dominion is a result of the fall and human sinfulness.
    - "Man is to rule the earth, but only as a vicegerent of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Redemptive Reorientation of Culture**
    - The fall distorts but does not erase the culture mandate.
    - In Christ, the mandate is restored and redirected toward God’s glory.
    - Redemption renews the possibility of true cultural obedience.
    - The church is called to witness to the lordship of Christ in every sphere.
    - "Redemption restores man to his proper place as God’s image-bearer in culture." (Common Grace and the Gospel)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **culture mandate** has profoundly shaped Reformed thinking about vocation and cultural engagement, especially through his emphasis on the antithesis and the covenantal nature of all human activity. His insistence that all culture is fundamentally religious has influenced generations of Christian philosophers and apologists. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of **presuppositional apologetics** and in the robust engagement of Reformed thinkers with issues of work, science, and society.
