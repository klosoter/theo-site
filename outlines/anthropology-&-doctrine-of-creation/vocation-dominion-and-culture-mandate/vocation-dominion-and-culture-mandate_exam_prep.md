### TITLE
From Adamic Vicegerency to Pilgrim Witness: Reframing Vocation, Dominion, and the Culture Mandate in a Covenantal Key

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the Adamic commission to exercise **dominion** orders human **vocation** within God’s **creation covenant**, how it persists under **Noahic** preservation and is reoriented by Christ’s kingdom and the **Great Commission**, and what this means for culture, church, and eschatology.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Abraham Kuyper, Meredith G. Kline, David VanDrunen.
- Relevant traditions: Augustinian two cities, Lutheran vocation and two kingdoms, Reformed **federal theology** with Dutch neo-Calvinism, twentieth-century Reformed developments in **common grace**, **sphere sovereignty**, and **two kingdoms** retrieval.
- Debates:
  - Internal: neo-Calvinist transformation vs **two kingdoms** and Klinean **intrusion ethics**; tensions around **common grace** and **antithesis**; rejection or recalibration of **theonomy**.
  - External: Roman Catholic nature–grace and natural law; Anabaptist separatism; liberal Protestant social gospel; secular humanist and technocratic visions of dominion.
  - Contemporary: technology and ecological stewardship; vocation and identity in late capitalism; political polarization and religious liberty; eschatology of culture and the fate of cultural artifacts.
- Position defended: The **culture mandate** abides as creational law for all humanity under the **Noahic covenant** by **common grace**, while the church as institution is ordered by the **Great Commission**; Christians engage cultural labor as cruciform **vicegerency** and neighbor love, rejecting **theonomy** and triumphalist utopianism, yet resisting quietism through eschatologically hopeful stewardship.

### ESSAY
Vocation, dominion, and the culture mandate name a single complex: the appointment of humanity as royal priests to cultivate and order the world in service to God, the ethical shape of that labor, and its relation to the economy of redemption. Genesis gives the basic grammar. Humanity is created in the **image of God** to be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, and rule over living things. The text conjoins gift and task: the world is good, structured, and teleologically oriented to Sabbath, yet unfinished, inviting cultured care. Genesis 2 clarifies that this rule is priestly stewardship, to work and keep the garden, the same verbs later used for Levitical guardianship. Dominion is not predatory extraction but ordered service of God and neighbor, a derivative **vicegerency**. The work is covenantal: embedded in a **creation covenant** in which life is promised upon obedient fidelity, and guarded by law that prohibits autonomous grasping. The Sabbath discloses dominion’s end, rest in God, which makes all labor liturgical and limits it. The fall corrupts but does not erase these structures. The ground yields thorns; the heart seeks to make work an idol; dominion bends into domination. Yet God stabilizes common life in the **Noahic covenant**, a universal covenant of preservation that secures seasons, restrains violence, and reaffirms human rule by delegating the sword so that cultural life may continue until the end. Redemption does not abolish creation’s task but rescues its agents and reorders their loves. Christ the last Adam secures the eschatological Sabbath, pours out the Spirit, and commissions a people to make disciples of all nations, which is a distinctly ecclesial mission that sanctifies but does not collapse into the broader culture mandate.

Augustine contends that two loves made two cities. The earthly city is defined by the love of self to the contempt of God, the heavenly by the love of God to the contempt of self. This antithesis is not a spatial separation but a moral orientation that runs through shared institutions. Augustine receives Genesis as assurance that created goods are really good and really ordered, yet only rightly used when subordinated to the supreme good. He sets dominion within an ordo amoris. The fall’s punishment means that dominion often requires coercive authority to preserve a fragile peace. Temporal peace is itself a good, penultimate but necessary for the pilgrimage of the heavenly city. Augustine’s political theology thus refuses utopias while validating public responsibilities as ordered loves. His stance anticipates later **two kingdoms** reasoning by distinguishing the pilgrim church’s spiritual ends from the civil order’s proximate goods, while guarding them by one divine providence. Objections that Augustinian two cities nihilates culture misunderstand his doctrine of use and enjoyment. Cultural arts can be used for the heavenly end, as Israel plundered Egypt, but enjoyment attaches finally to God. Dominion in Augustine is not self-assertion but ministerial ordering toward peace, tempered by humility in a saeculum marked by ambiguity.

Luther recovers the dignity of everyday life by articulating a doctrine of **vocation**. Rejecting monastic superiority, he argues that God calls people to stations in family, economy, and polity, and that faithful service there is divine worship. Luther’s **two kingdoms** describes God’s single reign in two modes: by the gospel creating the church through Word and sacrament, and by law restraining evil in the civil realm. Because the gospel's rule does not arrive by coercion, Christians respect the distinctness of civil offices, and they love neighbors through their work, bearing the cross in the world. In Luther, the culture mandate is not a separate theological charter but the creational frame of callings through which God providentially sustains life. Against the charge of quietism, Luther insists that love works actively and that magistrates are called to justice. Against triumphalism, he denies that cultural success is the kingdom. One must emphasize in examination that Luther’s flattening of sacred and secular in terms of worth does not obliterate the institutional church’s unique mission. Public and private vocations are equally holy in service, but not interchangeable in function.

Calvin deepens this with a covenantal and ecclesial precision that remains decisive for Reformed accounts. Contextually a reformer of church and commonwealth in Geneva, Calvin reads creation and providence as conditions for the believer’s task. In the Institutes of the Christian Religion of 1559, he teaches that God adorns creation with gifts and distributes them widely, even among the ungodly, by **common grace** that restrains and enables. In doing so, he preserves and perfects the earlier insights of Augustine and Luther but with a clearer account of natural gifts and civil order. Calvin’s doctrine of **calling** assigns every believer a particular station as a theater to glorify God, tying contentment and diligence to God’s providential distribution. The fourth commandment in his catechesis frames work by **Sabbath** rest, a sign of eschatological communion that both limits labor and sanctifies it. Calvin’s two kingdoms language distinguishes the spiritual government of Christ in the church by his Word from the political order of human affairs, yet both stand under Christ’s kingship. This distinction is not dualism but an analytic tool to preserve the integrity of law and gospel. Calvin’s commentaries on Genesis construe dominion as stewardship, bounding human rule by neighbor love and creation’s telos. He affirms the legitimacy of wealth while denouncing avarice and luxury that dehumanize labor and oppress the poor. Under examination, one should resist caricatures that make Calvin the father of capitalist asceticism. He values arts and sciences as Spirit-given gifts across society and sees civil magistrates as servants of God to secure the external worship of God and administer justice, not as redeemers of culture.

Abraham Kuyper reframed the entire discussion for modernity by expanding Calvinism into a comprehensive life-system for a pluralist society. As theologian, journalist, and prime minister, Kuyper faced the rising secular state and ideologies of totalizing sovereignty. He introduced **sphere sovereignty**, the principle that God has structured social life into distinct spheres with their own creational law and norms, such as family, church, state, school, and business. No sphere is absolute; each is immediately under Christ’s lordship and indirectly related to the others. This preserved liberties against statist encroachment and overzealous ecclesiastical control. Kuyper also paired the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief with robust **common grace**, arguing that while sin radically pervades, God preserves and enables genuine cultural good among the unregenerate for the sake of history. In the Stone Lectures of 1898, he made the **culture mandate** central to Christian public life, insisting that Christ claims every square inch, and that Christians must develop art, science, and politics according to Christ’s norms. Kuyper’s program successfully dignified lay callings and justified institutional pluralisms such as Christian schools and parties. Yet it generates enduring debates. Some heirs translated it into triumphalist transformationism, confusing kingdom and culture. Others underplayed antithesis by collapsing Christian normativity into neutral progress. A Westminster examiner will press whether Kuyper’s emphasis on Christian principles for every domain competes with the institutional church’s focus on Word and sacrament. The best Kuyperian reply, anchored by **sphere sovereignty**, says no: the church as institute preaches and sacraments, while Christian associations shoulder culture-making according to creational norms, all under Christ. Another challenge questions whether Kuyper’s **common grace** doctrine compromises the profundity of sin. The answer is that common grace is not salvific; it is creational preservation and endowment, which makes cultural labor possible but not redemptive.

Meredith Kline recast the relation of culture and kingdom within a more rigorous **federal theology** and typology. Reading Scripture through covenant and the pattern of intrusion, he argued that the Mosaic theocracy was an eschatological intrusion of final judgment and new creation into history. This provides the key to why Israel’s civil law and holy war are not templates for ordinary politics. Theocracy as an intruded holy order expired with Christ’s advent. Kline’s Kingdom Prologue and subsequent works read the Adamic commission as part of the **creation covenant**, renewed in the **Noahic covenant** as a common grace order that stabilizes the world for redemptive history. Under Noah, the sword is divinely delegated to restrain violence in a common civil sphere shared by believers and unbelievers. The church as redemptive community is constituted by the gospel and is not to wield the sword. The **Great Commission** is the church’s mission to form a holy people under Christ’s heavenly administration. Kline thus guards against **theonomy**, which seeks to impose Mosaic civil law as the norm for all nations, by re-situating that law in its typological, intruded context. A likely objection is that Kline downplays society’s transformation by Christ. The Klinean rejoinder is that Christ surely transforms persons and congregations by the Spirit, and through them society may receive blessing, but redemptive holiness belongs to the church, not to the common order. This allows for robust engagement in the common kingdom according to natural and creational norms while refusing to sacralize cultural projects.

David VanDrunen has elaborated and defended a contemporary **two kingdoms** and natural law account that integrates and tests these themes under late modern pluralism. He argues that the **Noahic covenant** institutes a common kingdom governed by **natural law** that is genuinely moral and accountable to God yet not redemptive. In this common kingdom, Christians share cultural labors with neighbors, seeking justice and peace. The church, by contrast, is a holy nation ordered by the **Great Commission**, where Christ rules by his Word. VanDrunen resists transformationalism that suggests a distinctly Christian way to do carpentry or city planning as such, emphasizing instead that what makes a work Christian is not a special technique but the worker’s faith and love ordered by God’s law. He also resists **theonomy**, arguing that biblical civil laws were tied to Israel’s intruded theocracy and not designed to serve as universal civil codes. Critics worry that this approach invites passivity. VanDrunen insists that natural law gives thick guidance about justice, that the civil magistrate remains God’s servant, and that Christians should participate vigorously, but without conflating such work with the church’s mission. He also clarifies that two kingdoms are not two sovereign spheres but two modes of the one Christ’s rule, which can help quash the examiner’s familiar charge of Christological dualism.

These figures locate the doctrine within the traditions that actually formed it. Augustine set a humble eschatology and a differentiated account of temporal peace. Luther democratized holiness and sharpened the distinction of law and gospel for public life. Calvin integrated vocation with providence, **Sabbath**, and civil order, articulating a robust stewardship ethic. Kuyper made cultural calling explicit for modern institutions, balancing **antithesis** and **common grace** within **sphere sovereignty**. Kline supplied a rigorous covenantal map that quarantined Israel’s theocracy as typological and traced the **culture mandate** across **creation** and **Noahic** covenants to the **Great Commission**. VanDrunen developed a systematic account of the common kingdom that protects ecclesial mission and sustains principled pluralism.

The internal debates within Reformed theology center on how to correlate these elements. First is the question of whether the culture mandate is republished in the Great Commission as part of the church’s mission. Transformationalists often say yes, appealing to the cosmic scope of Christ’s redemption and to passages about reconciling all things. Two kingdoms advocates deny this, insisting on proper institutional differentiation, while affirming that Christians, precisely as disciples, serve neighbor and world. The Klinean mapping is persuasive: the mandate abides as creational law for humanity under the **Noahic covenant**, while the **Great Commission** specifies the church’s holy task of disciple-making. This preserves the integrity of the church and protects liberty of association. Second is the debate over **common grace** and **antithesis**. Kuyper already held both, but his heirs have sometimes privileged one over the other. The responsible synthesis is to affirm total depravity as the moral condition of all apart from grace, while also affirming that God restrains sin and grants genuine insights and goods across culture. This grounds cooperation across difference without naivete. Third is **theonomy**. By placing Mosaic civil law back into its intruded, typological context, Kline shows why it cannot norm the nations today. The moral law abides, but the civil polity of Israel was unique. Advocates of theonomy may object that this concedes norms to secularism. The reply is that **natural law** and creational norms are not secular; they are divine wisdom accessible and accountable to all, and Scripture itself appeals to them.

External debates test the doctrine’s resilience. Roman Catholic social teaching shares with Reformed accounts a robust appreciation of creation, **natural law**, and the common good, yet it construes grace as perfecting nature within a sacramental ontology that can license thicker ecclesial mediation of culture. A Reformed covenantal approach can collaborate on many prudential judgments while maintaining the distinctive conviction that the church’s instituted mission is ministerial and spiritual, and that civil order does not derive theological content from the church’s magisterium. Anabaptist separatism rejects coercive authority and encourages ecclesial withdrawal. Its witness to cruciform discipleship is salutary, but the Noahic grant of the sword and Romans 13 confirm that civil authority is divinely ordained and that neighbor love obligates Christians to seek public justice. Liberal Protestant social gospel traditions conflate redemption with social amelioration, collapsing the church’s gospel into activism. The Reformed position denies this confusion while insisting that the justified are sanctified for good works in public and private. Secular visions of dominion, whether technocratic or Marxist, instrumentalize nature and persons for immanent ends. By contrast, **dominion** as **vicegerency** is bounded by **Sabbath**, ordered to worship, and answerable to the Creator, which secures ecological care and protects persons from being sacrificed to projects.

Contemporary questions sharpen application. Technological power accelerates the temptation to treat dominion as domination. Genesis 2 names cultivation and guarding, not optimization at any cost. The creational law orders technology by the ends of justice, dignity, and sabbath-rest. Artificial intelligence may assist prudence, but it cannot bear moral agency or replace the wisdom of embodied vocations. An examiner may press whether ecological imperatives subtract from human prerogatives. The creation covenant answers that dominion is stewardship, not license. The land participates in the Sabbath; exploitation that destroys neighbor and habitat violates the mandate. Another pressure point is identity. Late capitalism tempts us to make vocation our self, generating either despair or pride. Luther’s and Calvin’s doctrine of calling cuts across this by locating identity in Christ and freedom in service. Christians should prize unpaid vocations in family and community as much as remunerated work. The Sabbath resists totalizing productivity, reminding the church that rest is eschatological gift, not earned wage, and that work’s worth is relative and penultimate.

Political polarization and questions of religious liberty call for precise accounts of authority. **Sphere sovereignty** and **two kingdoms** together clarify that neither state nor church is absolute. The state prosecutes justice within its limited competence; the church binds consciences only by Scripture in matters of faith and worship. Families, schools, and vocations have their own laws. This provides principled pluralism under Christ. Christians, acting as citizens, may advocate laws that follow **natural law** and promote the common good, yet they must resist baptizing policy preferences as kingdom mandates. Theonomy, in promising biblical blueprint politics, mislocates biblical law and threatens both gospel freedom and neighborly cooperation. On the other hand, quietism that retreats from the common good is a betrayal of neighbor love. The middle course defended here grounds robust civic involvement without ecclesial overreach.

Eschatology probes whether cultural artifacts endure into the new creation. Some read the kings of the earth bringing their glory into the New Jerusalem as a promise that human cultural products are transposed into eternity. Better to say that the nations and their glory, that is, the people and their sanctified honor, are redeemed. The ethical qualities of righteousness, justice, and praise, not the artifacts as such, endure. This prevents sacralizing projects while honoring the real goodness of work. In Christ, our labors are not in vain, because resurrection secures the worker, not because any particular artifact is guaranteed immortal significance. This keeps our eyes on the **eschatological telos** and dissolves both despair and idolatry.

The defended position integrates these threads. The **culture mandate** is creational law given in Adam and republished in the **Noahic covenant** as a common grace order for all peoples. It imposes obligations to cultivate, conserve, and govern according to **natural law** and creational norms, seeking temporal peace and justice. The church as institute is constituted by the **Great Commission** to preach the gospel, administer the sacraments, and exercise discipline, forming a holy people. Christians, as members of both church and civil orders, engage in vocations as cruciform **vicegerency**, guided by **Sabbath** rhythms and hope in the **eschatological telos**, resisting the seductions of domination and identity-through-work. We reject **theonomy** as a misreading of Israel’s typological polity, and we correct transformationalism’s conflation of kingdom and culture with Kline’s **intrusion ethics** and Reformed **two kingdoms** teaching. Yet we also reject quietism by reaffirming Kuyper’s insistence that Christ’s lordship extends to every sphere, and therefore Christians should labor for proximate justice and beauty under **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace**.

Anticipating objections consolidates the defense. Does two kingdoms theology concede the public square to secularism and deny Christ’s lordship? No, it distinguishes Christ’s modes of rule, not his authority. Christ rules the common kingdom providentially and morally through **natural law** and civil institutions, and the redemptive kingdom graciously through Word and Spirit. This clarifies without compartmentalizing. Does the defended view diminish the Old Testament’s theocratic witness? No, it places Israel’s polity within the economy of typology as an intruded anticipation of judgment and new creation. That intensifies the holiness of the church rather than diluting civil norms. Is dominion environmental plunder in biblical dress? No, creation’s goodness and Sabbath’s sanctity bind dominion as stewardship. The land’s sabbaths and the prohibition of bloodshed in the **Noahic covenant** set boundaries that preclude exploitation. Does a common grace, natural law approach collapse into moral relativism? No, because natural law is covenantally grounded in the Creator’s order and universally binding. Scripture itself frequently appeals to creational norms. Finally, does stress on vocation sanctify ambition and the idol of work? No, vocation is a theater for love, not a ladder for glory. The cross relativizes achievement and measures success by faithfulness, not acclaim.

The doctrine of vocation and dominion functions as a hinge joining anthropology, ethics, and eschatology. It presupposes the **image of God**, is patterned by **Sabbath**, chastened by the fall, preserved by **common grace**, reoriented by **union with Christ**, ordered institutionally by **two kingdoms** and **sphere sovereignty**, and relieved of utopian pressure by **intrusion ethics** and eschatological hope. A candidate must therefore move with ease across these loci, tracing the covenantal line from Adam to Noah to Christ, discriminating church and world without dividing the one lordship of Christ, honoring creational tasks without confusing them with the gospel, and shepherding consciences to discern their callings with humility and joy. In this way the church can prepare men and women to live as faithful pilgrims who cultivate the earth as stewards and seek the city that is to come, holding dominion as service and their vocations as gifts for neighbor and as praise to God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **culture mandate** is humanity’s creational **vicegerency** to cultivate and govern the world unto God’s glory, preserved under the **Noahic covenant** by **common grace**, ethically bounded by **natural law** and **Sabbath**, and reoriented by Christ so that the church’s institutional mission is the **Great Commission**, while Christians pursue vocations as cruciform stewardship.

  - Augustine: two cities ordered by love, temporal peace as penultimate good for pilgrimage.
  - Luther: **vocation** in every station, God’s single reign in two modes, law and gospel distinguished.
  - Calvin: providence and **calling**, stewardship ethic, **Sabbath** framing work, Christ’s kingship with analytic **two kingdoms** distinction.
  - Kuyper: **sphere sovereignty**, **antithesis** with **common grace**, explicit cultural program under Christ’s lordship.
  - Kline: covenantal architecture, **intrusion ethics**, **Noahic covenant** as common order, church’s mission distinct.
  - VanDrunen: developed **two kingdoms** and **natural law** for pluralism, rejection of **theonomy**, vigorous but non-salvific cultural labor.
