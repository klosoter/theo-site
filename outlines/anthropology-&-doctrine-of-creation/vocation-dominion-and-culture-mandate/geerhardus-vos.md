# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of **biblical theology**, emphasizing the original commission given to humanity in creation. He argued that the **image of God** entails a calling to exercise **dominion** over creation, unfolding in the context of **covenant** and ultimately finding fulfillment in **eschatology**. Vos saw the cultural mandate as foundational for understanding humanity’s purpose and the redemptive work of Christ.

- "The cultural task is rooted in the very structure of man’s being and in the original purpose of God with reference to the world." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 2: Anthropology)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Princeton Theological Review)
- "The Kingdom of God" (Princeton Theological Review)
- The Pauline Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Culture Mandate as Creation Ordinance**
    - The **mandate** to subdue and rule the earth is given in Genesis 1:26–28 as part of humanity’s original purpose.
    - This command is not abrogated by the Fall but continues to define human vocation.
    - The cultural mandate is integrally related to the **image of God** in man.
    - Vos sees the mandate as a divine commission, not merely a natural impulse.
    - "The cultural mandate is not an afterthought, but belongs to the very essence of man’s calling." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Vocation and the Image of God**
    - Human **vocation** is grounded in being created in the **image of God**.
    - The exercise of dominion is a reflection of God’s sovereign rule.
    - Work and cultural development are dignified by their connection to God’s purpose.
    - The image includes knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, equipping humanity for this task.
    - "The image of God is the foundation of man’s capacity for dominion." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Dominion in Covenant Context**
    - The **covenant of works** frames the exercise of dominion as a covenantal responsibility.
    - Dominion is not autonomous but is to be exercised in obedience to God’s law.
    - The Fall distorts but does not erase the calling to dominion.
    - Redemption in Christ restores and consummates the original mandate.
    - "The covenant relation gives the cultural task its religious and ethical character." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Development of the Mandate**
    - Vos traces the unfolding of the cultural mandate through **redemptive history**.
    - The mandate is not static but develops through the covenants and reaches fulfillment in Christ.
    - The kingdom of God is the eschatological realization of the original dominion.
    - The church participates in the renewal of creation as part of its vocation.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the restoration of man’s lost dominion." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Vocation**
    - The ultimate goal of the cultural mandate is found in **eschatology**.
    - Human vocation and dominion point forward to the new creation.
    - Christ, as the last Adam, secures the consummation of the original calling.
    - The redeemed exercise perfected dominion in the new heavens and new earth.
    - "Eschatology is but the unfolding of the original purpose of God for man and the world." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s biblical-theological approach to **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** has profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of creation and redemption. His emphasis on the unity of **creation and eschatology** provided a framework for later theologians to integrate cultural engagement with redemptive history. Vos’s insights continue to influence discussions on the Christian’s role in society and the enduring significance of the creation mandate within the broader scope of **covenant theology**.
