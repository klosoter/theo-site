# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through his existential interpretation of the New Testament, emphasizing the individual's encounter with God rather than external cultural or societal tasks. He rejected a literal reading of the **creation mandate**, focusing instead on the call to authentic existence in response to the **kerygma**. For Bultmann, the Christian's true vocation is realized in faith, not in fulfilling a cultural program.

- "The New Testament proclamation does not offer a world view, but calls man to decision." ("New Testament and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann" (1960)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Scripture's language about **creation** and **dominion** is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
    - The **culture mandate** is not a literal command but points to humanity's existential situation.
    - The focus is on the individual's response to the **kerygma**, not on societal transformation.
    - The biblical narrative is reinterpreted to address the modern person's quest for meaning.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the other-worldly in terms of this world." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Existential Understanding of Vocation**
    - **Vocation** is not a societal role but the individual's call to authentic existence before God.
    - Faith is a personal decision, not a fulfillment of external mandates.
    - The Christian's task is to respond to God's call in the present, not to exercise dominion over creation.
    - Authentic existence is realized in openness to God's address, not in cultural achievement.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of oneself to the God who is present in the word." ("Theology of the New Testament")

3. **Rejection of Objective Culture Mandate**
    - The **culture mandate** is not a binding, objective command for Christians.
    - Bultmann sees biblical commands as existential appeals, not universal cultural programs.
    - Human history and culture are relativized in light of the eschatological event of Christ.
    - The New Testament does not prescribe a Christian culture or dominion over the world.
    - "The New Testament knows nothing of a Christian world-view or a Christian culture." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

4. **Christ as the Eschatological Event**
    - Christ's coming is the decisive event that reorients all human existence.
    - The meaning of **dominion** is transformed: it is no longer about rule over creation but about new life in Christ.
    - The eschatological event calls for decision, not cultural achievement.
    - The believer's life is shaped by encounter with the risen Christ, not by fulfilling a creation mandate.
    - "The Christ event is the eschatological event, the turning point of history." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Faith and Freedom from Worldly Structures**
    - Faith liberates from bondage to worldly structures, including cultural and societal mandates.
    - The Christian is not bound to fulfill a specific cultural role but to live authentically before God.
    - **Dominion** is reinterpreted as freedom from the world, not mastery over it.
    - The focus is on inward transformation, not external dominion or vocation.
    - "Christian existence is existence in freedom from the world." ("Faith and Understanding")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's existential approach to **vocation** and the **culture mandate** profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in its turn away from cultural programs toward personal faith. His **demythologization** project challenged traditional readings of Genesis and the creation mandate, prompting ongoing debate about the relationship between faith and culture. While often criticized by confessional traditions, Bultmann's work remains a touchstone for discussions on the existential meaning of Christian calling and the limits of biblical mandates for cultural engagement.
