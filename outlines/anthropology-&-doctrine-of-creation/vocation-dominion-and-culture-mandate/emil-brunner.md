# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the topics of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** through the lens of **divine command** and **human responsibility** within creation. He emphasized that humanity’s calling is rooted in being created in the **image of God**, tasked with stewardship over the world, yet always dependent on God’s revelation and grace. Brunner saw cultural activity as a sphere where humans respond to God’s mandate, but insisted that true fulfillment of this calling is only possible through **reconciliation in Christ**.

- "Man is called to be a responsible creature, to answer the call of God in the tasks of culture and society." ("Man in Revolt")

## Key Works

- "Man in Revolt" (1937)
- "The Divine Imperative" (1937)
- "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption" (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- "Truth as Encounter" (1937)
- "The Misunderstanding of the Church" (1952)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Vocation as Divine Command**
    - Human vocation is grounded in God’s sovereign call, not autonomous self-realization.
    - Every person is summoned to serve God within their historical and social context.
    - The call to work and cultural engagement is a response to God’s initiative.
    - Vocation is inseparable from obedience to God’s revealed will.
    - "The command of God is always a command to a particular man in a particular situation." ("The Divine Imperative")

2. **Dominion as Responsible Stewardship**
    - Humanity’s dominion over creation is a delegated authority, not absolute ownership.
    - Stewardship is exercised under the Creator’s authority and for His purposes.
    - The misuse of dominion results from the fall and leads to alienation from God and creation.
    - True dominion is restored only through reconciliation with God.
    - "Man is lord of creation only as servant of the Creator." ("Man in Revolt")

3. **Culture Mandate as a Continuing Task**
    - The **culture mandate** (Genesis 1:28) remains binding, calling humans to develop and order the world.
    - Cultural activity is a sphere of obedience, not a means of self-salvation.
    - The mandate encompasses all areas of life: work, art, science, and society.
    - The fulfillment of the mandate is distorted by sin but not annulled.
    - "The task of culture is given with creation, but its true meaning is revealed in Christ." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

4. **Image of God and Human Responsibility**
    - The **imago Dei** grounds human dignity and the capacity for relationship with God and others.
    - Human responsibility in culture flows from being made in God’s image.
    - The image is marred but not destroyed by sin; restoration comes through Christ.
    - The relational aspect of the image is central to Brunner’s anthropology.
    - "To be man means to be addressed by God and to respond in freedom and responsibility." ("Man in Revolt")

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Mandate**
    - Christ is the true image of God and the model for human vocation.
    - Reconciliation in Christ restores the possibility of genuine cultural obedience.
    - The church is called to witness to God’s kingdom within culture, not to withdraw from it.
    - All cultural tasks find their ultimate meaning in relation to Christ’s lordship.
    - "Only in Christ is the true meaning of human existence and vocation disclosed." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s theology of **vocation** and the **culture mandate** influenced Protestant discussions on the relationship between faith and public life, especially in the context of modernity. His emphasis on **responsible freedom** and the divine command shaped later debates on Christian ethics and the role of the church in society. While sometimes contrasted with Barth’s more dialectical approach, Brunner’s nuanced account of human stewardship and cultural engagement remains significant for contemporary theology. His work continues to challenge Christians to pursue faithful obedience in all spheres of life.
