# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** within the framework of **creation**, **providence**, and **covenant theology**. They teach that all human labor and stewardship are to be exercised under the lordship of Christ, for the glory of God and the good of neighbor, grounding these duties in the original creation order and their restoration in redemption.

- "God, the great Creator of all things, doth uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things, from the greatest even to the least, by his most wise and holy providence." (Westminster Confession of Faith 5.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 2, 4, 16, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 17, 20, 91, 155)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 1, 10, 13, 39)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on Christian life and calling)
- The Form of Presbyterial Church Government (sections on office and calling)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creation Ordinance and the Culture Mandate**
   - Humanity is created in the **image of God** and given dominion over the earth.
   - The mandate to "subdue" and "have dominion" is foundational for human vocation.
   - Work and stewardship are part of original righteousness, not results of the Fall.
   - The Standards affirm the ongoing validity of the creation mandate in all lawful callings.
   "God gave to man a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience." (WCF 19.1)

2. **Vocation as Divine Calling**
   - Every lawful occupation is a calling from God to serve Him and neighbor.
   - Vocation is to be pursued with diligence, faithfulness, and for God's glory.
   - The Standards reject monastic or ascetic withdrawal from ordinary callings.
   - Christians are exhorted to remain in the calling in which God has placed them.
   "Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called." (WLC Q.141)

3. **Dominion and Stewardship under Providence**
   - Dominion is exercised as stewardship, not autonomous rule.
   - **God’s providence** governs all human labor and achievement.
   - The use of creation’s resources is regulated by God’s **moral law**.
   - Human dominion is accountable to God and oriented toward the common good.
   "The light of nature showeth that there is a God, who hath lordship and sovereignty over all." (WCF 21.1)

4. **Sabbath and the Rhythm of Work and Rest**
   - The **Sabbath commandment** affirms the dignity of labor and the necessity of rest.
   - Six days are appointed for labor in one’s vocation; the seventh is set apart for worship.
   - The Sabbath is a creation ordinance, reaffirmed in the moral law.
   - Proper observance of the Sabbath guards against both idleness and overwork.
   "God hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him." (WCF 21.7)

5. **Redemption and the Restoration of Vocation**
   - Christ redeems not only souls but also restores the purpose of human vocation.
   - Believers are called to serve Christ in every sphere of life, sanctifying their labors.
   - The Spirit enables Christians to fulfill the culture mandate in light of the gospel.
   - The ultimate goal of vocation is the **glory of God** and the advancement of His kingdom.
   "Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever." (WSC Q.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on vocation, dominion, and the culture mandate, rooting these concepts in the doctrines of creation, providence, and redemption. Their teaching has influenced Protestant understandings of work, stewardship, and the Christian’s engagement with culture. The Standards remain a foundational reference for discussions of Christian vocation and the integration of faith and life in the world.
