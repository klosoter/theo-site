# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** is rooted in his understanding of the **image of God**, the **creation order**, and the ongoing relevance of Genesis 1:28. Calvin emphasized that all legitimate work is a calling from God, through which humans exercise stewardship and fulfill their mandate to cultivate and govern creation. He saw human labor and cultural activity as integral to God’s providential purposes, reflecting both the dignity and responsibility of humanity in the world.

- "Let every one of us, therefore, in whatever he does, consider what he is bound to do by God, and not what he himself wishes to do." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.10.6)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Vocation as Divine Calling**
    - All legitimate work is a **calling** (vocatio) from God, not merely secular labor.
    - Each person’s station in life is assigned by God’s providence.
    - Faithfulness in one’s vocation is a form of obedience and worship.
    - Vocation serves both the common good and God’s glory.
    - "The Lord bids each one of us in all life’s actions to look to his calling." (Institutes, 3.10.6)

2. **Dominion as Stewardship, Not Exploitation**
    - Humanity’s dominion over creation is a stewardship entrusted by God.
    - The **image of God** entails responsibility, not autonomy, over the earth.
    - Dominion is exercised under God’s law and for the benefit of all creation.
    - Abuse or neglect of creation is a violation of God’s mandate.
    - "Let him who possesses a field, so partake of its yearly fruits, that he may not suffer the ground to be injured by his negligence, but let him endeavor to hand it down to posterity as he received it, or even better cultivated." (Commentary on Genesis 2:15)

3. **The Culture Mandate as Ongoing Obligation**
    - The command to "fill the earth and subdue it" remains in force after the Fall.
    - Human cultural activity is a means of fulfilling God’s original intent for creation.
    - The **creation mandate** is not abrogated by redemption but clarified and redirected.
    - All cultural pursuits are to be conducted in light of God’s sovereignty.
    - "We are appointed stewards of all that God has committed to us." (Commentary on Genesis 1:28)

4. **Integration of Sacred and Secular**
    - There is no strict division between sacred and secular work; all of life is lived coram Deo.
    - Every legitimate occupation can be an arena for serving God and neighbor.
    - The dignity of labor is affirmed for all social classes and types of work.
    - The Christian’s daily work is a means of loving God and others.
    - "No task will be so sordid and base, provided you obey your calling in it, that it will not shine and be reckoned very precious in God’s sight." (Institutes, 3.10.6)

5. **Providence and the Ordering of Society**
    - God’s providence orders each person’s place and role in society.
    - Social order and division of labor are expressions of God’s wise governance.
    - Christians are to accept their station with humility and gratitude.
    - The pursuit of ambition outside one’s calling is discouraged as disorderly.
    - "He who is obscure will live a private life without discontent, so as not to desert the station in which God has placed him." (Commentary on 1 Corinthians 7:20)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of **vocation** and the **culture mandate** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition’s view of work, society, and the Christian’s engagement with the world. His emphasis on stewardship, the dignity of all lawful labor, and the integration of faith and daily life influenced later Protestant thought, including Puritanism and the development of the so-called "Protestant work ethic." Calvin’s teaching continues to inform contemporary discussions on faith, work, and the Christian’s responsibility in culture.
