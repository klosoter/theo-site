# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s understanding of **vocation**, **dominion**, and the **culture mandate** is deeply shaped by his doctrines of **creation**, **fall**, and the two cities. He affirms that humanity was originally given a mandate to exercise **dominion** over creation, but interprets this calling through the lens of sin and redemption, emphasizing the distinction between the **City of God** and the **earthly city** in the pursuit of cultural activity.

- "God made man in His own image, that he might exercise dominion over the beasts, not over his fellow-men." (City of God, XIX.15)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)
- On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana)
- The Trinity (De Trinitate)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Vocation Rooted in the Image of God**
    - Humanity’s original calling is grounded in being created in the **imago Dei**.
    - The mandate to rule and cultivate the earth is seen as a reflection of God’s own sovereignty.
    - This vocation is not for exploitation but for stewardship and care of creation.
    - The image of God includes rationality, moral responsibility, and relationality.
    - "The image of God, in which man was made, is to be found chiefly and most truly in the rational soul." (On the Trinity, XII.7)

2. **Dominion Distorted by the Fall**
    - The **fall** corrupted humanity’s exercise of dominion, introducing pride and self-love.
    - Dominion is now often expressed as domination over others, contrary to God’s intent.
    - Sin disrupts the harmony between humans and the rest of creation.
    - True dominion is only restored in Christ and the redeemed community.
    - "The first cause of slavery is sin, by which man was subjected to man by the bond of his condition." (City of God, XIX.15)

3. **Two Cities: Earthly and Heavenly Perspectives on Culture**
    - Augustine distinguishes between the **City of God** and the **earthly city**.
    - The earthly city seeks self-glory and temporal peace, while the City of God seeks God’s glory and eternal peace.
    - Cultural achievements are ambiguous, shaped by the loves of each city.
    - Christians participate in culture as pilgrims, not as ultimate citizens.
    - "Two loves have made two cities: love of self, even to the contempt of God; the love of God, even to the contempt of self." (City of God, XIV.28)

4. **Temporal Vocation and the Common Good**
    - Christians are called to work for the **common good** within earthly society.
    - Earthly vocations are legitimate but must be ordered to God’s ultimate ends.
    - Civic and cultural duties are to be fulfilled with justice and charity.
    - The peace of the earthly city is a provisional good, not the final goal.
    - "The earthly city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace...the heavenly city uses this peace only because it must." (City of God, XIX.17)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of the Culture Mandate**
    - The full realization of the **culture mandate** awaits the consummation of all things.
    - Present cultural efforts are provisional and marked by imperfection.
    - The restoration of creation and human vocation is promised in the new creation.
    - The ultimate end is the vision and enjoyment of God, not earthly achievement.
    - "Then shall the body be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, and the spirit subject to God." (City of God, XXII.30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s interpretation of **vocation** and **dominion** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in distinguishing between sacred and secular pursuits. His doctrine of the **two cities** provided a framework for understanding Christian engagement with culture, influencing both medieval and Reformation theology. Augustine’s emphasis on the provisional nature of earthly achievements continues to inform discussions on faith, work, and the public square. His legacy endures in debates about the relationship between church and society, and the ultimate purpose of human cultural activity.
