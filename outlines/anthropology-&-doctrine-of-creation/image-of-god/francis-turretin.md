# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **Image of God** that distinguished between its **natural** and **supernatural** aspects. He emphasized that the image consists fundamentally in **original righteousness** and the faculties of **reason** and **will**, while also maintaining that the image was not entirely lost in the Fall but was corrupted and marred.

- "The image of God is to be sought partly in the nature of man, and partly in his qualities and gifts." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topic 8, Questions 10–11)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Natural and Supernatural**
    - The image of God comprises both **natural faculties** (intellect, will) and **supernatural gifts** (original righteousness).
    - The natural aspect is essential to human nature and cannot be lost without ceasing to be human.
    - The supernatural aspect consists in **holiness** and **righteousness** given by grace.
    - The Fall destroyed the supernatural gifts but left the natural faculties impaired, not annihilated.
    - "The image of God is considered in two ways: broadly, as the whole excellence of human nature; strictly, as conformity to God in righteousness and holiness." (Institutes, 5.10.4)

2. **Retention and Loss in the Fall**
    - After the Fall, the **natural image** remains, though corrupted.
    - The **supernatural image** (original righteousness) was entirely lost.
    - Fallen humanity retains rationality and dominion, but not true holiness.
    - Restoration in Christ involves the renewal of both aspects, especially the supernatural.
    - "The image of God was not wholly lost, but remains in part, although miserably defaced." (Institutes, 5.10.7)

3. **Image and Human Faculties**
    - The image is rooted in the **spiritual faculties**: mind, will, and affections.
    - These faculties reflect God’s communicable attributes.
    - Even in fallen man, these faculties persist, though disordered.
    - The restoration of the image involves the sanctification of these faculties.
    - "The image of God consists in the spiritual and immortal soul, endowed with intellect and will." (Institutes, 5.10.3)

4. **Ethical and Relational Dimensions**
    - The image includes **original righteousness**, which is ethical conformity to God.
    - It also involves the capacity for **relationship with God** and dominion over creation.
    - The ethical aspect is central to Turretin’s definition of the image in the strict sense.
    - Restoration of the image is both moral and relational, achieved through union with Christ.
    - "The principal part of the image is the conformity of man’s will to the will of God." (Institutes, 5.10.6)

5. **Christ as the Perfect Image**
    - Christ is the **archetype** and perfect expression of the image of God.
    - Believers are renewed in the image of God through union with Christ.
    - The restoration of the image is eschatological, completed in glorification.
    - The work of the Spirit is essential for the renewal of the image in believers.
    - "Christ is the most perfect image of God, in whom we are renewed." (Institutes, 5.10.12)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced distinction between the **natural** and **supernatural** aspects of the image of God became a standard in later **Reformed scholasticism**. His careful exegesis and systematic approach influenced subsequent Reformed theologians, shaping debates on anthropology and soteriology. The categories he developed remain foundational for discussions of human dignity, the effects of the Fall, and the nature of redemption in Reformed theology.
