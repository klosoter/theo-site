# John Kilner (1952– )

John Kilner is a leading contemporary evangelical theologian whose work on the **image of God** emphasizes its grounding in humanity’s unique relationship to God rather than in particular human capacities or functions. He argues that the **imago Dei** is fundamentally about being created to reflect, relate to, and represent God, and that this status is not lost through sin but distorted. Kilner’s approach is marked by a strong commitment to the **Christological** and **relational** dimensions of the image.

- "Humanity is created in God’s image, which is neither lost nor diminished by sin, but rather distorted in its expression." (Dignity and Destiny)

## Key Works

- Dignity and Destiny: Humanity in the Image of God (2015)
- The Image of God in the Human Body: Essays on Christianity and Sports (2016, ed.)
- Why People Matter: A Christian Engagement with Rival Views of Human Significance (2017, co-authored)
- Life on the Go: Theological Ethics and the Image of God (various articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Relationship, Not Capacity**
    - The **imago Dei** is defined by humanity’s relationship to God, not by rationality, morality, or other human attributes.
    - All people equally possess the image, regardless of abilities or development.
    - This relational view resists reduction to functional or structural definitions.
    - The image is a status conferred by God, not an achievement.
    - "The image of God is not something people do or have, but something they are by virtue of God’s creative act." (Dignity and Destiny)

2. **Christ as the True Image**
    - Jesus Christ is the definitive revelation of the **image of God**.
    - Humanity’s destiny is to be conformed to the image of Christ.
    - The restoration of the image is accomplished through union with Christ.
    - Christology is central to understanding both the origin and destiny of the image.
    - "Christ is the image of God, and humanity is created according to that image." (Dignity and Destiny)

3. **Image Retained but Distorted by Sin**
    - The **imago Dei** is not lost through the Fall, but its expression is corrupted.
    - Human dignity and worth remain intact after sin.
    - Redemption involves the renewal, not the re-creation, of the image.
    - This view undergirds a robust theological anthropology and ethics.
    - "Sin distorts but does not destroy the image of God in humanity." (Dignity and Destiny)

4. **Ethical Implications of the Image**
    - Every human being possesses inherent dignity and worth.
    - The image of God grounds universal human rights and justice.
    - Ethical treatment of others is rooted in their status as image-bearers.
    - Theological anthropology shapes Christian engagement with bioethics, justice, and social issues.
    - "Recognition of the image of God in all people is the foundation for Christian ethics." (Dignity and Destiny)

5. **Universal and Eschatological Dimensions**
    - The image of God applies to all people, regardless of race, gender, age, or ability.
    - The full realization of the image awaits eschatological fulfillment in Christ.
    - The image points to both present dignity and future destiny.
    - The church is called to witness to the restoration of the image in Christ.
    - "The image of God is both a present reality and an eschatological promise." (Dignity and Destiny)

## Legacy and Impact

Kilner’s work has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical and Reformed discussions of the **imago Dei**, especially by clarifying its relational and Christological dimensions. His insistence on the enduring dignity of all people has influenced Christian approaches to **bioethics**, human rights, and social justice. By rooting the image in God’s creative act and Christ’s redemptive work, Kilner has provided a robust theological foundation for human worth and ethical responsibility. His scholarship continues to inform both academic theology and practical ministry.
