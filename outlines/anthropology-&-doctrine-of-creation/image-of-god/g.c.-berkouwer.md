# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **Image of God** as a dynamic and relational reality, emphasizing its connection to humanity's **covenantal relationship** with God rather than a static set of attributes. He rejected both purely **substantive** and **functional** definitions, instead highlighting the **Christological** and **redemptive-historical** dimensions of the image, especially in light of the Fall and restoration in Christ.

- "The image of God is not a fixed, static datum, but is bound up with the history of man’s relationship to God." (Man: The Image of God)

## Key Works

- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- General Revelation (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)
- A Half Century of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Relational and Dynamic**
   - The image is not a static possession but is realized in relationship with God.
   - Human existence as image-bearers is fundamentally **covenantal**.
   - The image is distorted but not destroyed by sin.
   - Restoration of the image is tied to union with Christ.
   - "The image of God is not a fixed, static datum, but is bound up with the history of man’s relationship to God." (Man: The Image of God)

2. **Rejection of Purely Substantive or Functional Views**
   - Critiques definitions that reduce the image to rationality or dominion.
   - Emphasizes the inadequacy of isolating the image to human faculties.
   - Argues that both substantive and functional aspects are insufficient alone.
   - Insists on a holistic, biblical-theological approach.
   - "The image of God cannot be captured by a single human characteristic." (Man: The Image of God)

3. **Christological Orientation**
   - Christ is the true and perfect image of God.
   - The restoration of the image is accomplished in and through Christ.
   - Believers are conformed to the image of Christ by the Spirit.
   - The image finds its eschatological fulfillment in Christ’s likeness.
   - "The New Testament speaks of the renewal of the image in terms of conformity to Christ." (Man: The Image of God)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
   - The image must be understood within the unfolding drama of redemption.
   - The Fall affects but does not annihilate the image.
   - Redemption involves the renewal and restoration of the image.
   - The image is both a present reality and a future hope.
   - "The history of redemption is the history of the restoration of the image." (Man: The Image of God)

5. **Anthropological Humility and Dependence**
   - Human dignity is derived from God, not inherent autonomy.
   - The image points to humanity’s dependence on divine grace.
   - Anthropology must be grounded in revelation, not speculation.
   - The image underscores the ethical responsibility of humanity before God.
   - "Man’s greatness lies not in himself, but in his being addressed and claimed by God." (Man: The Image of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s treatment of the **Image of God** has shaped Reformed anthropology by moving beyond reductionistic definitions and rooting the concept in **covenantal** and **Christological** realities. His work influenced later theologians to approach the image as a dynamic, relational, and redemptive-historical category. Berkouwer’s nuanced exegesis and engagement with contemporary debates continue to inform discussions on human dignity, sin, and restoration within the broader Reformed tradition.
