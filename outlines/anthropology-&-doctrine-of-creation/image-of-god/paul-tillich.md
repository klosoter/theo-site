# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **Image of God** as an existential and ontological reality, emphasizing humanity’s participation in the **Ground of Being** rather than a static possession of divine attributes. For Tillich, the **imago Dei** is fundamentally relational, rooted in the human capacity for **self-transcendence**, **freedom**, and the quest for **ultimate concern**. The image is distorted but not destroyed by sin, and its restoration is central to Tillich’s understanding of salvation and reconciliation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Imago Dei as Existential Structure**
    - Humanity’s **image of God** is not a static endowment but an existential structure of being.
    - The image is expressed through **self-awareness**, **freedom**, and the capacity for **transcendence**.
    - The **imago** is relational, manifesting in the encounter with God and others.
    - Sin distorts but does not annihilate the existential structure of the image.
    - "The image of God is the structure of man's being which makes him receptive to revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Participation in the Ground of Being**
    - Humanity’s being is grounded in participation with the **Ground of Being** (God).
    - The **image** is realized in the dynamic relationship between finite existence and infinite depth.
    - Alienation from the Ground of Being is the essence of sin and estrangement.
    - Restoration of the image involves reunion with the divine ground.
    - "Man is estranged from the ground of his being, but not separated from it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Freedom and Self-Transcendence**
    - The **image of God** is seen in human freedom and the ability to transcend mere creatureliness.
    - Self-transcendence enables humans to ask ultimate questions and seek meaning.
    - This freedom is both the glory and the risk of human existence.
    - The distortion of freedom leads to existential anxiety and estrangement.
    - "The image of God is freedom, and freedom is the possibility of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Distortion and Restoration of the Image**
    - Sin is defined as **estrangement** from God, self, and others, distorting the image.
    - The image remains structurally present but existentially corrupted.
    - Restoration comes through **reconciliation** in Christ, who is the New Being.
    - The process of salvation is the actualization of the image in communion with God.
    - "The New Being appears as the power of reunion, overcoming estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Universal and Existential Dimensions**
    - The **imago Dei** is universal to all humanity, transcending particular cultures or individuals.
    - It is existentially realized in the personal encounter with the divine.
    - The image is not a possession but a dynamic, lived reality.
    - The existential approach emphasizes the ongoing process of becoming in the image.
    - "The image of God is not a static possession but an existential possibility." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential interpretation of the **Image of God** has profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, especially in discussions of **human nature**, **sin**, and **redemption**. His focus on the relational and dynamic aspects of the image challenged more static or substantialist views, opening new avenues for dialogue between theology, philosophy, and psychology. Tillich’s thought continues to shape contemporary debates on the meaning of **imago Dei** in a pluralistic and secular context.
