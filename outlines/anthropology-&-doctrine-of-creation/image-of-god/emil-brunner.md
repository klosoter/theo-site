# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s doctrine of the **Image of God** centers on the relational and dynamic character of human existence before God. He distinguishes between the **formal** and **material** image, arguing that the formal image (humanity’s capacity for relationship with God) endures after the Fall, while the material image (original righteousness) is lost. Brunner’s approach grounds the **imago Dei** in **encounter** and **responsibility** rather than in static attributes.

- "The image of God is not a substance but a relation." ("Man in Revolt")

## Key Works

- "Man in Revolt" (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption" (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "The Mediator"
- "Truth as Encounter"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Formal and Material Image**
    - The **formal image** is humanity’s enduring capacity for personal relationship with God.
    - The **material image** refers to humanity’s original righteousness, which is lost in the Fall.
    - After the Fall, the formal image persists, but the material image is destroyed.
    - This distinction upholds both human dignity and the reality of sin’s effects.
    "The formal image remains, but the material image is lost." ("Man in Revolt")

2. **Relational Nature of the Imago Dei**
    - The image is not a static quality but a dynamic, relational reality.
    - Human beings are defined by their orientation toward God and others.
    - The **imago Dei** is realized in personal encounter and responsibility.
    - Relationship, not substance, is the core of the image.
    "The image of God is realized in the I-Thou relationship." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

3. **Christ as the True Image**
    - Jesus Christ is the perfect revelation and restoration of the **image of God**.
    - Humanity’s image is renewed only in union with Christ.
    - **Christology** is central to understanding and recovering the imago Dei.
    - The restoration of the image is eschatological and Christocentric.
    "In Christ, the true image of God is made manifest and restored." ("The Mediator")

4. **Human Freedom and Responsibility**
    - The image entails genuine human freedom before God.
    - Responsibility is a defining feature of the imago Dei.
    - Freedom is not autonomy but response to God’s call.
    - Sin distorts, but does not erase, this capacity for response.
    "Man is free because he is responsible before God." ("Man in Revolt")

5. **Critique of Substantialist and Rationalist Views**
    - Brunner rejects identifying the image with reason or any inherent faculty.
    - He opposes both **Scholastic** and **liberal** anthropologies.
    - The image is not a metaphysical possession but a relational possibility.
    - This critique aligns with his broader **dialectical theology**.
    "The image of God is not a metaphysical endowment but a relational possibility." ("Truth as Encounter")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s relational understanding of the **Image of God** significantly influenced 20th-century Protestant anthropology, especially in dialogue with **Karl Barth** and the wider **dialectical theology** movement. His distinction between the formal and material image provided a nuanced way to affirm both human dignity and the depth of the Fall. Brunner’s emphasis on encounter and responsibility continues to shape contemporary discussions on theological anthropology and the nature of human personhood.
