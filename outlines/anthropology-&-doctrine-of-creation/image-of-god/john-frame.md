# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **image of God** through his distinctive **multiperspectivalism**, emphasizing that humans reflect God's **lordship attributes**—**authority**, **control**, and **presence**—in every aspect of their being. He stresses that the image is not limited to a single faculty or function but encompasses the whole person in relation to God, others, and creation, integrating **ethical**, **relational**, and **functional** dimensions.

- "The image of God, then, is not a part of human nature, but the whole person in his or her relationship to God." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of God" (2002)
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life" (2008)
- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief" (2013)
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord" (2006)
- "Perspectives on the Image of God" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectival Approach to the Image**
   - The image of God is best understood through multiple perspectives: **normative** (ethical), **situational** (relational), and **existential** (personal).
   - Each perspective reflects a different aspect of how humans image God.
   - No single perspective exhausts the meaning of the image; all are necessary for a full account.
   - This approach guards against reductionism in theological anthropology.
   - "We must see the image of God as a multiperspectival reality." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Image as Reflection of Divine Lordship**
   - Humans image God by reflecting his **authority**, **control**, and **presence** in the world.
   - These lordship attributes are expressed in human dominion, moral responsibility, and relationality.
   - The image is dynamic, involving both being and doing.
   - Human vocation and stewardship are grounded in this reflection of God's lordship.
   - "To be in God’s image is to be his representative, exercising his lordship under his authority." ("The Doctrine of God")

3. **Holistic and Covenantal Anthropology**
   - The image of God encompasses the whole person—body and soul, reason and will, relationships and actions.
   - Human identity is fundamentally covenantal, defined by relationship with God.
   - The image is not lost in the Fall but is marred and restored in Christ.
   - Ethical, relational, and vocational aspects are all essential to the image.
   - "The image is not a mere faculty, but the whole person in covenant with God." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

4. **Ethical Implications of the Image**
   - The image of God grounds human dignity and moral responsibility.
   - Ethical norms derive from God’s character, which humans are called to reflect.
   - Justice, love, and stewardship are rooted in imaging God’s moral attributes.
   - Violations against humans are ultimately offenses against God’s image.
   - "Our ethical obligations are rooted in our status as God’s image bearers." ("The Doctrine of the Christian Life")

5. **Christological Fulfillment of the Image**
   - Jesus Christ is the perfect image of God and the model for redeemed humanity.
   - Believers are renewed in the image of Christ through union with him.
   - Sanctification involves being conformed to Christ’s image in all aspects of life.
   - The restoration of the image is both present and eschatological.
   - "In Christ, the image of God is restored and brought to its intended fulfillment." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **multiperspectival** approach to the image of God has influenced contemporary Reformed anthropology by integrating ethical, relational, and functional dimensions into a unified framework. His emphasis on the reflection of divine lordship and the holistic nature of the image has shaped discussions on human dignity, vocation, and ethics. Frame’s work continues to be a significant resource for those seeking a robust, covenantal understanding of the image of God within the broader Reformed tradition.
