### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How to define the image of God with precision so that it grounds human dignity, moral order, and vocation without collapsing into mere rational capacity, bare relationality, or functionalism.
- Decisive figures: Irenaeus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Francis Turretin, Karl Barth.
- Traditions: Patristic theology, medieval scholasticism, Reformation and Reformed scholasticism, modern dialectical theology.
- Debates to address:
  - Internal: whether **original righteousness** is integral to the image; whether the image is primarily structural, relational, or functional; persistence of the image post-fall; scope of the **dominion mandate** and its relation to **natural law** and culture.
  - External: Roman Catholic nature–grace scheme and donum superadditum; Eastern Orthodox image–likeness and theosis; naturalist and evolutionary accounts of personhood; secular rights-discourse detached from metaphysics.
  - Contemporary: AI and personhood, disability and dignity, gender and male–female relationality, race and justice, abortion and end-of-life, transhumanism.
- Position defended: The image consists in humanity’s created structural capacities ordered to God and inclusive of **original righteousness**, expressed relationally and vocationally in royal-priestly dominion, marred yet retained after the fall, renewed only in Christ who is the archetypal Image, and consummated eschatologically.

### ESSAY
The image of God names humanity’s created participation in representational likeness to God such that human beings, as body-soul unities, possess capacities for **analogical knowledge**, love, and dominion ordered to God and to the flourishing of creation. The image is not a single faculty nor a purely social relation nor mere function; it is a comprehensive created form of life, integrally moral and teleological, bestowed to display God in the world. This requires conceptual anchors. First, because God is simple, incomprehensible, and triune, the likeness we bear is neither univocal nor empty. By **analogical knowledge**, we confess that the imago entails a finite, ectypal resemblance that corresponds to God truly, not comprehensively. Second, as creatures of **divine simplicity**’s God, we cannot image God by reproducing his essence but by receiving a created configuration that reflects his truth, goodness, and lordship. Third, the image is not a mere status; it is a vocation. The **dominion mandate** charges image-bearers to exercise royal-priestly stewardship that orders the world in justice and praise. That vocation presupposes a structural capacity and a moral rectitude that the fall corrupts but does not annihilate.

Irenaeus, writing in a context of Gnostic denials of the goodness of creation, gives the first decisive framing. In Against Heresies he distinguishes image and likeness so as to guard a teleological ascent without separating humanity from God’s good creation. The image signifies human constitution as rational, embodied creatures destined for communion with God; likeness indicates the eschatological correspondence we grow into by grace. His recapitulation doctrine sets Christ as the second Adam who re-heads humanity, gathering in himself the trajectory from created potential to glorified likeness. The significance of Irenaeus is twofold. He insists that the body belongs positively to the image’s story, rejecting any dualism that would construe corporeality as a deviation. At the same time, he introduces a dynamic vector, anticipating later discussions of renewal and glorification. Yet his image–likeness distinction became contested. Is likeness an added gift? Or an internally teleological orientation? The later medieval habit of reading likeness as a superadded righteousness owes something to this trajectory yet is not compelled by Irenaeus’s anti-Gnostic posture. For oral defense, note the gain and the risk: Irenaeus secures a cosmic, Christological, and historical account of the imago, but he leaves open whether righteousness is intrinsic or adventitious.

Augustine deepens the doctrine by locating the imago in the rational soul as a vestigial trinitarian analog. In De Trinitate he reads memory, understanding, and will as a created triad signifying the triune God. The image consists principally in the mind’s capacity to know and love God, a capacity that persists after the fall but is disordered by sin. Augustine’s method is exegetical and metaphysical at once. From Genesis 1 he infers that dominion follows from, not forms, the image, since dominion is given to the image-bearer. From Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 he infers that renewal in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness is a restorative and eschatological work, not a first creation of the image. Contextually, he opposes Pelagian suggestions that unaided human faculties can ascend to God, and he therefore insists that grace restores and elevates the mind to its end. Augustine’s decisive contribution is his insistence that the image has a formal seat in the rational soul ordered to God, as well as a moral orientation now impaired. He maintains that the image does not imply a social ontology of persons, because God’s triune life is not mirrored by any creaturely collectivity. He affirms embodiment yet anchors the imago formally in intellect and will, which correspond analogically to God’s truth and love. Examiners may press whether this makes the body irrelevant. The Augustinian reply is hylomorphic: the soul is the form of the body, so our bodily capacities are the embodied expression of an intellectual and volitional nature. The denial of a bodily image is not a denial of embodied vocation, but a rejection of the claim that God’s incorporeal nature is imaged by anything bodily as such.

Thomas Aquinas receives Augustine and renders the doctrine with scholastic clarity. In Summa Theologiae I, question 93, he defines the image as the intellectual nature capable of God, and he articulates degrees of imaging: nature, grace, and glory. He distinguishes a natural imago in the intellect and will, a graced imago by charity, and a glorified imago in beatific conformity. Aquinas introduces the donum superadditum structure: **original righteousness** is not of the essence of nature but a habitus of rectitude added to bind the lower powers to the higher, ordering the whole person to God. This enables him to say that after the fall the natural imago persists while the superadded righteousness is lost. The advantage of this scheme is conceptual economy across loci, preserving a stable nature that grace heals and elevates. He also secures **natural law** as participation in eternal law through the imago’s rationality, grounding universal morality and civil order. Yet here a Reformed examiner will object that making righteousness superadded threatens to render the fall accidental to nature and to make depravity less culpable. Thomas avoids this by insisting that God originally intended nature to be under the form of original justice; the loss is catastrophic precisely because it removes the ordering form. Still, the Roman Catholic nature–grace grammar risks suggesting two tiers of finality. The question that will be pressed is whether Scripture treats rectitude as integral to created humanity or as an elevating gift. The exegesis of Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3, in our judgment, indicates restoration to an original moral form, not initial addition, which challenges the donum framework.

Calvin re-centers the doctrine along the axis of creation, fall, and redemption. In the Institutes he construes the image as consisting in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, with true righteousness as integral to human nature as created. He reads Genesis 1 to indicate that dominion flows from the image, and he treats the image as the total excellency originally given to Adam, not only rational capacities but their rectitude. His polemical opponents are twofold: on one side a scholastic two-tier rendering that he fears separates nature from moral form, on the other anthropologies that reduce humanity to embodied instinct. Calvin insists that the image is not destroyed in the fall, because humans remain human, yet he speaks starkly of its ruin with respect to righteousness and true knowledge of God. The continuity is ontological and vocational; the discontinuity is ethical and noetic. This shapes his doctrine of **federal theology**: under the **covenant of works**, Adam as image-bearer is endowed with **original righteousness** and called to obedience; the fall brings covenantal death and the corruption of the whole person. Calvin’s Christology is decisive. Christ is the Image in whom the original pattern is fully realized and to whose likeness believers are conformed by **union with Christ** through the Spirit. Renewal in the image is therefore sanctificatory and ecclesial, not merely private or civic. Calvin’s position, then, welds ontology, ethics, and soteriology. For examiners who query whether Calvin denies the body’s inclusion, the answer is that Calvin does not devalue the body; rather, he sees the image’s formal seat in the soul with bodily mediation of vocation. On whether the image grounds **natural law**, Calvin affirms that remnants of moral awareness persist as part of the imago’s structural goods, though the **noetic effects of sin** render fallen judgments unreliable without Scripture.

Francis Turretin supplies Reformed scholastic precision by distinguishing essential, integral, and consequential aspects of the image. He argues that the imago consists formally not merely in rationality, but in conformity to the law of God, that is, in **original righteousness**. He denies that righteousness is adventitious and contends that to posit the donum superadditum destabilizes the moral order of creation. He nuances persistence by distinguishing the image broadly considered, which remains in rationality and dominion capacity, and strictly considered, which is lost with respect to righteousness. This enables clarity on culpability and on common life. The imago in its broader sense grounds human dignity, **common grace**, civil society, and arts and sciences; in its stricter sense it is restored only in the regenerate. Turretin’s contribution is to resolve tensions threatened by flattening the doctrine into either structural capacity or moral habit. He secures a foundation for **natural law** that is neither Pelagian nor nihilist and integrates the imago with **federal theology** without collapsing creation into redemption.

Karl Barth represents a modern reframing that forced renewed clarity. In Church Dogmatics III he rejects a substantial account of the imago in favor of a relational and Christological one. Humanity images God as male and female in encounter, reflecting the I–Thou of divine freedom and grace. Christ is the Image, and humanity images God only in encounter with this self-revelation, not by any persistent natural property. Barth’s method is anti-metaphysical and anti-natural theology, locating theology in revelation events rather than created structures. His gain is to force attention to Christological determinations and to the ethical reality of human relations, particularly the neighbor. He also guards against ideological uses of static faculties. But his losses are substantial. If the image is reducible to relation, then infants, the severely disabled, and the solitary become marginal image-bearers. Barth himself denies this consequence, but his framework strains to explain persistent dignity across conditions. Moreover, he cannot ground universal moral obligations in a created participation available to all humans apart from the church’s proclamation, and he endangers the ontological continuity required by the incarnation’s assumption of true human nature. The Reformed reply is not a retreat to bare metaphysics but a confession that Christ is archetypal Image while creation is ectypal participation. The created imago is genuine even when marred, and it is the fit medium for redemptive renewal by the Spirit.

These figures map the genuine traditions that shaped the doctrine and expose three debate layers that examiners will press. Internally, the key question is whether **original righteousness** is integral to the image or a superadded habit. The Reformed position defended here is that it is integral. Scripture’s language of creation in righteousness and holiness and of renewal after the image points to restoration of a lost original form, not addition of an alien grace. This secures moral culpability and the coherence of **federal theology**. A second internal debate concerns whether the image is primarily substantive, relational, or functional. The best reading is integrative. Substantive structure is the seat and medium, relational orientation to God and neighbor is the order of its end, and functional dominion is its public exercise. Severing any one yields distortion: pure substantivism leaves vocation underdetermined; pure relationalism risks emptying the doctrine of ontological content; pure functionalism reduces dignity to performance. A third internal debate concerns the scope of the **dominion mandate** post-fall and in Christ. The mandate continues in a fallen world under **common grace** and is clarified under Scripture, but its eschatological fulfillment occurs only in union with the Last Adam. This avoids triumphalism while rejecting quietism.

Externally, Roman Catholic theology’s nature–grace framework and the donum superadditum provides a rival grammar that must be weighed. The Reformed critique is not of grace elevating nature, which is salutary, but of making nature originally complete without righteousness. That reading strains exegesis and attenuates the moral shock of sin. Eastern Orthodox theology often distinguishes image and likeness so that the image is natural constitution and likeness is deifying participation. There is profound truth here regarding eschatological transformation and a rich account of **sanctification**, but the proposed sharpness of the distinction is not textually demanded and risks implying that the fall did not implicate our creational nature’s original order. More externally, naturalist and evolutionary accounts reduce personhood to emergent consciousness. Our position can admit providentially guided biological development yet denies that the imago is exhausted by functional cognition. The imago includes a created rational soul, a teleology to God, and a moral order that transcends mere adaptive advantage. Without this, rights discourse floats unmoored. The Christian doctrine grounds human rights in created participation and God’s claim, not in social contract or preference.

Contemporary questions expose the doctrine to stress tests. Artificial intelligence raises the query whether a sufficiently advanced system could count as an image-bearer. The answer is no. The image belongs to human nature as created by God, which includes a spiritual principle that is not derivable from computation. Intelligence and linguistic output are not the seat of the imago; a human infant without such outputs is fully an image-bearer because of created order, whereas a machine simulating them is not. Disability and dignity require distinguishing teleological ordering from actualized capacity. The imago is not measured by present function but by created nature and end. A person with severe cognitive impairment remains ordered to God and thus bears full dignity. The male–female relation is indeed significant. Genesis places sexual differentiation under the sign of the image and vocation to fruitfulness. We reject reducing the imago to gender relations, yet we affirm that human relationality, including complementarity, is an expression of the image’s social orientation to community and mission. This undercuts both androgynous abstractions and oppressive hierarchies. Race and justice are grounded by the imago’s universal scope. The doctrine condemns dehumanizing ideologies and enjoins the church to advocate for laws and customs that honor human life. Abortion and end-of-life ethics draw immediate implications: because human beings are image-bearers from conception to natural death, they demand protection. Transhumanist projects misfire by assuming that technological enhancement can perfect our humanity. The image is renewed not by amplification of capacities but by **sanctification** through union with the archetypal Image and will be consummated in resurrection. These contemporary returns to first principles make clear that a doctrine stripped to bare relational encounter or bare cognitive function will fail under scrutiny.

We can now state and defend a comprehensive position with precision. The image of God is the created pattern of human life in which humanity, as a unity of body and rational soul, is constituted for true knowledge and love of God and neighbor, endowed with **original righteousness** and commissioned to cultivate and keep the world under God’s law. Structurally, this entails intellectual and volitional capacities that underwrite **analogical knowledge** of God and participation in **natural law**, which provides a creational moral grammar for civil life and cultural labor. Morally, it consists in conformity to God’s righteousness as intrinsic to created nature. Relationally, it orders us to communion with God and others, with marriage and society as proximate expressions, though not the ontological seat, of the imago. Functionally, it expresses itself in royal-priestly stewardship, the **dominion mandate** continued under **common grace** and regulated by Scripture. After the fall, the image persists as structural and vocational potential but is corrupted in moral rectitude and noetic function. In redemption, the Spirit conforms us to Christ, the Image, by **union with Christ** so that the image is renewed in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. In **eschatology**, the image is glorified in the resurrection, in which not only moral rectitude but bodily incorruptibility and cosmic dominion are consummated.

Objections must be faced. If the image includes righteousness, how did Adam sin? Our answer is that **original righteousness** is not impeccable glory but uprightness with posse peccare and posse non peccare. The image’s righteousness inclined to God without necessitating perseverance. Does making the image formal in the soul fall into dualism? No, because the soul’s form is inseparable from the body’s act; the image is formally in the soul yet inseparably expressed in embodied life. Does our account collapse Christology into anthropology by calling Christ the archetypal Image? No, because Christ’s Image is the personal Image of the eternal Son as incarnate, which we never possess. Our image is ectypal and dependent; we are conformed by grace to the man from heaven without sharing his hypostatic identity. Does natural law compromise sola Scriptura? Scripture is the norma normans that corrects and completes, but **natural law** is part of creational revelation that Scripture itself affirms; the imago is the created seat of this participation. What of evolutionary origins? The doctrine of providence, including concursus, allows for creaturely processes, but the imago requires divine bestowal of a rational soul and teleological order not reducible to biological emergence. Can an image-bearer be damned? Yes, which is the tragedy of sin; imaging God is a created vocation, not a saving union. Salvation is only by grace through faith in Christ, not by created dignity.

Finally, the doctrine coordinates with adjacent loci. The Trinity is the arche of the image’s relational and cognitive pattern, but the image is never a creaturely replication of trinitarian life. Providence and creation define the imago’s placement in the cosmos and the legitimacy of cultural labor. Hamartiology explains the extensive **noetic effects of sin** that distort reason, which supports a chastened account of philosophy and science. Soteriology tells the story of the image’s renewal through adoption and sanctification. Ecclesiology situates image renewal in the communion of saints, where Word and sacrament re-form human life into praise and obedience. Eschatology secures the telos: the image is not simply recovered but elevated in glory, not by nature’s pretension but by God’s gift in the resurrection. The ethical outcome is a life ordered by God’s law in love, committed to justice and mercy, confident in cultural work yet freed from utopianism.

The decisive figures thus converge on a stable center. From Irenaeus we keep the cosmic and Christological arc, without rigidly dividing image and likeness. From Augustine we keep the mind’s trinitarian orientation and the formal seat of the image in rational nature ordered to God. From Aquinas we keep the degrees of imaging and the civic import of natural law, while rejecting the donum as extrinsic to creation’s moral form. From Calvin we keep the integral righteousness and the tight Christological and covenantal framing. From Turretin we keep categorical precision and the grounding of **federal theology** and **natural law** in an integrated imago. From Barth we keep the Christological primacy and ethical seriousness of relation, while rejecting the evacuation of created structure. The position is coherent, historically informed, and capable of answering contemporary challenges without surrendering the doctrine’s metaphysical and moral content. In this way, the doctrine of the image becomes not only a foundation for human dignity but also a comprehensive map for Christian anthropology, ethics, and culture under the lordship of the triune God.
