# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema offered a robustly Reformed and holistic understanding of the **image of God**, emphasizing that it encompasses the totality of human existence rather than being limited to specific faculties or attributes. He argued that the **image** is not lost in the Fall but is distorted, and that its restoration is central to **redemption in Christ**. Hoekema’s approach integrates **structural** and **functional** aspects, highlighting humanity’s relationship with God, others, and creation.

- "The image of God in man must be understood as referring to the entire person, not to any part or aspect of man." (Created in God’s Image)

## Key Works

- Created in God’s Image (1986)
- The Christian Looks at Himself (1975)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- Five Views on Sanctification (contributor, 1987)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as the Whole Person**
    - The **image of God** refers to the entire human being, not merely the soul, intellect, or will.
    - Both **structural** (what humans are) and **functional** (what humans do) elements are included.
    - The image is present in every human, regardless of spiritual state.
    - Human dignity and worth are grounded in this comprehensive image.
    - "The image of God in the broad sense refers to the entire man as he was created by God." (Created in God’s Image)

2. **Distortion, Not Loss, in the Fall**
    - The **Fall** did not erase the image but corrupted and distorted it.
    - Fallen humanity retains the image structurally but loses its proper functioning.
    - Restoration of the image is a key aspect of **redemption**.
    - This view avoids both Pelagian optimism and total depravity pessimism regarding human nature.
    - "The image of God in man was not lost or destroyed by sin, but it was perverted and corrupted." (Created in God’s Image)

3. **Christ as the Perfect Image**
    - Jesus Christ is the true and perfect **image of God**.
    - Believers are being renewed into Christ’s image through **sanctification**.
    - The restoration of the image is both present and eschatological.
    - Union with Christ is essential for the renewal of the image.
    - "Christ is the perfect image of God, and in him the image is restored to its original glory." (Created in God’s Image)

4. **Relational and Functional Dimensions**
    - The image involves relationship with God, others, and creation.
    - Human vocation (dominion, stewardship) is integral to the image.
    - The image is expressed in community, not just individuality.
    - Ethical implications flow from the relational nature of the image.
    - "Man as image of God is a being who lives in relationship—with God, with his fellowman, and with creation." (Created in God’s Image)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The image will reach its fullness in the **consummation** at Christ’s return.
    - Present renewal is partial; final restoration awaits glorification.
    - The destiny of humanity is tied to the perfection of the image.
    - Eschatology provides hope and direction for Christian living.
    - "The image of God will be fully restored only when believers are glorified at Christ’s return." (Created in God’s Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s holistic and Reformed account of the **image of God** has significantly shaped evangelical and Reformed anthropology. His integration of structural, functional, and relational dimensions has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. By emphasizing the image’s persistence after the Fall and its restoration in Christ, Hoekema provided a framework for understanding human dignity, ethics, and sanctification that remains influential in contemporary discussions.
