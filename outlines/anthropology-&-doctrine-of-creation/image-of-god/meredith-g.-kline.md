# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline developed a distinctive understanding of the **Image of God** by emphasizing its connection to **covenant representation**, **kingly office**, and **eschatological destiny**. For Kline, the image is not merely a set of human faculties but is fundamentally tied to humanity’s role as a **vicegerent** under the **divine covenant**, with Adam serving as the original covenantal representative.

- "Man, as the image of God, is theomorphic, a finite replica of the divine King, invested with royal dignity and authority." ("Kingdom Prologue")

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King
- By Oath Consigned

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Covenant Representation**
    - The image of God is fundamentally a covenantal concept, not merely ontological.
    - Adam is constituted as the image in his role as federal head and representative.
    - The image entails responsibility to mediate God’s rule on earth.
    - The covenant structure frames the image as a dynamic, relational office.
    - "The image of God is not simply an anthropological datum but a covenantal office." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Royal and Priestly Functions**
    - Humanity’s imaging of God involves both royal dominion and priestly service.
    - The royal aspect is seen in subduing and ruling over creation.
    - The priestly aspect is expressed in consecrating the world to God.
    - Both functions are inseparable from the covenantal commission.
    - "Man’s office as image is at once royal and priestly." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The image of God is oriented toward an eschatological goal—consummation in glory.
    - Adam’s probation points to a higher, glorified state for humanity.
    - The image is dynamic, meant to be brought to fullness in the heavenly temple.
    - Christ, as the last Adam, fulfills and perfects the image.
    - "The image of God is eschatological in its orientation and destiny." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Corporate and Representative Dimensions**
    - The image is not only individual but also corporate, encompassing humanity as a whole.
    - Adam’s role as representative means all humanity participates in the image.
    - The church, as the body of Christ, is the renewed image community.
    - Redemption restores and consummates the corporate image.
    - "The corporate dimension of the image is realized in the covenant community." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity after the Fall**
    - The image remains after the fall but is marred and in need of restoration.
    - Common grace preserves aspects of the image in all humanity.
    - Redemption in Christ renews and elevates the image to its intended glory.
    - The consummation will bring the image to its eschatological fullness.
    - "Though defaced by sin, the image persists and is destined for restoration in Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and eschatological approach to the **Image of God** has significantly influenced Reformed biblical theology, especially in understanding the relationship between **covenant**, anthropology, and redemptive history. His work has shaped discussions on the federal headship of Adam and the role of Christ as the true image. Kline’s insights continue to inform debates on human dignity, vocation, and the theological structure of Genesis, making his contributions enduring in both academic and ecclesial contexts.
