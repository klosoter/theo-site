# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity provide a classic **Reformed articulation** of the **image of God**, emphasizing humanity’s original creation in **true righteousness, holiness, and knowledge**. These confessions highlight both the loss of the image through the fall and its restoration in **Christ**, situating the doctrine within the broader framework of **covenant theology**.

- "God created man good and in His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, so that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness for His praise and glory." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 6)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 6, 115
- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14, 15, 34
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads III/IV, Article 1
- Lyle D. Bierma, An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism
- Philip Schaff, The Creeds of Christendom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Image: Righteousness, Holiness, Knowledge**
    - Humanity was created in the **image of God** consisting of **true righteousness, holiness, and knowledge**.
    - This image enabled communion with God and the ability to fulfill His law.
    - The image is not merely rationality or dominion, but a moral and spiritual likeness.
    - The confessions root this understanding in both **creation** and **covenant**.
    "God created man good and in His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 6)

2. **The Fall: Loss and Corruption of the Image**
    - The fall resulted in the **corruption** and **loss** of the original image.
    - Human nature became inclined to evil, losing the ability to know and love God rightly.
    - The confessions stress the totality of this loss, affecting all faculties.
    - This loss necessitates **regeneration** and **renewal** by the Spirit.
    "Man, after he had thus made himself liable to physical and spiritual death, and became wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways..." (Belgic Confession, Article 15)

3. **Restoration in Christ**
    - The image of God is **restored** through **union with Christ**.
    - Renewal is accomplished by the **Holy Spirit** in the context of **redemption**.
    - Believers are progressively conformed to the image of Christ, the true image of God.
    - Restoration is both a present reality and an eschatological hope.
    "He makes us by His Holy Spirit partakers of Christ and all His benefits..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 20)

4. **Ethical and Eschatological Dimensions**
    - The image of God grounds human **dignity** and **ethical responsibility**.
    - The confessions connect the image to the law written on the heart.
    - The restoration of the image is linked to sanctification and future glorification.
    - The eschatological fulfillment will be perfect conformity to Christ.
    "That we may be renewed after the image of God in righteousness and holiness of truth." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 115)

5. **Covenantal Context**
    - The image of God is situated within the framework of **covenant theology**.
    - Humanity’s original state was one of covenant fellowship with God.
    - The loss and restoration of the image are interpreted through the covenants of works and grace.
    - The sacraments are seen as means of grace in the renewal of the image.
    "He has made with us an everlasting covenant of grace..." (Belgic Confession, Article 34)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed anthropology**, providing a confessional standard for understanding the **image of God** in relation to creation, fall, and redemption. Their emphasis on the moral and spiritual dimensions of the image, as well as its restoration in Christ, continues to inform Reformed theology and ethics. These confessions remain foundational for churches adhering to the continental Reformed tradition, ensuring ongoing engagement with this doctrine.
