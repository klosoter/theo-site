# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin understood the **image of God** as central to human nature, emphasizing both the original righteousness of Adam and the restoration of this image through **union with Christ**. For Calvin, the image consists primarily in the **spiritual faculties**—especially knowledge, righteousness, and holiness—rather than in physical or external attributes. The **fall** marred but did not erase the image, and its renewal is a work of the **Holy Spirit** in believers.

- "Although the divine image was not utterly annihilated and destroyed in him, yet it was so corrupted that whatever remains is frightful deformity." (Institutes 1.15.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 1, chapters 14–15)
- Commentary on Genesis (especially Genesis 1:26–27)
- Commentary on Colossians (especially Colossians 3:10)
- Sermons on Genesis
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition, secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Spiritual and Moral Likeness**
   - The image of God is chiefly located in the **soul**, particularly in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - Calvin distinguishes between the **substance** of the soul and the **qualities** that reflect God's image.
   - The image is not about physical form but about spiritual faculties.
   - True **human dignity** is grounded in this spiritual likeness to God.
   - "The image of God extends to the whole excellence by which man's nature towers over all the kinds of living creatures." (Institutes 1.15.3)

2. **Image Marred but Not Erased by the Fall**
   - The fall resulted in the **corruption** and distortion of the image, not its total loss.
   - Remnants of the image persist, but they are deeply flawed and insufficient for salvation.
   - The **natural gifts** (reason, will) remain, but the **supernatural gifts** (righteousness, holiness) are lost.
   - The remaining image is a "frightful deformity" compared to its original state.
   - "Whatever remains is frightful deformity; therefore, our deliverance begins with that restoration which we obtain through Christ." (Institutes 1.15.4)

3. **Restoration of the Image in Christ**
   - The image is **renewed** in believers through **union with Christ**.
   - This renewal is a progressive work, culminating in final glorification.
   - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent of this restoration, conforming believers to Christ's likeness.
   - The restoration involves both knowledge and holiness, reversing the effects of the fall.
   - "We are restored by the benefit of Christ to the image of God." (Institutes 1.15.4)

4. **Ethical Implications of the Image**
   - The image of God grounds the **dignity** and value of every human being.
   - Calvin uses the image to argue for love, justice, and mercy toward others.
   - The doctrine undergirds Christian ethics, especially in relation to the neighbor.
   - Even the unregenerate retain enough of the image to warrant respect and compassion.
   - "We are not to consider what men merit of themselves, but to look upon the image of God in all men." (Institutes 3.7.6)

5. **Corporate and Individual Aspects**
   - While the image is present in each individual, it also has a **corporate** dimension in humanity as a whole.
   - Calvin sees Adam as the representative head, so the image has implications for all his descendants.
   - The restoration in Christ is both personal and communal, as believers are united in the new humanity.
   - The church is the sphere where the image is most fully renewed and displayed.
   - "The image of God was displayed in Adam, and is now restored in Christ, and will be perfected in the age to come." (Commentary on Colossians 3:10)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **image of God** has profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology, emphasizing both the dignity and depravity of humanity. His nuanced distinction between the image’s substance and its moral qualities influenced later Protestant thought and debates on human nature after the fall. Calvin’s focus on the restoration of the image in Christ continues to inform discussions of sanctification, ethics, and the church’s role as the renewed humanity. His teaching remains foundational for understanding the relationship between creation, fall, and redemption in Reformed theology.
