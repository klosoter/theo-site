# Catherine McDowell (1973– )

Catherine McDowell’s work on the **Image of God** centers on a close reading of **Genesis 1:26–27** in its ancient Near Eastern context, emphasizing the relational and representational aspects of humanity’s creation. She argues that the **imago Dei** denotes both a **functional role** as God’s representative and a **relational capacity** for communion with God, distinguishing the biblical concept from surrounding ancient worldviews.

- "The image of God is not a thing or substance but a status and function bestowed upon humanity by God." ("The Image of God in the Garden of Eden")

## Key Works

- "The Image of God in the Garden of Eden: The Creation of Humankind in Genesis 2:5–3:24 in Light of the Mis pi Pit pi and Wpt-r Rituals of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt" (2015)
- "Image of God" in The Lexham Bible Dictionary
- "Humanity in the Image of God: The Creation of Humankind in Genesis 2:5–3:24" (various lectures and essays)
- "In the Shadow of the Temple: The Image of God in Genesis 1–3" (conference presentations)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Function and Status**
   - Humanity is appointed as God’s representative rulers over creation.
   - The **imago Dei** is not a physical likeness but a vocation.
   - The biblical text contrasts with ancient Near Eastern views that restrict divine image to kings.
   - All humans, male and female, equally bear this status.
   - "The biblical text democratizes the image, extending royal status to all humanity." (The Image of God in the Garden of Eden)

2. **Relational Capacity with God**
   - The image entails the ability to relate to and commune with God.
   - Humanity’s relationship with God is central to their identity.
   - The **imago Dei** is expressed in covenantal fellowship.
   - Alienation from God (sin) distorts but does not erase the image.
   - "Relationship with God is intrinsic to the meaning of the image." (The Image of God in the Garden of Eden)

3. **Ancient Near Eastern Contextualization**
   - McDowell situates Genesis within the broader ancient Near Eastern milieu.
   - She highlights similarities and differences with Mesopotamian and Egyptian rituals.
   - The biblical account subverts royal exclusivity by universalizing the image.
   - Rituals of idol consecration inform the understanding of humanity as God’s living image.
   - "Genesis redefines the concept of image by applying it to all people, not just rulers." (The Image of God in the Garden of Eden)

4. **Ethical Implications of the Image**
   - The image grounds human dignity and equality.
   - Ethical treatment of others is rooted in their status as God’s image-bearers.
   - The **imago Dei** undergirds biblical prohibitions against murder and injustice.
   - The image motivates care for creation as God’s stewards.
   - "The image of God is the foundation for human dignity and ethical responsibility." (Lexham Bible Dictionary)

5. **Continuity and Restoration of the Image**
   - The image persists after the Fall, though marred by sin.
   - Redemption in Christ aims at the restoration of the image.
   - New Testament texts (e.g., Colossians 3:10) echo the Genesis motif.
   - Eschatological hope includes the full realization of humanity’s image-bearing role.
   - "The restoration of the image is a central theme in the biblical story of redemption." (The Image of God in the Garden of Eden)

## Legacy and Impact

Catherine McDowell’s scholarship has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the **imago Dei** by integrating rigorous exegesis with ancient Near Eastern studies. Her work has influenced both academic and theological discussions, especially regarding the **ethical and relational dimensions** of the image. By emphasizing the universal and functional aspects of the image, she has contributed to ongoing debates about human dignity, gender, and vocation within the biblical tradition.
