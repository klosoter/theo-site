Created Image, Eschatological Glory: The Image of God between Nature, Covenant, and Destiny

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether the **image of God** is primarily ontological structure, ethical conformity, covenantal office, or eschatological destiny, and how these aspects cohere.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Herman Bavinck, Karl Barth.
- Relevant traditions: Latin patristic and medieval theology, Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed theology, modern dogmatics in dialogue with modern anthropology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: substantive vs relational vs functional accounts; prelapsarian image and original righteousness; image and likeness; nature and grace; Christ and the image.

  - Contemporary: gender and sexuality, disability, race and oppression, technology and AI, and how they pressure the doctrine of **imago Dei**.
- Defended position: The **image of God** is a unified but layered reality in which humanity, as a rational and relational creature, is constituted in covenant with God as royal son-servant, ordered to eschatological communion in Christ; this includes a natural structural capacity, an ethical conformity in original righteousness, a vocational calling, and an eschatological destiny, all grounded and restored in the incarnate Son as the **archetypal image**.

### ESSAY
To defend the doctrine of the **image of God** under thorough examination, one must hold together several tensions with conceptual clarity: the ontological and the covenantal, creation and eschatology, nature and grace, Christ and Adam, structure and function. The doctrine becomes confused whenever one of these poles is absolutized. The position I will defend is that the **imago Dei** is a multi-layered but unified reality: by creation humans are rational, moral, and social beings fitted for communion with God; in covenant they are commissioned as royal son-servants to reflect and represent God in the world; in eschatological orientation they are ordered, from the beginning, to consummated conformity to Christ, the **archetypal image**. Sin does not erase the image in its structural sense but corrupts its ethical form and disrupts its covenantal function, so that only in union with Christ is the image renewed and brought to its telos.

Augustine is decisive because he reframes the question of the image around the inner life of the soul and the Trinity. Against both Manichaean dualism and Pelagian optimism, Augustine insists that humanity’s greatness and misery meet in the **imago Dei**. In works such as De Trinitate and De Genesi ad litteram he locates the image principally in the rational soul, more specifically in the triadic structure of memory, understanding, and will. This gives a profoundly substantive account: the image is not first a task we perform, but a created participation in a certain mode of being. Humanity is the kind of creature capable of receiving and reflecting the divine Word. Yet Augustine refuses to leave the doctrine at the level of bare ontology. The image is also dynamic and teleological. It is created, damaged, healed, and perfected. The fall does not annihilate the image, but it renders it deformed and obscure. Hence his distinction between image and likeness: the image remains, the likeness is lost and must be restored by grace.

Examiners will likely challenge whether Augustine’s triadic psychology is exegetically warranted, or whether it imposes a speculative Trinitarian scheme on Genesis. The defense is not that his precise analogies are exegetically mandatory, but that he grasped something conceptually crucial: that the **imago Dei** must be understood as a capacity ordered to knowing and loving God. Without such a capacity account, talk of covenantal vocation or relationality risks collapsing into functionalism with no metaphysical depth. Still, Augustine’s emphasis leaves relatively underdeveloped the royal and priestly dimensions of the image that contemporary biblical theology highlights. That limitation invites later correction, not rejection of his core insight.

Thomas Aquinas receives and refines Augustine within a more articulated **nature–grace** framework. In the Summa Theologiae he distinguishes several senses of image. There is, first, a broad sense in which every rational creature bears God’s image by virtue of possessing intellect and will. This is the **substantive** layer: the image is the very form of rational nature. Second, there is an image according to grace, when the soul is conformed to God in charity. Third, there is an image according to glory, when the blessed enjoy perfect vision of God. Aquinas therefore builds an explicitly eschatological gradation into the doctrine. The **imago Dei** is both given and to be attained. It is present inchoately by nature and consummately in glory. He also accepts, though with nuance, a distinction between image and likeness, aligning likeness with a higher degree of conformity.

A key internal debate, especially for Reformed examiners, is whether Aquinas’ structure allows one to say that original righteousness is of nature or of grace, and how that bears on the image. Aquinas places original righteousness in the order of grace superadded to nature, yet as connatural to humanity’s created condition before the fall. This seems, at first glance, to risk splitting the image between a bare rational nature and an elevated supernatural end, opening the nature–grace tension that modern Roman Catholic theology has wrestled with. From a Reformed vantage point, one must say both that man was created with a real **covenant of works** orientation to eschatological life and that this orientation was not owed to human nature as such, but was a free bestowal of God. The advantage of Aquinas’ scheme is its clear gradation of image in nature, grace, and glory. The danger is that the teleological thrust of the image can appear to be extrinsic, such that nature is complete in itself and only accidentally ordered to God. A Reformed correction insists that man’s rational nature is created already historically situated in covenant, ordered toward Sabbath consummation, which is not an add-on but the very meaning of being the image.

John Calvin introduces a crucial redirection by locating the **image of God** not only in metaphysical constitution but in ethical righteousness and true knowledge of God. In the Institutes he can speak of the image as consisting in “true righteousness and holiness,” appealing to texts like Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3. He strongly emphasizes the corruption of the image in the fall. Yet Calvin also acknowledges that something of the image remains in fallen humanity, for on that basis murder is still condemned and human faculties still operate. This apparent tension has generated extensive internal debate within Reformed theology: if the image is essentially righteousness and holiness, is it not obliterated in sin; and if it remains, is sin as radical as we claim.

The best reading is to see Calvin as moving toward a layered account. In terms of **structural capacity** as rational and moral creatures, humans remain the image. In terms of ethical conformity and covenantal relationship, the image is ruined and must be renewed in Christ. Calvin also emphasizes that the true and full image is seen in Christ the mediator. Here he intersects, though in a very different idiom, with Aquinas’ gradation of image and with Augustine’s dynamic view. The image is not merely an initial condition but an eschatological destiny grounded in union with the risen Christ, the **archetypal image** in whom believers are conformed.

Herman Bavinck is decisive because he synthesizes and refines this tradition into a comprehensive **Reformed anthropology** that guards against both rationalistic substance-talk and thin relationalism. In his Reformed Dogmatics he insists that the image of God is “the entire man in the entire man,” encompassing body and soul, faculties and relations, knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. For Bavinck, the image is not a detachable property or a small region of human nature. It is the human as such, as God’s created analogue. He criticizes both Roman Catholic tendencies to restrict the image to the higher powers of the soul and Lutheran tendencies to identify it solely with original righteousness.

Bavinck articulates three tightly integrated dimensions. First, the image is **structural**: humanity possesses a created constitution as a rational, moral, and religious being oriented toward God. This remains after the fall. Second, the image is **ethical**: it includes original righteousness, an inherent rectitude of all powers rightly ordered to God. This is lost in the fall. Third, the image is **teleological**: it is oriented toward eschatological conformity to Christ. From the beginning, Adam as image-bearer was not in a static state but in via toward glorified life. Here Bavinck deepens Reformed **covenant theology**, integrating the **covenant of works** with **eschatological image**. Adam is created in the image and simultaneously called to attain, by covenant obedience, the consummate likeness that in the end is freely bestowed in Christ.

Examiners may press whether this multi-layer description risks positing multiple images. The answer is that Bavinck’s genius lies precisely in refusing such fragmentation. It is one image viewed under different aspects: what we are by nature, what we are called to be in covenant, and what we shall be in glory. The fall devastates the ethical and covenantal aspect but cannot destroy the structural aspect without destroying humanity altogether. This allows Bavinck to affirm both the profound dignity of all humans, including the unregenerate, and the radical necessity of regeneration for the restoration of the image.

Karl Barth enters the doctrine from a very different angle. In the Church Dogmatics he decisively shifts the focus toward a **relational and christological** understanding. Barth argues that the image is not located in human faculties or moral qualities, but in the relational structure of being male and female in encounter. On his reading of Genesis 1, “Let us make man” finds its echo in “male and female he created them.” Humanity images the triune God in being-in-encounter, in dialogue, in I–Thou relationship. Moreover, Barth insists that Christ is the one true **imago Dei**. Humanity images God only as it corresponds to the history of Jesus Christ revealed in the covenant of grace. This severely relativizes any purely “natural” doctrine of the image. For Barth, the **imago Dei** is essentially covenantal, christological, and relational.

Barth’s proposal has been enormously influential in modern theology, especially in relational and social trinitarian accounts of the image. Yet it also provokes necessary criticism. First, his strong identification of the image with male–female relationality invites questions about single or celibate persons, about interhuman relations more broadly, and about whether difference is essential to imaging God. Second, his suspicion of any “capacity talk” threatens the catholic conviction that humans really are constituted as certain kinds of beings, analogically corresponding to God, not merely addressed in an external covenant. Third, his collapsing of creation and grace into one covenantal history challenges Reformed commitments to a real prelapsarian natural order and a distinct **covenant of works**. 

A Reformed response should affirm Barth’s christological concentration and his insistence that the image is not an autonomous possession but a gift realized in relation. It should also appreciate the emphasis on interpersonal communion as a real dimension of the **imago Dei**. However, one must resist his near-erasure of structural ontology and his identification of the whole doctrine with the history of the covenant of grace. The image is intrinsically oriented to Christ, but it is present by creation, in order that such an orientation can be historically realized in covenant.

These figures together frame the key internal debates that examiners will press. One central debate concerns **substantive**, **relational**, and **functional** accounts of the image. Substantive accounts, exemplified by Augustine, Aquinas, and Bavinck, locate the image in what humans are: rational, moral, spiritual beings. Relational accounts, following Barth, stress who we are-in-communion, in relation to God and others. Functional accounts, often drawing on ANE royal ideology, highlight what humans are called to do as God’s vicegerents and priests, exercising dominion and stewardship. The position I defend maintains that all three aspects are true yet hierarchically ordered. There is no relation or function without a subject that can relate and act. Thus a **structural capacity** account has priority: humanity is the kind of being that can know, love, and serve God. On that basis, God enters covenant relation and assigns royal-priestly vocation. Structure grounds relation and function, and relation and function express and fulfill structure. To absolutize one aspect, as if the image were only dominion, or only relation, or only intellect, distorts the biblical picture.

A second internal debate concerns the distinction between image and likeness. Eastern traditions often saw likeness as the goal of deification, while Latin theology varied. Augustine and Aquinas treat the distinction but relativize it; Calvin tends to use the terms interchangeably. In a Reformed framework it is best not to build too much dogmatic load onto that lexical pairing, which in Hebrew poetry likely functions as a hendiadys. However, the instinct to distinguish structural image and eschatological likeness can reflect a real biblical pattern: humanity is created imaging God, yet is also called and destined to a fuller conformity, as seen in texts that speak of being renewed according to the image and being conformed to the image of the Son. The risk is projecting that theological distinction mechanically onto “image” and “likeness” as if scripture itself maintains that technical usage.

The third internal debate lies in the proportionality between image and original righteousness. Is original righteousness identical with the image, or an adornment of it. Reformed orthodoxy generally followed Calvin in stating that the image includes original righteousness, yet Bavinck refines this into the structural–ethical distinction already mentioned. This has implications for doctrines of sin and common grace. If the image is entirely lost, we approach an almost Manichaean view of fallen man. If it is wholly intact, sin becomes superficial. The layered account allows us to say that fallen humans remain truly human and still in the image structurally, but that ethically they are in radical enmity and unable to fulfill their image-bearing vocation.

Turning to external debates, the background of ancient Near Eastern royal ideology is significant. In surrounding cultures, the “image” of a deity often referred to the king or to cultic statues that represented the god’s rule. Genesis democratizes this language: not only the king, but all humanity is created as **royal image**. Humanity as a whole is God’s authorized representative and vicegerent on earth. This fits well with a **functional** dimension of the image: exercising dominion, subduing the earth, filling it. Yet Genesis conspicuously lacks any carved representation of God. The living human person is the authorized image. This simultaneously confers dignity and sets strict limits on idol-making. Examiners may press whether the ANE background makes the doctrine mere ancient royal propaganda. The answer is that God appropriates that idiom while radically transforming it: rather than legitimizing arbitrary power, the image grounds a universal vocation to serve and steward under God’s righteous rule.

Philosophical anthropologies pose another external challenge. Enlightenment accounts often equate human uniqueness with rational autonomy or self-legislation, decoupled from reference to God. Contemporary materialist views deny any intrinsic metaphysical uniqueness of humans; we are at most a particularly complex biological system. Against both, the doctrine of **imago Dei** anchors human dignity in a theological ontology: humans are created analogues of God, capable of **analogical knowledge**, responsible to a personal Lord, designed for worship. This allows for both affirmation of empirical continuity with animals and a principled insistence on qualitative difference. The examined defense must clearly distinguish between empirical similarity and ontological status. Brains and bodies can be studied along a continuum with other organisms; being in the image is a theological judgment about vocation and relation in light of revelation.

Contemporary debates bring concentrated pressure on the doctrine. Questions of gender and sexuality test whether male and female are equally and fully in the image. Scripture is explicit that both are created in God’s image and jointly entrusted with dominion. Any theological move that subordinates women ontologically or treats them as a secondary mode of imaging violates this. Yet the sexual differentiation is not accidental to imaging. In line with Barth’s better instincts, one can say that human relationality, including the capacity for covenantal union that is nevertheless non-fusional, expresses something of the richness of divine life. That does not entail that marriage is necessary for imaging God, but rather that the human community as a whole, in its differentiated unity, more fully manifests the image.

Disability presents another test. If the image is tied too tightly to specific capacities such as rational reflection or verbal communication, what becomes of those with severe cognitive impairments. A robust structural account must say that the image is not a sliding scale measure of functioning but an ontological status grounded in God’s creative act and covenantal intention. Capacities can be latent, undeveloped, or impaired and yet belong to the essence of the creature. Bavinck’s “entire man” language is crucial here. Dependence, vulnerability, and interdependence are not deficits relative to the image but conditions under which the image-bearing reality is displayed. Examiners may press whether this is coherent with a rationalist tradition. The answer is that the rationalist strand must itself be corrected: reason is one paramount expression of human nature, but the image is broader and deeper than conscious discursive activity.

Race and oppression have invoked the image doctrine both for harm and healing. Historically, some Christians have implicitly or explicitly denied the full image-bearing status of certain peoples. This stands in open contradiction to Genesis and to the catholic tradition. The doctrine, rightly understood, undercuts all racial hierarchies: every human being, from every tribe and people, bears God’s image with equal dignity. This gives a non-negotiable theological ground for rejecting slavery, racism, and all dehumanizing structures. Moreover, the corporate and eschatological dimensions of the image, as fulfilled in a multi-ethnic body united to Christ, highlight that no single culture or people exhausts the possibilities of imaging God. The manifold wisdom of God is refracted through the diversity of renewed image-bearers.

Technology and artificial intelligence raise the provocative question of whether a sufficiently advanced machine could bear the image of God. The answer, from within classical and Reformed anthropology, must be no. The **imago Dei** is not reducible to information processing, rational problem-solving, or language use. It is bound up with being a psychophysical creature, a unity of body and soul, called into covenant by God. Even if a machine could simulate many cognitive functions, it would not thereby become a creature with a destiny to behold God’s face. To call an AI an image-bearer would be to re-anchor human dignity in functionalist criteria that the doctrine precisely resists. However, reflection on AI can help us clarify that our own imaging is not predicated on performance metrics but on God’s creative and covenantal intention.

At this point one must draw the threads into a coherent, defensible doctrine. The **image of God** in humanity is best defined as the whole human person, in body and soul, created as a rational, moral, and relational analogue of God, placed in covenant to know, love, and represent him, and ordered from the beginning to eschatological conformity to Christ. Structurally, every human being is endowed with the capacities and orientation that make such relation and vocation possible. Ethically, humanity was originally constituted in true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, which are intrinsic to imaging God rightly. Vocationally, humanity is charged with royal and priestly service, to exercise dominion and cultivate creation under God’s law. Eschatologically, the image looks forward to consummation: to be like him, because we shall see him as he is.

Sin corrupts but does not annihilate the image. The structural aspect remains; the ethical and vocational aspects are perverted. Human reason turns to idolatry, human community to oppression, human dominion to exploitation. Yet it is precisely fallen image-bearers whom God addresses in covenant, and whom he redeems. Christ, as the eternal Son, is the **archetypal image**; as incarnate, crucified, and risen, he is the firstfruits of the eschatological human. Union with Christ is therefore the key to the renewal of the image. Regeneration begins this renewal; sanctification progresses it; glorification perfects it. The New Testament’s language of being conformed to the image of the Son and being renewed after the image of the creator is not a marginal note but the fulfillment of Genesis.

This position safeguards several theological loci in coherence. In relation to **Trinity**, it affirms that imaging does not imply any univocal likeness between God and creature, preserving **analogical knowledge** and **divine simplicity**. In relation to **Christology**, it insists that the humanity of Christ is the definitive instance of imaging, yet without collapsing the imago into the incarnation such that Adam’s status is erased. In relation to **covenant theology**, it unites creation and **covenant of works** with the **covenant of grace** in a single teleological arc of image-bearing destiny. In relation to **soteriology**, it frames salvation not only as forgiveness but as re-creation, the restoration and elevation of the image. And in relation to **ethics**, it grounds human dignity, rights, and responsibilities not in secular consensus but in God’s creative address.

Under oral examination, the pressure points will be whether one can hold together ontology and history, nature and covenant, Christ and Adam, without collapsing distinctions. The layered, christocentric, covenantally situated account developed via Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin, Bavinck, and in critical engagement with Barth, provides the scaffolding for such a defense. The **image of God** is neither a bare metaphysical substrate nor a sheer command to perform; it is a created, gifted, and destined reality in which humanity, in Christ, is summoned to reflect the glory of the triune God.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **image of God** is the whole human person, body and soul, created as a rational, moral, and relational analogue of God, placed in covenant to know, love, and represent him, and ordered from the beginning to eschatological conformity to Christ, the **archetypal image**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: substantive, soul-centered, dynamic image as rational capacity ordered to God, damaged but not destroyed by sin.
  - Thomas Aquinas: graded image in nature, grace, and glory, with rational nature as structural base and original righteousness as superadded yet connatural gift.
  - John Calvin: strong emphasis on image as true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, with a layered sense in which structural image remains and ethical image is ruined.
  - Herman Bavinck: synthetic Reformed account of image as “entire man in the entire man,” integrating structural, ethical, and eschatological dimensions within **covenant theology**.
  - Karl Barth: relational and christological focus, image as being-in-encounter and as realized in the covenantal history of Jesus Christ, critiqued for underplaying structural ontology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: substantive vs relational vs functional accounts; image–likeness distinction; extent of image’s loss in the fall; relation of image to original righteousness and to **covenant of works**.
  - External: ANE royal ideology and democratized vicegerency; Enlightenment and materialist anthropologies; idolatry and image-making.
  - Contemporary: gender and equality; disability and capacity; race and oppression; personhood vs performance; technology and AI as non-image-bearing artifacts.
- Defended position: A unified, layered **imago Dei** that is structurally ontological, ethically righteous, vocationally royal-priestly, and eschatologically oriented to conformity with Christ, corrupted but not erased by sin and renewed in union with the incarnate Son.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is the image of God lost or retained after the fall? Structurally retained in human nature, ethically and covenantally ruined, and only restored and perfected in Christ.
  - Where exactly is the image located: in soul, body, or relation. In the whole psychophysical person, with rational and moral capacities grounding relational and functional dimensions.
  - How does your view differ from Barth’s relational account. I affirm relational and christological emphases but insist on a real created structural capacity and a distinct prelapsarian covenant order.
  - Does identifying the image with rationality exclude the severely disabled. No, because the image is an ontological status with capacities that may be latent or impaired, not a performance threshold.
  - Can an advanced AI ever be in the image of God. No, since the image requires a created human nature, body–soul unity, and divine covenantal address, not merely complex functional behavior.
