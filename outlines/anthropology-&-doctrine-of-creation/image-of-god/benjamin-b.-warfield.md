# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the **Image of God** as a central aspect of human nature, emphasizing its connection to **original righteousness**, **rationality**, and **moral capacity**. He maintained that the image was not lost in the Fall, but rather **marred**, and that its restoration is accomplished through **union with Christ** and **sanctification**. Warfield’s understanding is deeply rooted in the **Reformed tradition**, highlighting both the ontological and ethical dimensions of the image.

- "The image of God is not wholly lost, but only marred, by the fall." ("The Divine Image in Man," Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Divine Image in Man" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2: Biblical Doctrines
- "The Human Development of Jesus" (in The Person and Work of Christ)
- Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 1 (ed. Meeter)
- The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible (for broader theological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Rational-Moral Capacity**
   - The image consists fundamentally in humanity’s **rationality** and **moral agency**.
   - Warfield distinguishes between the **structural** (ontological) and **ethical** (functional) aspects of the image.
   - He affirms that all humans retain the structural image after the Fall.
   - The ethical aspect is damaged but not obliterated by sin.
   - "It is in his reason and his free will, as these are exercised in righteousness and holiness, that man is the image of God." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Original Righteousness**
   - The image includes **original righteousness** as a created endowment.
   - Warfield argues that Adam was created in a state of true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - The loss of original righteousness is a key effect of the Fall.
   - Restoration of this righteousness is central to redemption in Christ.
   - "Man was created not merely innocent, but positively holy, in the image of God." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Image Marred, Not Lost**
   - The Fall **marred** but did not erase the image of God in humanity.
   - All people, regardless of spiritual state, retain the image in a damaged form.
   - This provides the basis for human dignity and moral responsibility post-Fall.
   - The restoration of the image is a work of **grace** in Christ.
   - "The image of God is defaced, but not destroyed, by sin." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Christ as the Perfect Image**
   - Christ is the **true and perfect image of God**.
   - In Christ, the image is fully revealed and restored.
   - Believers are renewed in the image through **union with Christ**.
   - Sanctification is the process by which the image is progressively restored in the believer.
   - "It is in Christ that the image of God is perfectly realized and in whom it is restored to us." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

5. **Ethical and Eschatological Restoration**
   - The restoration of the image is both ethical (holiness, righteousness) and eschatological (final glorification).
   - The process begins in regeneration and is completed at glorification.
   - The ethical renewal is inseparable from the work of the Holy Spirit.
   - The eschatological hope is conformity to the image of the risen Christ.
   - "The renewal of the image is the goal of redemption and the consummation of sanctification." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **Image of God** has shaped Reformed anthropology, especially in its insistence on the enduring dignity of fallen humanity and the centrality of Christ in restoration. His careful distinction between the structural and ethical aspects of the image has influenced later theological and philosophical discussions. Warfield’s legacy endures in contemporary debates over human nature, dignity, and the relationship between creation and redemption. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robust, biblically grounded doctrine of the image within the Reformed tradition.
