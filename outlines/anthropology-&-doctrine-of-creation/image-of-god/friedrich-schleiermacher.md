# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **image of God** as rooted primarily in the human capacity for **God-consciousness** rather than in traditional categories of **original righteousness** or **rational faculties**. He emphasized the relational and experiential dimension of the image, seeing it as the foundation for human religious experience and the possibility of redemption.

- "The true essence of religion is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling; it is a definite feeling, that of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as God-Consciousness**
   - The **image of God** is primarily the human capacity for **God-consciousness**.
   - This consciousness is a feeling of absolute dependence on God.
   - It is not a static attribute but a dynamic relational orientation.
   - The image is realized in the individual's religious experience.
   - "The common element in all religious experience is the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Substantialist Views**
   - Schleiermacher rejects the idea that the image consists in rationality or moral faculties.
   - He opposes the traditional Reformed focus on **original righteousness**.
   - The image is not a metaphysical substance or quality.
   - It is instead a relational and experiential reality.
   - "The image of God does not consist in any single faculty, but in the whole constitution of man as related to God." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Universality and Restoration**
   - All humans possess the potential for **God-consciousness**.
   - The image is not lost in the Fall, but its development is hindered.
   - Redemption in Christ restores and perfects this consciousness.
   - The process of sanctification is the maturation of the image.
   - "Redemption is the restoration of the God-consciousness in its purity and power." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Christ as the Perfect Image**
   - Christ uniquely embodies the perfect **God-consciousness**.
   - He is the archetype and fulfillment of the image in humanity.
   - Believers are conformed to Christ through participation in his consciousness.
   - The church is the community where the image is most fully realized.
   - "In Christ, the God-consciousness reached its highest possible degree." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical Implications**
   - The image of God grounds human dignity and moral responsibility.
   - Ethical life flows from the development of God-consciousness.
   - Social and communal dimensions are essential to the image.
   - True ethical action is an expression of dependence on God.
   - "The ethical life is the necessary expression of the God-consciousness." (Christian Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **image of God** shifted theological focus from metaphysical attributes to the experiential and relational aspects of human existence. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** influenced later liberal theology and shaped modern discussions on religious experience. While his views diverged from classical Reformed theology, they opened new avenues for understanding human nature, redemption, and the role of Christ as the true image. Schleiermacher remains a pivotal figure in the development of modern theological anthropology.
