# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth redefined the **image of God** by grounding it in the relational encounter between God and humanity, rather than in human faculties or capacities. For Barth, the **imago Dei** is most fully revealed in **Jesus Christ** and is fundamentally relational, reflecting the **covenantal correspondence** between God and human beings, and among humans themselves.

- "The image of God in which man was created is thus to be understood as the existence of man in his relationship to God and to his fellow-man." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics III/1: The Doctrine of Creation
- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth: The Humanity of God
- Karl Barth’s Doctrine of Creation (ed. John Webster)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christological Grounding of the Image**
    - The **image of God** is supremely revealed in **Jesus Christ** as the true human.
    - Humanity’s dignity and calling are defined by conformity to Christ.
    - The imago Dei is not a static possession but a dynamic reality in Christ.
    - All human beings participate in the image as they are related to Christ.
    - "Jesus Christ is Himself the image of God, and it is in Him that man is created." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

2. **Relational and Covenantal Structure**
    - The image is expressed in relationship: to God and to fellow humans.
    - Human existence is fundamentally **covenantal** and dialogical.
    - The relational aspect mirrors the **Trinitarian** fellowship.
    - The imago Dei is realized in community, not in isolation.
    - "Man is not man as an individual; he is man in fellowship." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

3. **Rejection of Substantialist Interpretations**
    - Barth rejects the idea that the image consists in reason, will, or any human faculty.
    - The image is not a quality or capacity inherent in human nature.
    - Substantialist views obscure the dynamic, relational character of the image.
    - The imago Dei is not a possession but a calling and event.
    - "The image of God is not a structure, but an event." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

4. **Universal yet Eschatological Dimension**
    - All humans bear the image, but its fullness is eschatological.
    - The image is both a present reality and a future hope.
    - Human sin distorts but does not erase the image.
    - Restoration of the image is promised in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "The image of God is not destroyed but obscured and perverted by sin." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

5. **Ethical Implications**
    - The relational image grounds human dignity and ethical responsibility.
    - Human rights and justice are rooted in the imago Dei.
    - The image calls for love, respect, and service to others.
    - Ethics flows from participation in God’s covenantal fellowship.
    - "To be in the image of God is to be responsible before God and for one’s fellow-man." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **relational and Christological** interpretation of the image of God has profoundly influenced modern theology, challenging both classical and modern anthropologies. His emphasis on **covenant** and **community** has shaped discussions on human dignity, ethics, and social justice. Barth’s approach continues to provoke debate and inspire constructive retrieval in contemporary theological anthropology.
