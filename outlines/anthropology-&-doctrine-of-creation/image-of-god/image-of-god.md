### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The doctrine of the **image of God** states that God created humankind to reflect, represent, and relate to him in a creaturely mode ordered to communion and rule under God. In classic formulation, the image names a creaturely capacity and calling characterized by **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness**, with a functional task of dominion and a destiny of glory in **Christ as true image**. The doctrine belongs to **anthropology within creation**, yet it is inseparable from **Christology and Soteriology** because the image is both given in creation and renewed in redemption unto eschatological consummation.

Dogmatically, the **imago Dei** stands at the crossroads of **Theology Proper** and human nature, since it presupposes **divine aseity and simplicity** and grounds creaturely correspondence that is analogical rather than univocal. The church therefore speaks **analogical predication** when describing human wisdom, love, and righteousness as imaging God. Methodologically, theology must integrate **exegetical description**, **historical development**, and **dogmatic synthesis**, resisting reduction to a single model by acknowledging **substantive-relational-functional models** as complementary rather than mutually exclusive.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
Genesis 1:26–28 introduces *tselem* and *demut* as God announces, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, granting dominion over creatures and blessing with fruitfulness. The terms *tselem* and *demut* overlap semantically, and their pairing emphasizes that humans are fashioned to be **royal representatives** of the Creator. Ancient Near Eastern parallels envisioned kings as images of a deity; Genesis democratizes this royalty so that male and female together bear the **image of God**. The immediate commission to subdue the earth and exercise **dominion** clarifies the functional dimension, while the creation of humans as male and female indicates a **relational communion** ordered to procreation and stewardship.

The canonical pattern deepens with Genesis 5:1–3, where Adam begets a son in his likeness and image, and with Genesis 9:6, which grounds the prohibition of murder in the **image of God**, thereby conferring universal **human dignity** postfall. Psalm 8 celebrates humanity crowned with glory and honor, reflecting **vicegerency under God**. The New Testament gathers these threads christologically: Christ is the **image of the invisible God** in Colossians 1:15 and the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the **image of God** in 2 Corinthians 4:4. Believers are being conformed to the image of his Son in Romans 8:29 and will bear the **image of the man of heaven** in 1 Corinthians 15:49.

Paul links the image to moral renewal: Ephesians 4:24 speaks of the new self created after the likeness of God in true **righteousness and holiness**, and Colossians 3:10 speaks of renewal in knowledge after the **image of its Creator**. James 3:9 condemns cursing people made in the **likeness of God**, reinforcing ethical implications for speech and community. The identification of **Christ as true image** safeguards that imaging is derivative and Christocentric. The church reads Genesis 1–2 in light of **Nicaea 325** and **Chalcedon 451**, affirming that the Son who images the Father *ad intra* becomes human to restore the image *ad extra*, a result the New Testament frames in terms of **sanctification and glorification**.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Patristic theology offered several trajectories. **Irenaeus** around c. 180 distinguished **image and likeness**, sometimes locating image in human rationality and freedom and likeness in the gift of grace lost in the fall and restored in Christ. **Athanasius** in On the Incarnation (c. 318) tied the image to participation, arguing that sin defaces the image and that the **Incarnation restores and elevates** it. **Augustine** in De Trinitate (399–419) developed a psychological analogy, locating the image in the **trinitarian structure of the mind** as memory, understanding, and will, while insisting that the image reaches fulfillment in **the vision of God**.

Medieval scholasticism advanced precision. **Thomas Aquinas** in Summa Theologiae I.93 taught that the image is principally in the **intellectual nature** ordered to God, with gradations: all humans bear the image; the just bear it more perfectly; the blessed will bear it most perfectly in glory. He distinguished **image and likeness** as nature and grace under a **nature-grace** schema marked by the **donum superadditum**. Late medieval debates nuanced whether original righteousness was created conjoined with nature or superadded; these debates became fault lines at **Trent 1545–1563**. Throughout, the church maintained that sin damages, but does not annihilate, the **imago Dei**, preserving moral order and dignity even as **concupiscence** disorders love.

Reformation accounts reoriented the conversation to **Christ and justification**. **Luther** emphasized that the **image of God in the narrow sense** refers to original righteousness, lost through sin and restored only through Christ, while a broader sense persists in human reason and relationality. **Calvin** stressed that the image is defaced but not extinguished, locating its renewal in **union with Christ** by the Spirit and its consummation in glory, as in his Institutes (1559). Post-Reformation scholastics codified this in confessions, culminating in the **Westminster standards 1646–1648**, which define the image in terms of **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness**, embedded in a covenantal framework that honors both creation and redemptive **federal headship**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
The **Westminster Confession of Faith 4.2** teaches that humanity was created male and female, after the image of God, in **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness**, with the law written on the heart and power to fulfill it; yet mutable and liable to fall. This classic statement combines **substantive moral quality** with functional vocation, grounding **human dignity** while explaining the fall and the need for **Christic renewal**. The Larger Catechism amplifies that the image entails **dominion** over creatures, aligning with Genesis 1:26–28 and Psalm 8.

**Old Princeton** developed a careful distinction between the image broadly considered and the image strictly considered. **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield**, notably Warfield's 1915 essay The Image of God in Man, argued that the image includes the rational-moral nature as structural, with **original righteousness** as the ethical completion lost through sin. They defended **common grace** and universal **human dignity** on the basis of the structural image, while rooting salvation in **regeneration and sanctification** that restore the ethical aspect. This enabled Princeton to resist both naturalistic reduction and perfectionist moralism.

**Dutch Neo-Calvinism** reframed the issue through **creation-fall-redemption** within a comprehensive worldview. **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** distinguished the **structural image** that persists in human nature from the **ethical image** corrupted by sin and restored in Christ. Bavinck insisted that the image is inherently **Christological**, pointing to **Christ as true image** and our destiny in conformity to him, while extending the image's cultural implications into **sphere sovereignty** and the **cultural mandate**. This yields a robust program for science, art, and politics as arenas of renewed imaging through **common and special grace**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology, drawing on **Aquinas** and developed at **Trent 1545–1563**, often describes the image as the **intellectual soul's orientation to God**, with **likeness** corresponding to **sanctifying grace**. The fall removed the **donum superadditum**, leaving nature wounded but not destroyed; grace heals and elevates nature to **the beatific vision**. **Vatican II's Gaudium et Spes 1965** emphasizes **human dignity** and Christ as the revealer of man to himself, anchoring the **imago Dei** in both creation and **Christological fulfillment**. Eastern Orthodox theology prioritizes **theosis**, seeing image as irrevocable capacity and likeness as dynamic movement by **synergy** into participation in the **divine energies**, as articulated in **Palamite** tradition from the 1340s.

Lutheran theology classically asserts that the **image of God narrowly** consists in original righteousness, wholly lost in the fall, while **reason and will** remain as natural endowments. The **Formula of Concord 1577** codifies this distinction, stressing that **justification by faith** restores righteousness coram Deo, with sanctification renewing life toward **Christic likeness**. Modern Protestant voices complicate the picture. **Karl Barth** recast the image as **relational correspondence**, reading Genesis 1:27's male and female as dialogical analogy to the **triune communion**. Critics charge speculative projection, yet Barth helpfully re-centers the image on **Christology** and divine address. Recent evangelical proposals, such as **John Kilner's destiny model** (2015), argue that the image is fundamentally our **God-given destiny in Christ**, which grounds equal dignity irrespective of present capacities, resisting **functionalism** that marginalizes the vulnerable.

Analytic and philosophical theologians debate human constitution and its relation to the image. **Lynne Rudder Baker's constitution view** of persons, **J. P. Moreland's substance dualism**, and **nonreductive physicalism** in contemporary neurotheology frame the **imago Dei** in terms of **personal identity** and mental causation. **Oliver Crisp** and others caution that metaphysical accounts must serve, not supplant, **biblical and dogmatic constraints**, particularly **Christ as true image** and the teleology of **glorification**. Across these proposals, the image functions as a bridge concept spanning **metaphysics, ethics, and soteriology**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
An ongoing debate concerns **evolutionary origins** and a historical Adam. Some propose that God conferred the **imago Dei** upon a hominin population, emphasizing the structural image as rational-moral capacity under **providence**, while others defend a **federal headship** through a historical pair as in **Romans 5**. The exegetical core remains Genesis 1–3 and the New Testament's **Christ-Adam typology**, read with hermeneutical care about genre and **ancient Near Eastern** context. A related question asks whether the image admits of degrees; the best account affirms equal **human dignity** grounded in divine bestowal, while acknowledging degrees of **conformity to Christ** through **sanctification and glorification**.

Ethical objections target the misuse of **dominion** to justify exploitation. Scripture counters by framing dominion as **priestly-royal stewardship**, patterned on God's own **benevolent rule** and clarified in Jesus's **servant lordship**. Contemporary topics press the doctrine: **gender and social ontology** in relation to male-and-female as image; **race and disability** regarding inviolable dignity; and **artificial intelligence** relative to agency, consciousness, and moral status. A theologically responsible response anchors dignity in **imago Dei** rather than in fluctuating **functional capacities**, thereby resisting technocratic or eugenic logics and resisting idolatrous extensions of **instrumental reason** to human worth.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The **imago Dei** anchors anthropology in **Trinity and Christology**. Because the Son is the **image of the Father** *ad intra*, the eternal archetype of imaging is personal and filial, not abstract form. In the economy, **Christ as true image** becomes human, so that by **union with Christ** and the indwelling Spirit we are renewed to bear that image. This grounds a participatory account where imaging is a Spirit-enabled **communion and conformity**, not merely a static endowment. The doctrine also disciplines **natural theology**, as we recognize analogical likeness alongside infinite **Creator-creature distinction**.

Soteriologically, the image structures **justification and sanctification** as renewal toward **righteousness and holiness** and culminates in **glorification** when we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is, echoing 1 John 3:2. Ecclesiologically, the church as **new humanity** in Christ images God corporately in reconciled Jew and Gentile and male and female, manifesting **communion-in-difference** by the Spirit's gifts. Ethically, the image underwrites **human rights and dignity**, stewardly **dominion**, and neighbor love, resonating with **James 3:9** and **Genesis 9:6**. Eschatologically, imaging stretches toward **beatific vision** and **theosis**-like participation understood within Reformed commitments to **grace elevating nature** without collapsing the **Creator-creature distinction**.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, teaching the **imago Dei** forms congregations in **dignity and humility**: dignity, because every neighbor images God and demands justice; humility, because imaging is derivative and perfected only in **Christic conformity**. Catechesis can tie **baptismal identity** to renewal of the image, preach **sanctification** as Spirit-led restoration in **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness**, and frame vocation as **priestly-royal stewardship** in work and culture. Liturgically, practices of confession renounce **idolatry** that deforms the image, the Eucharist nourishes **union with Christ**, and benedictions commission the people to bear **peaceable dominion** in their callings. In public theology, the church can defend the unborn, the aged, the disabled, and the stranger on the basis of **human dignity**, resist racialized hierarchies by confessing a **new humanity**, and approach technology with **discerned creativity** rather than naive embrace or fearful rejection.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
To confess the **image of God** is to receive creation as gift, redemption as renewal in **Christ as true image**, and consummation as our glorified destiny of **holy communion and wise dominion** before the Triune God.
