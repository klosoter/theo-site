# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed understanding** of the **image of God**, emphasizing both the **natural** and **moral aspects** of human nature as reflecting God's character. He maintained that while the **natural faculties** (reason, will, affections) persist after the Fall, the **moral likeness** (original righteousness) was lost and is restored only in **redemption**.

- "The image of God, in which man was created, included knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on Anthropology)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- "Man’s Original State" (Princeton Review, 1857)
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Natural and Moral Likeness**
    - The image of God consists of both **natural faculties** (reason, will) and **moral qualities** (righteousness, holiness).
    - The **natural image** remains after the Fall; the **moral image** was lost.
    - The **moral likeness** is restored in **regeneration** through Christ.
    - Hodge distinguishes between the **structural** and **ethical** aspects of the image.
    - "The image of God, therefore, in its widest sense, includes the whole nature of man, as an intelligent, moral, and immortal being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Image and Human Dignity**
    - The **image of God** grounds the unique dignity and value of every human being.
    - All humans, regardless of condition, retain the **natural image** and thus possess inherent worth.
    - This doctrine undergirds moral obligations toward others.
    - The **universality** of the image is a basis for Christian ethics.
    - "All men, whatever their condition, retain the image of God in the essential elements of their nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Effect of the Fall on the Image**
    - The Fall resulted in the loss of the **moral image** (original righteousness), not the **natural faculties**.
    - Fallen humanity is still rational and moral, but now corrupted.
    - The **restoration** of the moral image is a work of **grace**.
    - Hodge rejects the idea that the image is entirely lost in the Fall.
    - "The loss of the moral image of God does not involve the loss of reason, conscience, or free agency." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Christ as the Perfect Image**
    - Christ is the **perfect image of God**, both as the eternal Son and as the true man.
    - Believers are renewed after the image of Christ through **sanctification**.
    - The restoration of the image is **eschatological** as well as present.
    - The **imago Christi** is the goal of redemption.
    - "The restoration of the image of God in man is effected by his being renewed after the image of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Image and Dominion**
    - The **image of God** is linked to humanity’s dominion over creation.
    - Dominion is an expression of human likeness to God in authority and stewardship.
    - This dominion is not absolute but **derivative** and accountable to God.
    - The exercise of dominion is marred by sin but will be restored in the new creation.
    - "Man was created in the image of God, and invested with dominion over the creatures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **image of God** has shaped generations of Reformed and evangelical theologians, especially in distinguishing between the **natural** and **moral** aspects of the image. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity provided a foundation for later discussions on human dignity, ethics, and the doctrine of salvation. Hodge’s influence endures in contemporary debates about anthropology, the effects of the Fall, and the meaning of redemption in Christ.
