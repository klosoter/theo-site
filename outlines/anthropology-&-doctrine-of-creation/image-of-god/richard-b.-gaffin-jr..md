# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **image of God** primarily through a redemptive-historical and **Christocentric** lens, emphasizing the eschatological fulfillment of the image in Christ. He maintains that the **imago Dei** is not merely a static possession but is fundamentally tied to humanity’s vocation and destiny in union with the resurrected Christ. Gaffin’s perspective integrates **Reformed anthropology** with a strong focus on **eschatology** and the **work of the Holy Spirit**.

- "The image of God is eschatologically defined and realized in Christ, the last Adam." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Image of God" in Created in His Image: The Divine Image in the Human Person (ed. Anthony Hoekema)
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the True Image**
   - The **image of God** finds its ultimate realization in the resurrected Christ, the **last Adam**.
   - Humanity’s restoration in the image is inseparable from union with Christ.
   - The original image in Adam was protological, pointing forward to its eschatological fulfillment.
   - Christ’s resurrection is the pattern and guarantee of believers’ conformity to the image.
   - "The image of God is not fully realized until it is seen in the resurrected Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Eschatological Orientation of the Image**
   - The **imago Dei** is oriented toward consummation, not merely creation.
   - Adam’s original state was one of potential, awaiting eschatological glorification.
   - The image involves both present possession and future transformation.
   - The Spirit’s work is essential in bringing believers to the fullness of the image.
   - "The image is not static but dynamic, pointing to the destiny of glorification." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Functional and Relational Dimensions**
   - The image includes humanity’s calling to rule and serve as God’s vicegerents.
   - Relationship with God and others is integral to the image.
   - The image is expressed in ethical obedience and covenantal faithfulness.
   - Restoration of the image involves renewal in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - "The image of God is expressed in the relational and functional dimensions of human existence." (Created in His Image)

4. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
   - The Holy Spirit is central in conforming believers to the image of Christ.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling marks the beginning of eschatological transformation.
   - Sanctification is the progressive realization of the image.
   - The Spirit’s work is both individual and corporate, shaping the church as the renewed humanity.
   - "The Spirit is the agent of transformation into the image of the resurrected Christ." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Adam**
   - There is continuity between Adam’s original image and its restoration in Christ.
   - Sin distorts but does not erase the image; redemption restores and consummates it.
   - The image in Adam was mutable and provisional; in Christ, it is perfected and permanent.
   - The church, united to Christ, is the locus of the renewed image.
   - "The image marred in Adam is restored and perfected in Christ, the second Adam." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s redemptive-historical and **Christocentric** approach to the image of God has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology. His integration of **eschatology**, **union with Christ**, and the **work of the Holy Spirit** has influenced both academic theology and pastoral ministry. Gaffin’s work continues to inform discussions on the nature and destiny of humanity within the broader framework of biblical theology.
