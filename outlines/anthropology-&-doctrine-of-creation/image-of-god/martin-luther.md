# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther understood the **Image of God** as humanity's original state of **righteousness**, **holiness**, and **knowledge** before the Fall. He emphasized that the image was lost or profoundly corrupted through **sin**, but could be restored in part through **regeneration** in Christ. For Luther, the image was not merely rationality or dominion, but a holistic conformity to God's will.

- "The image of God is a term which embraces all these: that Adam not only knew God and believed Him to be good, but that he also lived a life that was wholly godly." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (especially Genesis 1–3)
- The Bondage of the Will
- Small and Large Catechisms
- Disputation on Man (1536)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 1: Lectures on Genesis

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Original Righteousness**
    - The image of God included true **righteousness**, **holiness**, and perfect knowledge of God.
    - Adam and Eve possessed a will in perfect harmony with God’s will.
    - The image was not simply external or physical but involved the whole person.
    - The image was the foundation for humanity’s relationship with God.
    - "The image of God was a disposition of the soul, a wisdom, righteousness, and knowledge of God." (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Corruption of the Image through Sin**
    - The Fall resulted in the loss or severe distortion of the image.
    - Human faculties—reason, will, affections—became corrupted.
    - The image remains only in a broken or vestigial sense after the Fall.
    - Sin affects every aspect of human nature, not just external actions.
    - "After the Fall, this image was so obscured and corrupted that we cannot recognize it except by the light of the Gospel." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Partial Restoration in Christ**
    - The image of God is restored through **regeneration** by the Holy Spirit.
    - Restoration is partial in this life and will be perfected in the resurrection.
    - Faith in Christ initiates the renewal of the image.
    - The process of sanctification is the gradual recovery of the image.
    - "Through Christ, the image of God begins to be restored in us." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Image Not Merely Rationality or Dominion**
    - Luther rejected the view that the image is only human reason or dominion over creation.
    - The image is fundamentally spiritual, involving the heart and soul.
    - Dominion and reason are consequences, not the essence, of the image.
    - True knowledge of God is central to the image.
    - "The image of God is not in the body, nor in the dominion over creatures, but in the soul itself." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Anthropological and Christological Significance**
    - The doctrine of the image shapes Luther’s understanding of human nature and dignity.
    - Christ is the perfect image of God, the pattern for restored humanity.
    - The image grounds human responsibility and the call to love God and neighbor.
    - The restoration of the image is inseparable from union with Christ.
    - "Christ is the true image of God, into whose likeness we are being renewed." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of the **Image of God** influenced later Protestant anthropology, especially in emphasizing the loss and restoration of original righteousness. His distinction between the image as original righteousness and its corrupted remnants shaped Reformation debates and later **Reformed theology**. Luther’s Christological focus on the restoration of the image in believers continues to inform contemporary discussions on human dignity, sanctification, and the nature of salvation.
