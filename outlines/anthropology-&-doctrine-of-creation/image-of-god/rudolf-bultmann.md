# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Image of God** not as a static ontological property but as an existential reality realized in authentic human existence. He emphasized the **existential interpretation** of biblical texts, arguing that the **imago Dei** is best understood through the lens of **self-understanding**, **freedom**, and **responsibility** before God, rather than as a metaphysical or physical likeness.

- "Man is truly himself only when he understands himself as coming from God and going to God." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Existential Interpretation of Imago Dei**
   - The **Image of God** is not a substance but an existential relation.
   - Human beings realize the image through authentic existence in response to God's call.
   - The biblical text must be interpreted through existentialist categories, not ancient cosmology.
   - The imago Dei is dynamic, actualized in decision and faith.
   - "The image of God is not a possession but a task." (Theology of the New Testament)

2. **Demythologization of Biblical Anthropology**
   - Traditional views of the image as rationality or dominion are products of mythological thinking.
   - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical language.
   - The focus shifts from ontology to the individual's encounter with God.
   - The biblical narrative is reinterpreted to address the modern existential situation.
   - "What matters is not the ancient world-picture but the existential understanding of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

3. **Human Freedom and Responsibility**
   - The image is expressed in human freedom to respond to God.
   - Responsibility before God is central to authentic existence.
   - Sin is the failure to live in the image, a turning away from authentic selfhood.
   - True humanity is realized in openness to God's address.
   - "Man is free only in obedience to God." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Christ as the True Image**
   - Christ reveals what it means to be truly human and in the image of God.
   - The believer is conformed to the image of Christ through faith.
   - The restoration of the image is eschatological, not merely ethical or natural.
   - Christology is central to understanding the imago Dei in the New Testament.
   - "In Christ, the new man is created according to the image of God." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Rejection of Substantialist Anthropology**
   - Bultmann rejects the idea that the image is a fixed human faculty or substance.
   - Human nature is understood in terms of relationality and existential decision.
   - The image is not a metaphysical quality but a mode of being.
   - Anthropology must be reinterpreted in light of existential philosophy.
   - "The New Testament does not teach a doctrine of man, but speaks of man in relation to God." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to the **Image of God** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the fields of **biblical hermeneutics** and **theological anthropology**. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional doctrines and encouraged theologians to reinterpret biblical concepts in light of modern existential concerns. While controversial among confessional traditions, his work remains influential in discussions about the meaning of human existence before God and the relevance of biblical anthropology for contemporary faith.
