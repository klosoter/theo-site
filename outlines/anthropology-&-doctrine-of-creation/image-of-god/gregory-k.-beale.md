# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a contemporary biblical theologian who interprets the **image of God** primarily through the lens of **temple theology** and **eschatology**. He argues that humanity is created as a **priestly image-bearer**, called to reflect God’s glory and extend His presence throughout creation, with the **new creation in Christ** fulfilling and restoring this vocation.

- "The image of God is not merely a static quality but a dynamic calling to reflect, represent, and mediate God’s presence in the world." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- "A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New" (2011)
- "The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God" (2004)
- "The Book of Revelation" (NIGTC, 1999)
- "God Dwells Among Us: Expanding Eden to the Ends of the Earth" (with Mitchell Kim, 2014)
- "The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism" (2008)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Temple Representation**
   - Humanity is created as the **image of God** to function as living representations of God’s presence, paralleling ancient temple imagery.
   - The Garden of Eden is depicted as the first temple, with Adam and Eve serving as priests.
   - The image involves both **function** (ruling, subduing) and **relationship** (communion with God).
   - The temple motif is central for understanding the image in both Old and New Testaments.
   - "Adam was to be God’s image, a living idol, set in the temple of creation to reflect and mediate God’s presence." ("The Temple and the Church’s Mission")

2. **Priestly and Kingly Vocation**
   - Bearing God’s image entails a dual vocation: priestly (serving and guarding) and kingly (ruling and subduing).
   - This vocation is rooted in Genesis 1–2 and is echoed in Israel’s priesthood and kingship.
   - The image is not only ontological but also vocational and missional.
   - Christ, as the true image, perfectly fulfills this priestly-kingly role.
   - "The image of God is a commission to extend God’s rule and presence throughout the earth." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

3. **Eschatological Restoration in Christ**
   - The **fall** marred the image, but it is being restored in believers through union with Christ.
   - The New Testament presents Christ as the **last Adam**, the perfect image-bearer.
   - Believers are being transformed into Christ’s image, anticipating full restoration in the new creation.
   - The church, as Christ’s body, corporately bears and extends the image.
   - "The restoration of the image is an eschatological process, culminating in the new heavens and new earth." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

4. **Cosmic and Missional Scope**
   - The image of God has a cosmic dimension: humanity is to fill and subdue the earth as God’s representatives.
   - The mission of expanding Eden/temple imagery points to the spread of God’s glory globally.
   - The Great Commission echoes the original mandate to fill the earth with God’s image.
   - The church’s mission is thus temple-expansion, reflecting God’s presence to the nations.
   - "The church’s mission is to expand the temple of God’s presence to the ends of the earth." ("God Dwells Among Us")

5. **Biblical-Theological Integration**
   - Beale’s approach is characterized by a **canonical** and **biblical-theological** method, tracing the image theme from Genesis to Revelation.
   - He emphasizes typology, seeing Adam, Israel, and Christ as successive image-bearers.
   - The image of God is a unifying thread in the story of redemption.
   - Theological reflection is grounded in exegesis and intertextual connections.
   - "The image of God theme is a central thread that weaves together the entire biblical narrative." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the **image of God** by integrating **biblical theology**, temple imagery, and eschatology. His emphasis on the priestly and missional dimensions of the image has influenced both academic and ecclesial understandings of human vocation. By tracing the image motif from Eden to the new creation, Beale provides a robust framework for understanding humanity’s role in God’s redemptive plan. His scholarship continues to inform Reformed and evangelical approaches to anthropology and mission.
