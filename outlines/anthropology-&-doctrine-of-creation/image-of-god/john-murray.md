# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **image of God** as a comprehensive reality encompassing the whole person, not merely certain faculties or attributes. He emphasized that the **imago Dei** is foundational to human dignity, moral responsibility, and the capacity for **covenant relationship** with God, while also stressing the effects of the Fall and the necessity of **redemption in Christ** for its restoration.

- "The image of God in which man was created consisted in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, as well as in the dominion given to man over the lower creation." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, especially on Romans 8:29)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (relevant for the restoration of the image)
- "Christian Baptism" (touches on implications for new creation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Comprehensive Nature of the Image**
   - The image of God encompasses the entirety of human nature, not just intellect or will.
   - It includes **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness** as essential aspects.
   - Human dominion over creation is an expression of the image.
   - The image is not a separate "part" but the whole person in relation to God.
   - "It is not some aspect or faculty of man that is the image, but man himself in the integrity of his being." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Moral and Ethical Dimensions**
   - The image includes original **righteousness** and moral uprightness.
   - Loss of the image through the Fall is primarily ethical, not ontological.
   - The capacity for **moral responsibility** is rooted in the image.
   - Restoration in Christ renews these moral dimensions.
   - "The image of God is to be defined in terms of knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Relational and Covenantal Orientation**
   - The image grounds humanity’s capacity for **covenant relationship** with God.
   - Human beings are created for communion with God and others.
   - The image is expressed in relationality, not isolation.
   - The covenant of works presupposes the image as the basis for obedience.
   - "Man was created in covenant with God, and this covenantal relationship is inseparable from the image." (Principles of Conduct)

4. **Effect of the Fall and Persistence of the Image**
   - The Fall resulted in the corruption, not the annihilation, of the image.
   - Fallen humanity retains the image in a marred form.
   - The image persists as the basis for human dignity and accountability.
   - Restoration is needed for the image to be fully realized.
   - "The image is not destroyed by sin, but it is vitiated and perverted." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Restoration and Consummation in Christ**
   - **Redemption** in Christ is the renewal of the image.
   - Believers are progressively conformed to the image of Christ.
   - The eschatological hope is full restoration in glorification.
   - The image is ultimately Christological in orientation.
   - "The renewal after the image of God is the renewal after the image of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **image of God** has significantly shaped Reformed anthropology, especially in its insistence on the image’s comprehensive and ethical dimensions. His work influenced later discussions on human dignity, the doctrine of sin, and the nature of redemption. By rooting the image in covenant and Christological categories, Murray provided a framework that continues to inform contemporary theological reflection on what it means to be human before God.
