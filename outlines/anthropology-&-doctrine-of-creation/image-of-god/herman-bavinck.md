# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck developed a robust doctrine of the **image of God** that integrates both the structural and functional aspects of humanity. He emphasized that the **imago Dei** is not merely a set of faculties but encompasses the whole person in relation to God, others, and creation, and is restored and fulfilled in **Christ**.

- "The image of God is not something in man, nor a part of man, but the entire man as such." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.554)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- "The Origin, Essence, and Purpose of Man" (in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- Our Reasonable Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Comprehensive View of the Imago Dei**
   - The image of God includes the whole person—body and soul—in their original righteousness.
   - It is not limited to rationality or spirituality but encompasses all human faculties.
   - The image is both structural (what humans are) and relational (how humans live before God).
   - Bavinck rejects dualistic reductions of the image to a single aspect of human nature.
   - "The image of God is present in the whole person, in body and soul, in all human faculties and powers." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.554)

2. **Original Righteousness and Knowledge**
   - Humanity was created in true **righteousness**, **holiness**, and **knowledge**.
   - These qualities are not accidental but essential to the image as originally given.
   - The loss of original righteousness in the Fall is a distortion, not a destruction, of the image.
   - Restoration in Christ involves the renewal of these qualities.
   - "The image of God consists in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.558)

3. **Structural and Functional Dimensions**
   - The image of God is both what humans are (structural) and what they are called to do (functional).
   - Human dominion over creation is an expression of the image.
   - The capacity for relationship with God and others is integral to the image.
   - The image is dynamic, involving vocation and destiny.
   - "The image of God is not static but dynamic, involving calling and destiny." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.561)

4. **Universality and Persistence after the Fall**
   - All humans retain the image of God after the Fall, though it is marred.
   - The image is the basis for human dignity and moral responsibility.
   - Even sinful humanity reflects God in a broken way.
   - The universality of the image grounds the equality of all people.
   - "Even after the fall, man remains man, an image and likeness of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.567)

5. **Christ as the True Image and Restoration**
   - Christ is the perfect and ultimate **image of God**.
   - Redemption in Christ restores and consummates the image in believers.
   - The church is the community in which the image is being renewed.
   - Eschatological fulfillment awaits the full restoration of the image.
   - "Christ is the true and perfect image of God, and in him the image is restored in us." (Reformed Dogmatics, 2.570)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s doctrine of the **image of God** has profoundly shaped Reformed anthropology, emphasizing the holistic and relational nature of the imago Dei. His integration of structural and functional aspects has influenced both theological anthropology and discussions on human dignity. Bavinck’s Christocentric focus on the restoration of the image continues to inform contemporary debates on creation, fall, and redemption within Reformed and broader Christian theology.
