# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **image of God**, emphasizing humanity’s original creation in **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness**. They affirm that the **image** was not only natural to Adam and Eve but also foundational for understanding **human dignity**, the **fall**, and **redemption** in Christ. The Standards maintain that while the image was marred by sin, it is being renewed in believers through **sanctification**.

- "After God had made all other creatures, he created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls, endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after his own image." (Westminster Confession of Faith 4.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially 4.2, 6.2, 9.2, 16.7)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Q&A 17, 20, 75)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Q&A 10)
- The Westminster Assembly and Its Work (Chad Van Dixhoorn)
- The Westminster Confession: A Commentary (A.A. Hodge)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Knowledge, Righteousness, and Holiness**
    - Humanity was created reflecting God’s **moral and rational attributes**.
    - The image includes **intellectual, ethical, and spiritual capacities**.
    - The Standards stress the original state of **uprightness** before the fall.
    - The image is not merely physical but primarily **spiritual**.
    - "God created man, male and female, after his own image, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, with dominion over the creatures." (WSC Q10)

2. **Universality and Dignity of Humanity**
    - The image of God is the basis for **human dignity** and value.
    - All humans, by virtue of creation, possess the image, though now marred.
    - The Standards ground ethical obligations in the shared image.
    - The image is not limited by gender, ethnicity, or status.
    - "All men are not only made in the image of God, but also have the law of God written in their hearts." (WLC Q17)

3. **Corruption and Loss through the Fall**
    - The fall resulted in the **corruption** of the image, not its total loss.
    - Original righteousness and holiness were lost, but rationality remains.
    - The image is now **defaced** but not destroyed in fallen humanity.
    - Sin affects every aspect of the image, necessitating redemption.
    - "By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body." (WCF 6.2)

4. **Restoration in Christ**
    - The image is **renewed** in believers through union with Christ.
    - Sanctification progressively restores knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
    - Christ is the **perfect image** and pattern for renewed humanity.
    - The restoration is both present and eschatological in scope.
    - "The image of God is renewed in us by the Spirit, after the image of Christ, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness." (cf. WLC Q75)

5. **Ethical and Eschatological Implications**
    - The image grounds human responsibility and ethical conduct.
    - Believers are called to live in a manner consistent with the renewed image.
    - The full restoration of the image awaits **glorification**.
    - The doctrine shapes Christian hope for the new creation.
    - "They who are effectually called and regenerated... are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them." (WCF 13.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed anthropology**, providing a foundational understanding of the **image of God** for confessional churches and theologians. Their articulation of the image as knowledge, righteousness, and holiness remains a touchstone for discussions on human dignity, sin, and redemption. The Standards’ influence extends to contemporary debates on ethics, human rights, and the nature of sanctification, ensuring their continued relevance in systematic theology.
