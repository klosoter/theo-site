# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a nuanced doctrine of the **Image of God** (imago Dei), emphasizing humanity’s rational nature and capacity for **intellect** and **will** as central to this image. For Aquinas, the image is most fully realized in the soul’s ability to know and love God, and is distinguished between the image in all humans and its perfection in the redeemed. His synthesis of **Aristotelian philosophy** and **Christian doctrine** shaped the Western understanding of human nature and the divine image.

- "The image of God, in its principal signification, namely, as regards the intellectual nature, is found both in man and in woman." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.6)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, I, Questions 93–94
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book II, Chapters 46–47
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book II, Distinction 16
- De Veritate, Question 10
- Aquinas on Human Nature (secondary: Pasnau, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Intellectual Nature**
   - The **imago Dei** is principally located in the rational soul, specifically in the faculties of **intellect** and **will**.
   - All humans possess the image by virtue of their intellectual nature, regardless of moral state.
   - The image is distinguished from likeness; the former is natural, the latter is perfected by grace.
   - The capacity for knowledge and love of God is the foundation of the image.
   - "The image of God in man is in his mind, not in his body." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.6)

2. **Trinitarian Analogy**
   - The structure of the human mind reflects the **Trinity**: memory, understanding, and will correspond to Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - This analogy grounds the image in relational and dynamic faculties.
   - The image is not a static imprint but a living participation in Trinitarian life.
   - Growth in grace increases the likeness, but not the image itself.
   - "The image of the Trinity is found in the mind, according as it is capable of God, and can attain to Him." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.7)

3. **Image in All, Likeness in the Righteous**
   - The image is universal to all humans; likeness is proper to the righteous who are conformed to God by grace.
   - Sin does not destroy the image but obscures the likeness.
   - Restoration through **redemption** perfects the likeness without recreating the image.
   - The distinction preserves both human dignity and the necessity of grace.
   - "The image of God remains in man after sin; but the likeness is diminished." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.4)

4. **Image and Human Destiny**
   - The image grounds human capacity for **beatific vision**—the ultimate end of knowing and loving God.
   - Fulfillment of the image is eschatological, realized fully in the vision of God.
   - The image is the basis for moral responsibility and spiritual growth.
   - Human dignity and vocation are rooted in this orientation toward God.
   - "Man is said to be the image of God by reason of his intellectual nature, which is ordained to the vision of God." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.4)

5. **Image and Bodily Nature**
   - While the image is primarily in the soul, the body participates instrumentally as the soul’s organ.
   - The unity of body and soul is essential for the full expression of the image in human action.
   - Bodily differences (e.g., male and female) do not affect the possession of the image.
   - The resurrection affirms the goodness of the body as part of the human image.
   - "The image of God is found in man, not according to the body, but according to the mind." (Summa Theologiae I, q.93, a.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **Image of God** profoundly shaped both Catholic and broader Christian anthropology, emphasizing the centrality of **rationality** and the soul’s orientation toward God. His distinction between image and likeness influenced later debates on grace, sin, and human dignity. Aquinas’s integration of **Trinitarian theology** with philosophical anthropology remains foundational for discussions on what it means to be human in relation to God. His thought continues to inform contemporary theological and philosophical explorations of human nature and destiny.
