# Richard Lints (1956– )

Richard Lints approaches the **Image of God** as a dynamic, covenantal reality, emphasizing its role in **human identity**, **representation**, and **redemption**. He critiques both reductionist and purely functional accounts, arguing for a **Christocentric** and **relational** understanding that is deeply embedded in the narrative of **creation, fall, and restoration**.

- "The image of God is not a static possession but a dynamic calling to reflect God’s character in the world." (Renewing the Evangelical Mission)

## Key Works

- Identity and Idolatry: The Image of God and Its Inversion (2015)
- The Fabric of Theology: A Prolegomenon to Evangelical Theology (1993)
- Renewing the Evangelical Mission (2010, editor and contributor)
- "Imago Dei and the Missio Dei" in The Enduring Authority of the Christian Scriptures (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Dynamic Vocation**
   - The image is not merely an ontological trait but a calling to represent God.
   - Humanity’s vocation is to reflect God’s character in all of life.
   - The image involves participation in God’s purposes, especially in stewardship and creativity.
   - The image is distorted but not destroyed by the fall.
   - "The imago Dei is best understood as a dynamic vocation rather than a static possession." (Identity and Idolatry)

2. **Christocentric Restoration**
   - Jesus Christ is the true and perfect image of God.
   - Restoration of the image occurs through union with Christ.
   - Redemption is the renewal of humanity’s vocation in Christ.
   - The church, as Christ’s body, participates in this restored image.
   - "Christ is the image in which the restoration of humanity is both grounded and accomplished." (Identity and Idolatry)

3. **Relational and Covenantal Emphasis**
   - The image is fundamentally relational—toward God, others, and creation.
   - Covenant frames the context in which the image is expressed and restored.
   - Human dignity and responsibility are rooted in covenantal relationships.
   - The image is communal, not merely individual.
   - "The imago Dei is covenantal, shaping our relationships with God and neighbor." (The Fabric of Theology)

4. **Idolatry as Inversion of the Image**
   - Idolatry is the distortion or inversion of the image of God.
   - Humans are always imaging—either God or idols.
   - Idolatry corrupts human identity and vocation.
   - The biblical narrative contrasts true imaging with false imaging (idolatry).
   - "Idolatry is not the loss of the image, but its inversion." (Identity and Idolatry)

5. **Integration of Creation, Fall, and Redemption**
   - The image must be understood within the whole biblical drama.
   - Creation establishes the image; the fall distorts it; redemption restores it.
   - Eschatological hope is the consummation of the image in Christ.
   - The image shapes Christian ethics and mission.
   - "The drama of creation, fall, and redemption is the drama of the image of God." (Renewing the Evangelical Mission)

## Legacy and Impact

Lints’s work on the **Image of God** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, especially in its **covenantal** and **Christocentric** dimensions. His dynamic and narrative approach has influenced evangelical theology’s understanding of human identity, vocation, and the problem of idolatry. By integrating biblical theology with systematic reflection, Lints has provided a robust framework for engaging issues of human dignity, ethics, and mission in the modern world.
