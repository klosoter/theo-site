# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **Image of God** as fundamentally eschatological and relational, emphasizing humanity’s destiny to reflect God in the context of **history** and **community**. He rejected static or merely ontological accounts, instead rooting the **imago Dei** in humanity’s openness to the future and participation in the divine self-revelation, ultimately fulfilled in **Jesus Christ**.

- "Man is the image of God in so far as he is destined for fellowship with God and for representing God in the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially ch. 15: "Man as the Image of God")
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Jesus—God and Man
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of the Image**
   - The **imago Dei** is not a static possession but a destiny realized in the consummation of history.
   - Human beings are oriented toward their future fulfillment in Christ, who is the true image.
   - The image is thus dynamic, unfolding through God’s historical self-revelation.
   - The final realization of the image is tied to the resurrection and eschatological consummation.
   - "The image of God is not a static endowment but a task and destiny to be fulfilled in the future." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Relational and Social Nature**
   - The image is expressed in human relationality, especially in community and fellowship.
   - Human beings reflect God most fully in their capacity for relationship—with God and with others.
   - The social dimension of the image resists individualistic interpretations.
   - Community is intrinsic to the realization of the **imago Dei**.
   - "Man is the image of God not as an isolated individual but in his relation to others." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christological Fulfillment**
   - Jesus Christ is the definitive revelation and realization of the **image of God**.
   - Humanity’s destiny as image-bearers is fulfilled in conformity to Christ.
   - The **imago Dei** is understood in light of Christ’s resurrection and glorification.
   - Christology provides the key to understanding human nature and vocation.
   - "The true image of God is realized in the man Jesus." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Openness to God and the World**
   - Human beings are characterized by openness to transcendence and the world.
   - This openness is a structural aspect of the **imago Dei**.
   - Human self-transcendence points to the divine origin and goal of humanity.
   - The image involves the capacity for reason, freedom, and responsibility before God.
   - "Man’s openness to the world is the structural basis of his being the image of God." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

5. **Integration of History and Revelation**
   - The **imago Dei** is disclosed progressively through God’s acts in history.
   - Revelation is not merely propositional but historical and participatory.
   - Human beings participate in God’s self-revelation as history unfolds.
   - The image is inseparable from the narrative of salvation history.
   - "The history of God with man is the history of the realization of the image of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s dynamic, **eschatological** understanding of the **image of God** has significantly influenced contemporary theological anthropology, especially in ecumenical and dialogical contexts. His emphasis on **relationality** and the centrality of Christ has shaped discussions on human dignity, community, and destiny. By integrating history, revelation, and anthropology, Pannenberg provided a robust alternative to both classical and existentialist accounts of the **imago Dei**.
