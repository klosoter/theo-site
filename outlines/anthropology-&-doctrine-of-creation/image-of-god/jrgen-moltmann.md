# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann understands the **Image of God** as a dynamic, relational reality grounded in **Trinitarian fellowship** and oriented toward the eschatological future. He emphasizes that human beings reflect the **relationality** and **freedom** of God, and that the image is restored and fulfilled in **Christ** and the **community** of the redeemed. For Moltmann, the image is not a static possession but a vocation to participate in God's life and mission.

- "The image of God is not a possession, but a relationship and a task." (God in Creation)

## Key Works

- God in Creation (1985)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981)
- The Coming of God (1995)
- Man: Christian Anthropology in the Conflicts of the Present (1974)
- Theology of Hope (1964)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Relational and Social Understanding of the Image**
    - The image of God is fundamentally relational, reflecting **Trinitarian communion**.
    - Human beings are created for relationship with God, others, and creation.
    - The image is realized in **community**, not in isolated individuals.
    - This relationality opposes individualistic or purely rational definitions.
    - "The image of God is to be understood as the capacity and the commission for relationship." (God in Creation)

2. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The image of God points toward humanity’s future fulfillment in **Christ**.
    - Human beings are in process, moving toward the full realization of the image.
    - **Eschatology** shapes anthropology: what humanity will become defines what it is.
    - The restoration of the image is a work of the **Spirit** in the new creation.
    - "The image of God is not a static datum but a dynamic destiny." (The Coming of God)

3. **Christological Focus**
    - **Jesus Christ** is the true image of God and the pattern for redeemed humanity.
    - The restoration of the image occurs through union with **Christ**.
    - Christ’s resurrection inaugurates the new humanity.
    - The church, as the body of Christ, participates in this renewed image.
    - "In Christ, the true image of God is revealed and restored." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Integration with Creation and Ecology**
    - The image of God includes humanity’s vocation as stewards of **creation**.
    - Human dominion is reinterpreted as responsible, loving care for the earth.
    - The image is distorted when creation is exploited or neglected.
    - Ecological crisis is a theological crisis concerning the image of God.
    - "To be in the image of God is to be entrusted with the earth." (God in Creation)

5. **Critique of Traditional Substantialist Views**
    - Moltmann rejects defining the image by reason, will, or soul alone.
    - He critiques dualistic and hierarchical anthropologies.
    - The image is not a metaphysical property but a calling and relationship.
    - Emphasizes equality and dignity for all humans, regardless of capacity.
    - "The image of God is not a quality, but a relationship and a commission." (Man: Christian Anthropology)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s **relational and eschatological** approach to the image of God has significantly influenced contemporary theology, especially in discussions of **Trinitarian anthropology** and **ecological responsibility**. His critique of individualistic and static views has encouraged a more communal and dynamic understanding of human identity. Moltmann’s work continues to shape debates on human dignity, vocation, and the church’s role in creation. His integration of **Christology**, **pneumatology**, and **eschatology** into the doctrine of the image of God remains a hallmark of his enduring theological legacy.
