# Michael S. Horton (1964– )

Michael S. Horton approaches the **image of God** as a foundational doctrine that shapes Christian anthropology, emphasizing the **covenantal** and **Christological** dimensions of human identity. He insists that the image is not merely a set of faculties but is fundamentally **relational**, fulfilled and restored in **union with Christ** and participation in the **new creation**. Horton’s Reformed perspective situates the image within the broader drama of **creation, fall, and redemption**.

- "The image of God is not a set of capacities or attributes, but a covenantal office that finds its fulfillment in Christ, the true image." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Covenant Office**
    - The image of God is defined by humanity’s role as God’s royal representative.
    - It is not reducible to rationality or moral capacity.
    - The image is inherently relational and vocational.
    - Humanity’s office is to reflect God’s rule in creation.
    - "The image is a commission, not merely a possession." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Christ as the True Image**
    - Jesus Christ is the perfect and ultimate image of God.
    - Human imaging is derivative and finds its telos in Christ.
    - Redemption restores the image through union with Christ.
    - The eschatological renewal centers on conformity to Christ.
    - "Christ is not only the restorer but the very content of the image." (Covenant and Salvation)

3. **Corporate and Ecclesial Dimensions**
    - The image is expressed most fully in the corporate people of God.
    - The church is the community being renewed in the image.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper signify participation in Christ’s image.
    - The communal aspect resists individualistic interpretations.
    - "The church is the new humanity, being conformed to the image of the Son." (People and Place)

4. **Dynamic and Eschatological Renewal**
    - The image is dynamic, not static; it is being renewed.
    - Sanctification is the process of being conformed to Christ’s image.
    - The fullness of the image awaits the resurrection.
    - The Spirit’s work is central in this transformation.
    - "The image is not a relic of the past but a promise of the future." (Pilgrim Theology)

5. **Creation, Fall, and Redemption Framework**
    - The image must be understood within the drama of redemptive history.
    - The fall distorts but does not erase the image.
    - Redemption in Christ restores and elevates the image.
    - The image points to humanity’s destiny in the new creation.
    - "The image of God is the thread that runs from creation to new creation." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Horton’s articulation of the **image of God** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing its **covenantal** and **Christ-centered** character. His work challenges reductionistic or purely functional accounts, insisting on the image’s eschatological fulfillment in Christ and the church. Horton’s synthesis has shaped evangelical discussions on anthropology, ecclesiology, and the doctrine of sanctification, reinforcing the centrality of **union with Christ** in understanding human identity and destiny.
