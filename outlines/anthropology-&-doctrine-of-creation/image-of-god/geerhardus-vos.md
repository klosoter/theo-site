# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos understood the **Image of God** as fundamentally tied to humanity’s original **covenant relationship** with God, emphasizing both the **structural** and **functional** aspects of the image. For Vos, the image encompasses not only the **natural faculties** of knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, but also humanity’s **eschatological destiny** in the unfolding of redemptive history.

- "The image of God in man is not something accidental, but belongs to the very essence of his being." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2")

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (article)
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Image as Structural and Functional**
    - The image includes both the inherent qualities of humanity and their intended activity.
    - **Knowledge, righteousness, and holiness** are essential to the image, not accidental.
    - The image is expressed in humanity’s dominion and vocation.
    - The image is not lost in the Fall, but is marred and requires restoration.
    - "The image is not a mere external resemblance, but a structural principle in man’s very being." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Covenantal Context of the Image**
    - Humanity was created in covenant with God, and the image is inseparable from this relationship.
    - The **Covenant of Works** frames the original purpose of the image.
    - The image points to humanity’s capacity for communion with God.
    - The loss and restoration of the image are tied to covenantal history.
    - "Man’s being in the image of God is the presupposition of his capacity for covenant fellowship." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

3. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - The image is oriented toward an eschatological goal, not static perfection.
    - Adam’s original state was **provisional**, pointing to a higher consummation.
    - The restoration of the image in Christ fulfills its eschatological intent.
    - The image is perfected in glorification, not merely in creation.
    - "The image of God in man is destined for eschatological fulfillment." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Christ as the True Image**
    - Christ is the perfect and final revelation of the image of God.
    - The restoration of the image comes through **union with Christ**.
    - Believers are renewed after the image of Christ by the Spirit.
    - The **Second Adam** motif is central to understanding the image’s restoration.
    - "Christ is the image of God in the highest and absolute sense." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity after the Fall**
    - The image is not entirely lost in the Fall, but its moral aspects are corrupted.
    - All humans retain the image structurally, but not in full function.
    - Redemption involves the renewal of the image, not its replacement.
    - The image’s restoration is both present and future in the believer.
    - "The image remains after the Fall, but in a mutilated and impaired form." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust account of the **Image of God** shaped later Reformed anthropology by integrating **covenantal** and **eschatological** dimensions into the doctrine. His emphasis on the image’s restoration in Christ and its fulfillment in redemptive history influenced both biblical theology and systematic theology. Vos’s insights continue to inform contemporary discussions on human dignity, vocation, and the relationship between creation and redemption.
