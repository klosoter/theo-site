# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper developed a robust doctrine of the **image of God** rooted in the Reformed tradition, emphasizing both the original dignity of humanity and the effects of the **Fall**. He distinguished between the **broader and narrower senses** of the image, maintaining that while the essential structure of humanity as image-bearers remains after the Fall, the **ethical likeness** to God is marred. Kuyper’s view integrates the **cultural mandate** and the restoration of the image through **redemption in Christ**.

- "Even after the fall, man did not cease to be man, and therefore did not cease to be the image of God." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Works

- Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology (1898)
- Lectures on Calvinism (1898)
- Our Worship (1911)
- Created in God’s Image by Anthony A. Hoekema (secondary, for Kuyper’s influence)
- Abraham Kuyper: Modern Calvinist, Christian Democrat by James D. Bratt (secondary, contextualizes Kuyper’s theological anthropology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Broader and Narrower Image**
   - The broader sense refers to humanity’s structural capacity as image-bearers.
   - The narrower sense refers to the ethical and spiritual likeness to God.
   - The broader image persists after the Fall; the narrower is corrupted.
   - This distinction preserves both human dignity and the reality of sin.
   - "The image of God in the broader sense is indestructible, but in the narrower sense it is lost." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **The Image and the Cultural Mandate**
   - Humanity’s calling to exercise **dominion** flows from being made in God’s image.
   - The image includes rationality, creativity, and stewardship over creation.
   - The cultural mandate is not abrogated by the Fall, though it is now frustrated by sin.
   - Human culture and society are arenas for expressing the image of God.
   - "The dominion over the earth is inseparably connected with the image of God." (Lectures on Calvinism)

3. **Persistence of the Image After the Fall**
   - The essential structure of the image remains in fallen humanity.
   - Sin has corrupted the ethical likeness but not erased the image.
   - This persistence grounds human worth and the possibility of redemption.
   - Kuyper rejects views that equate the image solely with original righteousness.
   - "The fall did not destroy the image, but it did deform it." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Restoration of the Image in Christ**
   - Redemption in Christ aims at the renewal of the image in its ethical sense.
   - Sanctification is the process by which believers are conformed to Christ, the perfect image.
   - The church is the community in which the image is being restored.
   - Full restoration awaits the consummation at Christ’s return.
   - "Regeneration is the renewal of the image of God in man." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Corporate and Individual Dimensions**
   - The image of God is expressed both individually and corporately.
   - Human society and institutions reflect aspects of the divine image.
   - Kuyper’s doctrine undergirds his vision for Christian engagement in all spheres of life.
   - The image is not merely a private or spiritual reality but shapes public life.
   - "The image of God is not only personal but also social." (Lectures on Calvinism)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s nuanced doctrine of the **image of God** has significantly shaped Reformed anthropology, especially in its engagement with culture and society. His distinction between the broader and narrower senses influenced later theologians such as Herman Bavinck and Anthony Hoekema. Kuyper’s integration of the image with the **cultural mandate** provided a theological foundation for Christian involvement in public life, education, and politics. His legacy endures in neo-Calvinist thought and ongoing discussions about human dignity and vocation.
