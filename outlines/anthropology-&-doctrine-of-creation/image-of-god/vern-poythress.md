# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the **Image of God** through a **multiperspectival** lens, emphasizing the integration of **ontology**, **function**, and **relationship** within a **Trinitarian** and **covenantal** framework. He maintains that human beings reflect God's **lordship attributes**—authority, control, and presence—across all aspects of life, and that the image is restored and fulfilled in **Christ**.

- "The image of God in man is not a static thing, but a dynamic relationship involving representation, resemblance, and rule." ("Redeeming Science")

## Key Works

- "Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach" (2006)
- "The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses" (1991)
- "Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology" (1987)
- "In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach" (2009)
- "Theophany: A Biblical Theology of God's Appearing" (2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectival Understanding of the Image**
    - The image of God is best understood through multiple, complementary perspectives.
    - Emphasizes the **existential**, **situational**, and **normative** aspects of human identity.
    - Rejects reductionist accounts that focus solely on function, substance, or relationship.
    - Each perspective is rooted in the **Trinitarian** nature of God.
    - "We must not reduce the image of God to one aspect; it is a rich, multiperspectival reality." ("Symphonic Theology")

2. **Trinitarian Foundation**
    - Human imaging of God reflects the plurality and unity within the Trinity.
    - The relational aspect of the image is grounded in the eternal relationships of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The diversity of human roles and functions mirrors the diversity-in-unity of the Godhead.
    - The **Trinitarian** model guards against both individualism and collectivism.
    - "The image of God in man is patterned after the interpersonal communion of the Trinity." ("Redeeming Science")

3. **Covenantal Context**
    - The image of God is expressed and developed within the context of God's covenants.
    - Human vocation as image-bearers is tied to covenantal responsibilities and privileges.
    - The fall distorts but does not erase the image; redemption in Christ restores it.
    - The **covenantal** structure shapes both the dignity and duty of humanity.
    - "The image of God is inseparable from the covenantal relationship between God and man." ("Redeeming Science")

4. **Christological Fulfillment**
    - Jesus Christ is the perfect image of God and the model for restored humanity.
    - Believers are conformed to the image of Christ through union with Him.
    - The restoration of the image is both inaugurated and consummated in Christ.
    - The **imago Dei** finds its ultimate meaning in the person and work of Jesus.
    - "Christ is the true image, and in Him we see the destiny and restoration of humanity." ("Redeeming Science")

5. **Integration with Human Vocation**
    - The image of God encompasses human dominion, creativity, and stewardship.
    - Scientific, cultural, and linguistic endeavors are expressions of imaging God.
    - Human work and relationships are arenas for manifesting God's lordship attributes.
    - The image is holistic, involving all aspects of human life and calling.
    - "Our calling to subdue the earth and develop culture is an outworking of the image of God." ("Redeeming Science")

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectival** approach has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed discussions of the **Image of God**, especially in integrating biblical, theological, and philosophical insights. His work has encouraged theologians to avoid reductionism and to appreciate the richness of the **Trinitarian** and **covenantal** dimensions of human identity. By rooting the image in Christ and connecting it to all areas of life, Poythress has shaped evangelical thought on anthropology, vocation, and redemption.
