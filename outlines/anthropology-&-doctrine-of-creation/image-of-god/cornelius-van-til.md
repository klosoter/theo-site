# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til’s doctrine of the **Image of God** is rooted in his commitment to a consistently **Reformed epistemology** and **covenantal anthropology**. He emphasizes that humanity’s imaging of God is inherently **analogical**, reflecting the Creator-creature distinction, and that the image is always understood in relation to **covenant** and **revelation**. For Van Til, the image is not merely structural but fundamentally **ethical** and **religious**, shaping all human knowledge and existence.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Analogical Image Bearing**
   - Humanity images God in a way that is always analogical, never univocal.
   - The Creator-creature distinction is fundamental to understanding the image.
   - Human knowledge, morality, and being are patterned after, but never identical to, God’s.
   - The image is dynamic, reflecting God’s communicable attributes in a creaturely mode.
   - "Man is like God in every respect in which a creature can be like God." (The Defense of the Faith)

2. **Covenantal Context of the Image**
   - The image of God is always expressed within the context of covenant relationship.
   - Adam’s original righteousness was covenantal, not autonomous.
   - The fall affected the image ethically, not ontologically.
   - Restoration of the image is tied to redemption in Christ, the true Image.
   - "The image of God in man is always to be understood in relation to the covenant." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Ethical and Religious Nature of the Image**
   - The image is primarily ethical and religious, not merely rational or structural.
   - True knowledge and morality are possible only in covenant fellowship with God.
   - Sin distorts but does not erase the image; it is corrupted ethically.
   - Regeneration renews the image in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.
   - "The image of God is ethical at its core, for man was made to serve and glorify God." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Epistemological Implications**
   - Human knowledge is possible only because man is the image of God.
   - All human thought is covenantally conditioned—either in obedience or rebellion.
   - There is no neutrality; all reasoning is either analogical or autonomous.
   - The antithesis in epistemology flows from the ethical status of the image.
   - "All human interpretation is possible only on the basis of man’s being the image of God." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

5. **Christ as the True Image**
   - Christ is the perfect and ultimate Image of God, the pattern for redeemed humanity.
   - The restoration of the image is accomplished through union with Christ.
   - Believers are renewed after the image of Christ in knowledge and holiness.
   - The eschatological goal is conformity to the image of the Son.
   - "It is only in Christ, the express image of God, that man’s image is restored." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s understanding of the **Image of God** has profoundly shaped Reformed discussions of **anthropology**, especially in relation to epistemology and covenant theology. His insistence on the analogical nature of the image and the impossibility of neutrality in human thought has influenced generations of presuppositional apologists and theologians. By rooting the image in covenant and ethics, Van Til provided a robust framework for engaging modern and postmodern views of human nature. His legacy endures in the ongoing development of Reformed theological anthropology and apologetics.
