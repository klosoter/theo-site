# Robert L. Reymond (1932–2013)

Robert L. Reymond, a prominent Reformed theologian, firmly advocates for **dichotomy**—the view that humans are composed of only **body** and **soul/spirit**—over the **trichotomist** position, which posits a separate **body, soul, and spirit**. Reymond grounds his stance in **biblical anthropology** and the **Reformed confessional tradition**, arguing that Scripture does not support a three-part division of human nature.

- "The dichotomist view is the only position that does justice to the biblical data and the Reformed confessions." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith (1998)
- Paul: Missionary Theologian (2000)
- The Reformation’s Conflict with Rome (2001)
- Contending for the Faith (2005)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Argues that **Scripture** uses "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably.
    - Asserts that **Genesis 2:7** and other texts present a twofold human constitution.
    - Maintains that **trichotomy** arises from Greek philosophical influence, not biblical teaching.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the **immaterial aspect** of man.
    - "The Bible simply does not teach that man is composed of three distinct substances." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Trichotomy’s Exegetical Basis**
    - Critiques the use of **1 Thessalonians 5:23** and **Hebrews 4:12** by trichotomists.
    - Argues these passages employ **rhetorical parallelism**, not ontological distinction.
    - Notes that **Reformed confessions** uniformly affirm dichotomy.
    - Warns against reading **philosophical categories** into biblical texts.
    - "The trichotomist must read into the text what is not there." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

3. **Unity of the Immaterial Nature**
    - Holds that **soul** and **spirit** refer to the same immaterial substance.
    - Points to **synonymous usage** in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Rejects the idea that the **spirit** is a higher faculty than the soul.
    - Affirms the **psychosomatic unity** of the human person.
    - "There is no biblical warrant for distinguishing soul and spirit as separate substances." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

4. **Confessional Alignment**
    - Aligns with the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and other Reformed standards.
    - Notes that historic **Reformed theology** consistently teaches dichotomy.
    - Views trichotomy as inconsistent with **Reformed anthropology**.
    - Sees dichotomy as safeguarding the **doctrine of the image of God**.
    - "The Reformed confessions know nothing of a trichotomous anthropology." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

5. **Pastoral and Theological Implications**
    - Warns that trichotomy can lead to **theological errors** (e.g., semi-Pelagianism).
    - Argues dichotomy better supports doctrines of **sin** and **redemption**.
    - Emphasizes the importance of **biblical categories** for pastoral care.
    - Maintains that dichotomy avoids unnecessary **speculation** about human nature.
    - "A dichotomous view preserves the biblical teaching on the unity and responsibility of man." (A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Reymond’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has reinforced the standard position within contemporary **Reformed systematic theology**. His careful exegesis and confessional fidelity have influenced pastors, scholars, and students, especially within Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Reymond’s work continues to serve as a bulwark against speculative anthropologies, ensuring that the **unity of the human person** remains central in theological anthropology.
