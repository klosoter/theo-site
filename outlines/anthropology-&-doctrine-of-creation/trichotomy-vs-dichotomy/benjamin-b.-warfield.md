# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield was a staunch defender of the **dichotomous** view of human nature, arguing that Scripture teaches humanity consists of only **body** and **soul/spirit**, rather than three distinct substances. He critiqued the **trichotomous** position as a later development influenced by Greek philosophy, emphasizing the unity and simplicity of the **immaterial aspect** of man in classic **Reformed anthropology**.

- "The prevailing representation of the nature of man in Scripture is that he consists of two, not three, elements—body and soul (or spirit)." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

## Key Works

- "The Biblical Doctrine of Man" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "On the Psychological and Ethical Aspects of the Doctrine of the Trinity" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Divine and Human in the Bible" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "Calvin and the Reformation" (for context on Reformed anthropology)
- Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (secondary, for Warfield’s influence)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as the Biblical View**
    - Scripture consistently presents man as composed of **body** and **soul/spirit**.
    - The terms "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
    - No clear biblical evidence supports a third, distinct element in human nature.
    - The **Reformed tradition** upholds dichotomy as the historic position.
    - "The Bible knows nothing of a trichotomous constitution of man." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

2. **Trichotomy Rooted in Greek Philosophy**
    - Trichotomy entered Christian thought through **Platonic** and **Gnostic** influences.
    - Early church fathers who adopted trichotomy did so under philosophical, not biblical, pressure.
    - Warfield traced the historical development of trichotomy to extra-biblical sources.
    - He warned against reading philosophical categories into Scripture.
    - "The trichotomous conception is not of biblical, but of philosophical origin." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

3. **Unity of the Immaterial Aspect**
    - The **soul** and **spirit** are not separate substances but different aspects or functions of the same immaterial part.
    - Biblical passages that distinguish "soul" and "spirit" do so for emphasis, not ontology.
    - The **psychological unity** of man is essential for moral and spiritual responsibility.
    - Warfield stressed the danger of dividing the inner life into separate entities.
    - "The distinction between 'soul' and 'spirit' is functional, not substantial." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

4. **Anthropology and Soteriology**
    - A dichotomous view safeguards the integrity of **original sin** and **regeneration**.
    - Trichotomy can lead to erroneous views of the **image of God** and the nature of salvation.
    - Warfield argued that regeneration affects the whole immaterial man, not just a "spirit" part.
    - He maintained that **Reformed soteriology** presupposes a dichotomous anthropology.
    - "The whole man, not a part of him, is the subject of salvation." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

5. **Exegesis over Speculation**
    - Warfield insisted that **doctrine** must be grounded in careful exegesis, not speculative philosophy.
    - He critiqued trichotomists for relying on ambiguous texts and philosophical reasoning.
    - The authority of Scripture is paramount in determining the constitution of man.
    - Warfield modeled a rigorous, text-driven approach to **systematic theology**.
    - "We must not allow ourselves to be led astray by the ambiguous use of terms." ("The Biblical Doctrine of Man")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of **dichotomy** shaped twentieth-century **Reformed anthropology** and remains a standard reference in debates over human constitution. His insistence on biblical exegesis over philosophical speculation influenced generations of theologians and solidified the dichotomous view in mainstream evangelical and Reformed circles. Warfield’s work continues to be cited as a decisive critique of trichotomy and a model of theological method rooted in Scripture.
