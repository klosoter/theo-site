# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached the question of **trichotomy vs dichotomy** from a Reformed perspective, emphasizing the unity of the human person while recognizing the scriptural language of **body**, **soul**, and **spirit**. He ultimately favored a **dichotomist** view, arguing that the distinction between soul and spirit is functional rather than ontological, and that the human being is fundamentally composed of two substances: **body** and **soul**. Kuyper’s anthropology reflects his broader commitments to **Reformed theology** and the integrity of **creation**.

- "Scripture never teaches that man consists of three substances, but always that he consists of two: body and soul." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Works

- Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology (1898)
- Dictaten Dogmatiek (Dogmatics Lectures, unpublished but influential)
- Principles of Sacred Theology (English translation, 1898)
- Created in God’s Image (secondary, J. Douma, for Kuyper’s anthropology)
- Abraham Kuyper: A Centennial Reader (ed. Bratt, selections on anthropology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Scriptural Anthropology**
    - Argues that **Scripture** consistently presents humans as composed of **body** and **soul**.
    - Sees references to "spirit" as describing a function or aspect of the soul, not a separate substance.
    - Emphasizes the unity and integrity of the human person.
    - Rejects speculative divisions not grounded in biblical exegesis.
    - "The distinction between soul and spirit is not substantial, but functional." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Maintains that **body** and **soul** are intimately united in human existence.
    - Warns against dualisms that fragment the person.
    - Views the **image of God** as encompassing the whole person.
    - Connects anthropology to the broader doctrine of **creation**.
    - "Man is not a soul that has a body, but a living unity of body and soul." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Rejection of Trichotomy’s Historical Roots**
    - Notes that trichotomy has roots in **Greek philosophy** rather than biblical revelation.
    - Critiques the influence of **Platonism** on Christian anthropology.
    - Argues that early church trichotomist views were later corrected by Reformed orthodoxy.
    - Sees trichotomy as undermining the biblical doctrine of **sin** and **redemption**.
    - "The trichotomist view is a foreign importation into Christian doctrine." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

4. **Functional Distinction of Soul and Spirit**
    - Recognizes that "spirit" can refer to the soul’s capacity for **God-consciousness**.
    - Affirms that "soul" often denotes the seat of **life** and **personality**.
    - Holds that these distinctions are within the one immaterial substance.
    - Uses this framework to interpret key biblical texts (e.g., Hebrews 4:12).
    - "Spirit and soul are not two substances, but two sides of the same immaterial being." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Anthropology and Soteriology**
    - Connects the dichotomist view to the doctrines of **sin**, **regeneration**, and **resurrection**.
    - Argues that the whole person is affected by the Fall and redeemed in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul.
    - Sees anthropology as foundational for understanding **covenant** and **eschatology**.
    - "Redemption is for the whole man, body and soul, not for a part of him only." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust defense of **dichotomy** shaped subsequent Reformed anthropology and provided a bulwark against speculative trichotomist schemes. His insistence on the unity of the human person influenced later Neo-Calvinist thought and contributed to the development of a holistic Christian worldview. Kuyper’s approach remains a reference point in debates over the nature of humanity, especially within confessional Reformed circles.
