# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine addressed the nature of the human constitution primarily through the lens of **dichotomy**, viewing humans as composed of **body** and **soul**, with the **spirit** often considered a faculty or aspect of the soul rather than a separate substance. He rejected the strict **trichotomist** division (body, soul, spirit) found in some earlier Christian thought, emphasizing the unity and simplicity of the **soul** as the seat of reason and will. Augustine’s anthropology deeply influenced later **Western Christian** understandings of human nature.

- "For man is not made up of three certain things, body, soul, and spirit, as if the soul and the spirit were different; but when the soul is called by this name, spirit, it is not because it is itself different from the soul, but because it is so called in respect to God." (On the Trinity, 15.7.11)

## Key Works

- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram)
- On the Soul and Its Origin (De Anima et eius Origine)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomous View of Human Nature**
    - Humanity consists of **body** and **soul**, not three distinct substances.
    - The **soul** is the principle of life and rationality.
    - The **spirit** is not a separate entity but an aspect or function of the soul.
    - Augustine critiques trichotomy as lacking scriptural and philosophical support.
    - "But the apostle, by putting the soul for the spirit, shows that the soul is not one thing, the spirit another, but that the soul itself is called spirit." (On the Trinity, 15.7.11)

2. **Unity of the Soul**
    - The **soul** is a simple, immaterial substance.
    - All faculties (reason, will, memory) are unified within the soul.
    - The soul animates and governs the body.
    - Augustine resists dividing the soul into separable parts.
    - "The soul is not composed of parts, but is a simple substance." (On the Trinity, 10.10.14)

3. **Scriptural Interpretation of Anthropological Terms**
    - Augustine interprets biblical references to "spirit" and "soul" as often interchangeable.
    - He emphasizes the need for careful exegesis of Pauline texts.
    - He argues that distinctions in terminology do not imply ontological separateness.
    - Augustine prioritizes the broader biblical witness over isolated proof texts.
    - "For sometimes the soul is called spirit, and sometimes the spirit is called soul." (On the Trinity, 15.7.11)

4. **Philosophical Influences on Anthropology**
    - Augustine draws on **Platonic** and **Neoplatonic** sources.
    - He adapts philosophical psychology to Christian doctrine.
    - He rejects the Platonic tripartite soul in favor of a unified soul.
    - His anthropology is shaped by both Scripture and philosophical reasoning.
    - "The philosophers themselves, who have written much about the soul, have not been able to divide it into parts." (City of God, 14.2)

5. **Theological Implications for Salvation and Resurrection**
    - The unity of body and soul is essential for understanding **resurrection**.
    - The soul’s immortality undergirds hope for eternal life.
    - Salvation involves the whole person, not just a spiritual component.
    - The dichotomous view supports the doctrine of bodily resurrection.
    - "The soul, when separated from the body, is not the whole man, but the soul of a man." (City of God, 13.24)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s **dichotomous** anthropology became foundational for Western Christian theology, shaping medieval and Reformation thought. His rejection of trichotomy influenced major figures such as **Aquinas** and **Calvin**, who followed his understanding of the soul’s unity. Augustine’s careful exegesis and integration of philosophical insights set a standard for later theological reflection on human nature. His views continue to inform contemporary debates on the constitution of the human person within the **Reformed tradition**.
