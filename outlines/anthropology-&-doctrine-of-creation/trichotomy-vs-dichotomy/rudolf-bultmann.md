# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** through his existential and **demythologizing** framework, rejecting the literal division of human nature into **body, soul, and spirit**. He argued that New Testament anthropology is fundamentally **unitary**, emphasizing the existential relationship of the person to God rather than metaphysical distinctions within human nature.

- "The New Testament does not present a doctrine of man as a composite of body, soul, and spirit, but sees man as a unity." ("Theology of the New Testament")

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Anthropological Unity**
   - Human beings are fundamentally a unified whole, not a composite of separable parts.
   - The New Testament language of **body, soul, and spirit** is interpreted existentially, not ontologically.
   - Bultmann rejects both **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** as speculative metaphysics.
   - The focus is on the person’s relationship to God, not on internal divisions.
   - "The New Testament does not present a doctrine of man as a composite of body, soul, and spirit, but sees man as a unity." ("Theology of the New Testament")

2. **Demythologizing Biblical Anthropology**
   - Scriptural references to **spirit** and **soul** are mythological expressions of existential realities.
   - Demythologizing seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind ancient categories.
   - The language of **trichotomy** is a product of Hellenistic influence, not essential to Christian faith.
   - True understanding comes from interpreting these terms existentially, not literally.
   - "Mythological thinking distinguishes between body, soul, and spirit, but this is not the concern of the New Testament." ("New Testament and Mythology")

3. **Existential Interpretation of Personhood**
   - The human person is defined by existence before God, not by metaphysical structure.
   - **Sin**, **faith**, and **decision** are central to understanding human nature.
   - The existential situation, not ontological composition, is the focus of biblical anthropology.
   - The call to authentic existence supersedes speculative anthropology.
   - "Man is not a thing, but a possibility, an event that happens." ("Faith and Understanding")

4. **Critique of Hellenistic Influence**
   - Bultmann argues that **trichotomy** reflects Greek philosophical categories, not biblical thought.
   - Early Christian anthropology was shaped by its Jewish roots, which emphasized unity.
   - The adoption of **trichotomy** in later theology distorts the original message.
   - The New Testament’s use of anthropological terms is functional, not ontological.
   - "The distinction between body, soul, and spirit is foreign to the Old Testament and to primitive Christianity." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Soteriological Focus**
   - Salvation is not about the restoration of parts, but the transformation of the whole person.
   - The **resurrection** and **new life** are existential realities, not reconstitution of body, soul, and spirit.
   - The gospel addresses the person as a whole in their concrete existence.
   - Theological anthropology must serve the proclamation of the **kerygma**, not speculative doctrine.
   - "The message of the New Testament is addressed to man as a whole, calling him to decision and faith." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s rejection of **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** in favor of a unitary, existential anthropology profoundly influenced modern **biblical theology** and New Testament studies. His emphasis on demythologizing shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation to the existential situation of the believer. While controversial, his approach challenged traditional categories and prompted renewed discussion on the meaning of **personhood** in Christian theology. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between biblical language and philosophical anthropology.
