# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas advocated a **dichotomous** view of human nature, distinguishing between **body** and **soul** rather than positing a separate **spirit** as in trichotomy. For Aquinas, the **soul** is the substantial form of the body, encompassing all aspects of human life, including rationality and spirituality, thus rejecting a strict division into body, soul, and spirit. His position is rooted in **Aristotelian anthropology** and has been influential in shaping the **Roman Catholic** and broader **Western Christian** understanding of the human constitution.

- "The soul is not a body, but the act of a body; and so it is not composed of matter and form, but is itself a form." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, qq. 75–76
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book II, chs. 56–68
- Commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima
- De Spiritualibus Creaturis
- The Human Soul: A Philosophical Inquiry (secondary, John Haldane)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy of Body and Soul**
   - Human beings are composed of two principles: **body** (matter) and **soul** (form).
   - The **soul** is the single substantial form that animates the body.
   - There is no separate **spirit** distinct from the rational soul.
   - The rational soul encompasses vegetative, sensitive, and intellectual powers.
   - "The soul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is not a body, but the act of a body." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
   - The **soul** and **body** together constitute one substance.
   - The soul is not a separate entity inhabiting the body but its form.
   - Human identity is not divided among multiple souls or substances.
   - The resurrection involves the reuniting of the same soul and body.
   - "The soul is united to the body as its form, and thus constitutes with it one being." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 76, a. 1)

3. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
   - Aquinas explicitly rejects the division into **body, soul, and spirit** as three substances.
   - He interprets biblical references to "spirit" as aspects or powers of the one rational soul.
   - Trichotomy is seen as philosophically and theologically unnecessary.
   - The **spirit** is not a distinct substance but refers to the soul’s highest faculties.
   - "The soul and the spirit are not two substances, but the same substance considered in different respects." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 7)

4. **Aristotelian Anthropology**
   - Aquinas adopts Aristotle’s **hylomorphic** (matter-form) framework.
   - The **soul** is the form of the body, giving it life and function.
   - All human faculties (vegetative, sensitive, rational) are rooted in the one soul.
   - The soul’s immateriality grounds human rationality and immortality.
   - "The soul is the first principle of life in living things of nature." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 1)

5. **Immortality and Spirituality of the Soul**
   - The rational soul is **immortal** and survives bodily death.
   - The soul’s intellectual operations demonstrate its immaterial nature.
   - The soul is capable of knowing universals and contemplating God.
   - The soul’s immortality is essential for **eschatology** and moral responsibility.
   - "The human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is something incorporeal and subsistent." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 75, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s **dichotomous anthropology** became normative in Roman Catholic theology and deeply influenced Western Christian thought. His synthesis of **Aristotelian philosophy** with Christian doctrine provided a robust framework for understanding the unity and complexity of human nature. Later debates on trichotomy versus dichotomy often reference Aquinas as a key authority for the latter position. His views continue to shape contemporary discussions in philosophical theology and Christian anthropology.
