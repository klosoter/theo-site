### TITLE
One Human Nature: Defending Dichotomy against Trichotomist Fragmentation

- Core issue: Whether Scripture and sound theological anthropology teach that humans consist of two distinguishable aspects (**body–soul**) or three (**body–soul–spirit**), and how this bears on sin, salvation, and eschatology.  
- Decisive figures: Origen, Augustine, John Calvin, Franz Delitzsch, Lewis Sperry Chafer.  
- Relevant traditions: Greek patristic and Latin Augustinian anthropology, Reformation and **federal theology**, nineteenth‑century Lutheran biblicism, early twentieth‑century dispensational and evangelical trichotomism.  
- Debates:  
  - Internal: dichotomist debates on **substance–attribute** language, inherited guilt, **monism vs dualism**; trichotomist disagreements over the spirit’s fallenness and regeneration.  
  - External: interaction with Greek philosophical dualism, modern materialism and physicalism, and non‑Christian tripartite anthropologies.  
  - Contemporary: implications for **neuroscience**, **psychology**, deliverance ministry, and so‑called “soul care” models.  
- Defended position: Classical Christian anthropology is best construed as a **substance dualist dichotomy** (body and one immaterial aspect described under multiple relational terms as soul or spirit), with trichotomy rejected as exegetically unsound, theologically destabilizing, and pastorally misleading.

### ESSAY
At issue in the trichotomy versus dichotomy debate is not a minor terminological preference but the coherence of a Christian anthropology that can integrate biblical exegesis, a doctrine of sin, a robust soteriology, and the church’s confession of the intermediate state. The core question is whether man is constituted by two aspects, **body and soul** where soul and spirit are functionally or substantially one, or by three ontologically distinct components, **body–soul–spirit**, each with its own integrity and operations. This is not merely about how many “parts” we count but about whether Scripture’s diverse language for the inner life signals multiple substances, or one immaterial principle described under varying relational and functional aspects.

The biblical data present a rich vocabulary: nephesh and ruach in the Old Testament, psyche and pneuma in the New. Human beings are portrayed in embodied concreteness, yet capable of personal existence beyond bodily death. A Westminster examiner will press whether one can give a principled account of this language without collapsing into either a reductive physicalism, on the one hand, or a speculative partitioning of the human person, on the other. My contention is that the best reading of Scripture within the classic Christian consensus is a **dichotomous substance dualism**: man as a single psychosomatic unity comprised of a material body and an immaterial, rational–volitional principle which Scripture variously designates as soul and spirit. The multiplicity of terms describes distinct relations and operations of the one immaterial aspect, not multiple distinct immaterial “parts.” Trichotomy, though historically recurrent and often motivated by piety, introduces ontological distinctions Scripture does not sustain and tends to distort doctrines of sin, regeneration, and the intermediate state.

The earliest decisive figure for the later debate is Origen of Alexandria (died 253), who worked at the interface of Greek philosophy and early Christian exegesis. Deeply shaped by Middle Platonism, Origen developed a speculative anthropology in which the rational soul preexisted its embodiment. While he does at times speak of body, soul, and spirit, his usage is not yet the tidy evangelical trichotomy of later centuries. Rather, influenced by 1 Thessalonians 5.23 and Hebrews 4.12, he construes spirit as the rational, God–oriented aspect of the soul, capable of ascent to contemplation, over against the “soul” as seat of passions and intermediary between spirit and body. The entire schema is calibrated toward his spiritualizing exegesis, where the “spiritual sense” of Scripture corresponds to the spirit in man. Origen thus reframes biblical anthropology by inserting a gradated hierarchy within the inner man that aligns closely with Platonic tripartition. Though he does not sharply reify spirit and soul as two substances, he bequeaths to the tradition a functional tripartism: spirit as higher, intellective principle; soul as lower, passionate and mediating; body as the outer shell.

This Origenian impulse shapes key parts of the Greek patristic tradition, though with significant modification. Many Greek fathers stress man as a psychosomatic unity in the image of God, yet they retain a tendency to speak of the “spirit” as the highest faculty by which man knows and communes with God. A Westminster examiner may press: does this make the Greek fathers trichotomists? The best answer is nuanced. Their anthropology is fundamentally dualist in substance, with one body and one immaterial principle, but employs a rich faculty psychology that sometimes appears tripartite. Spirit denotes the highest operation of the soul rather than a distinct third entity. The later, more rigid trichotomy that distinguishes soul and spirit as separable entities with distinct moral statuses goes beyond this patristic usage.

The decisive break from speculative tripartism into a more conceptually disciplined dichotomy comes with Augustine of Hippo (354–430). Augustine receives the Greek vocabulary but reformulates it under a different set of concerns: original sin, grace, and the beatific vision. For Augustine, man is a rational soul using a mortal body. The human person is not a composite of three ontologically distinct immaterial components but a single rational soul that animates the body, endowed with memory, understanding, and will. Where he does employ tripartite language, it is clearly in the context of faculties or analogies, not substances. For example, in De Trinitate he uses memory, understanding, and will as an intrapsychic analogy of the Trinity without suggesting three “parts” of the soul. Similarly, he can speak of “mind, knowledge, love” as a triad within the one soul. His insistence on the soul as a simple substance underwrites his strong doctrine of **divine simplicity** analogically mirrored in the unity of the human spirit.

Augustine’s anti‑Pelagian context drives him to emphasize that the entire inner man, not just a lower “soul” layer, is fallen in Adam. There is no preserved apex naturae, no intact “spirit” untainted by sin. If an examiner asks whether one can hold trichotomy and still maintain total depravity, this Augustinian point must be central: Scripture indicts the mind, heart, conscience, and spirit of man as corrupt. Augustine’s concept of inherited guilt and corruption rests on the assumption that the immaterial aspect of man is unitary and comprehensively disordered. Were a higher spirit to exist above the fall, the need for **regeneration** as a radical re‑creation would be blunted. Augustine thus resets the trajectory against any anthropology that partitions the inner man into more and less fallen layers.

The Reformation, particularly in its Calvinian and later Reformed scholastic expressions, consolidates this Augustinian dichotomy. John Calvin (1509–1564) is decisive, not simply because he opts for dichotomous language, but because he integrates anthropology with his doctrines of **covenant**, federal headship, and union with Christ. In the Institutes, Calvin typically speaks of man as composed of body and soul, with soul encompassing all inner faculties and being by nature immortal. He explicitly warns against idle speculation about “parts” of the soul beyond what Scripture clearly teaches. His method prioritizes **analogical knowledge** of ourselves before God via the Word rather than philosophical partitioning.

More importantly, Calvin extends Augustine’s anti‑Pelagian, anti‑Origenian concerns. He argues that sin has corrupted the whole man, including reason and will, such that no natural “spirit” remains upright or immune. When Paul contrasts flesh and spirit, Calvin interprets this ethically and redemptively, not ontologically: “flesh” denotes man as he is in Adam, dominated by sin, while “spirit” denotes the renewed principle of life in Christ through the Holy Spirit. Likewise, in 1 Thessalonians 5.23 Calvin sees Paul piling up near synonyms to emphasize total sanctification, not mapping a trichotomous ontology. For Calvin, “soul” and “spirit” can refer to the same inner reality under different aspects, and at times “spirit” can designate the soul in its Godward orientation or the special work of the Holy Spirit. His dichotomy is thus guarded by a principled hermeneutic: do not turn terms of redemptive contrast into ontological indexes.

Reformed scholastic and **federal theology** after Calvin, such as Francis Turretin, follow this Augustinian–Calvinian line. Turretin explicitly rejects trichotomy, arguing that soul and spirit denote the same substance under diverse respects. Federal anthropology, in which Adam as covenant head represents the race, presupposes that whatever ontological structure was his is ours. If we speculate that Adam possessed a uniquely intact higher spirit layer that we now lack, we destabilize his representative relation to us. Moreover, doctrines like the intermediate state rest on the assumption that the one soul survives death, awaiting bodily resurrection, not that two immaterial layers may be differently disposed.

The modern revival of explicit trichotomy is strongly shaped by Franz Delitzsch (1813–1890), a Lutheran biblical scholar whose System of Biblical Psychology became a fountainhead for later evangelical tripartite schemes. Delitzsch aims to derive a “biblical psychology” inductively from Scripture, free from Greek philosophical intrusion, yet ironically his project bears a quasi‑scientific systematicity akin to contemporary psychologies. He argues that man consists of body, soul, and spirit, where soul is the life principle mediating between body and spirit, and spirit is the higher God‑conscious principle. Delitzsch leans heavily on 1 Thessalonians 5.23, Hebrews 4.12, and selected Old Testament usages where nephesh and ruach appear distinct. For him, the soul belongs to the world of nature, while the spirit belongs to the world of God; in regeneration, the spirit is quickened, and the soul and body are progressively renewed.

Delitzsch’s framing reshapes the evangelical conversation by setting up a neat alignment: body with world–consciousness, soul with self–consciousness, spirit with God–consciousness. He provides a conceptual grid that later trichotomists adopt almost wholesale. Yet his reading is vulnerable on several fronts that examiners will probe. First, the hermeneutical assumption that linguistic distinction entails ontological distinction is dubious; Scripture also piles up near synonyms for rhetorical fullness. Second, Delitzsch tends to systematize texts without sufficient attention to redemptive‑historical and literary context; Hebrews 4.12, for instance, stresses the penetrating judgment of the Word, not a mapping of human metaphysics. Third, his nature–grace alignment between soul and spirit tilts in a semi‑Pelagian direction, since it easily suggests that the “spirit” retains a latent capacity for God that regeneration merely awakens, rather than receiving a new heart ex nihilo.

The most influential modern evangelical trichotomy, particularly in North American circles, arises in early dispensationalism, with Lewis Sperry Chafer (1871–1952) as a central figure. As founder of Dallas Theological Seminary and author of a multi‑volume Systematic Theology, Chafer popularized a pastoralized trichotomy oriented toward spiritual growth and “victorious Christian living.” He adopts the Delitzschian grid and reinterprets it within a dispensational framework. For Chafer, man’s spirit is the faculty Godwards, dead in the unbeliever and made alive at regeneration; the soul comprises intellect, emotion, and will; the body mediates worldly contact. Christian experience is then explained by whether the believer “walks according to the spirit” or remains “soulish.”

Chafer’s trichotomy is pastorally attractive because it offers a ready‑made diagnostic for spiritual problems: Is this an issue in the spirit, the soul, or the body. It also lends itself to sanctification schemes that distinguish between “carnal” and “spiritual” Christians in ontological terms. But precisely here the theological cost becomes apparent. First, the alignment of spirit with the regenerate nature and soul with a lower, quasi‑neutral realm undercuts total depravity and obscures the ongoing sinfulness of the believer’s inner life. Second, the sharp reification of spirit over against soul fuels a quasi‑gnostic mentality in which bodily and psychological realities are downplayed relative to an inner “spirit life.” Third, it disrupts the Pauline contrast between “flesh” and “spirit,” where “spirit” refers primarily to the Holy Spirit’s reign, not to an autonomous human spirit layer. Under critique, Chafer’s scheme reveals itself as an over‑systematization of devotional language into a rigid metaphysic.

The internal debates within the dichotomy camp concern not whether man is two or three, but how best to articulate the relationship between the one immaterial aspect and its various powers, and how robustly to affirm **substance dualism** in a scientific age. Some Reformed theologians emphasize the simplicity of the soul and interpret “spirit” as a term for the soul’s Godward relationality. Others stress more detailed faculty psychology, distinguishing intellect, will, affections, and conscience. Disagreement also arises over whether “soul” is the best umbrella term, given biblical usage of “heart,” “inner man,” and “spirit.” Yet there is broad consensus that these are distinct modes and powers of one immaterial principle, not distinct substances.

In contrast, internal trichotomist debates revolve around the status of the human spirit in the fall and in regeneration. Some, more orthodox, insist that the entire person, including spirit, is spiritually dead and corrupted, though the spirit is the particular subject of regeneration. Others, influenced by Keswick or higher‑life teaching, speak as if there remains in man a dormant spirit awaiting activation, thereby smuggling in a Pelagian residue. Within Pentecostal and charismatic streams, trichotomy sometimes intertwines with views of demonic oppression, suggesting that demons can inhabit the soul but not the spirit of believers. This creates a practical dualism and undermines the sufficiency of Christ and the Spirit in sanctification.

Externally, the dichotomy–trichotomy debate sits in tension with at least two major rival frameworks. On one side stand modern materialism and Christian physicalism, which deny any immaterial soul and construe human persons as complex physical organisms. Against these, both biblically grounded dichotomy and trichotomy insist on an intermediate state and on the continuity of personal identity beyond bodily death, thereby requiring some form of **dualism**. On the other side, one finds various religious tripartite anthropologies, from Platonic and Neoplatonic threefold souls to certain strands of Eastern spirituality that speak of body, soul, and spirit as ascending layers. Examiners may ask whether Christian trichotomy is a baptized version of these. Historically, the lines of influence from Greek philosophical tripartition into Origen and beyond are evident. Moreover, the tendency to valorize spirit as intrinsically Godward and to denigrate soul or body as lower easily echoes non‑Christian ascetical patterns.

The contemporary debate is further complicated by developments in neuroscience and psychology. Some Christian thinkers argue that advances in brain science undermine traditional **substance dualism** and render both dichotomy and trichotomy obsolete. Others, including Reformed analytic philosophers, defend dualism on metaphysical and biblical grounds, while remaining agnostic on the precise internal structure of the soul. The dichotomist can respond that Scripture’s insistence on personal subsistence after death, Christ’s words to the thief on the cross, and the consistent witness to an inner aspect that can be absent from the body, all demand an ontologically robust, though creaturely, immaterial principle. Neuroscience explains the correlation between brain states and mental states but does not reduce them. Therefore, a carefully articulated dichotomy remains coherent and necessary.

In the realm of pastoral practice, the trichotomy–dichotomy dispute surfaces in counseling models, spiritual formation, and deliverance ministries. Some “biblical counseling” paradigms explicitly reject trichotomy as an unbiblical intrusion that fractures the unity of the person and encourages a therapeutic compartmentalization of problems. Others, particularly in charismatic circles, structure entire ministries around discerning whether an issue is of the body, soul, or spirit, sometimes suggesting that certain sins or torments lodge in one area while leaving another untouched. Here the dichotomist must press the unity and pervasiveness of indwelling sin and the holistic sanctification wrought by the Spirit. Sanctification is not the incremental conquest of lower faculties by a pristine higher spirit, but the progressive renewal of the whole person in union with Christ.

A Westminster oral examiner will likely hone in on the key proof texts trichotomists wield and demand direct engagement. 1 Thessalonians 5.23 speaks of spirit and soul and body being sanctified; Hebrews 4.12 speaks of the word of God dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow, discerning thoughts and intentions. Do these not teach three “parts”? The dichotomist answer must appeal to biblical parallelism and rhetorical intensification. In 1 Thessalonians, Paul is praying for comprehensive sanctification, not teaching an ontology. Similar triple and multiple groupings appear elsewhere, such as heart, soul, mind, and strength. No one infers four substances from that. In Hebrews 4, the “division” of soul and spirit is parallel to joints and marrow; the point is that God’s word penetrates to the deepest recesses of our being, not that soul and spirit are metaphysically separable entities. In both cases, the burden of proof lies on the trichotomist to show that terms of comprehensive description entail ontological partitioning, which they do not.

Another likely question concerns whether the dichotomy position adequately accounts for passages where “spirit” is used distinctively. For example, in 1 Corinthians 14 Paul speaks of praying with the spirit and with the mind also; in Romans 8 the Spirit bears witness with our spirit. The dichotomist can respond that “spirit” here functions as a relational or functional designation: the human inner self as engaged by and in communion with the Holy Spirit. It signals the Godward orientation of the one inner man, not a separable entity. Moreover, the Old Testament often uses nephesh and ruach interchangeably for life, inner self, or person, warning against any simplistic lexical argument.

Finally, the question arises whether the dichotomy view risks an abstract, unbiblical dualism that elevates soul over body. The answer is that a properly Christian dichotomy is not a body–prison vs soul–jewel scheme but a **psychosomatic unity** grounded in creation and resurrection. The body is intrinsic to human nature; death is an evil rupture; the intermediate state is an abnormal condition of “nakedness” awaiting clothed glory. The soul’s separability in death is a consequence of sin and a testimony to continued personal identity, not an ideal. Here, dichotomy proves more compatible than trichotomy with the biblical emphasis on bodily resurrection and the goodness of creation. Trichotomy’s tendency to stratify the inner life can foster a spirituality that underemphasizes embodiment and ordinary creaturely means.

In sum, the case for dichotomy rests on the convergence of biblical exegesis, historical consensus, doctrinal coherence, and pastoral wisdom. Origen’s proto‑trichotomy arises from speculative exegesis and Platonic influence and is rightly corrected by Augustine’s insistence on a single rational soul wholly fallen and wholly in need of grace. Calvin and the Reformed tradition consolidate this into a sober dichotomy tethered to **federal theology**, union with Christ, and the intermediate state. Delitzsch and Chafer, though influential, build elaborate tripartite schemes on slender exegetical foundations and introduce conceptual and pastoral distortions. Under the pressure of external challenges from materialism and rival religious anthropologies, a clear, biblically grounded **substance dualist dichotomy** remains the most defensible position for a Reformed theologian: one human nature, one body, one immaterial aspect described under multiple biblical terms, all comprehensively fallen in Adam and comprehensively renewed in Christ by the Spirit.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Dichotomy holds that humans consist of a material body and one immaterial aspect described as **soul** or **spirit** under different relations and functions; trichotomy posits three ontologically distinct components, **body–soul–spirit**.  
- Decisive figures: Origen introduced a functionally tripartite hierarchy aligning with Platonic patterns; Augustine articulated a unitary rational soul wholly fallen and needing grace; Calvin integrated a sober dichotomy with **covenant** and **federal theology** and read soul–spirit distinctions as functional; Delitzsch systematized a modern biblical trichotomy; Chafer popularized a pastoralized trichotomy tied to dispensational piety.  
- Debates: Internal debates concern faculty psychology, **substance dualism**, and the status of the “spirit” in fall and regeneration; external debates engage Greek tripartition, modern materialism, and non‑Christian tripartite schemes; contemporary debates focus on neuroscience, counseling, deliverance ministry, and holistic sanctification.  
- Defended position: A **substance dualist dichotomy** is biblically, historically, and theologically superior; soul and spirit are not distinct substances but diverse biblical descriptions of the one immaterial aspect of man.  
- Likely examiner questions:  
  - Does 1 Thessalonians 5.23 teach trichotomy? → No, it uses piled‑up terms for comprehensive sanctification, not ontological partitioning.  
  - How do you explain Hebrews 4.12’s “division of soul and spirit”? → As metaphor for the Word’s penetrating judgment, parallel to joints and marrow, not a metaphysical taxonomy.  
  - Are the Greek fathers trichotomists? → Mostly no in substance; they use tripartite faculty language within an underlying dualist framework.  
  - How does dichotomy safeguard total depravity? → By affirming that the entire inner man, under every description including “spirit,” is fallen and must be regenerated.  
  - How does your view handle neuroscience? → By affirming **dualism** and the soul’s dependence on the brain for normal operations while maintaining the soul’s ontological distinctness and persistence beyond bodily death.
