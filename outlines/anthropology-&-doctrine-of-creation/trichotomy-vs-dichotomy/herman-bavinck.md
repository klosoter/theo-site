# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck addressed the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** within the broader context of **Christian anthropology**. He firmly rejected the trichotomist division of human nature into **body, soul, and spirit**, instead affirming the **dichotomous** view that humans consist of only **body and soul** (or spirit), emphasizing the unity and integrity of the human person as taught in **Reformed theology**.

- "Scripture knows no trichotomy; man does not consist of three parts but of two." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Volume 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Volume 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- "The Origin, Essence, and Purpose of Man" (in Our Reasonable Faith)
- The Wonderful Works of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
    - Bavinck critiques the trichotomist view as a product of **Greek philosophical influence** rather than biblical teaching.
    - He argues that **Scripture** uses "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably, not as distinct substances.
    - Trichotomy undermines the **unity of the human person** and risks dualistic errors.
    - He maintains that the **Reformed tradition** consistently affirms dichotomy.
    - "The trichotomist view is not supported by Scripture, but is rather a foreign import." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

2. **Biblical Terminology and Usage**
    - Bavinck carefully analyzes the use of **nephesh** (soul) and **ruach/pneuma** (spirit) in the Old and New Testaments.
    - He concludes that these terms often overlap in meaning and function.
    - The distinction is functional or relational, not ontological.
    - He emphasizes the importance of **biblical exegesis** over philosophical speculation.
    - "Soul and spirit in Scripture do not denote two different substances, but different aspects of the same spiritual principle." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

3. **Unity of Human Nature**
    - Bavinck stresses the **psychosomatic unity** of the human person.
    - He opposes any division that would fragment human identity or responsibility.
    - The **image of God** is expressed in the whole person, not a particular part.
    - Human faculties (intellect, will, emotion) are aspects of the soul, not separate entities.
    - "Man is a unity; his spiritual and physical life are intimately connected." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

4. **Tradition and Confessional Alignment**
    - Bavinck aligns with the **Augustinian and Reformed confessions** on anthropology.
    - He notes that the **Belgic Confession** and **Heidelberg Catechism** assume dichotomy.
    - He critiques trichotomy as inconsistent with historic Christian doctrine.
    - The church fathers and Reformers largely rejected trichotomy.
    - "The Reformed confessions speak only of body and soul, never of three parts." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

5. **Implications for Soteriology and Eschatology**
    - Bavinck argues that dichotomy safeguards the doctrines of **sin, death, and resurrection**.
    - Trichotomy can lead to errors regarding the **immortality of the soul** and the nature of salvation.
    - The resurrection involves the whole person, not just the body or a part of the soul.
    - He warns against spiritualizing salvation in a way that neglects the body.
    - "Redemption is for the whole man, body and soul, not for a part of him." (Reformed Dogmatics, II)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped modern Reformed anthropology and remains a standard reference in debates over human constitution. His careful exegesis and engagement with both historical theology and contemporary philosophy have influenced generations of theologians. Bavinck’s emphasis on the **unity of the human person** continues to inform discussions on the image of God, the nature of salvation, and the Christian hope of resurrection.
