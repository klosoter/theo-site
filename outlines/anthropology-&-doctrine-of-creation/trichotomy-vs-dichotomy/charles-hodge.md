# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Reformed theology** and long-time professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, firmly advocated for the **dichotomous** view of human nature, holding that humans consist of two essential components: **body** and **soul** (or spirit). He rejected the **trichotomous** division (body, soul, and spirit) as unscriptural and inconsistent with the historic **Reformed anthropology**.

- "The Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testaments, make a sharp distinction between the soul or spirit and the body, but never between the soul and the spirit as distinct entities." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on Anthropology)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Review articles on anthropology
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Scriptural Anthropology**
    - Argues that **Scripture** consistently presents humans as composed of two parts: material and immaterial.
    - Maintains that "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Asserts that the **Reformed tradition** has historically affirmed dichotomy.
    - Views trichotomy as an import from **Greek philosophy** rather than biblical teaching.
    - "The Bible does not teach that there are three distinct substances in man, but only two." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of the Immaterial Part**
    - Emphasizes that the **soul** and **spirit** refer to the same immaterial essence.
    - Rejects the idea that humans possess a third, distinct spiritual principle.
    - Argues that distinctions between "soul" and "spirit" in Scripture are functional, not ontological.
    - Warns against speculative anthropology that divides the immaterial unnecessarily.
    - "The soul and spirit are not two distinct substances, but different aspects of the same immaterial principle." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Critique of Trichotomy’s Origins**
    - Identifies trichotomy as rooted in **Platonic** and **Gnostic** thought.
    - Claims early church fathers who adopted trichotomy were influenced by non-biblical sources.
    - Argues that trichotomy undermines the biblical doctrine of **sin** and **redemption**.
    - Suggests trichotomy can lead to theological errors, such as denying the unity of the person.
    - "Trichotomy is not only unscriptural, but it is dangerous in its theological consequences." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Implications for Doctrine of Sin**
    - Holds that dichotomy preserves the integrity of the **doctrine of original sin**.
    - Argues that trichotomy can imply part of man remains unfallen, which is unbiblical.
    - Insists that both soul and spirit are affected by the Fall.
    - Maintains that redemption in Christ addresses the whole person, not just a part.
    - "If the spirit is unfallen, then man does not need complete redemption, which contradicts the gospel." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Consistency with Reformed Confessions**
    - Aligns dichotomy with the **Westminster Confession of Faith** and other Reformed standards.
    - Notes that the confessions speak of body and soul, not body, soul, and spirit.
    - Argues that the Reformed tradition’s anthropology is both biblical and confessional.
    - Sees dichotomy as safeguarding the unity and dignity of the human person.
    - "The Reformed confessions know nothing of a threefold division of human nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped the standard position within **Reformed anthropology** and continues to influence evangelical and confessional traditions. His arguments against trichotomy have been widely cited in systematic theologies and remain a reference point in debates over the constitution of human nature. By rooting his position in both Scripture and the Reformed confessions, Hodge helped solidify dichotomy as the prevailing view in conservative Protestant circles.
