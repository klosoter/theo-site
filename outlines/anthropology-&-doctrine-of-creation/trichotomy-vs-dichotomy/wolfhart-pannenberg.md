# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg addressed the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** within **theological anthropology** by emphasizing the **unity of the human person** rather than any substantial division. He critiqued both classical trichotomist and dichotomist models, insisting that human identity is best understood as a holistic integration of body, soul, and spirit, grounded in **relationality** and oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment**.

- "The distinction between body, soul, and spirit is not a division into three substances, but a differentiation of functions within the unity of the person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on anthropology)
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Jesus—God and Man
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Unity over Substantial Division**
    - Rejects strict **trichotomy** (body, soul, spirit as separate substances).
    - Argues that **dichotomy** (body and soul) also risks abstraction from biblical witness.
    - Emphasizes the **functional unity** of the human person.
    - Sees all aspects as interdependent and inseparable in human existence.
    "The unity of the person is not to be broken up by speculative anthropology." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Relational Anthropology**
    - Human identity is constituted in relation to **God** and others.
    - The **spirit** is not a separate substance but denotes openness to God.
    - The **soul** refers to the center of personal life, not an independent entity.
    - Anthropology must be grounded in **revelation** and **Christology**.
    "The human spirit is the openness of man to God and the world." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

3. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Full human identity is realized in the **resurrection**.
    - The distinction between body, soul, and spirit is provisional, awaiting eschatological completion.
    - The **future** determines the meaning of human existence.
    - Anthropology is inseparable from **eschatology**.
    "Man’s true being is determined by his future in God’s kingdom." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Critique of Greek Dualism**
    - Rejects **Platonic** and **Gnostic** dualisms as unbiblical.
    - Argues that biblical anthropology resists sharp body-soul separation.
    - Emphasizes the **Hebraic** view of the person as a psychosomatic unity.
    - Theological anthropology must avoid importing foreign philosophical categories.
    "Biblical thought knows no dualism of body and soul." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

5. **Christological Foundation**
    - The person of **Jesus Christ** is the model for true humanity.
    - Christ’s resurrection affirms the unity and destiny of human nature.
    - Anthropology must be shaped by the **incarnation** and **redemption**.
    - The meaning of body, soul, and spirit is clarified in Christ.
    "In Jesus Christ, the destiny of humanity as unity of body and spirit is revealed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **theological anthropology** has significantly influenced contemporary discussions on the nature of the human person, especially regarding the inadequacy of both trichotomist and dichotomist models. His insistence on the **unity of the person** and the centrality of eschatology has shaped both Protestant and ecumenical thought. By rooting anthropology in **Christology** and revelation, Pannenberg provided a robust alternative to dualistic and reductionist accounts, leaving a lasting mark on modern theology.
