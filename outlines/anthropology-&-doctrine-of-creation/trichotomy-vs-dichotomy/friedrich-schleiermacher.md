# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** through his broader commitment to the unity of human nature and the primacy of **religious consciousness**. He rejected the traditional trichotomous division of **body, soul, and spirit**, instead emphasizing a **psychological and anthropological monism** that aligns with his understanding of **God-consciousness** as the defining feature of humanity.

- "The distinction of soul and spirit is not to be maintained; the human being is a unity of sensuous and spiritual functions." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Schleiermacher: Life and Thought (ed. Richard Crouter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Human Nature**
   - Humanity is fundamentally a single, unified being rather than a composite of separable parts.
   - The distinction between **body, soul, and spirit** is seen as artificial and unhelpful.
   - All human faculties are interrelated and cannot be neatly divided.
   - The **God-consciousness** pervades the whole person, not just a "spirit" component.
   - "The human being is not a composite of separable substances, but a unity of life." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
   - The essence of religion is found in the feeling of absolute dependence.
   - This **God-consciousness** is not located in a distinct "spirit" but in the totality of human existence.
   - Religious experience is holistic, involving both psychological and physical dimensions.
   - The dichotomy/trichotomy debate is secondary to the reality of religious experience.
   - "Religion is neither knowing nor doing, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

3. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
   - Schleiermacher explicitly denies the necessity of a threefold division of human nature.
   - He critiques the exegetical and philosophical grounds for trichotomy.
   - The biblical language of "spirit" and "soul" is interpreted functionally, not ontologically.
   - He aligns more closely with a **dichotomous** or monistic anthropology.
   - "The distinction of soul and spirit is not to be maintained." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Anthropology and Christology**
   - His anthropology shapes his understanding of Christ's person.
   - Christ is the perfect realization of **God-consciousness** in human unity.
   - There is no need to posit a separate "spirit" in Christ distinct from his human soul.
   - The unity of Christ’s person mirrors the unity of human nature.
   - "In Christ, the divine and human are united in one consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Influence of Idealism and Romanticism**
   - Schleiermacher’s anthropology is shaped by German **Idealism** and **Romanticism**.
   - He emphasizes the organic unity of life and the interdependence of faculties.
   - The soul is not a substance but a mode of existence or relation.
   - Human nature is best understood dynamically, not as a static composite.
   - "The soul is not a thing, but a living relation." (Brief Outline of the Study of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s rejection of **trichotomy** and emphasis on the unity of human nature profoundly influenced modern **theological anthropology**. His approach shifted the focus from metaphysical speculation about human composition to the experiential and relational dimensions of religious life. Subsequent liberal and existential theologians built on his insights, moving away from traditional dichotomous or trichotomous frameworks. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions of **personhood** and the integration of psychology and theology.
