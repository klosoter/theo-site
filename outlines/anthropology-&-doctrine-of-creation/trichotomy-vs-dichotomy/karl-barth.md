# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth rejected both **trichotomy** (body, soul, spirit) and **dichotomy** (body and soul/spirit) as speculative anthropological schemes, insisting instead on the unity of the human person as revealed in **Christology**. For Barth, human nature must be understood in light of the **imago Dei** and the event of **revelation**, rather than through abstract philosophical categories.

- "Man is not a being composed of parts, but a whole, a unity, and as such he is the image of God." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics III/2: The Doctrine of Creation, §46–47
- Church Dogmatics I/1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Anthropological Unity in Christ**
   - Barth grounds human nature in the **unity of Christ’s person**, not in a division of parts.
   - Rejects both trichotomy and dichotomy as speculative and unbiblical.
   - Emphasizes that the **imago Dei** is found in relational wholeness, not in substance dualism.
   - Human beings are a psychosomatic unity, reflecting the unity of God’s act in creation and redemption.
   - "The New Testament does not know of a division of man into parts." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

2. **Critique of Speculative Schemes**
   - Barth sees trichotomy/dichotomy as products of **Greek philosophical influence** rather than biblical revelation.
   - Argues that such divisions distort the biblical witness to human nature.
   - Maintains that anthropology must be shaped by **revelation**, not philosophical tradition.
   - Warns against reading metaphysical categories into Scripture.
   - "The trichotomous and dichotomous views are both alien to the biblical witness." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

3. **Imago Dei as Relational**
   - The image of God is not a structural component but a **relational reality**.
   - Human distinctiveness is found in relationship to God and others, not in a tripartite or bipartite constitution.
   - The **imago Dei** is realized in encounter and response to God’s Word.
   - Anthropology is fundamentally theological, not metaphysical.
   - "The image of God is not a quality or faculty, but a relation." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

4. **Christological Determination of Anthropology**
   - All anthropology must be determined by the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ reveals true humanity, which is unified and whole.
   - Theological anthropology is inseparable from **Christology**.
   - Human nature is interpreted in light of the incarnation, not abstract essence.
   - "In Christ, we see what it means to be truly human." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

5. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
   - Barth opposes the idea that soul and body are separate substances.
   - Human existence is a **psychosomatic unity**.
   - The biblical witness affirms the wholeness of the person, not separable parts.
   - The resurrection affirms the unity and redemption of the whole person.
   - "Man is soul and body, but not two beings; he is one being in two aspects." (Church Dogmatics III/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of both **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** redirected modern theological anthropology toward a **Christocentric** and relational understanding of the human person. His emphasis on the unity of human nature, grounded in the **imago Dei** and revelation, has influenced both Protestant and Catholic thought. Barth’s approach challenged speculative and philosophical anthropologies, insisting that theology must be shaped by the reality of Christ and the witness of Scripture. This legacy continues to shape contemporary discussions on the nature of humanity in systematic theology.
