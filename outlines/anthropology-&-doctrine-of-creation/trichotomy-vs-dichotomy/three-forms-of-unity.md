# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—set forth a classic **Reformed anthropology** that affirms a **dichotomous** view of human nature: humanity consists of **body and soul**. These confessions reject the **trichotomous** division and emphasize the unity and integrity of the human person within the framework of **creation, fall, and redemption**.

- "Man consists of two parts, namely, body and soul." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (esp. Articles 14, 34)
- Heidelberg Catechism (esp. Q&A 6, 57)
- Canons of Dort (esp. Head III/IV, on human nature)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Humanity as Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is created by God with two essential components: **body and soul**.
    - The **soul** is immortal and distinct from the body, yet both are united in the human person.
    - The confessions consistently use "soul" to encompass the spiritual aspect of humanity.
    - No distinction is made between "soul" and "spirit" as separate substances.
    "Man consists of two parts, namely, body and soul." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

2. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
    - The division of humanity into **body, soul, and spirit** is not supported by the confessions.
    - Scriptural references to "spirit" are interpreted as synonymous with "soul" or as functional distinctions.
    - The trichotomous view is seen as speculative and lacking exegetical foundation.
    - The confessions emphasize the sufficiency of the dichotomous framework for understanding sin and salvation.
    "We believe that God created man out of the dust of the earth, and made and formed him after His own image and likeness, good, righteous, and holy; capable in all things to will agreeably to the will of God." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

3. **Unity and Integrity of the Person**
    - The **body and soul** are united to form a single, integrated human person.
    - Sin affects both aspects of human nature, not just the physical or spiritual part.
    - Redemption in Christ involves the restoration of the whole person.
    - The resurrection hope is for the reunification of body and soul.
    "My soul, after this life, shall be immediately taken up to Christ, its Head." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 57)

4. **Anthropology Grounded in Creation and Redemption**
    - Human nature is defined in relation to **creation in the image of God**.
    - The fall corrupted both body and soul, necessitating comprehensive redemption.
    - The confessions stress the restoration of the image of God in both aspects.
    - The dichotomous view supports the doctrines of original sin and regeneration.
    "God created man good, and after His own image, that is, in righteousness and true holiness." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 6)

5. **Scriptural Sufficiency and Simplicity**
    - The confessions prioritize **biblical language** and categories in anthropology.
    - They avoid speculative distinctions not clearly taught in Scripture.
    - The dichotomous view is presented as faithful to the **plain teaching of Scripture**.
    - The confessions urge humility and restraint in doctrinal formulation.
    "We must acquiesce in what God has revealed to us in His Word, without prying into secret things." (Belgic Confession, Art. 13)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped the **Reformed tradition's** understanding of human nature, establishing the dichotomous view as confessional orthodoxy. Their clear articulation of **body and soul** has influenced subsequent Reformed theology, catechesis, and pastoral practice. By grounding anthropology in Scripture and the doctrines of creation and redemption, these confessions have provided a durable framework for addressing questions of sin, salvation, and the resurrection. Their rejection of trichotomy remains a hallmark of classic Reformed anthropology.
