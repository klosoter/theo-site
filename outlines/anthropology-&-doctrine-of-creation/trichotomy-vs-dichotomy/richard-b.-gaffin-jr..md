# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** by affirming the historic **Reformed dichotomist** position, which holds that humans are composed of **body and soul** (or spirit) rather than three distinct substances. He emphasizes the **unity of the human person** and cautions against speculative anthropology that divides human nature beyond biblical warrant. Gaffin’s exegesis and theological method stress the importance of **biblical theology** and the **redemptive-historical** framework for understanding human constitution.

- "Scripture does not support a trichotomist view of human nature; rather, it presents man as a unity of body and soul/spirit." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Anthropology" in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson, David Wright)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Articles in Westminster Theological Journal addressing anthropology and Pauline theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Argues that **Scripture** consistently presents humans as composed of two parts: **body** and **soul/spirit**.
    - Maintains that terms like "soul" and "spirit" are often used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Rejects the notion that "spirit" is a separate, third substance distinct from "soul."
    - Emphasizes the **Reformed tradition’s** commitment to dichotomy.
    - "The biblical data do not sustain a trichotomist anthropology." (New Dictionary of Theology)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Stresses that human beings are a **psychosomatic unity**, not a composite of separable parts.
    - Warns against dualistic or tripartite views that fragment the person.
    - Connects anthropology to **Christology**, noting Christ assumed a full human nature.
    - Affirms that redemption encompasses the whole person, not just one "part."
    - "Man is not a composite of separable entities but a unified being." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Exegesis of Key Texts**
    - Analyzes passages like 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12, arguing they do not teach trichotomy.
    - Notes that **parallelism** and **Hebraic thought** often use multiple terms for emphasis, not ontological distinction.
    - Points out that "spirit" can refer to the person’s orientation toward God, not a separate substance.
    - Highlights the importance of **contextual exegesis** over systematic imposition.
    - "Paul’s language is not intended to establish a tripartite anthropology." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Theological and Pastoral Implications**
    - Warns that trichotomy can lead to **spiritual elitism** or unbiblical distinctions in sanctification.
    - Argues that dichotomy better supports doctrines like the **resurrection** and **union with Christ**.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of the person in death and resurrection.
    - Sees anthropology as foundational for understanding **soteriology** and **eschatology**.
    - "A dichotomist view safeguards the integrity of biblical teaching on salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Engagement with Historical Theology**
    - Traces the dichotomist position through **Augustine**, the **Reformers**, and the **Westminster Standards**.
    - Critiques trichotomy as influenced by **Greek philosophy** rather than biblical revelation.
    - Affirms the confessional standards of the Reformed tradition on human constitution.
    - Encourages ongoing dialogue with historical sources while prioritizing Scripture.
    - "The Reformed confessions consistently uphold a dichotomist anthropology." (Anthropology, New Dictionary of Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has reinforced the Reformed tradition’s approach to **biblical anthropology** and shaped contemporary discussions on the nature of humanity. His exegetical rigor and redemptive-historical method have influenced generations of students and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By rooting anthropology in Scripture and the confessional heritage, Gaffin has provided a framework that resists speculative or dualistic errors, ensuring that the doctrine of humanity remains integrated with broader **systematic theology**.
