# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** with a critical and nuanced perspective, ultimately rejecting both as speculative and reductionistic. He emphasized the **unity of the human person** in Reformed anthropology, arguing that Scripture does not support a strict division of human nature into either two or three distinct substances, but rather presents a holistic view of humanity as created in the **image of God**.

- "The dichotomy-trichotomy discussion is not a matter of exegesis, but of a speculative construction imposed upon the biblical data." (Man: The Image of God)

## Key Works

- Man: The Image of God (Studies in Dogmatics)
- Sin (Studies in Dogmatics)
- General Revelation (Studies in Dogmatics)
- The Conflict with Rome
- Holy Scripture (Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Speculative Anthropology**
    - Critiques both **trichotomist** and **dichotomist** models as speculative.
    - Argues that these models are not grounded in **biblical exegesis**.
    - Sees the debate as shaped more by philosophical presuppositions than by Scripture.
    - Emphasizes the dangers of imposing foreign categories onto biblical anthropology.
    - "The dichotomy-trichotomy controversy is not a biblical but a speculative problem." (Man: The Image of God)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Stresses the **inseparable unity** of body and soul/spirit.
    - Views the human person as a holistic being, not a composite of separable parts.
    - Argues that biblical language about "soul" and "spirit" is often interchangeable.
    - Insists that the **image of God** is not located in a particular "part" of man.
    - "Scripture does not present man as a duality or a trinity of substances, but as a unity." (Man: The Image of God)

3. **Critical Engagement with Historical Theology**
    - Examines the influence of **Greek philosophy** on early Christian anthropology.
    - Notes that trichotomy gained traction through external philosophical influences.
    - Highlights the Reformation's return to a more biblical, unified view of man.
    - Engages critically with both **patristic** and **scholastic** sources.
    - "The trichotomist view owes more to Hellenistic thought than to the biblical witness." (Man: The Image of God)

4. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Prioritizes **biblical theology** over systematic speculation.
    - Advocates careful exegesis of key texts (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 4:12).
    - Warns against building doctrines on isolated proof texts.
    - Sees the **image of God** as a relational and functional concept, not a structural one.
    - "We must not allow isolated texts to determine our anthropology apart from the total biblical witness." (Man: The Image of God)

5. **Anthropology and Soteriology**
    - Connects anthropology closely with **soteriology** and the doctrine of **sin**.
    - Argues that the unity of the person is essential for understanding the fall and redemption.
    - Rejects any view that would fragment the human person in the work of salvation.
    - Emphasizes that Christ redeems the whole person, not just a part.
    - "Redemption concerns the whole man, not merely a part or aspect of his being." (Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** has shaped modern Reformed anthropology, steering it away from speculative divisions and toward a more biblically grounded **unity of the human person**. His insistence on careful exegesis and suspicion of philosophical imposition have influenced subsequent theological method. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a robust, scripturally faithful doctrine of humanity within the Reformed tradition.
