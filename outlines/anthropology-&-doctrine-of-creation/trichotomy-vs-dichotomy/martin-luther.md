# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** with a preference for the **dichotomous** view, understanding human nature as composed of **body** and **soul/spirit** rather than three distinct substances. While he occasionally used **trichotomous language** in exegesis, Luther consistently emphasized the unity of the **inner (spiritual) and outer (physical) man** within the context of **justification** and **sanctification**.

- "Scripture divides man into two parts, as does philosophy: the outward man and the inward man, or the body and the soul." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Romans
- Commentary on Genesis
- The Freedom of a Christian
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms
- Selected Sermons and Letters

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy of Body and Soul**
    - Luther generally taught that humans consist of two essential parts: **body** and **soul**.
    - He identified the **spirit** as the highest faculty of the soul, not a separate substance.
    - This dichotomy aligns with his emphasis on the **inner and outer man**.
    - He rejected speculative anthropology not grounded in **Scripture**.
    - "Man is composed of body and soul, and the soul itself has its own powers." (Commentary on Genesis)

2. **Occasional Use of Trichotomous Language**
    - Luther sometimes used **trichotomous terms** (body, soul, spirit) in biblical exposition.
    - He interpreted these distinctions functionally, not ontologically.
    - The **spirit** was seen as the seat of faith and relationship with God.
    - He did not develop a systematic trichotomous anthropology.
    - "The spirit is the noblest part of man, by which he is able to grasp things invisible." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Luther stressed the **inseparable unity** of human faculties.
    - He opposed dividing human nature into independent substances.
    - The **image of God** encompasses the whole person, not just the spirit.
    - Sin and grace affect the entire human being, not isolated parts.
    - "The whole man, both body and soul, is corrupted by sin and renewed by grace." (The Freedom of a Christian)

4. **Anthropology in Service of Soteriology**
    - Luther’s anthropology served his doctrine of **justification by faith**.
    - The **inner man** is renewed through the Word and Spirit, not by natural faculties.
    - The distinction between inner and outer man highlights the work of **Christ**.
    - He avoided speculative divisions that detract from the gospel.
    - "Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace, so sure and certain that a man would stake his life on it a thousand times." (Preface to Romans)

5. **Scriptural Authority over Philosophical Speculation**
    - Luther subordinated philosophical anthropology to **biblical revelation**.
    - He critiqued medieval and scholastic trichotomies as lacking scriptural warrant.
    - His exegesis prioritized **Pauline** and **Old Testament** usage of soul and spirit.
    - He insisted on clarity and simplicity in doctrinal matters.
    - "We must not go beyond what Scripture teaches about the nature of man." (Lectures on Romans)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s preference for a **dichotomous** understanding of human nature influenced later **Protestant anthropology**, especially within the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. His insistence on the unity of the person and the centrality of **justification** shaped subsequent debates on the nature of the soul and spirit. While not systematic in his anthropology, Luther’s scriptural focus and rejection of speculative trichotomy set a precedent for confessional theology. His approach remains a reference point in discussions of the **image of God** and the constitution of humanity.
