# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos addressed the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** within the broader context of **Reformed anthropology**, affirming the traditional **dichotomist** view that humans consist of **body and soul** rather than three distinct substances. He argued that **Scripture** does not support a strict separation of **spirit** and **soul** as independent entities, and that the **unity of the person** is best preserved by the dichotomist position. Vos’s approach is marked by careful exegesis and a commitment to the **organic unity** of biblical revelation.

- "The distinction between soul and spirit is not substantial, but rather functional or modal." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology")

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology"
- "Pauline Eschatology"
- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Self-Disclosure of Jesus"
- "The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as the Biblical View**
    - Argues that **Scripture** presents humans as composed of **body and soul**, not three parts.
    - Emphasizes the interchangeable use of "soul" and "spirit" in biblical texts.
    - Rejects the notion that "spirit" is a separate, higher faculty.
    - Maintains that **Reformed theology** consistently upholds dichotomy.
    - "The Reformed view is that man consists of two, not three, essential parts." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2")

2. **Functional Distinction, Not Substantial**
    - Recognizes that "soul" and "spirit" can refer to different aspects or functions.
    - Denies that these terms indicate separate substances within the human person.
    - Sees "spirit" as the soul in its relation to God, and "soul" as the principle of natural life.
    - Stresses the importance of **contextual interpretation** of biblical language.
    - "The distinction is not ontological, but functional." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2")

3. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Insists on the **organic unity** of human nature.
    - Warns against dividing the person into independent parts.
    - Affirms that both body and soul are essential to true humanity.
    - Connects anthropology to the broader unity of **redemptive history**.
    - "The unity of the person is a fundamental biblical teaching." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2")

4. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Criticizes trichotomy as influenced by **Greek philosophy** rather than biblical exegesis.
    - Notes the lack of consistent trichotomist teaching in the **history of the church**.
    - Points out exegetical weaknesses in trichotomist readings of key texts (e.g., 1 Thess 5:23).
    - Argues that trichotomy undermines the **doctrine of sin** and **salvation**.
    - "Trichotomy is not a doctrine of the Reformed churches, nor is it scriptural." ("Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2")

5. **Anthropology in Redemptive Context**
    - Frames the discussion within the **covenant** and **eschatological** purposes of God.
    - Relates the nature of man to the image of God and the work of Christ.
    - Emphasizes the restoration of the whole person in **redemption**.
    - Connects anthropology to the unfolding of **biblical theology**.
    - "Anthropology must be understood in the light of redemptive history." ("Biblical Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s defense of **dichotomy** has shaped much of twentieth-century **Reformed anthropology**, providing exegetical and theological clarity on the nature of the human person. His insistence on the **organic unity** of body and soul continues to influence contemporary discussions, particularly in relation to the doctrines of sin, salvation, and resurrection. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded and historically informed approach to the question of trichotomy versus dichotomy.
