# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** through his broader theological anthropology, emphasizing the unity of the human person as a **spirit-in-the-world**. He rejected a strict **trichotomist** division of **body, soul, and spirit**, instead advocating for a **dualist** (dichotomist) understanding that maintains the inseparable unity of **body and soul** within the context of human openness to **transcendence**.

- "Man is not a spirit who has fallen into a body, but rather a unity of spirit and matter." ("Theological Investigations," vol. 9)

## Key Works

- "Theological Investigations," especially vol. 9: "Writings on Anthropology"
- "Foundations of Christian Faith"
- "Spirit in the World"
- "Hearer of the Word"
- "Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi" (articles on anthropology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Anthropological Unity**
    - Human beings are fundamentally a unity, not a composite of separable parts.
    - Rejects the **trichotomist** scheme as incompatible with Christian revelation and philosophical anthropology.
    - Emphasizes the integration of **body and soul** as constitutive of personhood.
    - Sees the human as a "spirit-in-the-world," not a spirit trapped in matter.
    - "The human person is always already a unity of spiritual and material existence." ("Theological Investigations," vol. 9)

2. **Transcendental Openness**
    - Human nature is defined by openness to **God** and the infinite.
    - This openness is not a separate "spirit" but the orientation of the whole person.
    - The **soul** is the principle of this transcendence, not a distinct third substance.
    - All human faculties are oriented toward the supernatural existential.
    - "Man is the being who hears the word of God, not because he has a third part, but because of his total structure." ("Hearer of the Word")

3. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Trichotomy is seen as a product of Hellenistic, not biblical, thought.
    - The New Testament language of "body, soul, and spirit" is interpreted functionally, not ontologically.
    - Trichotomy risks dualism and undermines the unity of the person.
    - Rahner aligns with the **dichotomist** tradition of the Western Church.
    - "The trichotomist anthropology is foreign to the authentic Christian tradition." ("Encyclopedia of Theology")

4. **Eschatological Integrity**
    - The resurrection affirms the unity of the human person.
    - The hope of bodily resurrection presupposes the inseparability of **body and soul**.
    - Intermediate state is understood without positing a third, separable "spirit."
    - The person remains a unified subject even in death and resurrection.
    - "Christian hope is not for the survival of a part, but for the resurrection of the whole person." ("Foundations of Christian Faith")

5. **Philosophical Foundations**
    - Influenced by **Thomism** and **transcendental philosophy**.
    - Adopts a **hylomorphic** (matter-form) view of the human person.
    - The **soul** is the form of the body, not a detachable entity.
    - Human self-transcendence is grounded in existential unity, not tripartite division.
    - "The soul is not a thing alongside the body, but the principle that makes the body a living person." ("Spirit in the World")

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s anthropology decisively shaped modern **Roman Catholic theology**, reinforcing the **dichotomist** view and influencing ecumenical discussions on human nature. His rejection of trichotomy contributed to a renewed emphasis on the **unity of the person** in both theological and philosophical circles. Rahner’s work remains foundational for contemporary debates on **Christian anthropology**, especially regarding the relationship between nature, grace, and eschatological fulfillment.
