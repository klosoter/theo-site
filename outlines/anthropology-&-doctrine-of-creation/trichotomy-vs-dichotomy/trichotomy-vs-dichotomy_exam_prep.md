### TITLE
One human nature or three parts? Reasserting classical dichotomy against trichotomic partitioning

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: whether Scripture and sound theology teach an ontological **dichotomy** of human nature, body and soul, or a **trichotomy** of body, soul, and spirit, and how that decision integrates with **Christology**, **soteriology**, and the **intermediate state**.
- Decisive figures: Irenaeus, Apollinaris, Augustine, Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Herman Bavinck.
- Traditions: patristic Greek and conciliar theology, Augustinian and Reformed dogmatics, nineteenth to twentieth century evangelical debates, analytic and biblical theology on human constitution.
- Debates:
  - Internal: hylomorphic vs Cartesian **substance dualism**, traducianism vs creationism of the soul, Reformed handling of biblical terms and the **image of God**.
  - External: patristic and modern trichotomies, Keswick and dispensational sanctification schemas, contemporary Christian physicalism and monism.
  - Contemporary: neuroscientific pressure on dualism, deliverance and spiritual-formation models that presuppose trichotomy, semantic analysis of psychē and pneuma.
- Position: defend classical **dichotomy** within **hylomorphic dualism**, treating spirit and soul as nonseparable aspects or uses of the one immaterial soul, rejecting ontological trichotomy on exegetical, dogmatic, and pastoral grounds.

### ESSAY
The question of trichotomy versus dichotomy is not a minor lexical preference but a determinant of how one reads Scripture’s anthropology, coordinates **Christology** and **soteriology**, and avoids conceptual drift toward either disembodied spiritualism or reductive monism. By trichotomy I mean the claim that the human being consists of three distinct ontological components, body, soul, and spirit, where soul and spirit are different immaterial substances or at least separable parts with distinct essences and destinies. By dichotomy I mean the claim that human beings consist of two ontological components, a material body and an immaterial soul, with biblical terms like spirit, heart, and mind indicating functions, orientations, or aspects of the one immaterial principle of life. I will defend dichotomy within a broadly **hylomorphic dualism**, that is, the body and soul compose one substantial unity with the soul as the organizing form and the body as the material principle, while rejecting an ontological split between soul and spirit. This position honors biblical semantics, safeguards conciliar **Christology**, preserves the **intermediate state** and resurrection hope, and avoids sanctification schemas that partition believers into layered spiritual statuses.

The history of this dispute bears both promise and peril. Irenaeus, writing against Gnostics in the late second century, is a decisive early witness because he pioneered the body, soul, spirit triad while refusing Gnostic elitism. In Against Heresies he can speak of the human being as composed of body, soul, and spirit, where the spirit is the gift of God that animates and elevates the soul toward God. The crucial nuance in Irenaeus is that he resists reifying the spirit as a separable third substance. For him, spirit denotes the divine donation that restores the soul, thus it is not an intrinsic created part that naturally belongs to man irrespective of grace. His usage is soteriological and teleological, not a metaphysical anatomy. This was a polemical strategy to confound Gnostic claims that only pneumatic souls ascend, by asserting that the Spirit of God vivifies embodied human creatures destined for resurrection. Irenaeus therefore shows how trichotomic language can function biblically when governed by the economy of grace, yet he also demonstrates why making spirit a third ontological component is unnecessary. Any appeal to him must acknowledge that his spirit is more gift than part, tethering anthropology to **pneumatology**.

Apollinaris of Laodicea illustrates the danger of elevating such language into ontology. He argued that the eternal Logos took the place of a human rational spirit in the incarnation, producing a Christ with a human body and soul but no human spirit. The appeal of this scheme was the unity of Christ’s person and the assurance of sinlessness, but its cost was devastating. If the Logos replaces a human rational spirit, Christ lacks a full human mind, and what is not assumed is not healed. The second council of Constantinople condemned Apollinarianism because it fatally compromised **Christology** and soteriology. For our topic the lesson is acute. Once soul and spirit are posited as distinct essential parts, the temptation to assign different theological functions to each part multiplies, creating conceptual pressure toward Christological error and a pattern of soteriology that seems neat but misreads Scripture’s usage. Apollinaris remains a negative decisive figure whose trichotomic presupposition became a lever for heresy, a warning that anthropological partitioning is not an innocent classification.

Augustine stands as the great Western corrective. Writing after the councils had secured Nicene **Trinitarian** and two-natures precision, he treated anthropological language with exegetical sobriety and metaphysical restraint. In De Trinitate and City of God he surveys the biblical terms and the philosophical options of his day and concludes that soul and spirit are not two substances but often two names for the one immaterial soul. Sometimes spirit names the soul’s highest powers, or its Godward orientation, or the inner person, while soul can name life more broadly or even the person as a whole. He is adamant that terms flex according to context, citing places where soul and spirit function in parallel or interchangeable fashion, as in Mary’s Magnificat where soul magnifies and spirit rejoices. Augustine adopts a **hylomorphic** framework inherited from Aristotle but baptized into Christian doctrine, treating soul as the form of the body, the principle of life and intellect, which survives death by divine conservation in the **intermediate state** and is destined for reembodiment at the resurrection. This gives him conceptual resources to affirm both psychosomatic unity and the survival of the person. Against trichotomy, Augustine argues that the unity and simplicity of the human soul, though creaturely and finite, is analogically akin to the simplicity of God’s being, hence the soul cannot be partitioned into substances without contradiction. He does not equate the two, preserving **analogical knowledge**, but he anticipates the later scholastic refusal to treat faculties as parts. An examiner will press whether Augustine collapses the spirit into a mere faculty and whether that loses the Pauline emphasis on Spirit-given life. The answer is that Augustine’s semantic mapping is paired with robust **pneumatology** and **regeneration**. He insists that the Holy Spirit indwells and renews the human spirit, where human spirit names the inner man renewed in Christ. That grammar preserves both the unity of the soul and the distinct agency of the Holy Spirit. It also inoculates against any Apollinarian shortcut by securing a full assumption of our rational soul by the Son.

John Calvin tightens the lexical case and binds the doctrine to Reformed soteriology. In Institutes he contends that Scripture uses soul and spirit interchangeably for the immaterial aspect of humans, and that any attempt to make them two substances is unwarranted. He notes how Scripture sometimes speaks of spirit to elevate moral seriousness or to speak of the life that comes from God, but then also speaks of soul for life after death and the person’s inner deliberations. Calvin’s anthropology is resolutely anti-speculative and anchored in redemptive history. To examiners who will ask about 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12, Calvin’s posture is instructive. He treats both as rhetorical and functional, not as metaphysical schematics. The prayer for sanctification of spirit and soul and body is a merism, a stylized totality, just as Jesus speaks of loving God with heart, soul, mind, and strength. Hebrews 4:12’s division of soul and spirit is a metaphor for the penetrating judgment of the Word, not an ontological dissection akin to the separation of joints and marrow. Calvin also integrates anthropology with **total depravity**. Sin affects the whole soul, and Scripture speaks of the defilement of flesh and spirit to indicate the comprehensive corruption of the person. If spirit were a distinct unfallen part, the Reformed account of sin and grace would fragment and the logic of **union with Christ** would be imperiled. Calvin thereby cements dichotomy as a doctrinal hinge between **anthropology**, **hamartiology**, and **soteriology**.

B. B. Warfield, writing at Princeton in the late nineteenth century, is the decisive modern exegete and polemicist on this subject. In his essay Trichotomy, he reconstructs the historical origins of Christian trichotomy, shows its roots in Greek philosophical psychology more than in Scripture, and surveys the biblical terms with philological rigor. He demonstrates that nephesh and ruach in the Old Testament and psychē and pneuma in the New Testament overlap extensively. Soul and spirit can both name the life principle, the seat of desires, and the inner person, and both can be said to depart at death. He pays special attention to parallelism in Hebrew poetry, where soul and spirit alternate as semantically equivalent, as in Mary’s song, which is in the idiom of the Psalter. Warfield’s reading of 1 Thessalonians 5:23 situates the Pauline triad among other totalizing triads and tetrads, arguing that Paul intends a comprehensive sanctification of the whole person, not a metaphysical list. On Hebrews 4:12 he argues that the division enacted by the Word is not the isolation of distinct substances but the exposure of what is otherwise inseparable, an image of complete scrutiny. Warfield connects the doctrine to the Apollinarian temptation and to contemporary evangelical sanctification schemas. He targets Keswick and dispensational tendencies to posit a higher plane of pneumatic life separated from the psychical life, a move that fosters a two-tiered Christianity and weakens the doctrine of progressive **sanctification** through means. Warfield is equally alert to the pastoral disorders that arise when believers are taught that their spirit is holy while their soul remains corrupt, a conceptual arrangement that confuses conscience, minimizes sin, and complicates repentance. To the examiner who asks whether Warfield overstates Hellenistic influence and underplays Irenaeus’s pastoral trichotomy, the reply is that Warfield’s point is not that every patristic use is corrupt, but that the ontological hardening of those terms into three substances is alien to the canon’s usage and invites doctrinal injury.

Herman Bavinck consolidates this Reformed consensus with metaphysical breadth. In Reformed Dogmatics he anchors human constitution in **hylomorphic dualism**, arguing that the soul is the substantial form of the body, a single spiritual substance endowed with multiple faculties. He criticizes both trichotomy’s partitioning and Cartesian dualism’s tendency toward an accidental union, preferring an account where the soul informs the body as its own. Spirit language names the soul’s highest power and its Godward capacity and is the seat of conscience and worship, but there is no third substance. Bavinck links this to the **image of God** by stressing that the image is not restricted to a spiritual part but encompasses the whole human in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. He thereby stymies both reductionist monism and elitist trichotomy. He also attends to the **intermediate state**, affirming that the soul survives death, is conscious in Christ, and longs for the resurrection of the body, a hope incoherent if spirit is a separable third entity with a distinct destiny. Bavinck’s posture against trichotomy is also eschatological and ecclesial, preventing the fragmentation of the Christian life into spiritual strata and ensuring that means of grace address the whole person.

The internal debates within the main tradition revolve around the mode of dualism, the origin of the soul, and the semantics of biblical terms. Reformed theologians have often differed on **hylomorphic dualism** versus more Cartesian **substance dualism**. The former emphasizes the deep unity of psychosomatic life, the latter the distinctness of substances. Either framework can affirm dichotomy though the hylomorphic account better explains embodiment and the goodness of matter without denying the soul’s subsistence between death and resurrection. On the soul’s origin, traducianism and creationism matter because they bear on **original sin** and **federal theology**. Creationists say God creates each soul and unites it to the body, traducianists say the soul is propagated through parental generation. A trichotomist might place sin in the soul while immunizing the spirit, but Reformed anthropology resists that partition, locating guilt and corruption in Adamic **federal headship** transmitted to the whole person. These internal debates sharpen but do not unsettle dichotomy.

External debates press from two sides. On one side stands a family of trichotomic schemes that derive from pietist, holiness, or dispensational contexts. Watchman Nee’s popular synthesis distinguishes soul as the seat of mind and emotion from spirit as the realm of God-consciousness, using 1 Corinthians 2 to claim that the psychical man cannot receive spiritual things while the spiritual man can. The result is a soteriology where regeneration implants a new spirit distinct from the old soul, yielding vernacular talk of carnal and spiritual Christians. Warfield’s criticism applies here. Paul’s psychikos and pneumatikos are not ontological labels for inner parts, but moral and eschatological descriptions of persons as animated by the flesh or by the Holy Spirit. A spiritual body in 1 Corinthians 15 is a body glorified and fully governed by the Holy Spirit, not a body made of spirit. A similar correction applies to deliverance ministries that isolate generational curses in the soul while claiming a pristine spirit. Scripture’s confession that both flesh and spirit can be defiled means the whole person is the theater of sanctification, and the indwelling Spirit renews the whole inner man, not a segregated compartment. On the other side stands modern Christian physicalism, which denies any immaterial substance. It derives support from neuroscientific correlations between brain states and mental states and seeks to align Christian hope with resurrection alone. The best Reformed response, consonant with dichotomy, is that while brain dependency is real, correlation is not identity, and the **intermediate state** taught by Scripture requires the persistence of personal identity in the absence of the body. Jesus’ words about killing the body but not the soul, the promise to the thief, and the souls under the altar teach an ongoing conscious life. **Hylomorphic dualism** can honor embodiment and the centrality of resurrection without collapsing into materialism. It also avoids the reduction of mental causation to physical processes and preserves the reality of rational deliberation and moral responsibility.

The contemporary debates often begin at the textual level. Examiners will press 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Hebrews 4:12, and 1 Corinthians 2 and 15. On the first, the pattern of Scripture shows that triads and tetrads like heart, soul, mind, and strength or mind and conscience or spirit and flesh all function as totalizing idioms. The point is that God sanctifies the whole person in every respect. On the second, the Word’s division of soul and spirit is a hyperbolic image of utter penetrability. The comparison to joints and marrow shows that the author is not giving a taxonomy of parts but picturing the invasive power of divine judgment. On the third, the psychical and spiritual adjectives describe persons under opposing dominions, either the old age of Adam or the new age of the Spirit. They do not establish an inner stratification. Luke 1:46 to 47 is crucial because it shows soul and spirit as poetic parallels. Mary’s soul magnifies and her spirit rejoices. Any ontology that demands two inner substances here does violence to Hebrew parallelism. Genesis 2:7 also accelerates the dichotomy case. Man becomes a living soul when God breathes the breath of life into dust. The language underwrites the unity of whole-person life without an inner repartition. Death dissolves the body to dust and returns the spirit to God, but other texts speak of the soul departing. The two terms alternate because they name the one immaterial aspect under different lights. This is not verbal gamesmanship. It is the canon’s own conceptual economy.

Dichotomy also stitches together adjacent loci. In **Christology**, it guarantees that the Son assumed a full human nature, including a rational soul, without carving that soul into two substances. It therefore insulates against Apollinarian shortcuts and secures the Athanasian claim that Christ is perfect God and perfect man. In **soteriology**, it harmonizes **regeneration** and **sanctification** with personal unity. The Spirit does not regenerate a separate spirit while leaving the soul untouched. He renews the heart, enlightens the mind, and reorders the will, all faculties of the one soul. The promise of the **intermediate state** is that to be away from the body is to be with Christ, not that a spirit leaves behind a soul. In **ecclesiology** and the means of grace, preaching and sacrament address the whole person, not just a spiritual compartment. In **ethics**, dichotomy supports a robust account of **conscience** and moral agency rooted in the soul’s rational powers, without divorcing affections from reason or either from embodied practices. This doctrinal coherence reflects the unity of divine action in **concursus**, the Spirit using bodily means to sanctify the soul and through the soul to discipline the body.

Several objections deserve direct reply. First, does dichotomy risk a reductive rationalism that ignores the Bible’s rich inner vocabulary. Only if mishandled. Dichotomy is not a denial of the heart, mind, conscience, spirit, and inner man. It is the claim that these name diverse acts and orientations of the same immaterial subject. Second, does trichotomy better protect the distinct work of the Holy Spirit. No, because the Spirit is Lord and giver of life who indwells persons, not an inner room. His distinct agency is secured by **Trinitarian** dogma, not by carving the human soul. Third, does dichotomy deny the embodied character of human life and foster a dispensable body. Not when framed as **hylomorphic dualism**. On that account the body is essential to human completeness, the soul is naturally oriented to its body, and the hope is bodily resurrection. Dualism does not negate embodiment but explains why bodily practices matter. Fourth, how does dichotomy interpret passages where spirit seems to act without mind, as in speaking in tongues where the mind is unfruitful. Paul is distinguishing modes of operation within the one soul. The same agent can act with diminished rational fruit and yet be genuinely engaged in prayer. Fifth, can dichotomy account for the etiology of mental illness that maps onto brain dysfunction. Yes, because soul and body operate in a powerful unity. Bodily conditions affect the operations of the soul without destroying its subsistence, just as rational deliberation can impact bodily states. The dual traffic does not require multiple immaterial substances; it requires a well-ordered account of psychosomatic interaction.

The pastoral advantages of dichotomy are likewise significant. It sustains a holistic view of **sanctification** that rebukes both antinomian comfort and perfectionist claims. It coheres with **federal theology**, locating guilt and corruption in Adamic solidarity, not in an isolated soul part. It resists the pathologizing of ordinary sin as a soul-tier problem while also acknowledging that oppression and affliction can be complex and require attention to body and soul. It offers clarity in counseling by treating conscience, memory, and affection as faculties of one soul that can be reformed by Word and Spirit. It renders deliverance talk sane by recalling that sin and Satan seek dominion over the whole person and that the Spirit resists them by renewing the whole inner man.

We can now state the positive account in summary. Scripture teaches that human beings are a unity of body and soul. The soul is the immaterial life principle and seat of rationality, affection, and volition. Spirit is often another name for this soul when considered in its relation to God, its highest powers, or under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes spirit names breath or life. The two terms overlap extensively and interchange without indicating two substances. Death is the temporary rupture of body and soul, not the peeling away of spirit from soul. The gospel promises the redemption of the whole person, and the Spirit sanctifies in every part. The church must reject ontological trichotomy because it misreads Scripture, endangers **Christology**, fractures **soteriology**, distorts **sanctification**, and confuses pastoral practice. The dichotomy defended here receives support from Irenaeus when his spirit is understood as a gift rather than a part, it learns from Apollinaris what to avoid, it is articulated with depth by Augustine and Calvin, it is defended exegetically and polemically by Warfield, and it is synthesized metaphysically by Bavinck. It keeps biblical language supple, doctrinal loci coherent, and pastoral ministry sane.

If examiners press whether the Bible ever speaks as if there were three parts, the answer is that Scripture can list multiple inner terms to emphasize totality, and that where soul and spirit are juxtaposed, the context reveals functional or rhetorical, not ontological, distinctions. If they ask whether dichotomy binds us to a Greek metaphysic, the answer is that the metaphysic is chastened by revelation. **Hylomorphic dualism** is a conceptual tool enabling us to confess truths plainly taught in Scripture, namely the reality of the soul and its survival, the unity of the person, and the goodness of the body. And if they press whether dichotomy risks minimizing the Holy Spirit’s indwelling presence, the answer is that the Spirit dwells in persons, makes their bodies temples, renews their hearts, and will raise their mortal bodies. He needs no extra compartment to sanctify. He is Lord.

- Defended position: classical **dichotomy** within **hylomorphic dualism**, rejecting ontological trichotomy while retaining rich functional vocabulary for the soul’s powers and Godward orientation.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - What about 1 Thessalonians 5:23 listing spirit, soul, and body? Merism for total sanctification, not metaphysical taxonomy.
  - Does Hebrews 4:12 divide substances? No, it pictures exhaustive discernment, like joints and marrow.
  - How avoid Cartesian disembodiment? Adopt **hylomorphic dualism** affirming psychosomatic unity and resurrection.
  - Does dichotomy minimize the Holy Spirit? No, the Spirit indwells persons and renews the whole inner man, not a separate compartment.
  - How does this safeguard Christology? It blocks Apollinarianism by insisting Christ assumed a full rational soul without inner partition.
