# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** through the lens of **biblical anthropology** and **covenant theology**, emphasizing the unity and integrity of the human person as created in the image of God. He rejected the traditional trichotomist division of **body, soul, and spirit** in favor of a **dichotomous** view, arguing that Scripture presents humans as a unified whole comprised of **material** and **immaterial** aspects.

- "Scripture does not teach a trichotomous anthropology but rather a dichotomous constitution of man as body and spirit." (Kingdom Prologue)

- By Oath Consigned
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomous Constitution of Humanity**
    - Humanity is fundamentally composed of two elements: **body** (material) and **spirit/soul** (immaterial).
    - The terms "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in Scripture, not as distinct substances.
    - Trichotomy is seen as an exegetical error influenced by Greek philosophical categories rather than biblical revelation.
    - The **image of God** is expressed in the unity of the person, not in a tripartite division.
    - "The biblical data do not support a threefold division of human nature." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenantal Anthropology**
    - Human nature must be understood within the framework of **covenant relationship** with God.
    - The whole person, both material and immaterial, is addressed in covenantal terms.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** both presuppose a unified human subject.
    - Kline emphasizes the forensic and relational aspects of anthropology over speculative metaphysics.
    - "Man as covenant servant is a unified being, not a composite of separable parts." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Rejection of Greek Dualism**
    - Kline critiques the influence of **Platonic** and **Hellenistic** thought on Christian anthropology.
    - He argues that biblical categories are holistic, not dualistic or tripartite.
    - The dichotomy of body and spirit is not a denigration of the body but affirms its goodness in creation.
    - The resurrection hope is grounded in the restoration of the whole person, not just the soul or spirit.
    - "Biblical anthropology resists the intrusion of Greek dualism and its trichotomist offspring." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Eschatological Unity of the Person**
    - The ultimate destiny of humanity is the resurrection of the whole person, body and spirit.
    - Intermediate state distinctions do not imply a permanent separation of human components.
    - The **new creation** affirms the integrity and unity of redeemed humanity.
    - Kline’s eschatology underscores the restoration of the full image of God in Christ.
    - "The resurrection consummates the unity of man as God intended from the beginning." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Exegetical Priority in Anthropology**
    - Kline insists that anthropological categories must arise from careful exegesis, not philosophical speculation.
    - He highlights key biblical texts (e.g., Genesis 2:7; 1 Corinthians 15) as foundational for understanding human nature.
    - The dichotomous view is rooted in the language and logic of Scripture itself.
    - Theological formulations must be subordinate to the authority of **biblical revelation**.
    - "Our doctrine of man must be shaped by the text, not by tradition or philosophy." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust defense of a **dichotomous anthropology** has influenced Reformed discussions on human nature, particularly in the context of **covenant theology** and biblical exegesis. His rejection of trichotomy in favor of a unified, covenantal understanding of the person has shaped generations of students and scholars at Westminster and beyond. Kline’s work continues to serve as a corrective to speculative anthropologies, grounding theological anthropology in the redemptive-historical framework of Scripture.
