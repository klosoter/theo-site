# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** affirm a **dichotomous** view of human nature, teaching that man consists of two essential components: **body and soul** (or spirit). While acknowledging the use of "spirit" and "soul" in Scripture, the Standards do not distinguish them as separate substances, but rather as interchangeable terms for the immaterial aspect of humanity. This position is rooted in a commitment to **biblical anthropology** and the unity of the human person.

- "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls... being immortal, do neither die nor sleep." (Westminster Confession of Faith 32.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 4, 6, 32)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 17, 86)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 22, 37)
- A.A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine
- Robert Letham, The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Human Nature as Body and Soul**
    - Humanity is created with two essential parts: a material **body** and an immaterial **soul**.
    - The **soul** is the seat of rationality, morality, and spiritual life.
    - The terms "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in the Standards.
    - There is no affirmation of a third, distinct "spirit" as a separate substance.
    - "God created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls..." (WCF 4.2)

2. **Unity of the Person**
    - The human person is a unified being, not a composite of separable parts.
    - The **body and soul** are distinct but integrally related.
    - Death is described as the unnatural separation of body and soul.
    - The resurrection reunites body and soul, restoring the whole person.
    - "At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever." (WCF 32.2)

3. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
    - The Standards do not teach a three-part division (body, soul, spirit).
    - Scriptural references to "spirit" and "soul" are understood as referring to the same immaterial aspect.
    - Trichotomy is viewed as lacking clear biblical support and unnecessary for Christian anthropology.
    - The dichotomous view safeguards the unity and simplicity of the human person.
    - "The soul or spirit of man doth not die with the body, but is immortal..." (WLC Q.86)

4. **Immortality of the Soul**
    - The **soul** is created immortal and does not perish with the body.
    - Upon death, the soul continues in conscious existence, either in blessedness or misery.
    - The immortality of the soul undergirds doctrines of judgment and resurrection.
    - The soul’s destiny is determined by its relation to God in Christ.
    - "The souls of the righteous... are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory..." (WLC Q.86)

5. **Anthropology Rooted in Scripture**
    - The dichotomous view is derived from a careful reading of biblical texts.
    - The Standards cite Genesis 2:7, Ecclesiastes 12:7, and Matthew 10:28 as foundational.
    - Theological anthropology is developed in service to doctrines of sin, salvation, and resurrection.
    - The language of the Standards reflects the Reformed commitment to **sola Scriptura**.
    - "The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption; but their souls... being immortal, do neither die nor sleep..." (WCF 32.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have shaped the doctrine of **anthropology** in Reformed and Presbyterian traditions, establishing the dichotomous view as normative. Their careful biblical reasoning has influenced subsequent confessions and catechisms, providing a framework for understanding human nature, sin, and redemption. The Standards’ rejection of trichotomy has contributed to the clarity and unity of Reformed teaching on the constitution of man. Their enduring authority continues to guide theological reflection and pastoral practice on questions of body, soul, and the hope of resurrection.
