# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in 20th-century **Reformed theology**, firmly upheld the **dichotomous** view of human nature, teaching that Scripture presents man as composed of **body and soul** rather than three distinct parts. He critiqued **trichotomy** as lacking biblical warrant and emphasized the unity and integrity of the human person, aligning with classic **Reformed anthropology**.

- "Scripture does not warrant the trichotomous construction of man’s nature." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology"
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "Principles of Conduct"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Murray argued that Scripture consistently presents man as comprised of **body and soul/spirit**.
    - He maintained that the terms "soul" and "spirit" are often used interchangeably in the Bible.
    - He rejected the notion that humans possess three distinct substances.
    - He saw dichotomy as essential to a proper understanding of **human nature**.
    - "There is no evidence that the New Testament writers intended to distinguish between soul and spirit as two separate substances." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Murray critiqued trichotomy as an import from **Greek philosophy** rather than biblical exegesis.
    - He warned that trichotomy can lead to theological errors, such as undermining the unity of the person.
    - He argued that trichotomy is not supported by the **Reformed confessions**.
    - He emphasized the sufficiency of the dichotomous view for Christian doctrine.
    - "The trichotomous view is not only without biblical support but is fraught with serious consequences for the doctrine of man." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Murray stressed the inseparable unity of body and soul in the constitution of man.
    - He taught that the **image of God** pertains to the whole person, not merely to one aspect.
    - He opposed any dualism that would fragment human identity.
    - He saw the resurrection as affirming the value of both body and soul.
    - "The unity of man is a unity of body and soul, not a composite of three substances." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Terminological Precision**
    - Murray insisted on careful use of biblical terms like "soul" and "spirit."
    - He argued that distinctions between these terms are often contextual, not ontological.
    - He cautioned against speculative anthropology not grounded in Scripture.
    - He encouraged exegesis that respects the literary and theological context.
    - "The distinction between soul and spirit in Scripture is functional, not substantial." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Reformed Confessional Alignment**
    - Murray aligned his anthropology with the **Westminster Standards**.
    - He emphasized that the Reformed tradition has historically taught dichotomy.
    - He saw confessional fidelity as a safeguard against anthropological error.
    - He viewed the dichotomous view as integral to **Reformed soteriology** and **eschatology**.
    - "The Westminster Confession of Faith clearly presupposes the dichotomous view of man." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, reinforcing the unity and integrity of the human person. His careful exegesis and confessional alignment have provided a standard for evaluating anthropological models within Reformed circles. Murray’s influence persists in theological education, especially where fidelity to the **Westminster Standards** and biblical anthropology are prioritized.
