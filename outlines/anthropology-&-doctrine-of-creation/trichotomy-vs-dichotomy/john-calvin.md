# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin firmly rejected the **trichotomous** view of human nature, instead advocating for a **dichotomous** anthropology in which humans are composed of only **body** and **soul** (or **spirit**, used interchangeably). For Calvin, the distinction between **soul** and **spirit** in Scripture is functional or rhetorical, not ontological, and he consistently argued that dividing human nature into three distinct substances undermines the unity of the person.

- "Man consists of a body and a soul; and the soul, though properly speaking it is not a spirit, is yet so called, because it is a breath or inspiration of God." (Institutes 1.15.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 1, chapters 15–16)
- Commentary on 1 Thessalonians 5:23
- Commentary on Genesis 2:7
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition)
- Calvin’s Doctrine of Man by Charles Partee

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy of Body and Soul**
    - Calvin teaches that humans are composed of two essential parts: **body** and **soul**.
    - He denies that **spirit** is a third, separate substance; rather, it is another term for the soul.
    - The unity of the person is maintained by not multiplying substances.
    - Scriptural references to "spirit" and "soul" are interpreted as emphasizing different functions, not different entities.
    - "But that the soul and spirit are one and the same is easy to prove." (Institutes 1.15.6)

2. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
    - Calvin explicitly opposes the trichotomous division of **body**, **soul**, and **spirit**.
    - He views trichotomy as a speculative error without biblical warrant.
    - Trichotomy is seen as a threat to the simplicity and unity of human nature.
    - He critiques both ancient and contemporary proponents of trichotomy.
    - "Those who make out the soul to be a spirit, and the spirit to be something else, are led into error by a false interpretation." (Institutes 1.15.6)

3. **Scriptural Interpretation of Soul and Spirit**
    - Calvin insists that **soul** and **spirit** are used interchangeably in Scripture.
    - He interprets passages like 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12 as rhetorical, not ontological.
    - The distinction is functional (e.g., higher and lower faculties), not substantial.
    - He appeals to the broader biblical usage to support his dichotomous view.
    - "Paul, intending to express the whole, names soul and spirit, which are not two substances, but denote the same thing." (Commentary on 1 Thessalonians 5:23)

4. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Calvin emphasizes the inseparable unity of **body** and **soul**.
    - He warns against philosophical speculation that divides the person into unrelated parts.
    - The image of God is located in the whole person, especially the soul.
    - The resurrection affirms the value and unity of both body and soul.
    - "The soul is not man, nor is the body, but man consists of both." (Institutes 1.15.2)

5. **Dependence on Divine Creation**
    - Both **body** and **soul** are created by God, with the soul being an immediate creation.
    - The soul is not derived from the parents but is infused by God.
    - The dignity of the soul is rooted in its divine origin and immortality.
    - Human faculties (reason, will, affections) are functions of the soul, not separate substances.
    - "The soul is an incorporeal substance, the essence of which is immortal, created by God for the purpose of inhabiting bodies." (Institutes 1.15.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust defense of **dichotomy** became normative in the **Reformed tradition**, shaping confessional standards and later Protestant anthropology. His careful exegesis and polemics against trichotomy influenced generations of theologians, ensuring that the unity of the human person remained a hallmark of Reformed thought. Calvin’s approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of humanity, especially in debates over the interpretation of biblical anthropology.
