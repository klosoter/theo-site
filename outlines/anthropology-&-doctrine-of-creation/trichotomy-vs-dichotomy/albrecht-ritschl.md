# Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889)

Albrecht Ritschl rejected speculative anthropology, including both **trichotomy** and **dichotomy**, in favor of a practical, ethical understanding of human nature. He emphasized the unity of the person as a moral agent, subordinating metaphysical distinctions to the **Kingdom of God** and the **ethical vocation** of humanity. For Ritschl, theological anthropology must serve the **religious and ethical aims** of Christian faith rather than abstract philosophical categories.

- "The distinction of soul and spirit, as well as the tripartite division of man, are not essential for the religious view of man." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Key Works

- Justification and Reconciliation (Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung)
- The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (English translation)
- The Christian Doctrine of Faith
- Theology and Metaphysics (secondary: Wilhelm Herrmann, Ritschlianism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Speculative Anthropology**
    - Denies the necessity of **trichotomy** (body, soul, spirit) and **dichotomy** (body and soul) for Christian theology.
    - Argues that such distinctions arise from Greek philosophy, not biblical revelation.
    - Maintains that metaphysical categories distract from the ethical purpose of theology.
    - Asserts that the unity of the person is more important than speculative divisions.
    "The religious interest is not served by metaphysical distinctions within human nature." (Justification and Reconciliation)

2. **Primacy of Ethical Personality**
    - Human identity is defined by moral agency and responsibility before God.
    - Theological anthropology must focus on the person’s vocation in the **Kingdom of God**.
    - The unity of the self is grounded in ethical action, not ontological composition.
    - The image of God is realized in ethical community, not in metaphysical structure.
    "Man is to be understood as a moral personality, not as a composite of substances." (Justification and Reconciliation)

3. **Scripture as Practical, Not Metaphysical**
    - Biblical language about human nature is interpreted functionally, not ontologically.
    - Terms like "soul" and "spirit" are seen as expressions of religious experience.
    - Rejects literal readings of anthropological terms that lead to speculative doctrine.
    - Emphasizes the practical intent of Scripture for faith and life.
    "Scripture does not teach a metaphysical anthropology, but addresses man as a whole in relation to God." (Justification and Reconciliation)

4. **Opposition to Dualism**
    - Critiques the influence of **Greek dualism** on Christian anthropology.
    - Sees dualistic frameworks as alien to the biblical worldview.
    - Argues that dualism undermines the unity and ethical responsibility of the person.
    - Calls for a theology that resists dividing human nature into separate substances.
    "Christian faith knows nothing of a dualism between body and soul as separate entities." (Justification and Reconciliation)

5. **Theological Method: Historical and Critical**
    - Insists that doctrines must be grounded in the historical revelation of **Christ**.
    - Rejects speculative systems not rooted in the practical needs of faith.
    - Employs historical-critical methods to clarify the development of anthropological doctrines.
    - Seeks to align anthropology with the centrality of **reconciliation** and **justification**.
    "Theology must be guided by the historical revelation of God in Christ, not by metaphysical speculation." (Justification and Reconciliation)

## Legacy and Impact

Ritschl’s rejection of **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** shaped modern Protestant theology’s move away from speculative anthropology toward a focus on ethical personality and the unity of the self. His influence is evident in the development of **liberal theology** and the emphasis on the practical, communal, and ethical dimensions of Christian doctrine. While later theologians critiqued his dismissal of metaphysics, Ritschl’s approach remains a key reference point in debates over the nature of humanity in relation to God.
