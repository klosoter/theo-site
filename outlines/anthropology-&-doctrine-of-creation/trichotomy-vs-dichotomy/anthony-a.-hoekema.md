# Anthony A. Hoekema (1913–1988)

Anthony A. Hoekema firmly advocates for **dichotomy**—the view that humans consist of a **body** and a **soul/spirit**—rejecting the **trichotomist** position that divides human nature into body, soul, and spirit. He grounds his stance in **biblical anthropology**, emphasizing the unity of the human person and the interchangeability of "soul" and "spirit" in Scripture.

- "The terms ‘soul’ and ‘spirit’ are often used interchangeably in the Bible to refer to the same aspect of man’s nature." ("Created in God's Image")

## Key Works

- Created in God's Image (1986)
- The Bible and the Future (1979)
- "The Image of God in Man" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1970)
- Saved by Grace (1989)
- Five Views on Sanctification (contributor, 1987)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Argues that Scripture presents humans as composed of two essential parts: **body** and **soul/spirit**.
    - Notes that "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Rejects the trichotomist reading of passages like 1 Thessalonians 5:23 as non-normative.
    - Emphasizes the **unity of the person** rather than a tripartite division.
    - "The Bible does not teach that man is composed of three distinct substances, but rather of two." (Created in God's Image)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Stresses the holistic nature of human beings, opposing any dualistic or tripartite fragmentation.
    - Asserts that **body** and **soul/spirit** are inseparably linked in biblical thought.
    - Warns against Greek philosophical influences that led to trichotomy in church history.
    - Maintains that redemption involves the whole person, not just one "part."
    - "The scriptural view is that man is a unity, not a composite of separable parts." (Created in God's Image)

3. **Interchangeability of "Soul" and "Spirit"**
    - Demonstrates that biblical writers use "soul" and "spirit" synonymously.
    - Cites examples where the same event or function is attributed to both terms.
    - Argues that distinctions between "soul" and "spirit" are exegetically unwarranted.
    - Points out that Hebrew and Greek terms do not support a tripartite anthropology.
    - "There is no evidence that the Bible distinguishes sharply between soul and spirit." (Created in God's Image)

4. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Identifies trichotomy as a later development influenced by **Greek philosophy**.
    - Notes that early church fathers and later theologians often adopted trichotomy uncritically.
    - Argues that trichotomy undermines the biblical doctrine of the **image of God**.
    - Warns that trichotomy can lead to theological errors, such as a diminished view of sin’s effects.
    - "Trichotomy is not a biblical teaching but a product of speculative philosophy." (Created in God's Image)

5. **Anthropology and Soteriology**
    - Connects the doctrine of **dichotomy** to the doctrines of **sin** and **salvation**.
    - Asserts that both body and soul/spirit are affected by the Fall and are redeemed in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the resurrection of the body as essential to Christian hope.
    - Maintains that sanctification involves the whole person, not just the "spirit."
    - "Salvation is for the whole man—body and soul—not just for a part of man." (Created in God's Image)

## Legacy and Impact

Hoekema’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped contemporary Reformed anthropology, providing a clear biblical alternative to trichotomist views. His work is frequently cited in discussions of the **image of God** and the nature of human beings, especially in evangelical and Reformed circles. By grounding his arguments in Scripture and critiquing philosophical influences, Hoekema has contributed to a renewed emphasis on the unity and wholeness of the human person in systematic theology.
