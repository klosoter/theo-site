# Millard J. Erickson (1932– )

Millard J. Erickson approaches the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** by affirming the traditional **dichotomist** position, which holds that humans are composed of a **material body** and an **immaterial soul/spirit**. He critiques the **trichotomist** view, which divides humanity into body, soul, and spirit, arguing that biblical evidence more consistently supports a two-part constitution and that distinctions between "soul" and "spirit" are often functional rather than ontological.

- "The dichotomist view seems to be more in accord with the overall teaching of Scripture than the trichotomist position." (Christian Theology, 3rd ed.)

## Key Works

- Christian Theology (especially chapters on anthropology)
- Introducing Christian Doctrine
- What Does God Know and When Does He Know It? (for broader theological method)
- Evangelical Interpretation: Perspectives on Hermeneutical Issues

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as the Biblical View**
    - Argues that Scripture most often presents humans as composed of two elements: **body** and **soul/spirit**.
    - Notes that "soul" and "spirit" are frequently used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Emphasizes that the **image of God** is located in the unity of the material and immaterial aspects.
    - Sees the dichotomist view as more consistent with the **Reformed tradition**.
    - "The dichotomist position is the one that best fits the biblical data." (Christian Theology)

2. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Points out that trichotomy often arises from **Greek philosophical influences** rather than biblical exegesis.
    - Warns that trichotomy can lead to problematic theological implications, such as a **hierarchy within the human person**.
    - Observes that biblical passages cited for trichotomy (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 5:23) are better understood as emphasizing wholeness.
    - Argues that the **functional distinction** between soul and spirit does not necessitate an ontological separation.
    - "The trichotomist view is not well supported by the overall teaching of Scripture." (Christian Theology)

3. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Stresses the **holistic nature** of human beings in biblical anthropology.
    - Rejects any dualism that would separate body and soul/spirit in a way that undermines human unity.
    - Affirms that redemption and resurrection involve the whole person, not just the immaterial aspect.
    - Maintains that the **psychosomatic unity** is essential for understanding the image of God.
    - "The Bible views man as a unity, not as a being divided into separate parts." (Christian Theology)

4. **Terminological Clarification**
    - Explains that "soul" (nephesh/psyche) and "spirit" (ruach/pneuma) often overlap in meaning.
    - Argues that differences in terminology reflect different functions or aspects, not separate substances.
    - Notes that context determines whether "soul" or "spirit" is used in a given passage.
    - Cautions against building doctrine on isolated or ambiguous texts.
    - "The terms 'soul' and 'spirit' are used interchangeably in many biblical passages." (Christian Theology)

5. **Anthropological Implications for Theology**
    - Connects the dichotomist view to doctrines of **sin**, **salvation**, and **resurrection**.
    - Emphasizes that both body and soul/spirit are affected by the Fall and redeemed in Christ.
    - Argues that a correct anthropology safeguards the doctrine of the **resurrection of the body**.
    - Maintains that the dichotomist view avoids the errors of both materialism and extreme dualism.
    - "A proper understanding of human nature is crucial for a sound doctrine of salvation." (Christian Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Erickson’s defense of **dichotomy** has shaped contemporary evangelical anthropology, providing a clear and accessible framework for understanding the constitution of humanity. His work has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions, especially in contexts where **biblical anthropology** is debated. By grounding his arguments in careful exegesis and systematic theology, Erickson has contributed to the ongoing relevance of the dichotomist position within evangelical and Reformed circles.
