# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** from a Reformed perspective, emphasizing the unity of the human person as created in the **image of God**. He critiques both positions for their limitations but ultimately favors a **dichotomous** view—body and soul/spirit—while recognizing the complexity and richness of biblical anthropology. Frame insists that theological formulations must be governed by **Scripture** and the practical implications for **redemption** and **sanctification**.

- "Scripture does not sharply distinguish between soul and spirit, but often uses the terms interchangeably." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Priority in Anthropology**
    - Insists that all doctrines, including human constitution, must be derived from **biblical exegesis**.
    - Argues that Scripture often uses "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably.
    - Warns against speculative anthropologies not grounded in the text.
    - Maintains that theological categories must serve the **redemptive-historical** narrative.
    - "We must let Scripture itself define our terms and categories." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Unity of the Human Person**
    - Emphasizes the holistic nature of humanity as created in the **image of God**.
    - Rejects any view that fragments the person into unrelated parts.
    - Sees body and soul/spirit as distinct but inseparably related.
    - Stresses the importance of this unity for understanding **salvation** and **sanctification**.
    - "The biblical view is not of a divided person, but of a unified being with different aspects." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Qualified Dichotomy**
    - Affirms a basic distinction between **material** (body) and **immaterial** (soul/spirit) aspects.
    - Argues that "spirit" and "soul" are not separate substances but different perspectives on the same immaterial aspect.
    - Recognizes that biblical language is flexible and context-dependent.
    - Rejects trichotomy as lacking clear exegetical support.
    - "I believe the dichotomist view best fits the biblical data." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenantal and Redemptive Focus**
    - Grounds anthropology in the context of **covenant** and **redemption**.
    - Views human constitution as significant for understanding **sin**, **death**, and **resurrection**.
    - Connects the unity of the person to the unity of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Emphasizes the practical implications for Christian living and ethics.
    - "Our understanding of human nature must serve the larger biblical story of creation, fall, and redemption." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Critical Engagement with Historical Views**
    - Interacts with both **trichotomist** and **dichotomist** traditions in church history.
    - Appreciates the motivations behind trichotomy but critiques its exegetical basis.
    - Notes the influence of Greek philosophy on trichotomist formulations.
    - Seeks to retrieve the best insights from tradition while remaining biblically faithful.
    - "We must be careful not to let philosophical speculation override biblical teaching." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to **dichotomy vs. trichotomy** has influenced contemporary Reformed anthropology by insisting on the primacy of **Scripture** and the unity of the human person. His nuanced, covenantal framework has shaped discussions on the nature of the soul, the implications for **sanctification**, and the relationship between body and spirit. Frame’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for those seeking a biblically grounded and theologically robust understanding of human nature.
