# Wayne Grudem (1948–)

Wayne Grudem advocates for the **dichotomist** view of human nature, maintaining that Scripture teaches humans are composed of a **body** and a **soul/spirit**, rather than three distinct parts. He critiques **trichotomy** as lacking strong biblical support and argues that the terms "soul" and "spirit" are often used interchangeably in the **New Testament**, emphasizing the unity of the **immaterial aspect** of humanity.

- "Scripture does not seem to support the idea that the soul and spirit are distinct substances or entities." ("Systematic Theology," p. 472)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (1994)
- Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith (1999)
- Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, ed. Walter A. Elwell (contributor)
- 1 Peter: An Introduction and Commentary (1988)
- "Man as Male and Female" in Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (1991)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
    - Argues that humans consist of two parts: **body** and **soul/spirit**.
    - Asserts that both Old and New Testaments use "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably.
    - Finds no convincing scriptural evidence for a third, distinct element.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the **immaterial aspect** of human beings.
    - "The dichotomist view is the most consistent with the overall teaching of Scripture." (Systematic Theology, p. 473)

2. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Notes that trichotomy often arises from Greek philosophical influences, not biblical exegesis.
    - Points out that supposed proof texts for trichotomy (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 5:23) use parallelism, not ontological distinction.
    - Warns that trichotomy can lead to theological confusion about the nature of **regeneration** and **sanctification**.
    - Maintains that the **image of God** is not divided among three parts.
    - "The distinction between soul and spirit in Scripture is not a division of substance but of function or emphasis." (Systematic Theology, p. 474)

3. **Unity of the Immaterial Nature**
    - Stresses that the **soul** and **spirit** refer to the same immaterial part of humans.
    - Highlights that both terms are used to describe the seat of emotions, will, and intellect.
    - Argues that the biblical writers use the terms interchangeably in various contexts.
    - Rejects the idea that the spirit is the part that relates only to God, while the soul relates to the world.
    - "There is no convincing evidence that the spirit is a higher faculty than the soul." (Systematic Theology, p. 473)

4. **Anthropology and the Image of God**
    - Connects the **image of God** to the whole person, not to a specific part (soul or spirit).
    - Emphasizes the holistic nature of human beings as created in God's image.
    - Argues that dividing humanity into three parts undermines the biblical teaching of human unity.
    - Affirms that both body and soul/spirit are essential to the **imago Dei**.
    - "The image of God is not located in one part of man, but in the whole person." (Systematic Theology, p. 448)

5. **Practical Implications for Christian Life**
    - Warns that trichotomy can foster unbiblical spiritual elitism or confusion in spiritual growth.
    - Encourages believers to view themselves as unified beings in Christ.
    - Teaches that **sanctification** involves the whole person, not just a "spirit" part.
    - Affirms the resurrection of the body as essential to Christian hope.
    - "Sanctification is a process that involves both our bodies and our spirits." (Systematic Theology, p. 748)

## Legacy and Impact

Grudem’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped contemporary evangelical anthropology, especially in systematic theology classrooms and textbooks. His clear biblical arguments have influenced pastors, students, and scholars to reconsider trichotomist assumptions. By rooting his position in exegesis and the unity of the **image of God**, Grudem has contributed to a more integrated understanding of human nature within the Reformed tradition. His work continues to be a standard reference in debates over the constitution of humanity.
