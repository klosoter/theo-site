# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading voice in **Reformed scholasticism**, firmly advocated for the **dichotomous** view of human nature, teaching that man is composed of **body** and **soul** rather than three distinct substances. He grounded his anthropology in **Scriptural sufficiency** and the **unity of the human person**, rejecting trichotomy as both unscriptural and theologically problematic.

- "The soul and spirit are not two distinct substances in man, but only two faculties or modes of the same spiritual substance." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 5.7.3)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 1, Topics 5–6)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy of Body and Soul**
   - Humanity consists of two essential parts: **material body** and **immaterial soul**.
   - The **soul** includes all rational and spiritual faculties.
   - The **spirit** is not a third substance but the soul in its highest operations.
   - Scripture often uses "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably.
   "We maintain against the trichotomists that man consists of two, not three, essential parts." (Institutes, 5.7.2)

2. **Rejection of Trichotomy as Unscriptural**
   - The trichotomist distinction lacks clear biblical support.
   - Key proof texts (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 5:23) are interpreted as rhetorical, not ontological.
   - The **unity of the soul** is essential for the doctrine of the **image of God**.
   - Trichotomy risks introducing **Platonic dualism** into Christian anthropology.
   "The distinction of soul and spirit is not of substance, but of quality or operation." (Institutes, 5.7.3)

3. **Soul as the Seat of Rationality and Spirituality**
   - The **soul** is the principle of both life and rational activity.
   - All human faculties—reason, will, affections—are rooted in the soul.
   - The **spirit** refers to the soul’s capacity for communion with God.
   - No biblical evidence supports a third, separate spiritual substance.
   "The soul is called spirit in respect to its nobler operations." (Institutes, 5.7.4)

4. **Unity of the Human Person**
   - The human person is a unified being, not a composite of three substances.
   - **Resurrection** and **redemption** presuppose the unity of body and soul.
   - The dichotomous view safeguards the integrity of the person in life and death.
   - Division into three parts undermines the biblical doctrine of **sin** and **salvation**.
   "The Scripture everywhere speaks of two parts only, body and soul." (Institutes, 5.7.5)

5. **Theological and Pastoral Implications**
   - The dichotomous view upholds the **simplicity** of the soul.
   - It avoids speculative anthropology that distracts from the gospel.
   - It maintains consistency with **Reformed confessions**.
   - Pastoral care is grounded in the unity of the person, not divided substances.
   "Let us not multiply entities without necessity, especially where Scripture is silent." (Institutes, 5.7.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust defense of **dichotomy** shaped subsequent **Reformed anthropology**, influencing confessional standards and theological education. His arguments provided a bulwark against speculative trichotomist tendencies, reinforcing the **unity of the human person** in both doctrine and pastoral practice. Turretin’s careful exegesis and commitment to **Scriptural sufficiency** continue to inform contemporary discussions on the nature of humanity within Reformed and broader Protestant theology.
