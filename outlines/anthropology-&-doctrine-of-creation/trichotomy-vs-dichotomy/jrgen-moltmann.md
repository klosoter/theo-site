# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the question of **trichotomy vs dichotomy** through a framework of **holistic anthropology** and **eschatological hope**. He rejects classical substance dualisms, emphasizing the unity of the human person as a psychosomatic whole, shaped by **relationality** and the promise of **resurrection**. For Moltmann, the human being is defined by the **imago Dei** and oriented toward future fulfillment in new creation.

- "The human being is not a soul in a body, but an embodied soul or an ensouled body, destined for resurrection." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God
- The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation
- Man: Christian Anthropology in the Conflicts of the Present
- Theology of Hope

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Holistic Anthropology**
   - Rejects both strict **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** as unbiblical and influenced by Greek philosophy.
   - Affirms the unity of body, soul, and spirit as aspects of the one human person.
   - Human beings are fundamentally relational, defined by their orientation toward God and others.
   - The resurrection affirms the wholeness of the human person, not the immortality of a separable soul.
   - "The human being is a psychosomatic unity, not a duality or trichotomy of substances." (Man: Christian Anthropology in the Conflicts of the Present)

2. **Relational Ontology**
   - Human identity is constituted in relationship—with God, with others, and with creation.
   - The **imago Dei** is realized in community and eschatological fulfillment, not in isolated faculties.
   - The spirit is not a separate substance but the relational openness to God’s Spirit.
   - Anthropology is inseparable from ecclesiology and eschatology.
   - "Human beings are created for relationship, and their wholeness is found in communion, not in the division of parts." (God in Creation)

3. **Eschatological Anthropology**
   - Human destiny is resurrection, not the survival of a soul apart from the body.
   - The future of humanity is bodily and communal, grounded in the **resurrection of Christ**.
   - The Spirit’s work is to vivify the whole person, not just an immaterial aspect.
   - Hope for new creation shapes present understanding of human nature.
   - "The resurrection of the body is the hope of the whole person, not just the soul." (The Coming of God)

4. **Critique of Greek Dualism**
   - Classical dichotomy and trichotomy are rooted in Platonic and Gnostic thought, not biblical revelation.
   - The biblical witness affirms the goodness and destiny of the body.
   - Salvation is not escape from the body but the transformation of the whole person.
   - Theological anthropology must resist reduction to either materialism or spiritualism.
   - "The separation of soul and body is foreign to the biblical hope of resurrection." (The Spirit of Life)

5. **Pneumatological Emphasis**
   - The **Holy Spirit** unites and renews the whole person, not just an inner faculty.
   - Spirit is the principle of life and communion, not a third substance within the human.
   - The Spirit’s indwelling is eschatological, anticipating the renewal of all creation.
   - Pneumatology grounds anthropology in the dynamic work of God, not static categories.
   - "The Spirit is the power of life for the whole person, body and soul together." (The Spirit of Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s holistic and **eschatological anthropology** has significantly influenced contemporary theology’s move away from substance dualisms. His critique of both **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** has encouraged theologians to recover a more biblical, relational, and hope-filled understanding of human nature. By rooting anthropology in the resurrection and the work of the **Holy Spirit**, Moltmann has shaped discussions on the **imago Dei**, embodiment, and the destiny of creation within modern systematic theology.
