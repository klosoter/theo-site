# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** debate from a **Reformed** and **biblically integrative** perspective, emphasizing the unity of the human person as created in the **image of God**. He critiques both strict dichotomist and trichotomist positions, favoring a **multiperspectival** understanding that resists reductionism and upholds the complexity of **biblical anthropology**.

- "The Bible does not support a simple trichotomy or dichotomy; rather, it presents a rich, multiperspectival view of human nature." (Poythress, "Science and Hermeneutics")

## Key Works

- "Science and Hermeneutics" (1988)
- "Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach" (2006)
- "Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology" (1987)
- "The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses" (1991)
- "In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach" (2009)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Multiperspectival Anthropology**
    - Human nature must be understood from multiple biblical perspectives.
    - Rejects simplistic reduction to either two or three parts.
    - Emphasizes the complexity and unity of the human person.
    - Draws on **triadic structures** as analogies, not ontological divisions.
    - "We must beware of reducing the richness of biblical teaching to a single scheme." (Symphonic Theology)

2. **Unity of the Image of God**
    - The **image of God** encompasses the whole person, not discrete parts.
    - Both body and soul/spirit are integral to human identity.
    - The biblical emphasis is on functional and relational unity.
    - Trichotomy risks fragmenting the image of God.
    - "The image of God is not a separable component, but a holistic reality." (Redeeming Science)

3. **Scriptural Terminology is Contextual**
    - Terms like "soul" and "spirit" are used fluidly in Scripture.
    - Context determines meaning, not rigid systematic categories.
    - Both dichotomist and trichotomist readings can misread biblical intent.
    - Careful exegesis is required to avoid anachronism.
    - "Biblical language about human nature is flexible and context-dependent." (Science and Hermeneutics)

4. **Critique of Reductionism**
    - Both dichotomy and trichotomy risk oversimplifying human nature.
    - True understanding requires attention to the diversity of biblical descriptions.
    - Multiperspectivalism resists flattening complex realities.
    - Theological models must serve, not constrain, biblical revelation.
    - "Reductionist schemes do not do justice to the fullness of biblical anthropology." (Symphonic Theology)

5. **Integration with Science and Theology**
    - Human nature must be understood in light of both **special revelation** and **general revelation**.
    - Scientific insights can inform, but not override, biblical anthropology.
    - Theological anthropology must remain Christ-centered and covenantal.
    - Integration avoids false dichotomies between body and soul/spirit.
    - "Science and theology together point to the unity and complexity of human beings." (Redeeming Science)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s **multiperspectival** approach has influenced contemporary Reformed discussions on **anthropology**, encouraging theologians to move beyond rigid dichotomist or trichotomist frameworks. His work has fostered a greater appreciation for the complexity and unity of the human person as presented in Scripture. By integrating insights from biblical studies, philosophy, and science, Poythress has contributed to a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the **image of God** in systematic theology.
