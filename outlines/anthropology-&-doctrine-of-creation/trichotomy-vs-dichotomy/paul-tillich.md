# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** through his existential and ontological framework, rejecting both traditional models in favor of a **unified view of the human being**. For Tillich, the human person is fundamentally a **unity of body and soul**, with **spirit** representing the dynamic relational aspect rather than a separate substance. His theology emphasizes the **existential structure of being**, where distinctions serve to describe functions rather than ontological separations.

- "Man is not a being who has a body, a soul, and a spirit; he is a body-soul-spirit unity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

- The Interpretation of History

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Substance Dualism**
    - Tillich opposes the classical **dichotomous** (body-soul) and **trichotomous** (body-soul-spirit) models as ontologically misleading.
    - He insists that such divisions are abstractions, not real separations within the human being.
    - The human is a unified being, not a composite of separable substances.
    - All aspects of human existence are interdependent and dynamically related.
    - "The separation of body, soul, and spirit is an abstraction which distorts the unity of man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Existential Unity of the Human Person**
    - Human existence is characterized by the inseparable unity of **body** and **soul**.
    - The **spirit** is not a third substance but the relational and self-transcending dimension of the soul.
    - Human wholeness is found in the existential structure, not in metaphysical parts.
    - The existential approach avoids reductionism and affirms the complexity of personhood.
    - "The unity of man is existential, not substantial." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Spirit as Function, Not Substance**
    - For Tillich, **spirit** denotes the human capacity for self-transcendence and relation to the **divine**.
    - Spirit is a function or dimension of the soul, not a separate ontological entity.
    - This view allows for a dynamic understanding of human openness to God.
    - The spiritual dimension is essential for religious experience and meaning.
    - "Spirit is not a third part of man but the dimension of his self-relatedness and his relation to God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Ontological Analysis of Human Nature**
    - Tillich frames anthropology within the broader context of **being and non-being**.
    - Human nature is defined by the tension between **finitude** and the **quest for the infinite**.
    - The body-soul unity participates in the existential struggle of existence.
    - The analysis of human nature is inseparable from the doctrine of **creation** and **fall**.
    - "Man’s being is a unity of the elements of existence, not a sum of substances." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Critique of Traditional Christian Anthropology**
    - Tillich challenges the adequacy of both **trichotomy** and **dichotomy** in classical theology.
    - He argues that these models reflect outdated metaphysical assumptions.
    - His approach seeks to reinterpret biblical language existentially, not metaphysically.
    - The goal is to recover the depth of the biblical witness to human wholeness.
    - "The biblical view does not support a substantial separation of body, soul, and spirit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and ontological approach to **human nature** has significantly influenced modern theology, especially in discussions of **anthropology** and the relationship between philosophy and theology. By rejecting both trichotomy and dichotomy as ontological categories, he redirected attention to the **unity and complexity of the person**. His work has shaped later existential and process theologians, and his critique of substance dualism continues to inform contemporary debates about the nature of the soul and spirit. Tillich’s emphasis on the existential structure of being remains a hallmark of twentieth-century theological anthropology.
