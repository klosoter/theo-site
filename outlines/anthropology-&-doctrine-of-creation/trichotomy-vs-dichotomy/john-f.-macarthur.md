# John F. MacArthur (1939– )

John F. MacArthur holds to a **dichotomous** view of human nature, affirming that Scripture teaches humans are composed of a material body and an immaterial soul/spirit, rather than three distinct parts. He emphasizes the essential unity of the **soul** and **spirit**, arguing that distinctions between them in Scripture are functional rather than ontological, and he critiques **trichotomy** as lacking biblical support and opening the door to theological error.

- "Scripture does not distinguish between the soul and the spirit as two separate parts of man; rather, both terms are used interchangeably to describe the immaterial aspect of humanity." (Biblical Doctrine, 2017)

## Key Works

- Biblical Doctrine: A Systematic Summary of Bible Truth (with Richard Mayhue, 2017)
- The MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series (various volumes)
- The Gospel According to Jesus (1988)
- The MacArthur Study Bible (notes on Genesis 2:7; 1 Thessalonians 5:23)
- Fundamentals of the Faith (2009)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Dichotomy as Biblical Anthropology**
   - Asserts that humans are comprised of two essential components: **body** and **soul/spirit**.
   - Argues that the terms "soul" and "spirit" are used interchangeably in both Old and New Testaments.
   - Maintains that no biblical text clearly teaches a three-part (trichotomous) division.
   - Views dichotomy as consistent with historic **Reformed anthropology**.
   - "The Bible uses ‘soul’ and ‘spirit’ interchangeably, making no substantive distinction between the two." (Biblical Doctrine)

2. **Critique of Trichotomy**
   - Warns that trichotomy can lead to unbiblical distinctions and theological confusion.
   - Notes that trichotomy has roots in Greek philosophy rather than biblical exegesis.
   - Suggests trichotomy undermines the unity of the immaterial aspect of man.
   - Points out that trichotomy can foster dualistic or mystical errors.
   - "Trichotomy is not a biblical doctrine but an import from pagan philosophy." (Biblical Doctrine)

3. **Unity of the Immaterial Nature**
   - Emphasizes the inseparability of the **soul** and **spirit** in human experience.
   - Affirms that both terms refer to the inner, immaterial life of a person.
   - Argues that distinctions in terminology reflect different functions, not substances.
   - Holds that regeneration and sanctification affect the whole inner person.
   - "The soul and spirit are not two separate entities, but two ways of viewing the immaterial aspect of man." (Biblical Doctrine)

4. **Scriptural Usage and Exegesis**
   - Analyzes key passages (e.g., Hebrews 4:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:23) as not teaching trichotomy.
   - Interprets scriptural language as phenomenological rather than ontological.
   - Highlights the poetic and parallel nature of Hebrew expression regarding soul and spirit.
   - Argues that careful exegesis supports dichotomy over trichotomy.
   - "The supposed trichotomous proof texts do not withstand careful exegetical scrutiny." (Biblical Doctrine)

5. **Implications for Soteriology and Sanctification**
   - Connects dichotomy to a holistic understanding of **salvation** and **sanctification**.
   - Argues that both soul and spirit are equally affected by sin and redemption.
   - Maintains that spiritual growth involves the whole inner person, not just a "spirit" component.
   - Warns against compartmentalizing spiritual life based on trichotomous categories.
   - "Sanctification is the work of God in the whole inner man, not just in a supposed ‘spirit’ part." (Biblical Doctrine)

## Legacy and Impact

MacArthur’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has influenced contemporary evangelical and Reformed anthropology, reinforcing a return to biblical categories over philosophical speculation. His teaching and writing have shaped the curriculum of seminaries and churches, especially through widely used resources like the MacArthur Study Bible and Biblical Doctrine. By emphasizing the unity of the immaterial aspect of humanity, MacArthur has contributed to clarity in discussions of human nature, sanctification, and the dangers of dualistic thinking. His stance continues to serve as a reference point in debates over the constitution of man within conservative theological circles.
