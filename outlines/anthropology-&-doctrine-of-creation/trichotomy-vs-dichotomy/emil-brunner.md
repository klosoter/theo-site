# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the question of **trichotomy vs dichotomy** through his broader commitment to **dialectical theology** and a relational understanding of the **imago Dei**. He rejected both a strict **trichotomist** (body, soul, spirit) and a simple **dichotomist** (body, soul/spirit) anthropology, instead emphasizing the human person as a unified being-in-relation before God. For Brunner, the distinction between **spirit** and **soul** is functional and relational, not ontological.

- "Man is not composed of different parts, but is a unity, a whole, in which body, soul, and spirit are not separable substances but aspects of the one person." (Man in Revolt)

## Key Works

- Man in Revolt (Der Mensch im Widerspruch)
- The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- The Divine-Human Encounter
- The Mediator
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Anthropological Unity**
    - Humanity is fundamentally a unified being, not a composite of separable parts.
    - The biblical language of **body**, **soul**, and **spirit** refers to aspects of the person, not distinct substances.
    - The unity of the person is grounded in relationship to God.
    - Any division of human nature must avoid dualistic or tripartite substance metaphysics.
    - "The human being is a whole, and the biblical terms describe functions, not substances." (Man in Revolt)

2. **Relational Imago Dei**
    - The **image of God** is not a structural component but a relational reality.
    - Human distinctiveness is found in the capacity for encounter with God.
    - The terms **spirit** and **soul** highlight relational openness, not ontological layers.
    - The imago Dei is dynamic, realized in relationship rather than static faculties.
    - "The image of God is not a possession, but a relationship." (Man in Revolt)

3. **Critique of Trichotomy**
    - Trichotomy risks introducing a non-biblical anthropology influenced by Greek thought.
    - The distinction between **spirit** and **soul** in Scripture is functional, not ontological.
    - Trichotomist views can undermine the unity and responsibility of the person.
    - Brunner warns against speculative psychology in theological anthropology.
    - "The trichotomist view is an importation from alien philosophies, not from biblical revelation." (Man in Revolt)

4. **Qualified Dichotomy**
    - While rejecting strict dichotomy, Brunner acknowledges the biblical use of dual language.
    - The **body-soul** distinction can be useful if understood as describing modes of existence.
    - He resists reducing the human person to either material or immaterial substance.
    - The dichotomy must be interpreted in light of the whole person before God.
    - "Dichotomy is less dangerous than trichotomy, but still inadequate if it becomes a metaphysical doctrine." (Man in Revolt)

5. **Existential-Functional Emphasis**
    - Human nature is best understood in terms of existential function and relation.
    - The **spirit** refers to the Godward openness of the person.
    - The **soul** denotes the center of personal life and selfhood.
    - Anthropology must be grounded in revelation and encounter, not speculative psychology.
    - "The decisive thing is not the number of parts, but the relation of the whole person to God." (Man in Revolt)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **trichotomy vs dichotomy** influenced 20th-century Protestant anthropology by emphasizing the **unity of the person** and the relational nature of the **imago Dei**. His critique of speculative anthropologies helped shift theological focus toward existential and relational categories. Brunner’s work remains a significant resource for those seeking a biblically grounded, non-dualistic understanding of human nature within the Reformed tradition.
