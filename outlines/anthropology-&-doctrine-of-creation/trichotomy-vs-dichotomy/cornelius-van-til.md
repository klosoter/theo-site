# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the question of **trichotomy vs. dichotomy** from the standpoint of **Reformed anthropology** and **presuppositional apologetics**. He rejected speculative divisions of human nature, emphasizing the unity of the **image of God** in man and the antithesis between **covenant faithfulness** and **autonomy**. For Van Til, the dichotomy of **body and soul** best preserved the biblical teaching on human constitution and the Creator-creature distinction.

- "The Bible does not teach a trichotomous view of man; it teaches that man is a unit, consisting of body and soul in covenant relation to God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Image of God**
   - Humanity is created as a unified whole reflecting the **image of God**.
   - The image encompasses all aspects of human existence, not separate "parts."
   - Trichotomy risks fragmenting the biblical concept of personhood.
   - The unity of personhood is foundational for covenantal relationship.
   - "The image of God in man is not to be sought in some part of man, but in the whole man as he stands in relation to God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Rejection of Trichotomy**
   - Trichotomy (body, soul, spirit) is seen as speculative and unbiblical.
   - Van Til critiques trichotomy for introducing Greek philosophical categories.
   - He argues that Scripture uses "soul" and "spirit" interchangeably.
   - Trichotomy undermines the biblical doctrine of **total depravity**.
   - "The trichotomist view is not only unnecessary but positively harmful to a proper understanding of man’s nature." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Anthropology**
   - Human constitution must be understood in terms of **covenant**.
   - The dichotomy of body and soul is sufficient for covenantal categories.
   - The covenant relationship defines the meaning and function of human faculties.
   - Anthropology is inseparable from the Creator-creature distinction.
   - "Man’s nature is to be understood only in terms of his covenant relation to God." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Presuppositional Critique of Autonomy**
   - Trichotomy often serves autonomous philosophical agendas.
   - Van Til insists on starting with **biblical revelation** rather than human speculation.
   - The dichotomist view aligns with the Reformed emphasis on **Scripture alone**.
   - Human self-knowledge is derivative from God’s knowledge.
   - "We must not seek to know man by abstracting him from his relation to God." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Implications for Sin and Redemption**
   - The dichotomist view supports the doctrine of **total depravity**.
   - Sin affects the whole person, not just one "part" (e.g., the body or soul).
   - Redemption in Christ restores the whole person in covenant with God.
   - Trichotomy can lead to a false dualism in sanctification and eschatology.
   - "Sin and grace are covenantal realities that touch every aspect of man’s being." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of **dichotomy** has shaped Reformed anthropology and apologetics, reinforcing the unity of the human person in covenant with God. His critique of trichotomy influenced generations of Westminster theologians to ground their anthropology in **Scripture** rather than philosophical speculation. Van Til’s approach remains a touchstone for discussions on the nature of man, especially in contexts emphasizing the **Creator-creature distinction** and the primacy of covenantal categories.
