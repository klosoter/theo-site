# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til strongly affirmed the **historicity of Adam** and his role as **federal head** of humanity, grounding these doctrines in a consistently **Reformed doctrine of revelation** and **covenant theology**. Van Til argued that the denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the **doctrine of original sin**, the **covenant of works**, and the **redemptive work of Christ**, insisting that biblical revelation is authoritative and perspicuous on these matters.

- "If Adam is not a historical individual, the whole doctrine of the covenant of works and the subsequent doctrine of the covenant of grace lose their meaning." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Historicity is Essential to Christian Doctrine**
    - The reality of **Adam as a historical person** is foundational to the biblical narrative.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity leads to a collapse of the **doctrine of original sin**.
    - The **unity of the human race** is grounded in the historic Adam.
    - The **biblical covenants** depend on Adam’s real existence.
    - "The historicity of Adam is not a peripheral matter but is central to the Christian faith." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Federal Headship and Covenant Representation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** representing all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin is a legal and covenantal reality.
    - Christ’s role as the **second Adam** is only intelligible if Adam’s headship is historical.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ in **Romans 5** is essential for understanding redemption.
    - "The federal relationship of Adam to his posterity is the presupposition of the gospel itself." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Revelation is Authoritative and Perspicuous**
    - Scripture clearly teaches Adam’s historicity and federal role.
    - The authority of **special revelation** is not subject to modern scientific or critical theories.
    - The **analogy of faith** requires interpreting Genesis in light of the whole canon.
    - Attempts to allegorize Adam undermine biblical authority.
    - "We must accept the plain teaching of Scripture regarding Adam, or we lose the foundation of the Christian worldview." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Antithesis between Christian and Non-Christian Worldviews**
    - The denial of Adam’s historicity reflects a **non-Christian epistemology**.
    - Only the Christian worldview provides a coherent account of sin and redemption.
    - The antithesis extends to the interpretation of history and origins.
    - Apologetics must challenge the presuppositions behind evolutionary or mythological readings.
    - "There is no neutrality: either Adam is the historical head of the race, or Christianity is false." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Interpretation**
    - The history of redemption is rooted in real historical events, beginning with Adam.
    - The **covenant of grace** presupposes the failure of the historical Adam.
    - Typology (Adam–Christ) is grounded in actual history, not myth.
    - The unfolding of redemptive history is linear and covenantal, not cyclical or symbolic.
    - "The whole of redemptive history stands or falls with the historicity of Adam." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology, especially in the context of debates over evolution and biblical authority. His insistence on the **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought has influenced generations of theologians and apologists to uphold the foundational doctrines of creation, fall, and redemption. Van Til’s work remains a touchstone for those defending the coherence and necessity of the Reformed doctrine of Adam in contemporary theology.
