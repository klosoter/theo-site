# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards robustly affirm the **historicity of Adam** as the first man and the **federal head** of all humanity, whose actions in the **covenant of works** have direct and lasting consequences for his descendants. Adam’s role as a **representative head** grounds the doctrines of **original sin** and **imputed guilt**, making his historicity essential for the Reformed understanding of **sin and redemption**.

- "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in that first transgression." (Westminster Confession of Faith 6.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 4, 6, 7, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 16–22)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 12–19)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on the covenant of works)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on creation and fall)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam is presented as a real, historical individual created by God.
    - The genealogies and narrative of Genesis are treated as factual history.
    - The fall is a historical event with real consequences for humanity.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the doctrine of original sin.
    "Our first parents, being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, sinned in eating the forbidden fruit." (WCF 6.1)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the covenant representative for all his descendants.
    - His obedience or disobedience is imputed to all whom he represents.
    - The concept of federal headship is foundational to the doctrine of imputation.
    - Christ’s role as the second Adam is understood in parallel to Adam’s headship.
    "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity..." (WCF 6.3)

3. **Covenant of Works**
    - God entered into a covenant of life with Adam, promising life for obedience.
    - The terms of this covenant required perfect and personal obedience.
    - Adam’s breach of the covenant brought death and condemnation to all.
    - The covenant of works sets the stage for the covenant of grace in Christ.
    "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works..." (WCF 7.2)

4. **Original Sin and Imputed Guilt**
    - All humans are born guilty and corrupt due to Adam’s first sin.
    - Original sin is both the imputation of Adam’s guilt and the corruption of nature.
    - This doctrine explains the universality of sin and death.
    - The necessity of redemption is grounded in this inherited condition.
    "They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed..." (WCF 6.3)

5. **Necessity of Adam’s Historicity for Redemption**
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ requires both to be historical figures.
    - The logic of Paul’s argument in Romans 5 depends on Adam’s reality.
    - Denying Adam’s historicity undermines the gospel’s coherence.
    - The Standards insist on the unity of the human race in Adam for the universality of salvation in Christ.
    "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (WLC Q.22)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the doctrines of creation, sin, and redemption by insisting on the **historicity and federal headship of Adam**. Their articulation of the **covenant of works** and the imputation of Adam’s sin remains foundational for confessional Presbyterian and Reformed churches. These commitments continue to inform contemporary debates on human origins, biblical authority, and the nature of salvation in Christ.
