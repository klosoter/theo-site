# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **historicity of Adam** as the first human and the **federal head** of the human race, grounding his interpretation in a literal reading of **Genesis** and the Pauline epistles. For Calvin, Adam’s **original sin** and subsequent fall had real, historical consequences for all humanity, establishing the need for **redemption in Christ** as the new federal head.

- "For as Adam, when he lost the righteousness which he had received, lost it not only for himself but for us all, so also has Christ, by his obedience, restored it to us." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, II.i.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters 1–2)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans (notably Romans 5)
- Sermons on Genesis
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill (secondary reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Calvin interprets the Genesis account as a true historical narrative.
    - Adam is not a myth or symbol but the literal first human created by God.
    - The events of the Fall are real and foundational for understanding human nature.
    - The historicity of Adam undergirds the reality of **original sin**.
    - "We must, therefore, hold, in accordance with the clear testimony of Scripture, that Adam was the father of the human race." (Institutes II.i.3)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam represents all humanity in the covenant of works.
    - His disobedience is imputed to all his descendants.
    - The concept of federal headship is rooted in Paul's teaching, especially Romans 5.
    - This headship establishes the parallel with Christ as the second Adam.
    - "For as the sin of Adam has involved us in guilt, so the righteousness of Christ delivers us from condemnation." (Institutes II.i.8)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Sin and guilt are transmitted from Adam to all his posterity.
    - Calvin rejects the notion that sin is merely imitation; it is inherited.
    - The corruption of nature is universal and total.
    - This transmission is both legal (imputation) and existential (corruption).
    - "Original sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature." (Institutes II.i.8)

4. **Necessity of Redemption in Christ**
    - The historical fall necessitates a historical redemption.
    - Christ is the new federal head, reversing Adam’s curse.
    - Justification and life come through union with Christ, as condemnation came through Adam.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Calvin’s soteriology.
    - "As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (Commentary on Romans 5:19)

5. **Authority of Scripture in Anthropology**
    - Calvin insists on the clarity and sufficiency of Scripture for understanding human origins.
    - He resists allegorical or purely figurative readings of Genesis regarding Adam.
    - The doctrine of humanity must be grounded in biblical revelation, not speculation.
    - Scripture’s account of Adam is foundational for all Christian anthropology.
    - "Let us, therefore, hold this principle, that error never can be eradicated from the heart of man until the true knowledge of God is implanted in it." (Institutes I.iii.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust affirmation of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in its doctrines of **original sin** and **covenant theology**. His exegesis of Genesis and Romans provided a foundation for later confessional standards, such as the Westminster Confession. Calvin’s insistence on the authority of Scripture in matters of anthropology continues to influence contemporary debates on human origins within the Reformed tradition.
