# Peter Enns (1961–)

Peter Enns challenges the **historicity** and **federal headship** of Adam as traditionally understood in **Reformed theology**, arguing that the Genesis account reflects ancient Near Eastern literary conventions rather than modern historical or scientific standards. He contends that **Paul’s use of Adam** in the New Testament is theologically significant but not dependent on Adam’s literal existence as the first human or as a **covenantal representative** of all humanity. Enns advocates for a reading of Scripture that is sensitive to its **ancient context** and open to dialogue with **evolutionary science**.

- "The Adam story in Genesis reflects the worldview of its ancient authors and is not necessarily a literal account of human origins." ("The Evolution of Adam")

## Key Works

- "The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn’t Say about Human Origins" (2012)
- "Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament" (2005)
- "The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It" (2014)
- "Genesis for Normal People" (with Jared Byas, 2012)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Archetype, Not Historical Individual**
    - Argues that the Genesis account presents Adam as a representative figure, not necessarily a literal first human.
    - Emphasizes the literary and theological function of Adam within the ancient Near Eastern context.
    - Suggests that the text’s primary concern is with Israel’s identity, not universal human origins.
    - Maintains that reading Adam as an archetype does not undermine the authority of Scripture.
    - "Adam is a figure who embodies the story of Israel, not the biological progenitor of the human race." ("The Evolution of Adam")

2. **Paul’s Use of Adam is Contextual and Theological**
    - Interprets Paul’s references to Adam (e.g., Romans 5, 1 Corinthians 15) as rooted in Second Temple Jewish thought.
    - Argues that Paul’s theological points about **sin** and **redemption** do not require a historical Adam.
    - Suggests that Paul’s use of Adam is analogous to his use of other Old Testament figures for theological argumentation.
    - Maintains that the gospel’s truth does not depend on Adam’s historicity.
    - "Paul’s Adam is the Adam he inherited from his Jewish world, not a modern scientific Adam." ("The Evolution of Adam")

3. **Scripture Reflects Ancient Worldviews**
    - Asserts that Genesis shares literary and conceptual features with other ancient Near Eastern texts.
    - Argues that the biblical authors were not concerned with modern scientific or historical precision.
    - Encourages readers to respect the Bible’s ancient context rather than impose modern expectations.
    - Maintains that recognizing ancient worldviews enhances, rather than diminishes, biblical authority.
    - "The Bible is an ancient book and must be read as such." ("Inspiration and Incarnation")

4. **Openness to Evolutionary Science**
    - Accepts the scientific consensus on human evolution and common ancestry.
    - Argues that Christian theology can and should adapt to well-established scientific findings.
    - Rejects the notion that faithfulness to Scripture requires rejection of evolutionary biology.
    - Sees the challenge of evolution as an opportunity for theological growth and re-examination.
    - "Evolution demands that we rethink what it means to be human and how we read Genesis." ("The Evolution of Adam")

5. **Reframing Original Sin and Federal Headship**
    - Questions the traditional doctrine of **original sin** as dependent on a historical Adam.
    - Suggests that the concept of **federal headship** is a theological construct, not a biblical necessity.
    - Proposes alternative ways of understanding human sinfulness and solidarity apart from Adamic descent.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency of Christ’s work without requiring a literal Adam as covenant head.
    - "The gospel does not rise or fall on the historicity of Adam." ("The Evolution of Adam")

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Enns has significantly influenced contemporary discussions on the **relationship between science and Scripture**, particularly regarding human origins and the interpretation of Genesis. His work has challenged traditional **Reformed** and evangelical positions on the historicity and federal headship of Adam, prompting both vigorous debate and new avenues of theological reflection. While controversial in some circles, Enns has encouraged many to engage the Bible with greater historical and literary sensitivity, fostering a more dialogical approach between faith and modern knowledge.
