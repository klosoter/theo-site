# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine firmly upheld the **historicity of Adam** as the first human and the **federal head** of the human race. He argued that Adam’s original sin was transmitted to all humanity, grounding the doctrine of **original sin** and the necessity of **divine grace** for salvation.

- "In Adam, all die; so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants
- On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam was a real, historical individual created by God.
    - The Genesis account is not merely allegorical but describes actual events.
    - The fall occurred in time and space, affecting all subsequent humanity.
    - Adam’s actions have real consequences for the human race.
    - "For if the events which Scripture records as having happened to Adam are not true, the whole edifice of faith falls." (On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative of all humanity before God.
    - His disobedience constituted a corporate act with universal implications.
    - All humans inherit both guilt and corruption from Adam.
    - The concept of federal headship is foundational for understanding redemption in Christ.
    - "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin." (City of God)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is transmitted from Adam to all his descendants.
    - This transmission is both by propagation (biological descent) and by legal imputation.
    - Human nature is universally corrupted as a result of Adam’s sin.
    - Infants, though personally innocent, are born under the guilt of Adam.
    - "The sin which is thus transmitted by birth is the reason why infants are baptized." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants)

4. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Humanity is utterly unable to save itself due to Adam’s fall.
    - Divine grace is necessary to heal the corruption inherited from Adam.
    - Salvation is not possible apart from the intervention of Christ, the second Adam.
    - Grace is both prevenient and effectual in overcoming original sin.
    - "For it is by grace that we are saved, not by nature." (Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love)

5. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - Christ’s obedience and righteousness counteract Adam’s disobedience.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Augustine’s soteriology.
    - Just as Adam’s act brought condemnation, Christ’s act brings justification.
    - Union with Christ is necessary for participation in the new humanity.
    - "As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** profoundly shaped Western Christian theology, especially in the doctrines of **original sin** and **grace**. His influence is evident in later Reformed and Catholic thought, providing a framework for understanding human solidarity in sin and redemption. The Augustinian paradigm remains foundational for discussions on the relationship between Adam and Christ, and continues to inform debates on biblical anthropology and soteriology.
