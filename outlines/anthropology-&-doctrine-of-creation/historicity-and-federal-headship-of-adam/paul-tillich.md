# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the question of the **historicity of Adam** and **federal headship** through his existential and symbolic theology, rejecting a literal-historical reading of Genesis. For Tillich, Adam represents the **archetype of humanity** and the **universal condition of estrangement**, not a specific historical individual whose actions are imputed to all. He reinterprets **original sin** and **fallenness** as existential realities, emphasizing the mythic and symbolic dimensions over federal or covenantal categories.

- "The story of Adam is not a story of a single event in the past, but the description of a permanent structure of human existence." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on The Fall and Existential Estrangement)
- The Shaking of the Foundations (sermons on sin and human condition)
- The Interpretation of History
- The Protestant Era (essays on myth and symbol)
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Symbol, Not Historical Individual**
   - Adam is understood as the symbol of universal human existence, not as a literal first man.
   - The Genesis narrative is interpreted mythologically, conveying existential truths.
   - The "fall" is a description of the human condition, not a historical event.
   - Tillich rejects the necessity of a historical Adam for Christian doctrine.
   - "The Adam of the story is every man; he is not a historical individual." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

2. **Original Sin as Existential Estrangement**
   - Sin is defined as the universal estrangement of humanity from God, self, and others.
   - This estrangement is a structural condition, not inherited guilt from a federal head.
   - The doctrine of original sin expresses the depth of human alienation.
   - The myth of Adam communicates the reality of this existential state.
   - "Original sin means that existence is estranged from its essential being." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Federal Headship**
   - Tillich does not affirm the Reformed concept of Adam as a federal or covenantal representative.
   - The imputation of Adam’s guilt is seen as a symbolic, not juridical, reality.
   - Humanity’s solidarity in sin is existential, not legal or forensic.
   - The focus is on the universality of the human predicament, not on covenantal structures.
   - "The idea of a representative act by a first man is a mythological expression of universal human experience." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

4. **Myth and Symbol in Theological Language**
   - Biblical narratives are interpreted as myths that reveal existential truths.
   - Myths are not falsehoods but symbolic expressions of ultimate reality.
   - The Adam narrative functions as a myth that discloses the structure of human existence.
   - Theological language must use symbol and myth to speak of transcendent realities.
   - "Myth is the expression of unanalysable realities in terms of images and stories." ("Theology of Culture")

5. **Christ as the New Being, Not Federal Head**
   - Christ is not a federal head in the juridical sense, but the "New Being" who overcomes estrangement.
   - Redemption is existential participation in the New Being, not a legal transfer.
   - The contrast between Adam and Christ is symbolic of old and new modes of existence.
   - Salvation is the healing of estrangement, not the reversal of a federal transaction.
   - "In Christ, the New Being appears, conquering the old existence symbolized by Adam." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic approach to the **doctrine of Adam** has profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in its engagement with science and biblical criticism. By shifting the focus from **historicity** and **federal headship** to existential realities, Tillich provided a framework for understanding sin and redemption in non-literal terms. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to reconcile Christian doctrine with contemporary philosophical and scientific perspectives, though it stands in marked contrast to traditional Reformed and evangelical positions.
