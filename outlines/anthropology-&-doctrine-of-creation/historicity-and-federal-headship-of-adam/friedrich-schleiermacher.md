# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **doctrine of Adam** by emphasizing the symbolic and representative aspects of the biblical narrative, rather than insisting on the **historicity** or **federal headship** of Adam in the traditional Reformed sense. He viewed Adam as a figure expressing the **universal human condition** of sinfulness, focusing on the existential reality of **sin** within the human race rather than a literal transmission from a historical progenitor.

- "The narrative of the fall is not to be regarded as a historical account, but as a mythical representation of the origin of sin in the human race." (The Christian Faith, §60)

- Schleiermacher: Hermeneutics and Criticism (ed. Andrew Bowie)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Symbolic Representative**
   - Adam is understood as a symbol of **humanity as a whole**, not as a unique historical individual.
   - The Genesis account is interpreted as **mythical**, expressing universal truths about human nature.
   - The focus is on the **solidarity of the human race** in sin, rather than on genealogical descent.
   - The narrative serves to illustrate the existential reality of **alienation from God**.
   - "The story of Adam is a poetic expression of the fact that sin is universal and inevitable in human development." (The Christian Faith, §60)

2. **Rejection of Federal Headship**
   - Schleiermacher denies the **federal theology** of Adam as a covenantal representative.
   - He sees no basis for the imputation of Adam’s guilt to his descendants.
   - Sin is not transmitted by **imputation**, but is a universal existential condition.
   - The concept of **original sin** is reinterpreted as the shared sinful state of all humans.
   - "There is no ground for the assumption of a legal imputation of Adam’s act to his descendants." (The Christian Faith, §71)

3. **Historicity De-emphasized**
   - The historicity of Adam is not essential for understanding the doctrine of sin.
   - Schleiermacher treats the Genesis narrative as **myth** rather than literal history.
   - The theological meaning of the text is prioritized over historical questions.
   - The focus is on the **phenomenology of sin** in human experience.
   - "Whether Adam existed as an individual is irrelevant to the reality of sin in the human race." (The Christian Faith, §60)

4. **Sin as Universal Human Condition**
   - Sin is seen as a universal aspect of **human consciousness**.
   - The origin of sin is explained in terms of the development of **self-consciousness** and freedom.
   - All humans participate in sin by virtue of their **creaturely nature**.
   - The doctrine of sin is grounded in **experience**, not in historical transmission.
   - "Sin is not a foreign element introduced by a single act, but the universal state of humanity." (The Christian Faith, §66)

5. **Christ as the New Paradigm**
   - Christ is presented as the **archetype** of redeemed humanity, not as a federal head in the traditional sense.
   - The contrast between Adam and Christ is existential and ethical, not genealogical.
   - Redemption is understood as the restoration of **God-consciousness** in humanity.
   - The work of Christ overcomes the universal condition symbolized by Adam.
   - "In Christ, the divine image is restored, and the power of sin is overcome for all." (The Christian Faith, §94)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **Adam** profoundly shaped modern theology by shifting the focus from **historical federal headship** to the existential and symbolic dimensions of the biblical narrative. His approach influenced later liberal and existential theologians, challenging traditional Reformed doctrines of **original sin** and **imputation**. While his views were controversial among confessional theologians, they opened new avenues for understanding the relationship between **biblical narrative** and human experience. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the meaning and significance of Adam in Christian theology.
