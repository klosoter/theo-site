# C. John Collins (1954– )

C. John Collins strongly affirms the **historicity of Adam** and his role as **federal head** of humanity, arguing that these doctrines are essential for a coherent understanding of **original sin** and **redemption in Christ**. Collins maintains that the biblical narrative presents Adam as a real, historical individual whose actions have **covenantal** and **representative** significance for all people, grounding his arguments in both exegetical and theological analysis.

- "If we lose Adam, we lose the explanation for why the world is the way it is, and why the work of Christ is necessary." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

## Key Works

- Science and Faith: Friends or Foes? (2003)
- Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary (2006)
- Four Views on the Historical Adam (contributor, 2013)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Individual**
   - Argues that the biblical text presents Adam as a real person, not merely a literary symbol.
   - Maintains that genealogies and references in both Old and New Testaments presuppose Adam’s historicity.
   - Emphasizes the importance of Adam’s existence for the coherence of **biblical theology**.
   - Engages with both scientific and literary-critical challenges to Adam’s historicity.
   - "The New Testament writers treat Adam as a real person, and so should we." (Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Affirms that Adam acts as the **representative head** of humanity in a **covenantal** framework.
   - Connects Adam’s federal role to the doctrine of **original sin** and the need for a second Adam, Christ.
   - Argues that Paul’s use of Adam in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 requires a federal understanding.
   - Insists that federal headship is essential for the logic of **redemption** in Reformed theology.
   - "Paul’s argument about Christ as the second Adam depends on Adam’s role as the first representative." (Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?)

3. **Covenantal Structure of Creation**
   - Sees the creation account as establishing a **covenant** between God and Adam.
   - Argues that Adam’s obedience or disobedience has consequences for all his descendants.
   - Connects the **covenant of works** with Adam’s role as federal head.
   - Emphasizes the continuity between the Adamic covenant and later biblical covenants.
   - "The story of Adam is the story of the first covenant, whose breach required a redeemer." (Genesis 1–4)

4. **Integration of Science and Exegesis**
   - Engages contemporary science while upholding the **theological necessity** of Adam’s historicity.
   - Argues that literary features in Genesis do not preclude historical claims.
   - Encourages a critical but respectful dialogue between biblical interpretation and scientific findings.
   - Rejects reductionist readings that dismiss Adam as merely mythological.
   - "We must read Genesis as intending to tell us about real events, even if the style is literary." (Reading Genesis Well)

5. **Adam and the Doctrine of Sin**
   - Maintains that the universality of **sin** and **death** is grounded in Adam’s historical fall.
   - Argues that without a historical Adam, the biblical account of human brokenness loses coherence.
   - Connects the transmission of sin to Adam’s representative disobedience.
   - Insists that Christ’s redemptive work is unintelligible apart from Adam’s historical transgression.
   - "If Adam is not the ancestor of us all, then the explanation for our plight and Christ’s work is undermined." (Four Views on the Historical Adam)

## Legacy and Impact

Collins has been a leading evangelical voice defending the **historicity of Adam** and his **federal headship** in the context of contemporary debates over science and Scripture. His work has shaped discussions within the Reformed tradition and broader evangelicalism, especially regarding the relationship between **biblical theology** and modern scientific claims. Collins’s careful integration of exegesis, theology, and scientific awareness continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students wrestling with the foundational issues of human origins and the gospel.
