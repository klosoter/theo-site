# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading advocate for the **historicity of Adam** and his role as the **federal head** of humanity, grounding these doctrines in a thoroughly **Reformed** and **Pauline** theological framework. Gaffin maintains that the integrity of **original sin**, **imputation**, and the **gospel** itself depends on Adam’s real existence and representative function, especially as articulated in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**.

- "The denial of the historicity of Adam as the first man and covenant head undermines the very structure of Paul’s gospel." (No Adam, No Gospel, 2013)

## Key Works

- "No Adam, No Gospel: Adam and the History of Redemption" (2013)
- "The Forgotten Christ: Exploring the Majesty and Mystery of God Incarnate" (2013)
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (1978)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- Contributions to "Did Adam Exist?" (Westminster Theological Journal articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Historicity is Essential**
    - Affirms Adam as a real, historical individual, not a myth or symbol.
    - Grounds the doctrine in the exegesis of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**.
    - Argues that denying Adam’s historicity undermines the **doctrine of original sin**.
    - Connects Adam’s reality to the reliability of **Scripture** and the **gospel**.
    "If Adam is not historical, then the entire structure of redemptive history collapses." (No Adam, No Gospel)

2. **Federal Headship as Covenant Representation**
    - Adam acts as the **federal head** (representative) of all humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - Adam’s disobedience is imputed to his descendants, grounding the universality of sin.
    - Christ’s role as the **second Adam** is only coherent if Adam’s federal headship is real.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Paul’s soteriology.
    "The parallel between Adam and Christ is not merely literary but covenantal and historical." (No Adam, No Gospel)

3. **Pauline Theology as Foundation**
    - Emphasizes that Paul’s arguments in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** presuppose a historical Adam.
    - Argues that Paul’s doctrine of **justification** and **resurrection** depends on Adam’s headship.
    - Maintains that Paul’s typology is rooted in real historical events.
    - Insists that undermining Adam’s historicity distorts Paul’s gospel.
    "Paul’s theology is unintelligible apart from the historical Adam." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Original Sin and Imputation**
    - Original sin is transmitted through Adam’s representative act.
    - The imputation of Adam’s guilt is the basis for the need of Christ’s righteousness.
    - Denial of Adam’s headship severs the logic of **imputed righteousness** in Christ.
    - Upholds the **Reformed confessional standards** on sin and imputation.
    "The doctrine of original sin stands or falls with the historicity and headship of Adam." (No Adam, No Gospel)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Hermeneutics**
    - Argues that the authority of **Scripture** requires affirming Adam’s historicity.
    - Critiques attempts to harmonize evolutionary theory with a non-historical Adam.
    - Maintains a grammatical-historical approach to Genesis and Pauline texts.
    - Warns that abandoning Adam’s historicity leads to doctrinal erosion.
    "To deny Adam’s historicity is to call into question the trustworthiness of the biblical witness." (No Adam, No Gospel)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to challenges from evolutionary biology and biblical criticism. His work has reinforced the centrality of **Pauline theology** and the coherence of the **Reformed doctrine of original sin**. Gaffin’s influence is evident in confessional debates and in the ongoing articulation of a robustly biblical anthropology within the church and academy.
