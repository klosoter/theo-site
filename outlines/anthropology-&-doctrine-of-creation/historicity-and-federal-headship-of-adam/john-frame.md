# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **historicity of Adam** and the doctrine of **federal headship** as essential to a biblical and Reformed understanding of **original sin** and **covenant theology**. He maintains that Adam’s real existence and representative role are foundational for the coherence of **redemptive history** and the work of **Christ as the second Adam**.

- "If Adam was not a real historical figure, the biblical doctrine of sin and salvation collapses." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "In Defense of Something Close to Biblicism" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1997)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Historicity is Essential**
    - Argues that the biblical narrative presents Adam as a real, historical person.
    - Maintains that denying Adam’s historicity undermines the integrity of **Scripture**.
    - Connects the historicity of Adam to the reliability of **Paul’s arguments** in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15.
    - Sees Adam’s existence as foundational for understanding the **fall** and the need for redemption.
    - "The New Testament treats Adam as a historical figure, and so should we." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Federal Headship and Covenant Representation**
    - Affirms that Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity in the **covenant of works**.
    - Adam’s disobedience is imputed to all his descendants, grounding the doctrine of **original sin**.
    - Christ’s role as the second Adam is only coherent if Adam’s federal headship is real.
    - The structure of **covenant theology** depends on the representative principle established in Adam.
    - "The parallel between Adam and Christ depends on both being covenant heads." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Biblical Authority and Hermeneutics**
    - Upholds the **authority of Scripture** in matters of history and doctrine.
    - Critiques attempts to reinterpret Adam as a myth or symbol.
    - Emphasizes a grammatical-historical approach to Genesis.
    - Insists that biblical theology must not be subordinated to extra-biblical science or philosophy.
    - "We must let Scripture interpret itself, even in matters of ancient history." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Original Sin and Human Solidarity**
    - Teaches that all humanity sinned in Adam and inherits his guilt and corruption.
    - Frames original sin as both a forensic and existential reality.
    - Connects the universality of sin to Adam’s representative act.
    - Argues that denying Adam’s headship leads to a Pelagian or semi-Pelagian anthropology.
    - "Original sin is unintelligible apart from Adam’s representative role." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - Stresses the typological and redemptive-historical connection between Adam and Christ.
    - Christ’s obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers, reversing Adam’s curse.
    - The gospel’s coherence relies on the parallel between Adam’s fall and Christ’s redemption.
    - The work of Christ is framed as a new covenant headship for the redeemed.
    - "The work of Christ is best understood as the reversal of Adam’s failure." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has reinforced the continuity of classic Reformed theology within contemporary evangelicalism. His insistence on the authority of Scripture and the centrality of **covenant representation** has shaped discussions on biblical anthropology and the doctrine of sin. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students committed to a confessional and exegetical approach to **systematic theology**.
