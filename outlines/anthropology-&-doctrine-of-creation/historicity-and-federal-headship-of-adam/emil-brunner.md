# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **historicity of Adam** and **federal headship** with significant reservations, emphasizing the **mythological** and **representative** nature of the Genesis narrative. He rejected a literal-historical Adam as the biological ancestor of all humanity, instead interpreting Adam as a symbol of **universal human sinfulness** and the existential reality of the **Fall**. Brunner’s view distances itself from traditional **federal theology**, focusing on the existential condition of humanity rather than a covenantal or forensic headship.

- "Adam is not a historical individual, but the representative of man as such, of man in his essential nature." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

## Key Works

- "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption" (Dogmatics, Vol. II)
- "Man in Revolt"
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "The Mediator"
- Alister E. McGrath, "The Intellectual Origins of the European Reformation" (secondary, for context on Brunner’s doctrine of man)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Representative, Not Historical Individual**
    - Adam signifies the existential reality of every human, not a literal first man.
    - The Genesis account is interpreted as **myth** conveying theological truth.
    - Brunner resists the identification of Adam with a specific historical figure.
    - The narrative’s value lies in its depiction of the universal human condition.
    - "The Adam of whom Paul speaks is not a historical person, but the representative of man as such." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

2. **Sin as Universal and Existential**
    - Sin is not inherited biologically from Adam but is a universal existential reality.
    - Every person reenacts the Fall in their own existence.
    - The doctrine of **original sin** is affirmed in existential, not genealogical, terms.
    - The focus is on the broken relationship between God and humanity.
    - "Every man is Adam, and Adam is every man." ("Man in Revolt")

3. **Critique of Federal Headship**
    - Brunner rejects the **federal theology** of Adam as a covenantal head.
    - He views the legal and forensic categories as foreign to biblical anthropology.
    - The relationship between Adam and Christ is typological, not juridical.
    - Emphasis is placed on the solidarity of sin rather than covenantal representation.
    - "The idea of a covenant headship is alien to the biblical witness as I understand it." ("The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption")

4. **Theological Use of Myth**
    - Genesis is seen as **myth** that expresses profound truths, not literal history.
    - Myth, for Brunner, is not falsehood but a necessary vehicle for existential truth.
    - The Adam narrative communicates the reality of human estrangement from God.
    - The mythic form allows for universal application to all humanity.
    - "The story of Adam is true, not as history, but as the deepest truth about man." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

5. **Christ as the New Man**
    - Christ is contrasted with Adam as the true image and fulfillment of humanity.
    - The **second Adam** motif is interpreted existentially, not covenantally.
    - Redemption is the restoration of true humanity in Christ, not reversal of a forensic status.
    - The work of Christ addresses the existential plight revealed in the Adam narrative.
    - "In Christ, the new Adam, we see what man was meant to be." ("The Mediator")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **historicity of Adam** and **federal headship** significantly influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, especially in its existential and neo-orthodox streams. His emphasis on the **mythological** and **representative** aspects of Adam challenged traditional Reformed and evangelical doctrines, prompting ongoing debates about the relationship between biblical narrative and historical fact. Brunner’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the intersection of **biblical anthropology** and modern thought, even as his views have been critiqued by more confessional traditions.
