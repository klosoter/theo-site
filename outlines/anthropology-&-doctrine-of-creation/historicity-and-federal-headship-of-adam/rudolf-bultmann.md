# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann rejected the **historicity of Adam** and the traditional doctrine of **federal headship**, interpreting the Genesis narrative as **mythological** rather than literal history. For Bultmann, Adam represents the existential condition of humanity rather than a historical individual whose actions have direct **soteriological** consequences for all people.

- "Adam is not a historical figure, but a symbol of every man." ("New Testament and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Primitive Christianity in Its Contemporary Setting" (1956)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - The biblical account of Adam is a mythological expression, not a historical report.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind the myth.
    - The Genesis narrative conveys truths about human existence, not ancient events.
    - Theological focus shifts from historical facticity to existential interpretation.
    - "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Existential Interpretation of Sin**
    - Adam’s story illustrates the universal human condition of **sin**.
    - Sin is understood as an existential reality, not a transmitted guilt from a progenitor.
    - Each person is Adam in the sense of making the choice to turn from God.
    - The narrative is a mirror for self-understanding, not a record of origins.
    - "The Adam myth expresses the fact that man’s existence is determined by sin." ("Theology of the New Testament")

3. **Rejection of Federal Headship**
    - The concept of Adam as the federal head is rooted in a pre-modern worldview.
    - Bultmann denies that Adam’s act is imputed to all humanity in a juridical sense.
    - Salvation is not a reversal of Adam’s historical fall, but a new existential possibility in Christ.
    - The Pauline parallel between Adam and Christ is interpreted existentially, not ontologically.
    - "The idea of original sin as a hereditary defect is foreign to the New Testament." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Christ as the New Adam—Existentially Understood**
    - Christ is the new Adam in the sense of inaugurating a new mode of existence.
    - The contrast between Adam and Christ is not about historical succession but existential transformation.
    - Faith in Christ brings liberation from the existential condition symbolized by Adam.
    - The focus is on personal encounter with the kerygma, not on historical genealogy.
    - "What matters is not the first Adam but the new creation in Christ." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

5. **Critical Approach to Biblical Historicity**
    - Bultmann applies historical-critical methods to question the factual basis of Genesis.
    - He views the Adam narrative as shaped by ancient cosmologies, not eyewitness history.
    - Theological meaning is not dependent on the historicity of Adam.
    - The authority of Scripture lies in its existential address, not in literal accuracy.
    - "Faith cannot be based on the acceptance of myths as historical facts." ("History and Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **historicity of Adam** and **federal headship** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, especially in the fields of **biblical hermeneutics** and existential interpretation. His insistence on demythologization challenged traditional doctrines and provoked significant debate regarding the relationship between **history** and **theology**. While many have critiqued his dismissal of Adam’s historicity, Bultmann’s work remains influential in discussions about the existential meaning of biblical texts and the nature of **original sin**.
