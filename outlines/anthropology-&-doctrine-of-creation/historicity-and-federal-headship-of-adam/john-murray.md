# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray strongly affirmed the **historicity of Adam** and the doctrine of **federal headship** as essential to a coherent understanding of **original sin** and **redemption**. He argued that Adam’s real existence and representative role are foundational for the **covenant of works** and the imputation of sin and righteousness in **Reformed theology**.

- "The historicity of Adam is indispensable to the doctrine of original sin and to the plan of redemption." ("The Epistle to the Romans")

## Key Works

- "The Epistle to the Romans" (especially commentary on Romans 5:12–21)
- "The Imputation of Adam’s Sin"
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "Principles of Conduct"
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (relevant for federal theology context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam was a real, historical individual, not a myth or symbol.
    - The narrative of Genesis is foundational for understanding human origins.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the biblical doctrine of sin.
    - The New Testament, especially Paul, presupposes Adam’s existence.
    - "The apostle’s argument in Romans 5:12–21 loses all cogency if Adam is not a historical person." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative head of all humanity.
    - His disobedience is imputed to his descendants by virtue of this headship.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is essential for understanding justification.
    - Federal headship is rooted in the **covenant of works**.
    - "The relation of Adam to his posterity is that of federal headship and representation." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

3. **Imputation of Sin**
    - Adam’s first sin is judicially reckoned to all his descendants.
    - Imputation is not mere imitation but a legal and covenantal reality.
    - This imputation is the basis for the universality of human depravity.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of Christ’s atoning work.
    - "The sin of Adam is the judicial ground of the condemnation of all." ("The Imputation of Adam’s Sin")

4. **Covenant of Works**
    - God established a covenant with Adam, promising life for obedience.
    - Adam’s failure brought death and condemnation to all under his headship.
    - The covenant of works provides the backdrop for the covenant of grace.
    - The structure of redemptive history depends on this initial covenantal arrangement.
    - "The covenant of works is the necessary presupposition of the covenant of grace." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 2")

5. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - Christ fulfills the role of federal head for the redeemed.
    - The obedience of Christ is imputed to believers, paralleling Adam’s disobedience.
    - The structure of redemption mirrors the structure of the fall.
    - Union with Christ is the means by which righteousness is received.
    - "As condemnation came by the one man’s disobedience, so justification comes by the one man’s obedience." ("The Epistle to the Romans")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **original sin** and **covenant theology**. His exegetical rigor, especially in Romans 5, continues to influence evangelical scholarship and confessional standards. By insisting on the necessity of Adam’s historicity, Murray provided a bulwark against theological trends that sought to reinterpret Genesis in non-historical terms, ensuring the coherence of the doctrines of sin and redemption within the Reformed tradition.
