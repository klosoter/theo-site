# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity affirm the **historicity of Adam** as the first human created by God and the **federal headship** of Adam over all humanity. These confessional documents teach that Adam’s original righteousness, subsequent fall, and covenantal role are foundational for understanding **original sin**, **imputation**, and the necessity of **redemption in Christ** as the second Adam.

- "We believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14–17
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 6, 7, 9, 18, 20
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Head III/IV, Articles 1–3
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical Creeds and Reformed Confessions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam is presented as a real, historical individual created by God.
    - The narrative of Adam’s creation and fall is not merely symbolic but foundational to human history.
    - The confessions explicitly connect Adam’s actions to the actual condition of all his descendants.
    - The historicity of Adam undergirds the doctrines of sin and redemption.
    - "God created man good and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative (federal head) of the entire human race in the **covenant of works**.
    - His obedience or disobedience had consequences for all his posterity.
    - The guilt and corruption resulting from Adam’s fall are imputed to all humanity.
    - This federal relationship is paralleled in Christ’s representative work for the elect.
    - "In Adam all men have thus become sinners, corrupt in all their ways, and subject to all misery, yea, to condemnation itself." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q7)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is transmitted from Adam to all his descendants by ordinary generation.
    - All people are born with a sinful nature due to Adam’s first transgression.
    - The confessions stress the universality and depth of human depravity.
    - This inherited corruption necessitates divine grace for salvation.
    - "Original sin is a corruption of the whole nature and an inherited depravity." (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 2)

4. **Necessity of Christ as Second Adam**
    - Christ is presented as the new federal head, reversing Adam’s curse.
    - Redemption is accomplished by Christ’s obedience and righteousness, imputed to believers.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to the confessional understanding of salvation.
    - Only through union with Christ can the effects of Adam’s fall be overcome.
    - "We must seek in Jesus Christ that which is wanting in ourselves." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

5. **Covenantal Structure of Redemptive History**
    - The confessions articulate a covenantal framework: **covenant of works** with Adam, **covenant of grace** in Christ.
    - Adam’s failure in the covenant of works sets the stage for the promise and fulfillment of the covenant of grace.
    - The unity and progression of God’s redemptive plan are emphasized through these covenants.
    - The federal headship of Adam and Christ is essential to this covenantal theology.
    - "God... made a covenant of grace with us, in which He gives us everything for the sake of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q20)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology**, especially in their articulation of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam**. Their confessional clarity has influenced subsequent doctrinal formulations regarding **original sin**, **imputation**, and the necessity of Christ’s mediatorial work. These documents remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, providing a robust theological framework for understanding the relationship between Adam, humanity, and redemption in Christ.
