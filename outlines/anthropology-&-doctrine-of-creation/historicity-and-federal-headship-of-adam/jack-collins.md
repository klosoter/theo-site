# Jack Collins (1954– )

Jack Collins is a leading advocate for the **historicity of Adam** and his role as **federal head** of humanity, arguing that these doctrines are essential for a coherent understanding of **original sin** and the **biblical narrative**. He maintains that the **Genesis account** presents Adam as a real, historical individual whose actions have universal implications, foundational for both **Reformed theology** and the **Pauline doctrine** of salvation.

- "The New Testament writers, especially Paul, treat Adam as a real person whose actions affected all his descendants." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

## Key Works

- "Did Adam and Eve Really Exist? Who They Were and Why You Should Care" (2011)
- "Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary" (2006)
- "Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?" (2003)
- "Reading Genesis Well: Navigating History, Poetry, Science, and Truth in Genesis 1–11" (2018)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Individual**
    - Argues that the biblical text presents Adam as a real person, not merely a literary symbol.
    - Maintains that the genealogies and narrative structure of Genesis support Adam’s historicity.
    - Insists that the New Testament, especially Paul, presupposes Adam’s existence.
    - Sees Adam’s historicity as crucial for the coherence of the Christian doctrine of sin and redemption.
    "If there was no first man, much of the logic of the biblical story falls apart." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Holds that Adam represents all humanity in a covenantal or federal sense.
    - Adam’s disobedience brings consequences for all his descendants, establishing the need for Christ’s obedience.
    - Connects the federal headship of Adam to the parallel headship of Christ in Romans 5.
    - Emphasizes that this structure undergirds the biblical teaching on **original sin** and salvation.
    "Paul’s argument in Romans 5 depends on Adam’s role as the representative of all people." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

3. **Compatibility with Science**
    - Engages with scientific findings while upholding the theological necessity of Adam’s historicity.
    - Argues that belief in a historical Adam is not incompatible with mainstream science if properly nuanced.
    - Suggests that Adam could be the head of a larger population, but must be a real individual.
    - Encourages careful reading of both Scripture and scientific data to avoid false dichotomies.
    "We must not let current scientific models dictate our reading of the biblical text, but neither should we ignore what science can tell us." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

4. **Literary and Theological Reading of Genesis**
    - Advocates for a reading of Genesis that respects its literary artistry and theological intent.
    - Warns against both hyper-literalism and reductionist symbolism.
    - Sees the narrative as communicating real events through sophisticated literary means.
    - Argues that the genre of Genesis 1–4 supports, rather than undermines, Adam’s historicity.
    "Genesis is history told with literary skill, not myth or mere allegory." ("Genesis 1–4")

5. **Pauline Theology and Adam**
    - Stresses that Paul’s theology, especially in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15, requires a historical Adam.
    - Notes that Paul’s parallel between Adam and Christ is foundational for understanding **justification** and **resurrection**.
    - Argues that undermining Adam’s historicity destabilizes the gospel’s logic.
    - Maintains that the **Reformed doctrine of imputation** depends on Adam’s federal role.
    "Without a real Adam, Paul’s teaching about Christ as the second Adam loses its force." ("Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?")

## Legacy and Impact

Jack Collins has played a significant role in contemporary debates over the **historicity of Adam**, especially within evangelical and Reformed circles. His careful engagement with both **biblical exegesis** and scientific discourse has provided a model for integrating faith and scholarship. Collins’s work continues to shape discussions on **original sin**, **federal headship**, and the relationship between Scripture and science, making him a key voice in modern systematic theology.
