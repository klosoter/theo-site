# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale strongly affirms the **historicity of Adam** and his role as **federal head** of humanity, grounding these convictions in a robust **biblical-theological** approach. Beale contends that the New Testament, especially **Pauline theology**, presupposes a real, historical Adam whose actions have direct implications for **original sin** and **redemptive history**.

- "Paul’s argument in Romans 5:12–21 depends on the parallel between Adam and Christ, which only makes sense if Adam was a historical individual." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New
- The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism
- Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (co-edited with D.A. Carson)
- “The Historical Adam: Genesis 1–2 as the Foundation for New Testament Anthropology” (essay in Four Views on the Historical Adam)
- The Temple and the Church’s Mission

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Historicity is Essential for Biblical Theology**
   - Asserts that the narrative of Adam in Genesis is intended as historical, not mythological.
   - Argues that both Old and New Testament writers treat Adam as a real person.
   - Maintains that denying Adam’s historicity undermines the coherence of **redemptive history**.
   - Links Adam’s historicity to the reliability of **Scripture**.
   - "If Adam is not historical, then the foundation for Paul’s argument about sin and salvation collapses." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
   - Adam functions as the representative head of all humanity in the covenant of creation.
   - Adam’s disobedience brings **condemnation** and **death** to his descendants.
   - The parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 is central.
   - Federal headship is necessary for understanding **imputed righteousness** in Christ.
   - "The parallelism between Adam and Christ is not merely literary but covenantal and representative." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

3. **Pauline Theology Requires a Historical Adam**
   - Paul’s arguments in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 presuppose Adam’s existence.
   - The structure of Paul’s soteriology depends on the Adam-Christ typology.
   - Denial of a historical Adam leads to incoherence in Paul’s doctrine of **original sin**.
   - Adam’s role is foundational for understanding the universality of sin and death.
   - "Paul’s entire argument about justification and resurrection hinges on the reality of Adam’s fall." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

4. **Scriptural Inerrancy and Adam**
   - Upholds the **inerrancy** of Scripture, including the early chapters of Genesis.
   - Critiques attempts to harmonize evolutionary theory with a non-historical Adam.
   - Argues that Jesus and the apostles affirm Adam’s historicity.
   - Sees the erosion of Adam’s historicity as part of a broader challenge to biblical authority.
   - "To deny Adam’s historicity is to undermine the trustworthiness of the biblical witness as a whole." (The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism)

5. **Typology and the Adam-Christ Parallel**
   - Emphasizes the typological relationship between Adam and Christ as central to biblical theology.
   - Adam prefigures Christ, the true and faithful representative.
   - The fulfillment of Adam’s failed commission is seen in Christ’s obedience and resurrection.
   - Typology depends on the reality of both Adam and Christ as historical figures.
   - "The typology of Adam and Christ is grounded in historical reality, not mere literary analogy." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed and evangelical discussions on **biblical anthropology** and **hermeneutics**. His work has reinforced the necessity of a historical Adam for coherent **Pauline theology** and the doctrine of **original sin**. Beale’s biblical-theological method continues to influence debates on the relationship between science, Scripture, and the origins of humanity.
