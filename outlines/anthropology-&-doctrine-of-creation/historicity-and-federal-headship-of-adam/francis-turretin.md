# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin vigorously defended the **historicity of Adam** and his role as the **federal head** of humanity, grounding these doctrines in the **literal interpretation of Genesis** and the **covenant of works**. He argued that Adam’s real existence and representative function are essential for understanding **original sin**, **imputation**, and the structure of **redemptive history**. Turretin’s scholastic precision shaped later **Reformed orthodoxy** on the unity of the human race in Adam.

- "If Adam did not exist as a real person, the whole doctrine of original sin and the imputation of his sin to his posterity falls to the ground." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 1, Topics 8–10)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Questions on the Doctrine of Sin (in Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Historicity is Essential**
    - Adam was a real, historical individual created by God.
    - The narrative of Genesis is to be read as literal history, not myth or allegory.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the doctrine of **original sin**.
    - The unity of the human race depends on Adam’s real existence.
    - "The history of Adam is not a fable, but a true account of the origin of mankind." (Institutes, 5.9.2)

2. **Federal Headship and Covenant of Works**
    - Adam acted as the **federal representative** of all humanity in the covenant of works.
    - His obedience or disobedience had consequences for all his descendants.
    - The imputation of Adam’s sin is grounded in this federal relationship.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ (the second Adam) is foundational for **Reformed soteriology**.
    - "Adam was constituted the head and root of the whole human race by the covenant of works." (Institutes, 9.7.1)

3. **Imputation of Sin**
    - Adam’s first transgression is imputed to all his posterity.
    - This imputation is legal and covenantal, not merely natural or hereditary.
    - The doctrine preserves the justice of God in condemning all men for Adam’s sin.
    - It provides the basis for understanding the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - "The sin of Adam is imputed to us because he was our federal head." (Institutes, 9.9.6)

4. **Literal Interpretation of Genesis**
    - The creation and fall narratives are historical events.
    - Allegorical or figurative readings undermine core doctrines.
    - The genealogies and chronology of Genesis support Adam’s historicity.
    - The New Testament’s use of Adam presupposes his real existence.
    - "The literal sense is to be retained unless necessity compels otherwise." (Institutes, 5.9.3)

5. **Unity of the Human Race**
    - All humans descend from Adam, ensuring the unity of the species.
    - This unity is theological (in sin and redemption) and biological.
    - The universality of sin and salvation depends on this unity.
    - The doctrine opposes polygenism and any denial of a single human origin.
    - "The whole human race is one in Adam, both in nature and in guilt." (Institutes, 9.8.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** became a cornerstone of later **Reformed confessional theology**. His arguments shaped the Westminster Standards and provided a bulwark against Enlightenment skepticism and later evolutionary challenges. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary debates over **original sin**, **imputation**, and the interpretation of Genesis within the Reformed tradition.
