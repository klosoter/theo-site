# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas affirmed the **historicity of Adam** as the first human and the **federal head** of the human race, grounding his views in a literal reading of **Genesis** and the doctrine of **original sin**. For Aquinas, Adam’s sin is transmitted to all humanity, not merely by imitation but by a real participation in his guilt, due to the unity of the human race in Adam as its **representative head**.

- "By the sin of the first parent, all men are infected in respect of their first origin." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.81, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, Questions 81–83
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 52–55
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book II, Distinction 31
- De Malo, Question 4
- On the Truth of the Catholic Faith (Summa Contra Gentiles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as the First Historical Human**
    - Adam is a real, individual person created by God.
    - The narrative of Genesis is interpreted as a true account of human origins.
    - Adam’s creation marks the beginning of the human race.
    - The unity of the human species is traced back to Adam.
    - "It is plain that the first man is the principle of the whole human race." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.94, a.4)

2. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam acts as the representative of all humanity before God.
    - His actions have consequences for all his descendants.
    - The transmission of original sin is rooted in Adam’s headship.
    - The unity of the will in Adam and his posterity grounds this federal relationship.
    - "By the will of the first parent, all men are said to have sinned in him." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.81, a.1)

3. **Transmission of Original Sin**
    - Original sin is passed on through human generation, not imitation.
    - The soul receives original sin at the moment of its infusion into the body.
    - All humans are born with original sin due to descent from Adam.
    - The guilt of original sin is a privation of original justice.
    - "Original sin is transmitted by the act of generation, because by that act the nature is transmitted." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.81, a.1)

4. **Literal-Historical Reading of Genesis**
    - The Genesis account is taken as a historical narrative.
    - Adam and Eve are treated as real, historical individuals.
    - The events of the Fall are understood as actual occurrences.
    - The doctrine of original sin depends on the historicity of Adam.
    - "The formation of the first man’s body is related as a fact." (Summa Theologiae I, Q.91, a.2)

5. **Unity of the Human Race in Adam**
    - All humans share a common nature derived from Adam.
    - The unity of the species is both biological and spiritual.
    - The effects of Adam’s sin are universal due to this unity.
    - Redemption in Christ is paralleled to the fall in Adam.
    - "The multitude of men are as one man in Adam." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q.81, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust affirmation of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** shaped subsequent Catholic and broader Christian theology, especially in the doctrine of **original sin**. His synthesis of biblical exegesis and philosophical anthropology provided a foundation for later discussions on human nature and sin. Aquinas’s influence persists in both Roman Catholic magisterial teaching and ecumenical dialogues on the relationship between Adam, sin, and redemption. His careful articulation of Adam’s role as the representative head remains a touchstone for debates on the unity and fallenness of humanity.
