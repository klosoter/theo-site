# N.T. Wright (1948–)

N.T. Wright approaches the **historicity of Adam** and **federal headship** within the broader narrative of **Scripture**, emphasizing Adam as both a real figure and a representative of humanity’s vocation and failure. He situates Adam within the **Second Temple Jewish context**, arguing that Paul’s use of Adam in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 is less about individual imputation and more about the **corporate identity** and **vocation** of humanity, ultimately fulfilled in Christ as the true representative.

- "Paul is not simply talking about Adam as the first human being, but about Adam as the archetypal representative of humanity as a whole." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

## Key Works

- Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- Surprised by Scripture (2014)
- The Day the Revolution Began (2016)
- Romans (New Interpreter’s Bible Commentary, 2002)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Historical and Archetypal Figure**
   - Affirms Adam’s existence as a real figure within the biblical narrative.
   - Emphasizes Adam’s role as a representative or archetype of humanity.
   - Reads Genesis in light of ancient Jewish understandings, not modern literalism.
   - Sees Adam’s story as foundational for understanding human vocation and failure.
   - "Adam is both a real figure and a representative one, standing for all humanity." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

2. **Federal Headship Reframed as Corporate Vocation**
   - Interprets Paul’s federal language as emphasizing humanity’s collective calling.
   - Argues that Adam’s failure is the failure of the human vocation to bear God’s image.
   - Christ is the faithful Israelite and true human who succeeds where Adam failed.
   - Rejects a simplistic doctrine of imputed guilt in favor of narrative participation.
   - "Paul’s concern is not with abstract guilt but with the vocation of humanity in God’s world." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

3. **Second Temple Jewish Context**
   - Reads Paul’s Adam-Christ typology through Jewish apocalyptic and covenantal lenses.
   - Highlights the importance of Jewish readings of Genesis for understanding Paul.
   - Argues that Paul’s Adam is shaped by Jewish debates about Israel and the nations.
   - Sees Adam as a cipher for Israel’s story and humanity’s destiny.
   - "Paul’s rereading of Adam is deeply rooted in the Jewish scriptures and their hopes." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

4. **Christ as the True Adam**
   - Christ is the fulfillment of the human vocation originally given to Adam.
   - Jesus’ obedience and resurrection inaugurate the new humanity.
   - The Adam-Christ parallel is central to Paul’s soteriology and eschatology.
   - Christ’s faithfulness undoes Adam’s failure and opens the way for restored humanity.
   - "Jesus is the one in whom the purposes of God for Adam and for Israel are finally accomplished." (The Day the Revolution Began)

5. **Narrative and Covenantal Reading of Scripture**
   - Prioritizes the overarching biblical narrative over systematic categories.
   - Sees Adam’s story as the beginning of the covenantal drama fulfilled in Christ.
   - Emphasizes the continuity between creation, Israel, and new creation.
   - Argues that federal headship is best understood within the story of God’s covenant.
   - "The story of Adam and Christ is the story of God’s covenant purposes for the world." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

## Legacy and Impact

N.T. Wright’s approach to the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** has significantly influenced contemporary Pauline studies, especially in the context of the **New Perspective on Paul**. His emphasis on narrative, vocation, and the Second Temple Jewish context has challenged traditional Reformed readings and sparked ongoing debate about the nature of Adam’s role in salvation history. Wright’s work continues to shape discussions on biblical anthropology, covenant theology, and the relationship between **creation and redemption**.
