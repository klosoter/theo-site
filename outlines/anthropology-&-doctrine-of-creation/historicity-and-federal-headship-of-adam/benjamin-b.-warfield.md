# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield staunchly defended the **historicity of Adam** and the doctrine of **federal headship** as essential to **Reformed theology** and the integrity of **biblical revelation**. He argued that Adam’s real existence and representative role are foundational for understanding **original sin**, **imputation**, and the work of **Christ as the second Adam**.

- "If there was no first man, Adam, who fell, there is no second man, Christ, to save." (Biblical Doctrines)

## Key Works

- "On the Antiquity and the Unity of the Human Race" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Divine Origin of the Bible" (in The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)
- "The New Testament Doctrine of the Christ" (in Biblical Doctrines)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam is presented in Scripture as a real, historical individual, not a myth or symbol.
    - The genealogies of both Old and New Testaments treat Adam as the first man.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the trustworthiness of **biblical revelation**.
    - The narrative of the Fall in Genesis is foundational for Christian doctrine.
    - "The whole doctrine of Scripture hangs together with the historicity of Adam." (Biblical Doctrines)

2. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the **covenantal representative** for all humanity.
    - His sin is imputed to his descendants by virtue of this federal relationship.
    - This headship is the basis for understanding **original sin** and human depravity.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ in Romans 5 is central to Warfield’s argument.
    - "In Adam’s fall, all sinned because he stood as the federal head of the race." (Biblical Doctrines)

3. **Imputation and Original Sin**
    - The guilt of Adam’s first sin is imputed to all his posterity.
    - This imputation is not merely by natural descent, but by divine appointment.
    - Warfield defends the **Augustinian** and **Reformed** understanding of original sin.
    - The doctrine safeguards the necessity of redemption in Christ.
    - "Original sin is not merely inherited corruption, but imputed guilt." (Biblical Doctrines)

4. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - The work of Christ is intelligible only in light of Adam’s federal headship.
    - Christ’s obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers as Adam’s sin was imputed to all.
    - The parallelism in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 is essential for Warfield’s soteriology.
    - Denying Adam’s headship undermines the gospel’s coherence.
    - "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive." (Biblical Doctrines)

5. **Scriptural Authority and Hermeneutics**
    - Warfield insists on the **inerrancy** and **authority of Scripture** in matters of history and doctrine.
    - He critiques attempts to allegorize or mythologize Genesis 1–3.
    - The New Testament’s use of Adam presupposes his historicity.
    - Sound exegesis requires affirming the plain sense of the biblical text regarding Adam.
    - "The authority of the Bible is bound up with its historical affirmations." (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** shaped twentieth-century **Reformed orthodoxy** and remains influential in debates over **theological anthropology** and **biblical authority**. His arguments continue to be cited by conservative theologians confronting challenges from evolutionary theory and higher criticism. Warfield’s synthesis of **biblical exegesis** and **systematic theology** set a standard for evangelical scholarship on Adam and original sin.
