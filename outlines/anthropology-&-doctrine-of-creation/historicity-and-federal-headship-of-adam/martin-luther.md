# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **historicity of Adam** as the first human and the **federal head** of the human race, grounding his views in a literal reading of **Genesis** and the Pauline doctrine of **original sin**. He maintained that Adam’s fall brought **universal sin and death** to all his descendants, making Adam’s role foundational for understanding **human depravity** and the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.

- "We are all born as children of wrath on account of the sin of Adam." (Lectures on Romans)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- Lectures on Romans
- Commentary on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- Large Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as a Historical Person**
    - Adam is presented in Scripture as a real, individual human being.
    - The events of Genesis are to be read as literal history, not allegory.
    - The genealogies of Scripture confirm Adam’s historicity.
    - Denial of Adam’s historicity undermines the doctrine of sin and salvation.
    - "If we do not maintain that Adam has fallen, what, then, is the work of Christ, the promised Seed?" (Lectures on Genesis)

2. **Federal Headship and Original Sin**
    - Adam acted as the representative head of all humanity.
    - Through Adam’s disobedience, sin and guilt were transmitted to all his descendants.
    - Original sin is not merely imitation but an inherited corruption.
    - The universality of sin is explained by Adam’s federal role.
    - "Through one man’s sin, all became sinners and subject to death." (Lectures on Romans)

3. **Literal Interpretation of Genesis**
    - The creation and fall narratives are historical accounts.
    - Allegorical readings are rejected as undermining biblical authority.
    - The reality of Adam’s actions is essential for understanding redemption.
    - The historicity of Adam is foundational for Christian doctrine.
    - "Moses spoke in the literal sense, not allegorically or figuratively." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - Christ’s redemptive work is contrasted with Adam’s transgression.
    - Just as Adam’s act brought condemnation, Christ’s obedience brings justification.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Pauline theology.
    - The necessity of Christ’s work is rooted in Adam’s historical fall.
    - "As in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive." (Commentary on Galatians)

5. **Transmission of Sin and Guilt**
    - Sin and guilt are transmitted by natural generation from Adam.
    - Human nature is fundamentally corrupted due to Adam’s fall.
    - Baptism is necessary to address the inherited guilt from Adam.
    - The bondage of the will is a direct result of Adam’s sin.
    - "We are all conceived and born in sin, which we have inherited from Adam." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **historicity and federal headship of Adam** shaped Protestant views on **original sin** and the necessity of **redemption in Christ**. His insistence on a literal reading of Genesis influenced later Reformed and Lutheran confessions. Luther’s theology provided a foundation for subsequent debates on human nature, sin, and the relationship between Adam and Christ, ensuring the enduring relevance of these doctrines in systematic theology.
