# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Covenant of Grace** not as a historical or theological construct in the traditional Reformed sense, but through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. For Bultmann, the biblical covenants—including the so-called Covenant of Grace—are best understood as existential encounters in which the individual is called to authentic faith in response to the **kerygma** of Christ, rather than as objective, redemptive-historical arrangements.

- "The Old Testament covenant is not a legal relationship but a personal encounter between God and man." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Covenant Language**
    - Interprets biblical covenants as mythological expressions requiring existential reinterpretation.
    - Rejects literal or historical readings of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Sees covenant motifs as vehicles for the proclamation of the **kerygma**.
    - Emphasizes the need to translate covenant concepts into existential terms for modern hearers.
    - "What matters is not the mythological conception of the covenant, but the existential decision to trust in God's word." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter over Legal Framework**
    - Views the covenant as a call to personal decision, not a legal or forensic arrangement.
    - Stresses the individual's response to God's self-revelation in Christ.
    - Downplays the continuity of redemptive history in favor of present existential encounter.
    - Frames grace as the event of faith, not as a covenantal structure.
    - "Faith is not assent to doctrines but the existential acceptance of God's claim." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant**
    - Interprets Christ as the decisive event in which God's promise is realized.
    - Rejects typological or dispensational readings of Old Testament covenants.
    - Sees the **kerygma** of Christ as the true content of the covenant promise.
    - Emphasizes the present reality of salvation over historical covenants.
    - "The Christ-event is the eschatological fulfillment, rendering all previous covenants obsolete." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Objective Redemptive-Historical Schemes**
    - Critiques traditional Reformed frameworks of **Covenant of Grace** as outdated.
    - Argues that salvation history is a mythological construct.
    - Prioritizes existential interpretation over historical continuity.
    - Sees the meaning of covenant in the individual's encounter with the gospel.
    - "The history of salvation is not a sequence of divine acts but the proclamation that confronts us now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Faith as Existential Response to Grace**
    - Defines grace as the call to authentic existence before God.
    - Sees faith as the only appropriate response to the divine initiative.
    - Rejects any notion of inherited or communal covenant status.
    - Emphasizes personal responsibility and decision in the face of God's word.
    - "Grace is the event in which man is called out of himself to authentic existence." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of the **Covenant of Grace** profoundly challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran covenant theology, shifting the focus from objective, historical covenants to the individual's existential encounter with the **kerygma**. His approach influenced generations of New Testament scholars and theologians, especially in the realm of **hermeneutics** and the demythologization movement. While often criticized by confessional traditions, Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between history, faith, and theological interpretation.
