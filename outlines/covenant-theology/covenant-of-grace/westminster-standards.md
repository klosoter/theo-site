# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate the **Covenant of Grace** as the central framework for understanding God's redemptive dealings with humanity after the Fall. They emphasize the unity of **redemptive history**, the necessity of **faith in Christ**, and the administration of the covenant through **means of grace** in both the Old and New Testaments.

- "Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, especially chapters 7, 8, and 14
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 30–36
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 20–23
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace as God's Remedy for the Fall**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is established in response to Adam's breach of the **Covenant of Works**.
    - It is initiated solely by God's mercy and not by human merit.
    - The covenant offers salvation through **Jesus Christ**, the only Mediator.
    - It is the only means by which sinners can be reconciled to God.
    - "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works... Man by his fall... the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.2–3)

2. **Unity and Diversity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **substance** of the covenant remains the same throughout redemptive history.
    - The **administrations** differ: under the law (Old Testament) and under the gospel (New Testament).
    - Both administrations offer Christ and require faith, though with different outward forms.
    - The Old Testament administration was preparatory and typological; the New is fuller and clearer.
    - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

3. **Christ as Mediator and Head of the Covenant**
    - Christ is appointed by the Father as the only Mediator of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - He fulfills all the conditions and secures all the promises of the covenant.
    - His obedience and sacrifice are the basis for covenant blessings.
    - Union with Christ is essential for participation in the covenant.
    - "The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice... hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father, and purchased... an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven." (WCF 8.5)

4. **Means of Grace and Covenant Administration**
    - The covenant is administered by the **Word**, **sacraments**, and **prayer**.
    - These means are effectual for the elect by the Spirit's work.
    - Baptism and the Lord's Supper are signs and seals of the covenant.
    - The visible church is the covenant community where these means are dispensed.
    - "This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel." (WCF 7.5)

5. **Faith as the Instrument of Covenant Participation**
    - Faith in Christ is the only instrument by which covenant blessings are received.
    - Faith itself is a gift of God, wrought by the Spirit through the means of grace.
    - The covenant promises are offered freely to all who hear the gospel.
    - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in God's faithfulness to the covenant.
    - "The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts." (WCF 14.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, providing a systematic and confessional articulation of the **Covenant of Grace** that remains foundational for Presbyterian and many Reformed churches worldwide. Their careful distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace** has influenced subsequent theological reflection and debate. The Standards' emphasis on Christ as Mediator and the unity of redemptive history continues to inform preaching, sacramental practice, and ecclesiology in the Reformed tradition.
