# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a prominent Reformed theologian who has emphasized the centrality of the **Covenant of Grace** in the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He situates the Covenant of Grace within the broader framework of **biblical theology**, highlighting its fulfillment in the person and work of **Christ** and its inseparability from the **ordo salutis** and the **history of salvation**. Gaffin’s approach underscores the unity of God’s saving purposes from **Genesis to Revelation**.

- "The history of redemption is the history of the outworking of the covenant of grace." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Covenant of Works: Its Confessional and Biblical Status" (in The Law is Not of Faith)
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - The Covenant of Grace structures the entire **history of redemption**.
    - It is progressively revealed from **Genesis 3:15** to its consummation in Christ.
    - All biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) are administrations of the one Covenant of Grace.
    - The unity of the covenant underscores the continuity of God’s saving purpose.
    - "The covenant of grace is the backbone of the history of redemption." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - The Covenant of Grace finds its fulfillment in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the mediator and the substance of the covenant.
    - The benefits of the covenant are applied through union with Christ.
    - The resurrection of Christ is central to the realization of covenant promises.
    - "All the blessings of the covenant are found in union with the resurrected Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Integration of Ordo Salutis and Historia Salutis**
    - Gaffin insists on the inseparability of the **order of salvation** and the **history of salvation**.
    - The application of redemption (ordo salutis) is grounded in the accomplishment of redemption (historia salutis).
    - The Covenant of Grace bridges individual salvation and redemptive history.
    - This integration guards against individualistic or purely historical readings of Scripture.
    - "The ordo salutis is rooted in and flows out of the historia salutis." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Covenant Administration**
    - There is fundamental continuity between Old and New Testament administrations of the Covenant of Grace.
    - Discontinuity is found in the newness and finality of Christ’s work.
    - The substance of the covenant remains the same, though its form changes.
    - The New Covenant is not a break but the climactic realization of the Covenant of Grace.
    - "The newness of the new covenant is the eschatological fulfillment of the one covenant of grace." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards)

5. **Covenant and the Means of Grace**
    - The means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer) are covenantal in nature.
    - Participation in the covenant community is essential for receiving covenant blessings.
    - The sacraments signify and seal the benefits of the Covenant of Grace.
    - The Spirit’s work is covenantally mediated to the people of God.
    - "The means of grace are the divinely appointed instruments for the communication of covenant blessings." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in articulating the unity of the **Covenant of Grace** across redemptive history. His insistence on the integration of **ordo salutis** and **historia salutis** has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly at Westminster Theological Seminary. Gaffin’s Christ-centered approach to covenant theology continues to inform debates on continuity and discontinuity within the Reformed tradition.
