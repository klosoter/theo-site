# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not affirm the traditional **Covenant of Grace** as articulated in Reformed theology, but he engaged deeply with the biblical and theological motifs of **covenant**, **revelation**, and the **relationship between God and humanity**. Tillich reinterpreted covenantal language through his existential and ontological framework, emphasizing the **New Being in Christ** and the dynamics of **divine-human encounter** over legal or historical covenants.

- "The relation of God to man is not a legal one but a relation of grace, of creative and saving power." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Protestant Era
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- Dynamics of Faith

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic of Divine-Human Encounter**
    - Tillich views covenant language as a symbol pointing to the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - He rejects a literal or juridical understanding of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - The covenant is reinterpreted as the event of **revelation** and acceptance of **New Being**.
    - Emphasis is placed on the transformative encounter rather than on historical covenants.
    - "The biblical concept of covenant expresses the existential relationship between God and man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Grace as Unconditional Acceptance**
    - Grace is not mediated through a covenantal structure but is the unconditional acceptance of the estranged by God.
    - The focus is on the **healing power of grace** rather than on covenantal promises or stipulations.
    - Tillich sees grace as the ground of reconciliation and the overcoming of estrangement.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is subsumed under the broader existential reality of grace.
    - "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

3. **Christ as the Bearer of the New Being**
    - Christ is not the mediator of a covenant in the legal sense but the manifestation of **New Being**.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted existentially as the event in which separation is overcome.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is fulfilled in the existential transformation brought by Christ.
    - The historical covenants are seen as symbols pointing to the ultimate event in Christ.
    - "In him the New Being appeared, and through him the power of the New Being is present." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Revelation as Event, Not Contract**
    - Revelation is understood as an existential event, not as the delivery of covenantal terms.
    - The **Word of God** is the self-disclosure of God, not a legal document.
    - The covenant is a symbol for the personal and communal encounter with the divine.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is reinterpreted as the ongoing event of revelation.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for the sake of the ultimate concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Universal Scope of Divine Grace**
    - Tillich emphasizes the universality of grace, transcending particular covenants or peoples.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is not restricted to a specific group but is open to all in existential estrangement.
    - The church is the community of the New Being, not the exclusive recipient of covenantal promises.
    - The universality of grace challenges the exclusivity of traditional covenant theology.
    - "The New Being is universally present where the old being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of the **Covenant of Grace** challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran categories by shifting the focus from historical covenants to existential encounter and **New Being**. His approach influenced 20th-century theology by emphasizing the symbolic and existential dimensions of biblical concepts. While his views diverged sharply from confessional Reformed theology, Tillich’s existential analysis of grace and covenant continues to provoke discussion on the meaning of **revelation** and the nature of the divine-human relationship.
