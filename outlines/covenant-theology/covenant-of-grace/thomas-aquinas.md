# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not explicitly formulate a **Covenant of Grace** as later Reformed theology would, but his doctrine of salvation centers on the gracious initiative of God in **redemption** through Christ. Aquinas emphasizes the necessity of **divine grace** for human salvation, the mediation of Christ, and the unfolding of salvation history, which later theologians would interpret in covenantal terms. His understanding of the **Old and New Law** provides a framework for understanding how God relates to humanity through promise and fulfillment.

- "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 106–114 (on Law and Grace)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (on salvation and the Incarnation)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III (on sacraments and grace)
- Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy and Daniel A. Keating)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Grace as the Principle of Salvation**
   - Salvation is initiated and sustained by **divine grace**, not human merit.
   - Grace is both **habitual** (sanctifying) and **actual** (assisting) in the soul.
   - Human cooperation with grace is necessary but always subordinate to God's action.
   - The **Incarnation** is the supreme manifestation of grace.
   - "No one can be saved without the help of divine grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 109, a. 5)

2. **Christ as Mediator**
   - Christ alone mediates between God and humanity, fulfilling the promises of the Old Law.
   - The **sacraments** are channels of Christ’s grace to the faithful.
   - The New Law is realized in Christ and communicated through the Spirit.
   - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are the basis for the possibility of salvation.
   - "Christ is the one and perfect mediator of God and men." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 26, a. 1)

3. **Unity of Salvation History**
   - The Old and New Law are stages in the unfolding of God’s saving plan.
   - The Old Law prefigures and prepares for the New Law, which brings fulfillment.
   - Both covenants are oriented toward the same end: union with God.
   - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers.
   - "The Old Law was a preparation for the coming of Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

4. **Necessity of Faith**
   - Faith is the foundational response to God’s self-revelation.
   - Justification requires assent to revealed truth, especially in Christ.
   - Faith is perfected by charity, which is the form of all virtues.
   - The content of faith is more fully revealed in the New Covenant.
   - "Faith is the first requirement for justification." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 113, a. 4)

5. **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
   - The sacraments are instituted by Christ as effective signs of grace.
   - They communicate the benefits of Christ’s mediation to believers.
   - Baptism and the Eucharist are especially central in the New Law.
   - The sacraments are necessary for salvation in the ordinary course.
   - "The sacraments of the New Law are necessary for salvation." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 61, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology provided the **scholastic foundation** for later discussions of grace, law, and salvation, shaping both Catholic and Protestant thought. While he did not articulate a **Covenant of Grace** in the Reformed sense, his synthesis of **grace**, **law**, and **Christ’s mediation** influenced the development of covenantal frameworks in early modern theology. His careful distinction between the Old and New Law, and his emphasis on the necessity of grace, remain central to Christian soteriology. Aquinas’s work continues to be a touchstone for ecumenical dialogue on the nature of salvation and the continuity of God’s redemptive plan.
