# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **Covenant of Grace** within his broader project of grounding theology in **religious experience** rather than in traditional federal or forensic categories. He saw the covenant not as a legal arrangement but as the unfolding of **God-consciousness** in the community of faith, realized supremely in Christ and mediated through the **church**. Schleiermacher thus shifted the focus from external covenants to the internal, communal life of **redemption**.

- "The Redeemer is the one in whom the God-consciousness has become actual and whose influence awakens the same consciousness in others." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Religious Consciousness**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is not a legal pact but the realization of God-consciousness in humanity.
    - Emphasizes the inward, experiential dimension over external arrangements.
    - The covenant is actualized in the communal life of the church.
    - Christ is the archetype and mediator of this consciousness.
    - "The essence of piety is neither a knowing nor a doing but a modification of feeling, or of immediate self-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Christ as the Mediator of Redemption**
    - Christ embodies the perfect God-consciousness, inaugurating the new covenant.
    - Redemption is participation in Christ’s consciousness, not a forensic transaction.
    - The church is the sphere where this mediation is realized.
    - The covenant is thus personal and communal, not merely historical or legal.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the Redeemer’s God-consciousness to the community." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Church as the Covenant Community**
    - The church is the historical manifestation of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - It is the community where God-consciousness is nurtured and shared.
    - The sacraments are signs of the ongoing covenantal relationship.
    - The church’s unity is grounded in shared experience, not in external law.
    - "The church is the fellowship in which the divine life is communicated and preserved." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Rejection of Forensic Covenant Theology**
    - Schleiermacher rejects the legalistic and federal frameworks of traditional Reformed theology.
    - He critiques the division between **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** as artificial.
    - The focus is on the living relationship, not on legal stipulations.
    - The covenant is dynamic, realized in the ongoing life of faith.
    - "The distinction between the covenants is not essential for the understanding of redemption." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Redemption as Ongoing Divine-Human Relationship**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is an ongoing process, not a completed past event.
    - Redemption unfolds as believers grow in God-consciousness.
    - The relationship is transformative, shaping both individuals and the community.
    - The covenant is thus existential and experiential, not merely doctrinal.
    - "The process of redemption is the progressive development of the divine life in humanity." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reconfiguration of the **Covenant of Grace** profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, shifting the focus from external, legal categories to the **inner life of faith** and communal experience. His approach paved the way for later liberal and existential theologies, challenging traditional Reformed covenantal frameworks. While often criticized by confessional theologians, his emphasis on experience and community remains a significant reference point in contemporary discussions of covenant and redemption.
