# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton articulates the **Covenant of Grace** as the unifying thread of **redemptive history**, emphasizing God's unilateral initiative in salvation through Christ. He situates the **Covenant of Grace** within a robust **Reformed covenant theology**, distinguishing it from the **Covenant of Works** and highlighting its Christocentric fulfillment and ecclesial implications.

- "The covenant of grace is not a contract between equals but a sovereign administration of grace by God to sinners." (God of Promise)

## Key Works

- God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology
- Introducing Covenant Theology (audio and print resources)
- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Unity**
    - Views the **Covenant of Grace** as the overarching structure of God's dealings with humanity after the Fall.
    - Stresses continuity between Old and New Testaments under the one covenant, with different administrations.
    - Emphasizes that all of Scripture points to Christ as the mediator of the covenant.
    - Argues that the covenant is fundamentally about God's promise, not human achievement.
    - "The unity of the covenant of grace is found in Christ, who is its substance in every administration." (God of Promise)

2. **Distinction from the Covenant of Works**
    - Maintains a clear distinction between the **Covenant of Works** (pre-Fall) and the **Covenant of Grace** (post-Fall).
    - The **Covenant of Works** is based on Adam's obedience, while the **Covenant of Grace** is grounded in Christ's obedience.
    - This distinction safeguards the gratuitous nature of salvation.
    - The law/gospel distinction is rooted in these two covenants.
    - "The law says, 'Do this and live'; the gospel says, 'It is done—believe and live.'" (God of Promise)

3. **Christ as Mediator and Fulfillment**
    - Christ is the true and final mediator of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - All previous covenant administrations (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic) point forward to and are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The benefits of the covenant (justification, adoption, sanctification) are received through union with Christ.
    - The sacraments are signs and seals of Christ's work in the covenant.
    - "Jesus Christ is not only the mediator but the very substance of the covenant of grace." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Covenant and Ecclesiology**
    - The church is the visible community of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Both believers and their children are included in the covenant community, reflecting continuity with Abrahamic promises.
    - The means of grace (Word and sacrament) are central to covenant life.
    - The covenant community is marked by both promise and obligation, but the latter is always grounded in grace.
    - "The church is the covenant community, gathered by God's promise and sustained by his means of grace." (God of Promise)

5. **Monergism and Assurance**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is monergistic: God alone initiates and accomplishes salvation.
    - Assurance is grounded in God's promise, not in human performance or subjective experience.
    - Faith is the instrument, not the basis, of receiving covenant blessings.
    - The covenant provides objective grounds for assurance through God's unchanging character.
    - "Our assurance rests not in our faithfulness to the covenant, but in God's faithfulness to his promise." (Pilgrim Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Michael Horton has played a pivotal role in recovering and articulating **Reformed covenant theology** for contemporary audiences, especially within American evangelicalism. His clear distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions on law, gospel, and assurance. Horton's work has helped re-center the church's identity around the objective promises of God in Christ, shaping how many understand the unity of Scripture and the nature of the church as the covenant community.
