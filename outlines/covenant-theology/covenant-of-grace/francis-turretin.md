# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Grace** within the framework of **federal theology**, distinguishing it sharply from the **Covenant of Works**. He emphasized the unity of the Covenant of Grace throughout **redemptive history**, while also recognizing its different administrations before and after Christ. Turretin’s formulation upholds the centrality of **Christ as Mediator** and the necessity of **faith** for participation in the covenant’s benefits.

- "The covenant of grace is that by which God promises freely to the elect, through faith in Christ, salvation and eternal life." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Volume 2, Topics 6–12
- The Doctrine of the Covenants in Reformed Theology (secondary: Geerhardus Vos)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Herman Bavinck, for context and reception)
- The Marrow of Modern Divinity (for historical context and comparison)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The Covenant of Works was made with Adam and required perfect obedience for life.
    - The Covenant of Grace is established after the Fall, promising salvation through Christ.
    - The two covenants differ in their conditions: works versus faith in a mediator.
    - This distinction safeguards the gratuitous nature of salvation.
    - "The covenant of grace differs from the covenant of works not only in degree, but in kind." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

2. **Unity and Diversity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The substance of the Covenant of Grace is the same throughout history.
    - Its administration differs between the Old and New Testaments.
    - Old Testament believers were saved by the same Christ, though under shadows and types.
    - The New Testament brings greater clarity and fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The covenant of grace is one as to substance, though various as to mode of dispensation." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

3. **Christ as Mediator and Surety**
    - Christ is the only mediator of the Covenant of Grace.
    - His obedience and satisfaction are the basis for covenant blessings.
    - Christ’s role as surety guarantees the fulfillment of the covenant promises.
    - All covenant benefits are received through union with Christ.
    - "Christ is the sole mediator and surety of the covenant of grace." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

4. **Necessity and Instrumentality of Faith**
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which believers receive covenant blessings.
    - Faith itself is a gift of grace, not a meritorious work.
    - The covenant demands faith in Christ, not perfect obedience.
    - Assurance and perseverance are grounded in God’s faithfulness, not human effort.
    - "Faith alone is required as the condition of the covenant, not as a work, but as an instrument." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

5. **Gracious Character and Unconditional Promise**
    - The Covenant of Grace is founded on God’s free and sovereign grace.
    - Its promises are unconditional, grounded in God’s election and Christ’s work.
    - Human response is enabled and sustained by the Holy Spirit.
    - The covenant is irrevocable for the elect, ensuring their ultimate salvation.
    - "The covenant of grace is gratuitous and unconditional as to its foundation and efficacy." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s formulation of the **Covenant of Grace** became a touchstone for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping confessional standards and theological education. His careful distinctions and emphasis on the unity of the covenant influenced subsequent theologians such as Herman Witsius and Charles Hodge. Turretin’s work remains foundational for understanding the structure of **Reformed federal theology** and continues to inform contemporary discussions on covenant continuity and assurance.
