# John Ball (1585–1640)

John Ball was a prominent English Puritan theologian whose exposition of the **Covenant of Grace** became foundational for later Reformed covenant theology. He emphasized the unity of **God’s redemptive plan** through the covenants, distinguishing the **Covenant of Works** from the **Covenant of Grace** while stressing the continuity of salvation by faith in Christ across both Old and New Testaments.

- "The Covenant of Grace is that whereby God freely promiseth eternal life unto men, upon condition of believing in Christ." ("A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace")

## Key Works

- A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace (1645, posthumous)
- A Short Catechism (1640)
- The Faithful Shepherd (1642)
- The Power of Godliness (1657, posthumous)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace as God’s Redemptive Framework**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is the means by which God restores fallen humanity.
    - It is distinct from the **Covenant of Works**, which Adam broke.
    - The promise of salvation is grounded in God’s initiative, not human merit.
    - Christ is the mediator and fulfiller of the covenant.
    - "The Covenant of Grace is made with Christ, and in him with all the elect." (Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

2. **Unity of the Covenant Across Testaments**
    - The substance of the **Covenant of Grace** is the same in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Differences are in administration, not in essence.
    - Old Testament believers were saved by faith in the promised Messiah.
    - The New Testament brings greater clarity and fulfillment in Christ.
    - "There is but one Covenant of Grace, though diversely dispensed." (Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

3. **Conditionality and the Role of Faith**
    - The covenant is unconditional in its establishment but conditional in its application.
    - Faith is the means by which individuals receive the covenant promises.
    - Obedience is a fruit of faith, not a ground of acceptance.
    - The covenant calls for a response of trust in Christ.
    - "Faith is required as the condition of the Covenant of Grace." (Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

4. **Christ as Mediator and Surety**
    - Christ fulfills all the requirements of the covenant on behalf of the elect.
    - His obedience and sacrifice secure the blessings of the covenant.
    - The covenant is made with Christ as the representative head.
    - Believers are united to Christ and partake in his benefits.
    - "Christ is the Mediator of the Covenant, and all the promises are made in him." (Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

5. **Practical and Pastoral Application**
    - The doctrine provides assurance and comfort to believers.
    - It grounds the call to repentance and faith in God’s promises.
    - The covenant shapes the life and worship of the church.
    - Pastoral ministry is oriented around the proclamation of the covenant promises.
    - "The Covenant of Grace is the foundation of all our hope and comfort." (Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

John Ball’s articulation of the **Covenant of Grace** significantly influenced later Puritan and Reformed theology, especially in England and New England. His careful distinctions and emphasis on the unity of God’s saving purpose shaped the Westminster Confession and catechisms. Ball’s work remains a touchstone for understanding classic Reformed covenant theology and its pastoral implications.
