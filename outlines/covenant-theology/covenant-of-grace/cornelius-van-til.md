# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Covenant of Grace** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing its role in the unfolding of **redemptive history** and the self-revelation of the **triune God**. He insisted that the **covenant** is not merely a legal arrangement but the very context in which God relates to His people, revealing the unity of **creation, fall, and redemption** under the sovereign plan of God.

- "The covenant idea is basic to all of Reformed theology and to all of Christian life." (The Defense of the Faith)

- Essays in Reformed Dogmatics (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Framework of Revelation**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is the structure through which God reveals Himself to humanity.
    - All of **redemptive history** is covenantal in character, from Genesis to Revelation.
    - The covenant is not an afterthought but central to God's eternal purpose.
    - The **self-attesting Christ of Scripture** is known only within this covenantal context.
    - "God’s relation to man is from the outset a covenantal relation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Continuity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - There is one **Covenant of Grace** throughout both Old and New Testaments.
    - The substance of the covenant remains the same, though its administration changes.
    - Christ is the mediator of the one covenant, uniting all believers across history.
    - The unity of the people of God is grounded in this single covenantal relationship.
    - "The covenant of grace is one in essence throughout the ages." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenant and the Triune God**
    - The covenant reflects the **Trinitarian** nature of God’s self-disclosure.
    - True knowledge of God is always covenantal and personal, not abstract or impersonal.
    - The **ontological Trinity** is the foundation for all covenantal relations.
    - The covenant is the means by which God communicates Himself to His people.
    - "The doctrine of the covenant is intelligible only in terms of the doctrine of the ontological Trinity." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Antithesis and Covenant Membership**
    - The covenant establishes a fundamental **antithesis** between believers and unbelievers.
    - Covenant membership entails ethical and epistemological separation from the world.
    - The **noetic effects of sin** are overcome only within the covenant community.
    - The covenant shapes the Christian’s worldview and apologetic stance.
    - "The antithesis is covenantal in character and is basic to Christian thought." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Covenant and Apologetics**
    - Van Til’s **presuppositional apologetics** is grounded in the reality of the covenant.
    - Only within the covenant can one have true knowledge and proper reasoning.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** provides the epistemological foundation for defending the faith.
    - Apologetics must be conducted from within the covenantal perspective, not from neutral ground.
    - "All reasoning is within the context of the covenant relationship." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s covenantal approach has profoundly shaped **Reformed apologetics** and systematic theology, especially in emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of the **triune God**. His insistence on the covenant as the framework for all theology has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, particularly within the Westminster tradition. The integration of **covenant theology** with presuppositional apologetics remains a hallmark of his enduring legacy.
