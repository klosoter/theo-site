# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer understood the **Covenant of Grace** as a dynamic, Christ-centered reality at the heart of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the covenant’s role in revealing **God’s faithfulness** and the unity of the **Old and New Testaments**, critiquing speculative or overly systematic covenant constructions in favor of a biblical-theological approach.

- "The covenant is not a static concept, but a living reality in which God’s redemptive work is revealed and accomplished." (The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth)

    - Stresses the inseparability of covenant and Christology.
    - Warns against covenant concepts that obscure the centrality of Christ.
    "The covenant is not understandable apart from Christ, who is its fulfillment." (Faith and Justification)

3. **Critique of Covenant Schematization**
    - Questions overly rigid or speculative covenant structures, such as sharp distinctions between **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Prefers biblical-theological approaches over dogmatic systematization.
    - Warns that excessive schematization can distort the biblical witness.
    - Advocates for a covenant theology that remains open to the richness of Scripture.

    - Rejects sharp discontinuities that undermine the continuity of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - Sees the promises to Israel as finding their fulfillment in Christ and the church.

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to the **Covenant of Grace** has significantly influenced Reformed theology by promoting a more biblical-theological and Christ-centered understanding of covenant themes. His critique of rigid covenantal schematization has encouraged renewed attention to the historical and redemptive context of covenant in Scripture. Berkouwer’s work continues to shape discussions on the unity of the **Old and New Testaments** and the centrality of Christ in covenant theology, making his contributions enduringly important for both academic and ecclesial contexts.
