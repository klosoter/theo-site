# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed understanding of the Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing its unity throughout **redemptive history** and its grounding in the work of **Christ as Mediator**. He maintained that the Covenant of Grace is the means by which God applies the benefits of **salvation** to the elect, unfolding progressively from the promise to Adam after the Fall to its fulfillment in the New Testament.

- "The plan of salvation has always been the same. It has always been by grace, through a Redeemer, and through faith." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (especially Vol. 2, chapters on Covenant)
- The Way of Life
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Covenant of Grace is one in substance throughout both Old and New Testaments.
    - The promise of salvation is consistent, though the administration varies across epochs.
    - All the redeemed, from Adam onward, are saved by faith in the promised Redeemer.
    - The differences between dispensations are administrative, not essential.
    - "The plan of salvation has always been the same." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the central figure and fulfiller of the Covenant of Grace.
    - The covenant is established and maintained through Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - All covenant blessings flow from union with Christ.
    - The Old Testament types and sacrifices point forward to Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "The covenant of grace is that arrangement under which Christ, as the second Adam, secures for his people the blessings of salvation." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Gracious Character of the Covenant**
    - The covenant is wholly gracious, not based on human merit or works.
    - God sovereignly initiates and sustains the covenant relationship.
    - Faith is the means by which individuals receive covenant blessings.
    - The law serves to reveal sin and drive sinners to Christ, not as a means of earning favor.
    - "It is a covenant of grace, because all the blessings promised are gratuitous." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
    - The substance of the covenant remains, but its outward forms change over time.
    - Circumcision and Passover give way to Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as covenant signs.
    - The church is one people of God, though its outward organization differs.
    - The New Covenant is the fulfillment, not abolition, of the Old.
    - "The new dispensation is only the old under a new form." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenant and the Elect**
    - The Covenant of Grace is made with Christ as the representative of the elect.
    - Its promises are effectually applied only to those chosen by God.
    - The visible church includes both elect and non-elect, but only the elect receive the covenant’s saving benefits.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in God’s faithfulness to his covenant promises.
    - "The covenant is made with Christ, and in Him with all the elect as his seed." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s formulation of the **Covenant of Grace** became a standard reference in American Presbyterian and Reformed theology, shaping generations of pastors and theologians at Princeton and beyond. His emphasis on the unity of God’s redemptive plan and the centrality of Christ as Mediator reinforced classic Reformed covenantal categories. Hodge’s careful distinctions between substance and administration continue to inform contemporary discussions of covenant theology and ecclesiology.
