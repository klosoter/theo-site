# Peter A. Lillback (1951– )

Peter A. Lillback is a prominent advocate of **Reformed covenant theology**, emphasizing the centrality of the **Covenant of Grace** as the unifying principle of redemption throughout Scripture. He highlights the continuity between the **Old and New Testaments**, arguing that the **Covenant of Grace** is progressively revealed and fulfilled in **Christ**. Lillback’s scholarship particularly explores the historical development and theological significance of covenant concepts within the Reformed tradition.

- "The covenant of grace is the backbone of the Reformed understanding of God’s redemptive dealings with humanity." (The Binding of God)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**

    - Argues that the promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - "The unity of the covenant of grace is the theological thread that binds the whole Bible together." (The Binding of God)

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Covenant**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is revealed in stages, beginning after the Fall.
    - Each biblical covenant (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) unfolds more of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Stresses the organic development of covenant promises.
    - Sees Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of all covenantal types and shadows.
    - "God’s covenantal dealings are progressively revealed, culminating in the person and work of Christ." (The Binding of God)

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Christ is the mediator and substance of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - All covenant promises find their yes and amen in Jesus.
    - The work of Christ secures the blessings promised to Abraham and his seed.
    - The sacraments of the church are signs and seals of this covenant reality.
    - "The covenant of grace finds its fulfillment and center in the person and work of Jesus Christ." (The Binding of God)

4. **Conditional and Unconditional Aspects**

    - God’s promises are graciously given, yet covenant membership entails responsibilities.
    - Faith and obedience are required as the means of receiving covenant blessings.
    - Draws on Calvin and Reformed tradition to balance divine sovereignty and human response.
    - "The covenant of grace is both a gift of God’s mercy and a call to faithful response." ("The Continuing Conundrum")

    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper correspond to circumcision and Passover as covenant rites.
    - Emphasizes the inclusion of believers and their children in the covenant community.
    - Argues for the continuity of covenant administration across redemptive history.

## Legacy and Impact

Lillback’s work has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of the **Covenant of Grace** within Reformed circles, especially through his historical and theological analysis of Calvin and the development of covenant thought. His emphasis on the unity and Christocentric fulfillment of the covenant has reinforced classic Reformed distinctives in academic and ecclesiastical contexts. By clarifying the conditional and unconditional aspects of the covenant, Lillback has contributed to ongoing debates about assurance, perseverance, and the nature of the church. His scholarship continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students committed to confessional Reformed theology.
