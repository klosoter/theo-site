# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—set forth a classic Reformed understanding of the **Covenant of Grace** as the means by which God redeems His elect through Christ. These confessions emphasize the unity of the covenant across both Old and New Testaments, grounding salvation in the gracious promise fulfilled in **Jesus Christ** and received by **faith**.

- "For the sake of Christ’s merits God will never more remember my sins, nor my sinful nature, against which I have to struggle all my life long; but graciously imputes to me the righteousness of Christ, that I may never come into condemnation." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 56)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 16, 22, 34
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 19, 20, 60, 74
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. First and Second Heads of Doctrine
- J. van Genderen & W.H. Velema, Concise Reformed Dogmatics (secondary)
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The covenant is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
   - Both Old and New Testament believers are saved by the same promise in Christ.
   - The covenant is progressively revealed but not essentially changed.
   - The sacraments of both testaments signify and seal the same grace.
   "The gospel was first made known to Adam, and afterwards published by the holy patriarchs and prophets, and represented by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law, and lastly fulfilled by the only begotten Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

2. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
   - Jesus Christ is the only ground and mediator of the covenant.
   - All covenant blessings flow from His atoning work.
   - Faith in Christ is the sole means of covenant participation.
   - The covenant excludes all human merit as a basis for salvation.
   "We believe that we have no access unto God, but alone through the only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous." (Belgic Confession, Art. 26)

3. **Covenant Membership and the Church**
   - The visible church is the covenant community on earth.
   - Children of believers are included in the covenant and receive its sign.
   - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign and seal of the covenant.
   - Covenant membership entails both privileges and responsibilities.
   "Are infants also to be baptized? Yes: for since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant and church of God..." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 74)

4. **Covenant and Justification by Faith**
   - Justification is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.
   - The covenant promise is received, not earned, by the elect.
   - Assurance of salvation is grounded in God’s covenant faithfulness.
   - Good works are the fruit, not the basis, of covenant membership.
   "How are you righteous before God? Only by true faith in Jesus Christ..." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 60)

5. **Perseverance and the Covenant**
   - God preserves His elect in the covenant unto final salvation.
   - The covenant is unbreakable from God’s side, though not all in the visible church are elect.
   - The Canons of Dort stress the certainty of perseverance for true believers.
   - Apostasy is possible for those only outwardly in the covenant.
   "Whom He effectually calls and regenerates... He delivers from the dominion and slavery of sin... so that they may persevere." (Canons of Dort, V.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the covenant theology of Reformed churches, providing a confessional anchor for understanding the **Covenant of Grace** as central to the gospel. Their articulation of the unity of the covenant, Christ’s mediatorship, and the inclusion of believers’ children has influenced both doctrine and practice, especially regarding **baptism** and church membership. Their covenantal framework continues to inform contemporary Reformed theology and catechesis.
