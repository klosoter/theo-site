# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a distinctive Reformed understanding of the **Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing its unity throughout redemptive history while rejecting the traditional division between the **Covenant of Works** and the Covenant of Grace. He argued that the **Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New Covenants** are successive administrations of the one gracious covenant, culminating in Christ. Murray’s approach sought to ground covenant theology more explicitly in **biblical exegesis** rather than in speculative or scholastic frameworks.

- "The covenant of grace is nothing less than the administration of the covenant of redemption in history." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

    - Rejects sharp discontinuities between Old and New Testament administrations.
    - Emphasizes the progressive revelation of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - Sees Christ as the center and fulfillment of the covenant.
    - "There is but one covenant of grace, progressively revealed and administered." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Rejection of the Traditional Covenant of Works/Grace Dichotomy**
    - Critiques the notion of a prelapsarian **Covenant of Works** as lacking explicit biblical warrant.
    - Argues that the biblical covenants are always gracious in character.
    - Maintains that obedience and promise are not mutually exclusive in God’s covenants.
    - Sees the Mosaic administration as gracious, not legalistic.
    - "The sharp contrast between a covenant of works and a covenant of grace is not sustained by the biblical data." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Affirms that all covenant promises find their fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is the mediator and substance of the covenant.
    - The New Covenant is not a break but the consummation of the Covenant of Grace.
    - Salvation is applied through union with Christ, the covenant head.
    - "The new covenant is the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and is realized in Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Emphasis on Historical Administration**
    - Stresses the importance of the historical unfolding of the covenant in redemptive history.
    - Each covenant administration (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) builds upon the previous.
    - The covenant is not static but dynamically revealed in history.
    - The church is the covenant community across all ages.
    - "The administration of the covenant is inseparable from the historical process of redemption." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Biblical-Theological Method**
    - Prioritizes exegesis and biblical theology over systematic or speculative formulations.
    - Seeks to derive covenant concepts directly from Scripture.
    - Avoids imposing extra-biblical categories onto the biblical text.
    - Influences later developments in Reformed biblical theology.
    - "We must allow the biblical data to determine the structure and content of our covenant theology." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s approach to the **Covenant of Grace** has significantly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in its emphasis on biblical-theological method and the unity of redemptive history. His rejection of the traditional **Covenant of Works/Grace dichotomy** sparked ongoing debate and reevaluation within confessional circles. Murray’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of covenant theology, particularly among those seeking a more exegetically grounded and Christ-centered framework.
