# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **Covenant of Grace** as the unifying structure of God's redemptive relationship with His people, emphasizing its continuity throughout **redemptive history** and its grounding in the **sovereign initiative of God**. He situates the covenant within his broader **tri-perspectival** framework, highlighting the interplay of divine authority, personal relationship, and ethical obligation. Frame stresses that the **Covenant of Grace** is fundamentally about God's promise to save His people through Christ, administered through various historical covenants.

- "The covenant of grace is God’s sovereign administration of his loving promises to redeem his people from sin and death." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Grace as Unifying Principle**
   - Frames the entire history of redemption as governed by the **Covenant of Grace**.
   - Sees all biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) as administrations of the one Covenant of Grace.
   - Emphasizes the continuity between Old and New Testaments under this covenant.
   - Argues that the covenant is the primary means by which God relates to His people.
   - "The various biblical covenants are not separate, competing arrangements, but rather different administrations of the one covenant of grace." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Divine Sovereignty and Initiative**
   - Stresses that the covenant is established solely by God's sovereign will.
   - Human response is real but always subordinate to God’s initiating grace.
   - The promises and stipulations of the covenant flow from God’s authority.
   - The covenant is not a contract between equals but a sovereignly imposed relationship.
   - "God’s covenants are always initiated by him, not negotiated with man." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
   - Identifies Jesus Christ as the central figure and mediator of the Covenant of Grace.
   - All covenant promises find their fulfillment in Christ’s person and work.
   - The benefits of the covenant—justification, adoption, sanctification—are received through union with Christ.
   - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice secure the blessings of the covenant for God’s people.
   - "Jesus is the mediator and guarantor of the new covenant, fulfilling all the promises of grace." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Covenant**
   - Applies his **normative**, **situational**, and **existential** perspectives to understanding the covenant.
   - The covenant expresses God’s authoritative word (normative), shapes the community’s life (situational), and calls for personal faith (existential).
   - This approach highlights the multi-dimensional richness of the covenant relationship.
   - Encourages seeing the covenant as both a legal structure and a living relationship.
   - "The covenant is at once a command, a historical reality, and a personal relationship." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
   - Affirms substantial continuity of the Covenant of Grace across redemptive history.
   - Recognizes real differences in the outward administration between old and new covenants.
   - The substance (salvation by grace through faith) remains unchanged, while forms (sacraments, ceremonies) may differ.
   - This allows for both unity and diversity in God’s dealings with His people.
   - "The new covenant is not a different way of salvation, but a new administration of the same covenant of grace." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **Covenant of Grace** has reinforced its centrality in contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his tri-perspectival lens. His work has encouraged theologians and pastors to appreciate the covenant as both a doctrinal and relational reality, shaping the church’s understanding of Scripture and redemptive history. Frame’s influence is evident in the ongoing discussions about the unity of the Bible and the practical implications of covenant theology for Christian life and ministry.
