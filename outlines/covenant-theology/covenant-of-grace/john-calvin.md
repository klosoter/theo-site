# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated the **Covenant of Grace** as the unifying structure of God's redemptive dealings with humanity after the Fall, emphasizing the continuity of God's promises throughout **redemptive history**. He saw the covenant as fundamentally rooted in Christ and administered through both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the unity of the **people of God** and the centrality of **faith** in receiving the covenant's benefits.

- "All the covenants made with the patriarchs were so many renewals of the covenant of grace." (Institutes 2.10.2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** spans both Old and New Testaments.
    - There is one way of salvation for all the elect, centered in Christ.
    - The substance of the covenant remains unchanged, though its administration differs.
    - The promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes 2.10.2)

2. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the foundation and mediator of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - All covenant blessings are received through union with Christ.
    - The Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the promised Christ.
    - The New Covenant reveals Christ more clearly but does not alter the substance of the promise.
    - "For the covenant made with Abraham is no less applicable to us than to them." (Institutes 2.10.3)

3. **Faith as the Means of Participation**
    - Faith is the sole means by which individuals receive the benefits of the covenant.
    - Both Old and New Testament believers are justified by faith.
    - The external administration of the covenant calls for an internal response of faith.
    - The sacraments serve to strengthen faith, not to replace it.
    - "The Lord has always covenanted with his servants thus: 'I will be your God, and you shall be my people.'" (Institutes 2.10.8)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is administered differently before and after Christ.
    - Old Testament administration involved types and shadows; the New Testament brings fulfillment.
    - The substance (Christ and salvation by grace) remains constant.
    - The external forms (circumcision, Passover vs. baptism, Lord’s Supper) change with redemptive history.
    - "The difference between the Old and New Testaments lies more in the manner of dispensation than in the substance." (Institutes 2.11.1)

5. **Covenant and the People of God**
    - The covenant community includes believers and their children.
    - The visible church is the outward expression of the covenant people.
    - Covenant promises are extended to successive generations.
    - The sacraments are signs and seals of covenant membership.
    - "The children of the faithful are born within the Church, and are heirs of the covenant." (Institutes 4.16.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s doctrine of the **Covenant of Grace** profoundly shaped later **Reformed theology**, providing a framework for understanding the unity of Scripture and the continuity of God’s redemptive plan. His emphasis on Christ as the covenant’s center and faith as the means of participation influenced the development of **federal theology** and the practice of infant baptism. Calvin’s covenantal insights remain foundational for Reformed ecclesiology and soteriology, continuing to inform theological reflection and confessional standards in the Reformed tradition.
