# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not develop a formal doctrine of the **Covenant of Grace** as later Reformed theologians did, but his theology centers on God's gracious initiative in salvation through **justification by faith alone**. Luther emphasized the unilateral promise of God fulfilled in **Christ**, highlighting the continuity of God's saving purpose from the Old Testament to the New, even if he did not use the covenantal terminology systematically.

- "For all the promises of God find their Yes in him." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- Commentary on Genesis
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Luther’s Small Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Salvation is received solely through **faith** in Christ, not by works.
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers as a free gift.
    - God's promise is central, and human response is enabled by grace.
    - The Old and New Testaments both proclaim this promise, though with differing clarity.
    - "Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Promise**
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all **divine promises**.
    - The Old Testament covenants point forward to Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in the person and work of Christ.
    - The gospel is the revelation of God's saving promise in Christ.
    - "All the promises of God are comprehended in Christ alone." (Commentary on Genesis)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The **Law** reveals sin and the need for grace.
    - The **Gospel** proclaims forgiveness and life through Christ.
    - The Law cannot save; only the Gospel brings salvation.
    - The distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of God’s promise.
    - "The Law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The Gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **Continuity of God’s Gracious Purpose**
    - God’s saving purpose is consistent throughout redemptive history.
    - The promises to Abraham and the patriarchs are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The church is the true Israel, receiving the benefits of God’s promise.
    - The sacraments are signs of God’s ongoing gracious action.
    - "The promise was given to Abraham and to his seed, that is, to Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Sacraments as Means of Grace**
    - Sacraments are visible signs of God’s promise and grace.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper communicate the benefits of Christ’s work.
    - Faith receives what the sacraments signify.
    - The sacraments confirm God’s covenantal promise to believers.
    - "The sacraments are signs of the promises of God." (The Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s emphasis on **justification by faith** and the centrality of Christ as the fulfillment of God’s promises profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of the **Covenant of Grace**, even if he did not articulate it in covenantal terms. His distinction between Law and Gospel influenced later Reformed and Lutheran covenant theology. While Luther did not develop a systematic covenant doctrine, his focus on God’s unilateral promise and grace laid important groundwork for subsequent theological developments. His legacy endures in the ongoing Protestant emphasis on salvation by grace through faith.
