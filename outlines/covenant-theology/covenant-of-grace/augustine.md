# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not articulate a formal doctrine of the **Covenant of Grace** as later Reformed theology would, but he laid foundational concepts for understanding **God’s redemptive dealings** with humanity. He emphasized the unity of **salvation history**, the continuity between the **Old and New Testaments**, and the centrality of **divine grace** in redemption. Augustine’s thought on the church, sacraments, and the people of God deeply influenced later covenantal frameworks.

- "For there is one and the same faith, in the same God, who worketh salvation in His saints, from the beginning of the world to the end." (City of God, XVI.29)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Salvation History**
    - Augustine taught that God’s plan of salvation is consistent throughout all ages.
    - He saw the **Old and New Testaments** as revealing the same God and the same promise of redemption.
    - The saints before Christ were saved by faith in the coming Redeemer, just as Christians are saved by faith in the Redeemer who has come.
    - He emphasized the unfolding of **divine grace** from Adam to Christ.
    - "The grace of the New Testament was hidden under the veil of the Old." (City of God, XVII.3)

2. **Necessity of Divine Grace**
    - Augustine insisted that fallen humanity cannot attain salvation apart from God’s sovereign grace.
    - He opposed Pelagian views of human ability and stressed the primacy of **grace** in both covenants.
    - The promise of salvation is fulfilled only by God’s initiative and mercy.
    - Grace is operative in both the Old and New dispensations.
    - "For not by the law of works, but by the law of faith, man is justified." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 16)

3. **Continuity of the People of God**
    - Augustine identified the **church** as the true Israel, the community of the redeemed across all ages.
    - He argued that the faithful under the Old Covenant were members of the same spiritual body as Christians.
    - The visible and invisible church distinction reflects the mixed nature of the covenant community.
    - The sacraments of the Old and New Covenants signify the same spiritual realities.
    - "The same things which are now signified by the sacraments were then signified by other signs." (City of God, X.2)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Augustine interpreted Old Testament events and institutions as types fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - He saw the **covenants** with Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses as preparatory for the coming of Christ.
    - The promises to the patriarchs are realized in the New Covenant.
    - Typology demonstrates the unity and progression of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The New Testament lies hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New." (Questions on the Heptateuch, 2.73)

5. **Sacraments as Signs of the Covenant**
    - Augustine taught that sacraments are visible signs of invisible grace, present in both Old and New Covenants.
    - He affirmed the efficacy of sacraments as means of grace for the covenant community.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper correspond to circumcision and Passover as covenantal signs.
    - The sacraments mark the boundaries of the visible church but do not guarantee salvation apart from faith.
    - "The sacraments of the Old Testament bore a resemblance to those of the New." (Letter 54)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology provided crucial groundwork for later **covenant theology**, especially regarding the unity of salvation history and the necessity of grace. His understanding of the church as the one people of God and his typological reading of Scripture shaped medieval and Reformation thought. While he did not use the term **Covenant of Grace**, his insights on grace, sacraments, and redemptive continuity profoundly influenced the development of this doctrine in the Reformed tradition.
