# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated the **Covenant of Grace** as the central thread uniting **redemptive history**, emphasizing its organic development from **Genesis 3:15** through the unfolding of **biblical revelation**. He stressed the unity and progression of the **covenantal structure**, seeing the Covenant of Grace as the means by which God accomplishes salvation in Christ for His people.

- "The covenant of grace is the historical embodiment of the principle of redemption." ("Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 2: Anthropology)
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (article)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Covenant of Grace unfolds progressively throughout **redemptive history**.
    - It is not a series of disconnected covenants but one unified covenant with multiple administrations.
    - The promise given in **Genesis 3:15** is foundational and organically develops through Scripture.
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of the covenantal promise.
    - "The covenant of grace is one in essence, though multiform in its historical unfolding." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Historical Embodiment of Redemption**
    - The Covenant of Grace is the concrete historical means by which God applies redemption.
    - It is not merely a theological abstraction but is enacted in history.
    - The covenant provides the structure for understanding the unfolding of salvation.
    - Each covenantal administration (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) advances the same redemptive purpose.
    - "Redemption and the covenant are inseparably connected in the history of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Christocentric Focus**
    - Christ is the Mediator and substance of the Covenant of Grace.
    - All covenant promises find their fulfillment in the person and work of Christ.
    - The Old Testament types and shadows point forward to Christ as the covenant's realization.
    - The New Covenant is not a break but the consummation of the Covenant of Grace in Christ.
    - "The covenant of grace finds its deepest meaning in the person and work of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - There is essential continuity in the substance of the covenant across redemptive history.
    - Discontinuity exists in the outward forms and administrations.
    - The unity of the covenant does not negate the progress of revelation.
    - The transition from old to new covenant is one of fulfillment, not replacement.
    - "The old and new covenants are not two covenants, but two dispensations of the same covenant." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Covenant and Eschatology**
    - The Covenant of Grace is inherently eschatological, aiming toward consummation in Christ.
    - Vos connects covenant history with the movement toward final redemption.
    - The covenant provides the framework for understanding the already/not yet of salvation.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is the telos of the covenantal promise.
    - "The eschatological is not something superadded to the covenant, but is inherent in its very structure." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of the **Covenant of Grace** profoundly shaped twentieth-century Reformed biblical theology, especially through his emphasis on the organic unity of redemptive history. His work provided a foundation for understanding the unity and diversity of Scripture through a covenantal lens. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary Reformed theology, particularly in discussions of biblical theology and the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. His covenantal framework remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate exegesis, dogmatics, and redemptive history.
