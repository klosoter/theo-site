# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted the **Covenant of Grace** by centering it on the person and work of **Jesus Christ** as the one true covenant partner between God and humanity. Rejecting traditional **bipartite covenant theology** (Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace), Barth saw the covenant as a singular, Christocentric event in which God’s **self-revelation** and **reconciliation** are accomplished for all. For Barth, the covenant is not a legal arrangement but the dynamic relationship of **divine election** and grace realized in Christ.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation, and creation is the way to the covenant." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1–3 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- Church Dogmatics III/1 (Doctrine of Creation)
- The Humanity of God
- Karl Barth and the Future of the Covenant (Bruce L. McCormack, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Covenant**
   - The covenant is fully revealed and realized in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is both the God who makes the covenant and the human who responds.
   - The covenant is not a bilateral contract but a unilateral act of divine grace.
   - All humanity is included in Christ’s covenantal obedience.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God has bound Himself to man and man to Himself." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Covenant Distinctions**
   - Barth denies the classic Reformed distinction between **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace**.
   - He sees only one covenant, rooted in God’s eternal purpose in Christ.
   - The law and gospel are not two separate dispensations but united in Christ.
   - The covenant is not a response to the Fall but the original intention of creation.
   - "There is only one covenant, the covenant of grace, which is the covenant of God with man in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Election as Covenant**
   - **Election** is the foundation and content of the covenant.
   - God’s election of humanity is realized in the election of Christ as both electing God and elected man.
   - The covenant is the historical outworking of God’s eternal election.
   - Election is not about individual predestination but about God’s purpose in Christ for all.
   - "Election means covenant, and covenant means Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

4. **Universal Scope of Grace**
   - The covenant in Christ is inclusive of all humanity.
   - Grace is not limited to the visible church or the elect in the traditional sense.
   - The **reconciliation** accomplished in Christ is objectively true for all.
   - Human response is secondary to God’s prior act of grace.
   - "He is the Reconciler not only for Christians, but for all men." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Covenant as Revelation and Relationship**
   - The covenant is the form of God’s **self-revelation** to humanity.
   - It is a living relationship, not a static legal arrangement.
   - God’s faithfulness is the ground of the covenant, not human merit or works.
   - The covenant is the context for understanding all of God’s dealings with creation.
   - "The history of the covenant is the meaning of all history." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **Christocentric revision** of the Covenant of Grace profoundly challenged and reshaped modern Reformed theology, moving the focus from legal frameworks to the dynamic relationship of God with humanity in Christ. His rejection of the traditional **Covenant of Works/Covenant of Grace** schema provoked significant debate and led to new explorations of **election** and **reconciliation**. Barth’s approach continues to influence ecumenical dialogue and contemporary covenant theology, especially in emphasizing the universal scope of God’s grace.
