### TITLE
One covenantal gospel in many administrations: defending the unity, instrumentality, and progression of the Covenant of Grace

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether Scripture teaches one **covenant of grace** unified in substance from the fall to Christ, administered diversely yet saving by Christ alone through faith alone, and how the Mosaic economy relates to that unity.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, Johannes Cocceius, Francis Turretin, Herman Witsius, Meredith G. Kline.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed federal theology and scholasticism, Westminster divines, Dutch Second Reformation, modern Reformed biblical-theological developments; opposed engagements with Lutheran two-covenant framing, Socinian and Arminian alternatives, dispensational and Barthian revisions.
- Debates to address:
  - Internal: one substance many administrations, conditions and instrumentality, relation of Mosaic law and potential republication of works, visibility and membership of the church, sacraments as seals, relation to election and the **pactum salutis**.
  - External: dispensational law-gospel discontinuity, Lutheran law-gospel polarities, Socinian and Arminian denials of imputation, Barth’s reconfiguration of covenant.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision, New Covenant Theology, paedobaptism challenges, assurance under a mixed administration.
- Position defended: Classic Westminster federalism—one **covenant of grace** grounded in the **pactum salutis**, administered from Adam to Christ, with faith as the sole instrument of justification and a limited, typological republication of a works principle under Moses that serves and does not subvert the covenantal unity.

### ESSAY
The Covenant of Grace is the postlapsarian administration of God’s eternal purpose to save a people in Christ, whereby God freely promises life and salvation to sinners, provides Christ as mediator and surety, and sovereignly brings the elect to receive these benefits by the Spirit through faith, all within a visible economy that is one in substance from the fall to the consummation yet diversely administered across redemptive history. This confessionally Reformed claim stands or falls with the unity of the gospel, the instrumentality of faith, and the Christological anchor of the covenant in the **pactum salutis**. Exegetically it is framed by the primal protoevangelium of Genesis 3.15, the oath-bound Abrahamic covenant of Genesis 15 and 17, the Mosaic economy as a pedagogical phase that neither annuls nor replaces the promise of Galatians 3.17, the Davidic royal pledge, and the new covenant ratified in Christ’s blood and expounded in Hebrews 8 to 10. Theologically it must be coordinated with **divine simplicity**, **federal theology**, and the loci of **justification by faith alone**, **union with Christ**, and the **visible church**.

The earliest decisive Reformed voice is John Calvin, whose Institutes and commentaries shaped the conceptual grammar even where later federal precision surpassed him. Calvin did not deploy a fully developed covenant-of-works construct, yet he consistently taught the unity of old and new under a single gracious covenant, with the law subservient to the promise and faith as the instrument of participation in Christ. In Institutes 2.10 to 2.11, Calvin argues that the fathers of Israel had the same covenantal hope we have, mediated by the same Christ, though under shadows and ceremonies. His method is exegetical and synthetic: he lays Abraham on the table of Galatians 3 and Romans 4, arguing that the righteousness reckoned to Abraham is identical in substance to Christian justification; he sets Jeremiah 31’s newness in terms of clarity, interior power, and liberation from ceremonial pedagogy, not a different way of salvation; he reads Hebrews as proof that the priestly order changes precisely because Christ, long promised, has come to consummate the one economy of grace. Calvin’s distinctive contribution is the conceptual unity of the covenantal gospel anchored in Christ, guarded from legalism by the instrumentality of faith, and ordered to gratitude through the law’s third use. Examiners will press whether Calvin leaves space for the covenantal conditions emphasized in later scholasticism. The answer is that Calvin already distinguishes the ground of the covenant, which is Christ alone, from the mode of reception, which is faith alone, and he understands evangelical obedience as the necessary fruit of union rather than any condition of title to life. The later vocabulary of condition serves to protect instrumentality rather than to compromise it.

In the Dutch Second Reformation, Johannes Cocceius reframed redemptive history around federal progression. His De Foedere et Testamento Dei established the two-covenant scaffold as a hermeneutical backbone for Scripture and traced the unfolding of grace in successive economies. Cocceius’s method was philological and biblical-theological, mapping promise, oath, stipulation, and curse across the canon. He is decisive for insisting that the Mosaic economy, though an administration of the Covenant of Grace, includes a republication of a works principle, particularly in relation to the typological land tenure and temporal blessings of Israel. His view invited the Voetian charge of antinomian tendencies, especially in his Sabbatarian revisions and his rhetoric of progress that seemed to imply a lack of evangelical holiness under the older administration. Yet Cocceius’s actual intent was to magnify the progress of redemption without denying the continuity of substance. The debates he sparked force clarity: if Moses rearticulates a works principle, is the Covenant of Grace compromised. Galatians 3 resolves the tension. The law came in to increase trespass and to serve as a pedagogue to Christ; it does not annul the promise previously ratified, and inheritance is by promise. Cocceius’s republication is valid in a typological and national sense, not in a soteric sense. Examiners may probe whether Cocceius slides toward two ways of life. The answer is to distinguish levels of covenantal operation: as to the ordo salutis, sinners are saved by **grace alone** through **faith alone** in Christ alone in all ages; as to Israel’s typological kingdom, a provisional works principle governed tenure in the land as a shadow of the last Adam’s perfect obedience.

Francis Turretin represents Reformed scholastic precision at its best. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he defines the **covenant of grace** as the agreement between God and the elect sinner in Christ, in which God promises salvation and life for the sake of Christ the mediator and surety, and the sinner, apprehending Christ by faith, undertakes a life of evangelical obedience. He distinguishes the Covenant of Grace as to substance and administration, insisting with the Westminster Standards that it is one in substance across the ages, differently administered under law and gospel. He ties the historical covenant to the eternal **pactum salutis**, the counsel of peace between Father and Son, in which the Son undertakes obedience unto death for the elect and the Father promises him a seed and the reward. Against Socinians, he defends the necessity of satisfaction and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness; against Arminians, he guards unconditional election and effectual calling; against Lutherans who speak of one covenant in two opposite modes, he denies that the Mosaic economy is a legal covenant for life while the new is evangelical. Turretin’s most delicate contribution lies in the vocabulary of condition. Faith is a condition, not as a meritorious cause or a cooperative contribution, but as the sole instrument ordained by God to receive Christ. The conditions of sincere evangelical obedience are secondary and consequent, the fruit of the Spirit, necessary as evidence and for communion with God, but never constituting the right to life. On sacraments, he aligns with the Westminster doctrine that they are signs and seals of the Covenant of Grace, strengthening faith by the Spirit, Calvin’s earlier emphases now bound into a federal structure. Examiner objection: does speaking of condition reintroduce legalism. Turretin’s response is to deploy the scholastic axiom of diverse respects. As to right, Christ alone is the condition and ground; as to possession and enjoyment, faith alone receives; as to evidence and sanctified fellowship, obedience is necessary. The unity of the covenant’s substance is preserved by disallowing any condition that would undermine the sufficiency of Christ’s obedience or the instrumentality of faith. The coherence with **divine simplicity** is maintained by distinguishing the eternal decree and **pactum salutis** from the temporal economy of administration without positing composition in God; the personal relations of Father and Son ground the covenantal roles ad extra by fittingness, not by change.

Herman Witsius, the irenic synthesizer, consolidated the tradition in The Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man. His context demanded mediation between Cocceian and Voetian parties. Witsius retains the robust two-covenant framework, strengthening the line from the **pactum salutis** to the historical covenant. He provides perhaps the best classical definition: the Covenant of Grace is that in which God, out of mere grace, through a mediator, promises to the elect and undeserving sinner union and communion with himself and all saving benefits, and man, through the same Spirit, embraces the promise by faith, and expresses his gratitude by good works. He clarifies conditionality with elegance: the Covenant of Grace is unconditional with respect to its foundation and effectual application to the elect, because God provides both the mediator and the faith by which we receive him; it is conditional in its federal form, because faith is the ordained means of participation and because the covenant includes stipulations for communion that are fulfilled by the Spirit’s sanctifying work. He harmonizes the administrations: the old and the new are one as to substance, different as to pedagogy, degree of clarity, and external rites. Circumcision and Passover seal the same righteousness of faith that baptism and the Lord’s Supper seal. Witsius is precise on the visibility of covenant. The Covenant of Grace has an external administration that can be profaned and an internal grace that cannot fail. This duality guards assurance from collapsing into presumption while also grounding the church’s ministry in objective promises. When examiners ask whether Jeremiah 31’s unbreakable covenant denies a mixed community, Witsius sends them to Hebrews, where the new covenant’s unbreakability pertains to the efficacy of the mediator and the eschatological power of the Spirit, not to an abolition of the church’s visibility or of hypocrites. The fault of the old lay not in its gracious substance but in the weakness of the flesh and the provisionality of its rites; the new surpasses by providing the reality to which the types pointed.

Meredith Kline, writing in the twentieth century, retrieved the covenantal form against higher critical skepticism and reshaped contemporary discussions with his suzerainty treaty analysis and his articulation of republication. In Treaty of the Great King and Kingdom Prologue, Kline argued that the Mosaic covenant is cast in Ancient Near Eastern treaty form, laden with oath, stipulation, blessing, and curse. He maintained that the Mosaic economy is an administration of the Covenant of Grace while also republishing the works principle of the Adamic covenant in a typological and corporate sense. Israel’s tenure in the land is conditioned on national obedience according to Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28, serving as an intrusion of final judgment in history and as a typological backdrop for the last Adam’s probation and obedience. In By Oath Consigned, he elaborated on oath sanctions and on sacramental judgment. Kline decisively exposed the structural compatibility of a gracious salvation for sinners and a provisional works principle at the level of typology. Yet his formulations sparked concerns. Some fear that republication makes Moses a covenant of works and jeopardizes the unity of grace. The response, consistent with Kline’s better statements and with classic federalism, is to insist on layering: as to personal salvation, Israelite sinners were saved by grace through faith in the promised Messiah; as to the theocratic economy, God used a works principle to display holiness, heighten transgression, and prefigure the covenant head who would render perfect obedience. Galatians 3 and 4 contain both dimensions: the law imprisons and tutors, the promise saves; Hagar and Sarah map the allegory of law and promise, yet Abrahamic faith stands prior to Sinai’s pedagogy. Kline’s retrieval is most helpful where it is restrained to typology and corporate tenure and where he does not slide into speaking of two soteric covenants.

These figures converge on a coherent Reformed doctrine resilient across the three layers of debate. Internal Reformed debates revolve first around the unity of substance and diversity of administration. The Westminster Standards are explicit: the Covenant of Grace is one, administered under the law and under the gospel, the former by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, Passover, and other types, the latter by the preaching of the word and the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Calvin, Turretin, and Witsius form the backbone. Cocceius and Kline introduce debates about the Mosaic economy. My defended position affirms a limited, typological republication of the works principle under Moses, which does not alter the gracious substance of salvation but subserves it. Second, conditionality and instrumentality must be handled with precision. Faith is the sole instrument of justification and union with Christ; evangelical obedience is necessary as fruit and evidence, not as a condition of title to life. This guards the free offer and grounds assurance without antinomian laxity. The Marrow controversy with Thomas Boston reminds us that the grant of Christ is unconditional in the gospel offer even as the covenant’s enjoyment blossoms into sanctified obedience. Third, visibility and membership. The Covenant of Grace is externally administered to believers and their children, and to all whom God calls by his providence into the church’s orbit. The internal efficacy belongs to the elect alone. Paedobaptism, grounded in the Abrahamic pattern and Acts 2.39, belongs to the continuity of the covenant; the sign seals the promise to the seed and obligates them to faith, without presuming regeneration. Those who appeal to Jeremiah 31 to deny infant membership overlook the prophetic contrast focused on the law’s interiorization and the forgiveness that is now accomplished in Christ, not the demolition of the covenantal household.

External debates demand careful comparison. Against dispensationalism and New Covenant Theology, the Reformed insist on one **covenant of grace** and one gospel across Scripture. Galatians 3 binds Abraham and Christian believers into the same seed-Christ relation; Hebrews 11 parades old covenant saints who lived by faith in the unseen Messiah; Paul’s argument in Romans 4 grounds justification by faith in Abraham’s experience. The dividing of Israel and the church as essentially distinct peoples with distinct promises fragments the biblical story and collides with Ephesians 2’s one new man and with Luke 1’s announcement of the mercy promised to the fathers now fulfilled. Against Lutheran construals that flatten the Old Testament into a legal dispensation for life, we affirm the proper law-gospel distinction while denying that the Mosaic economy inverted the gospel for the faithful. Luther’s mature exegesis of Genesis 15 and Romans 4 in fact points toward Reformed unity, if guarded from later misapplications. Against Socinian and Arminian rejections of imputation and satisfaction, the federal bonds between Christ and the elect in the **pactum salutis** secure both the just ground of our righteousness and the faith that receives it. Barth’s reconfiguration of covenant as a christological identity with election relocates covenant from a forensic and promissory structure to an ontological decision in which all humanity is elected in Christ and unbelief exists as an impossible possibility. This dissolves the visible administration, flattens the history of covenants, and detaches faith as instrument. The Reformed reply is simple: Scripture binds covenant to oath, promise, and sacrament; it binds election to particularity and to the **federal headship** of Christ for his people; it binds the Spirit’s new covenant ministry to effectual calling that produces definite faith and obedience.

Contemporary controversies test whether the classic doctrine can withstand pressure. Federal Vision proposals conflate the external administration with internal union by positing an undifferentiated covenantal objectivity. Baptism, on this view, confers union with Christ to all alike, only to be kept by covenant loyalty. This collapses instrumentality into faithfulness and jeopardizes justification by faith alone. The classical doctrine avoids this by maintaining two correlative truths. The external covenant is real and objective, conferring privileges and obligations; the internal grace of union and justification belongs to the elect alone and is received by faith as instrument. Apostasy from the external is real and fearful; apostasy from internal union is impossible. New Covenant Theology presses Jeremiah 31 to deny infant inclusion and to collapse the Mosaic law into a bygone covenant with no abiding moral norm. The Reformed answer returns to **divine law** as rooted in the character of God and republished in the new covenant through Christ and his apostles. The moral law’s substance remains the rule of gratitude for the redeemed, now empowered by the Spirit. Infant inclusion is not a carryover of mere tradition but the redemptive-historical continuity of the family promise that now encompasses the nations. Contemporary anxieties about assurance under a mixed administration are met by anchoring assurance in Christ’s finished work and promise, attested by Word and sacrament, and by recognizing the Spirit’s witness and fruit that accompany faith. The covenantal structure thus preserves both objective ground and subjective appropriation.

To defend this position under rigorous examination, one must keep the axes clear. First, substance and administration. From Adam’s fall onward there is but one way of salvation: Christ the mediator. The administrations differ in clarity, extent, and rites, not in soteric principle. The Mosaic economy includes a pedagogical function and a typological republication of a works principle relative to Israel’s national life. This republication neither saves nor damns as such; it prepares, images, and exposes. If pressed with Galatians 4’s language of slavery under the law, the reply is that Paul speaks of redemptive-historical minority under a guardian. The church’s maturity under Christ fulfills, not negates, the earlier gracious aim. Second, condition and instrument. Faith is the only instrument of justification and of initial union. The language of covenant condition concerns the divinely appointed means of participation and the consequent obligation of obedience, never the meritorious ground or co-cause of life. If challenged that the new covenant seems unconditional, we reply with Witsius that God himself provides the condition in his elect, granting faith, thereby preserving unconditional grace while maintaining the integrity of covenant form. Third, the **pactum salutis** and **divine simplicity**. The intra-trinitarian counsel of redemption is not a contract between separable wills in God but the one divine will subsisting in distinct personal relations, freely ordering the economy such that the Son as mediator undertakes obedience and receives a people. This grounds the historical **covenant of grace** in the eternal divine purpose without positing composition or change in God. Fourth, ecclesial visibility and sacraments. The **federal theology** secures a robust doctrine of the visible church, a covenant people with Word and sacrament, containing believers and their children, who are to be discipled in the promises. Baptism and the Supper are not mere badges but means of grace that seal the same promises across administrations. The Abrahamic circumcision of the heart promise blossoms into the Spirit’s work at Pentecost, yet the household shape of the covenant endures.

Adjacent loci converge here. **Justification by faith alone** is the forensic core of covenant enjoyment now, long promised in figures and prophecies. **Union with Christ** is the personal bond by which all covenant blessings are communicated, definitive of both old and new saints. **Sanctification** arises from covenantal adoption and the internalization of the law by the Spirit, illustrating that evangelical obedience is an effect of grace, not a condition of title. **Ecclesiology** is covenantal through and through, for the church is the community of the Covenant of Grace. **Sacramentology** protects assurance by anchoring it in God’s oath signs, which do not lie even when human response fails. A word on assurance: the Covenant of Grace affords objective assurance in Christ’s oath and blood and subjective assurance through the Spirit’s testimony and the fruit of faith. This twofold frame steers between presumption and despair.

Consider likely examiner objections. Is the covenant theological construct an imposition on the text. The biblical data refute the charge. God repeatedly structures his saving relation by oath and promise. Genesis to Revelation narrates covenantal administrations that culminate in Christ’s new covenant blood. Paul reads Abraham as the evangelical prototype and the law as an interlude that cannot annul the prior covenant. Is Jeremiah 31 a counterexample to continuity. No, because Jeremiah contrasts the Mosaic pedagogy, with its external rites and national form, to the Spirit-empowered interiority and once-for-all forgiveness of Christ’s mediation, not the Abrahamic promise. Thus Acts 2 ties the promise to believers and their children and to the nations. Does limited republication concede a dual track of salvation. No, because typological and national principles do not determine soteriology. Israel’s internal salvation always lay in the promised Christ. Does the **pactum salutis** compromise **divine simplicity**. No, because we predicate covenant roles to the distinct persons without positing separate wills or parts in God, confessing one will in three persons and locating covenant in God’s immutable decree ordered toward the economy. Does speaking of condition undermine sola fide. No, because the scholastic distinctions protect instrumentality. Faith is the ordained means, itself a gift of grace, and obedience is necessary as fruit, not as ground.

In sum, the Covenant of Grace is the architectonic of the gospel in history. Calvin set the unity of the covenantal gospel on exegetical footings; Cocceius traced its progression and exposed the pedagogical significance of Moses; Turretin armed it with scholastic rigor and tethered it to the **pactum salutis**; Witsius reconciled parties and clarified conditionality, sacraments, and visibility; Kline reminded us that Mosaic form and typology matter and that republication need not fracture grace. The doctrine proves its worth by integrating Scripture’s large-scale unity, preserving the unique sufficiency of Christ, and providing the pastoral grammar of promise, instrument, sacrament, and obedience that nourishes the church. It stands against external revisions that truncate continuity or dissolve covenant into abstraction, and it endures internal disputes by distinguishing substance and administration, title and possession, typology and soteriology. It calls the church to preach one gospel from all of Scripture, to seal it to believers and their children, to catechize in the law as a rule of life, and to anchor consciences in Christ’s oath sworn by his own blood. That is the covenantal center Westminster theology must defend.

### RECAP NOTES

  - John Calvin: unity of old and new under one gracious covenant, faith as instrument, law as rule of gratitude.
  - Johannes Cocceius: federal progression and typological republication under Moses in a national sense.
  - Francis Turretin: scholastic precision, one substance many administrations, faith as condition instrumentally, covenant tied to the pactum salutis.
  - Herman Witsius: irenic synthesis, conditionality clarified, sacraments and visibility balanced, children included.
  - Meredith G. Kline: treaty form and limited republication for land tenure and typology, preserving soteric unity.
- Debates:
  - Internal: unity of substance versus diversity of administration, conditions and instrumentality, Mosaic republication, visible-invisible church, sacraments as seals.
  - External: dispensational and NCT discontinuity, Lutheran law-gospel polarities, Socinian and Arminian denials of imputation, Barth’s election-covenant conflation.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision objectivity claims, paedobaptism challenges, assurance under a mixed administration.
- Defended position: Classic Westminster federalism with one gracious covenant from the fall to Christ, faith alone as instrument, sacraments as seals, infant inclusion, and a limited typological republication under Moses that serves the promise.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does Jeremiah 31 negate continuity and infant inclusion. Answer: It contrasts Mosaic pedagogy with Spirit-empowered efficacy, not the Abrahamic family promise reaffirmed in Acts 2.39.
  - Does republication create two ways of salvation. Answer: No, it is typological and national, while personal salvation is always by grace through faith in Christ.
  - Do covenant conditions undermine sola fide. Answer: Faith is the only condition instrumentally, given by God; obedience is necessary as fruit, not as title.
  - Is the pactum salutis compatible with divine simplicity. Answer: Yes, covenant roles reflect the one divine will subsisting in distinct persons, without composition or change.
  - How do sacraments function in the Covenant of Grace. Answer: As signs and seals that confirm the same promise across administrations, strengthening faith by the Spirit.
