# Peter J. Gentry (1952– )

Peter J. Gentry is a leading evangelical scholar whose work on the **biblical covenants** emphasizes their centrality in the unfolding of **redemptive history**. He argues that the covenants provide the structural backbone for understanding **biblical theology**, highlighting the continuity and progression from the **Old Testament** to the **New Testament** in God’s plan of salvation.

- "The covenants are the backbone of the storyline of the Bible." ("Kingdom through Covenant")

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Stephen J. Wellum)
- God’s Kingdom through God’s Covenants: A Concise Biblical Theology (with Stephen J. Wellum)
- “The Covenant of Creation” (in SBJT 12.2, 2008)
- “No One Holy Like the Lord: On the Meaning of Holiness in the Old Testament” (in Tyndale Bulletin 49.1, 1998)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenants as the Structure of Redemptive History**
    - The covenants organize the entire **biblical narrative** from creation to consummation.
    - Each covenant builds upon the previous, revealing God’s unfolding purposes.
    - The covenants clarify the relationship between **law and promise**.
    - They provide the framework for understanding **God’s kingdom** and people.
    - "The covenants are the key to understanding the unity and progression of the biblical storyline." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Creation Covenant as Foundational**
    - The **covenant with creation** (Adam) sets the stage for all subsequent covenants.
    - It establishes humanity’s role as image-bearers and vice-regents.
    - The fall is interpreted as a breach of this foundational covenant.
    - Later covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) address and advance the issues introduced in creation.
    - "The covenant with creation is the platform upon which all other covenants are built." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **Emphasis on Textual and Linguistic Analysis**
    - Careful exegesis of **Hebrew terms** for “covenant” (berit) and related concepts.
    - Analysis of **ancient Near Eastern treaty forms** to illuminate biblical covenants.
    - Focus on the literary and canonical context of covenant passages.
    - Argues for a nuanced understanding of covenant continuity and discontinuity.
    - "A proper understanding of the biblical covenants requires close attention to the original languages and ancient context." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Progressive Revelation and Typology**
    - The covenants reveal God’s purposes progressively throughout Scripture.
    - Typological fulfillment is seen especially in the **New Covenant** in Christ.
    - Each covenant anticipates and is fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Typology is grounded in the historical and textual realities of the covenants.
    - "The new covenant fulfills and transforms the previous covenants through Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

5. **Rejection of Traditional Covenant Theology and Dispensationalism**
    - Critiques both **classical covenant theology** and **dispensationalism** for misreading the biblical covenants.
    - Proposes a “progressive covenantalism” as a mediating position.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s people while recognizing covenantal distinctions.
    - Seeks to avoid flattening or fragmenting the biblical storyline.
    - "Progressive covenantalism offers a more faithful reading of the biblical covenants than either traditional system." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Legacy and Impact

Gentry’s work has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on **biblical theology** and the role of the covenants in Scripture. His advocacy for “progressive covenantalism” has provided a third way between traditional **Reformed** and **dispensational** approaches, influencing pastors, scholars, and students. By grounding his arguments in rigorous exegesis and ancient context, Gentry has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the centrality of the covenants in understanding the unity and diversity of the biblical canon.
