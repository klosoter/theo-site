# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a comprehensive doctrine of the **biblical covenants**, framing **God’s redemptive work** in history through the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. These confessional documents emphasize the unity and progression of **God’s covenantal dealings** with humanity, highlighting the centrality of **Christ** as the mediator of the covenant and the means by which the benefits of redemption are applied to the elect.

- "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God’s part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapters 7–8
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 20–36
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 12–21
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
   - God established a **Covenant of Works** with Adam as the representative of humanity.
   - The promise of life was conditioned on **perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience**.
   - The breach of this covenant brought **sin and death** into the world.
   - This covenant sets the stage for understanding the necessity of redemption.
   - "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (WCF 7.2)

2. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Structure**
   - After the Fall, God established the **Covenant of Grace** to save the elect.
   - This covenant is administered differently in the Old and New Testaments but is essentially one.
   - Christ is the **mediator** and fulfiller of the covenant on behalf of His people.
   - The benefits of the covenant are received by **faith alone**.
   - "Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.3)

3. **Unity and Diversity in Covenant Administration**
   - The **substance** of the Covenant of Grace is the same throughout redemptive history.
   - The **administrations** differ: promises, prophecies, sacrifices, and ordinances in the Old Testament; the preaching of the Word and sacraments in the New.
   - Both administrations point to **Christ** and the benefits of salvation.
   - The New Testament administration is fuller and more spiritual.
   - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

4. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
   - Christ fulfills the conditions of the covenant on behalf of the elect.
   - He is the only **mediator** between God and man.
   - His obedience and sacrifice secure the blessings of the covenant.
   - All covenant promises find their **yes and amen** in Him.
   - "The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father; and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto him." (WCF 8.5)

5. **Covenant and the Means of Grace**
   - The **means of grace** (Word, sacraments, prayer) are covenantal in nature.
   - These means are outward and ordinary ways by which Christ communicates the benefits of redemption.
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are signs and seals of the covenant.
   - Participation in these means is required of those within the covenant community.
   - "The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption, are his ordinances, especially the Word, sacraments, and prayer; all which are made effectual to the elect for salvation." (WSC 88)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, providing a systematic and confessional framework for understanding the unity of Scripture and the unfolding of redemption. Their articulation of the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** remains foundational for Presbyterian and many Reformed churches worldwide. The Standards’ covenantal structure continues to influence theological education, preaching, and ecclesiastical practice, ensuring that the biblical covenants remain central to Reformed identity and doctrine.
