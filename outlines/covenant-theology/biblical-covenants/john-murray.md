# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a careful and influential articulation of the **biblical covenants** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the unity and progression of **redemptive history**. He rejected the traditional **covenant of works/covenant of grace** dichotomy in favor of a more exegetically grounded approach, focusing on the **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, and **New Covenants** as revealed in Scripture.

- "The covenant concept is integral to biblical revelation and to the unfolding of God’s redemptive purpose." ("The Covenant of Grace," in Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- The Covenant of the Promise (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- "The Adamic Administration" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Divine Administration of Redemption**
   - The covenants are the means by which God unfolds His **redemptive purpose** in history.
   - Each biblical covenant is rooted in divine initiative and sovereign grace.
   - The structure of biblical covenants reveals the unity of the **plan of salvation**.
   - The covenants are not mere contracts but divine commitments with redemptive significance.
   - "The covenant is the way by which God secures and unfolds the blessings of redemption." (The Covenant of Grace)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Covenant of Works/Grace Dichotomy**
   - Murray critiques the sharp distinction between the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - He argues that the term "covenant" is not explicitly used for Adam’s arrangement in Genesis.
   - Emphasizes the need for biblical terminology and categories over scholastic formulations.
   - Sees continuity in God’s dealings with humanity before and after the fall.
   - "There is no warrant for the designation ‘covenant of works’ as applied to the Adamic administration." (The Adamic Administration)

3. **Centrality of the Abrahamic Covenant**
   - The **Abrahamic covenant** is foundational for understanding the unity of Scripture.
   - It is the root from which the **Mosaic** and **New Covenants** develop.
   - The promises to Abraham are ultimately fulfilled in **Christ** and the **gospel**.
   - The Abrahamic covenant is both unconditional in promise and conditional in fulfillment.
   - "The Abrahamic covenant is the fountainhead of redemptive promise." (The Covenant of Grace)

4. **Organic Unity and Progression of the Covenants**
   - Murray stresses the organic development of the covenants throughout **redemptive history**.
   - The covenants are not isolated but progressively reveal God’s saving purposes.
   - There is both continuity and discontinuity between the old and new covenants.
   - The **New Covenant** fulfills and transcends the previous administrations.
   - "The new covenant is the fruition of all that preceded." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Christ as the Mediator and Fulfillment of the Covenants**
   - Christ is the true seed of Abraham and the mediator of the **New Covenant**.
   - All covenant promises find their "Yes" and "Amen" in Him.
   - The work of Christ is the basis for the blessings of every covenant.
   - The unity of the people of God is grounded in union with Christ, not merely covenantal administration.
   - "All the promises of God find their fulfillment in Christ." (Romans Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s exegetical rigor and theological clarity reshaped Reformed understanding of the **biblical covenants**, moving the discussion beyond traditional categories to a more textually grounded approach. His emphasis on the unity and progression of **redemptive history** influenced generations of theologians and pastors, especially within the Westminster tradition. Murray’s work continues to serve as a touchstone for debates on covenant theology, biblical theology, and the relationship between law and gospel.
