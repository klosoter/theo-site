- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, Johannes Cocceius, Herman Witsius, Geerhardus Vos, Meredith G. Kline.
- Traditions: Patristic (especially Augustine), Reformed confessional and **federal theology** including Reformed scholastics, and modern Reformed biblical-theological developments.
- Debates:
  - Internal: covenant of works vs covenant of grace; Mosaic covenant as republication or not; relation of covenant and election; continuity and discontinuity across covenants.
  - External: Lutheran law–gospel vs Reformed federal schema; Roman Catholic sacramental–ecclesial approach; dispensationalism and its rival account of biblical unity.
  - Contemporary: New Covenant Theology and progressive covenantalism; criticisms of **merit** and **works** in the covenant of works; debates on typology, land, and justice.
- Defended position: A classic Reformed **federal theology** in which a real prelapsarian **covenant of works** and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** structure Scripture, with the historical covenants as unfolding administrations, climaxing in the new covenant in Christ as eschatological fulfillment.

### ESSAY
To defend biblical covenants in a Westminster oral examination one must show that the doctrine is not an optional overlay on the Bible but the grammar of **redemptive history** itself, as God relates to his image bearers through sworn, sovereign, history-shaping commitments. A covenant is a divinely initiated, oath-bound relationship of **federal representation**, with promises and sanctions, that structures both creation and redemption. The central dogmatic claim I will defend is that Scripture itself, read with canonical and typological sensitivity, presents two architectonic covenants, a **covenant of works** with Adam in the estate of innocence and a **covenant of grace** with sinners in Christ, historically administered in the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and new covenants. These covenants are not merely soteriological illustrations but the backbone of the Bible’s unity and the essential coordinates for **union with Christ**, **law–gospel**, and **ecclesiology**.

Patristic discussion of covenant is less architectonically developed than in later Reformed thought, yet Augustine of Hippo is decisive because he reframes history as a single divine economy ordered by Christ, in ways that will later be “federalized.” In The City of God Augustine distinguishes the two cities ordered by two loves, yet he also insists on the one people of God throughout the ages. His language of the “old” and “new” testaments is not merely about books but about two modes of the one **covenant of grace**, veiled and unveiled. Texts like Galatians 4 and Hebrews 8 are for Augustine proof that the old testament’s signs were shadowy anticipations of the same grace later given in clarity. He does not posit a prelapsarian **covenant of works**, but he clearly affirms Adam as a public person whose sin is imputed to his posterity, a nascent **federal headship** that will be formalized by later Reformed scholastics into explicit covenantal terms. Examiners will press whether the covenant of works is Augustinian or a Reformed novelty: one should concede that the label is later, but argue that the underlying structure of Adamic representation and probation is genuinely Augustinian and Pauline, rooted in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15. Augustine’s commitment to original guilt and forensic solidarity in Adam is the conceptual seed that will become classic **federal theology**.

John Calvin represents the crucial early Reformation consolidation of covenant as the unifying bond across the “two testaments.” In the Institutes, especially book 2, Calvin insists that the substance of the covenant is one: Christ himself offered in grace to believers in all ages. The difference between old and new lies in administration, clarity, and power, not in ultimate content. For Calvin, faith is the single instrument across both administrations, with Mosaic law serving pedagogically within the overarching **covenant of grace**. He does not sharply formulate a covenant of works, but he comes very close when addressing the law’s demand for perfect obedience for life, referencing the Adamic command and its curse. He is also foundational for the Reformed insistence on the unity of the church: Israel and the church share one olive tree and one **covenant of grace**, which grounds infant baptism and continuity of the moral law. An examiner will likely ask whether Calvin is a “federal theologian” in the later scholastic sense. The answer is that Calvin is covenantal but not yet structurally federal; he lacks the full prelapsarian–postlapsarian schema but provides the exegetical and dogmatic materials from which Cocceius and Witsius will construct explicit **federal theology**.

Johannes Cocceius in the seventeenth century is a decisive figure because he reframes Reformed doctrine as fundamentally covenant-historical and progressively unfolding. In his Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Dei he reads all of theology through the lens of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, and he pioneers a strongly developmental, almost epochal understanding of covenant history. Adam is placed under a **covenant of works**, promising eschatological life upon perfect obedience and threatening death upon disobedience. This covenant is broken in Adam, plunging humanity into death. The remainder of history is a single **covenant of grace** administered in successive phases, from the protoevangelium to Abraham, Sinai, David, and finally the new covenant. Cocceius is particularly significant for current debates because of his treatment of the Mosaic covenant. He tends to emphasize a temporary, law-heavy phase within the covenant of grace that brings Israel under a kind of intensified pedagogy of curse so that Christ may bear that curse. This lays groundwork for later Reformed discussions of Mosaic **republication** of the covenant of works, though Cocceius himself is more nuanced than some of his heirs.

Herman Witsius serves as a mediating and consolidating federal theologian. In The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man he systematizes the two-covenant schema with remarkable exegetical care and dogmatic balance, becoming a kind of benchmark for confessional Reformed orthodoxy. He clearly distinguishes but inseparably relates the **covenant of redemption** within the Trinity, the **covenant of works** with Adam and his natural posterity, and the **covenant of grace** with Christ as second Adam and all the elect in him. Witsius explicitly grounds the covenant of works in Adam’s status as federal head, citing Romans 5, and defends the genuineness of a promise of life beyond mere continuance, thus rejecting any reduction of the prefall arrangement to “natural” relation. He also develops a sophisticated account of covenant conditions: the covenant of works is conditioned on Adam’s personal obedience, whereas the covenant of grace is conditioned on Christ’s obedience and instrumentally received by faith alone. This anchors the classic Reformed **law–gospel** distinction within federal categories. Under oral examination, one must be able to explain why Witsius insists on the reality of prefall “merit” with respect to the covenant of works without undermining **divine aseity** and **sovereign grace**. The answer is that merit is covenantal and ex pacto, not intrinsic: God freely condescends to promise eschatological life as a reward to finite obedience; Adam does not obligate God by nature but by God’s graciously established covenant.

Moving into modern Reformed thought, Geerhardus Vos and Meredith G. Kline are crucial because they renew covenant as the key to biblical theology and respond to external and contemporary challenges, especially dispensationalism and revisionist Reformed proposals. Vos, often called the father of Reformed biblical theology, reasserts the foundational character of the **covenant of works** in his Reformed Dogmatics and in Biblical Theology. For Vos, eschatology precedes soteriology: God created Adam not in static perfection but in a state of probation ordered toward higher, consummate life. The tree of life is sacramental sign of that eschatological goal; the covenant of works is God’s historical, probationary arrangement by which humanity would enter that Sabbath rest. When Adam falls, history does not simply revert to a neutral state; rather, God introduces the **covenant of grace**, promising victory through the seed. Vos’s signal contribution is to insist that each historical covenant administration is not merely a new “dispensation” but a progressive intrusion of the age to come, especially in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants, which anticipate Christ as seed and king. In opposition to classic dispensationalism, which multiplies distinct peoples and plans, Vos insists on the organic unity of redemptive history and one people of God, thus tying covenant intimately to ecclesiology.

Meredith G. Kline develops these insights and becomes perhaps the most influential modern Reformed thinker on covenants, especially in relation to the Mosaic law and the doctrine of **republication**. In works like Treaty of the Great King and Kingdom Prologue, Kline argues that the biblical covenants, especially at Sinai, are structurally analogous to ancient Near Eastern suzerain–vassal treaties. This is not mere antiquarianism but a dogmatic claim: the Mosaic covenant has a strong works principle at the level of Israel’s corporate tenure in the land. While Israel participates in the **covenant of grace**, the Mosaic administration overlays a typological **covenant of works** in terms of “do this and live in the land, disobey and be exiled.” Kline insists this is a pedagogical republication of the Adamic works principle, designed to drive Israel to Christ and to display in history the curse-bearing obedience necessary for life. Examiners will press whether this republication undermines sola gratia. The answer, following Kline at his best, is that republication operates on different levels: in respect to eternal salvation, Israel is saved only by grace through faith in the coming Christ under the **covenant of grace**; in respect to typological kingdom tenure, a works principle is intentionally reintroduced to prefigure the last Adam’s obedience. This multi-layered approach allows one to affirm both the unity of grace and the real severity of Mosaic law.

With these figures in place, the internal Reformed debates can be faced squarely. First, the very existence of a **covenant of works** is contested by some contemporary Reformed theologians and by New Covenant Theology. Critics argue that Scripture never labels prefall relations “covenant,” and that importing a notional works principle compromises grace. The defense must proceed along three lines. Exegetically, Hosea 6:7 speaks of Israel “like Adam” transgressing a covenant; Genesis 2’s arrangement has all the structural marks of a covenant: parties, sanction, implied promise, sign. Theologically, Romans 5 presupposes a legal structure in which Adam’s disobedience and Christ’s obedience are imputed to their respective seeds, a classic **federal headship** schema. Hermeneutically, the Reformed confessions Westminster Standards and Three Forms of Unity articulate a covenant of works, so to reject it is at least confessional deviation. It is better to admit that the term is postbiblical but to defend that it names a real biblical pattern.

Second, within covenant theology, the relation of the Mosaic covenant to the covenant of grace is fiercely debated. One can distinguish between those who stress Mosaic continuity as a pure administration of the covenant of grace and those who emphasize a significant law works dimension. Classic Westminster theology sees Sinai as a genuine administration of the covenant of grace, with the moral law republished but fundamentally subsumed under promise and sacrifice. Kline and some of his heirs emphasize a sharper works principle at the typological level. New Covenant Theology sometimes uses this sharper Klinean formulation to argue that Mosaic law is fundamentally antithetical to gospel and thus abolished. A sound position, in my view, is to affirm with Vos and Witsius that Sinai is one administration of the **covenant of grace**, given to a redeemed people and embedded in sacrificial mediation, while also recognizing with Kline that within that gracious frame there is a real typological works principle governing Israel’s national tenure. This protects continuity of moral law and unity of the people of God, while doing justice to the specific intensity of Deuteronomic blessing–curse patterns.

Third, the relation of covenant and election raises internal tensions. Some fear that making covenant broader than election opens the door to a “covenant of hypothetical grace” and undermines perseverance. Others worry that simply collapsing covenant into election makes the visible church a mere epiphenomenon. The best Reformed response, drawing on Witsius and Vos, is to distinguish without separating. Eternal election is the intra-trinitarian **covenant of redemption**, the secret foundation of the historical **covenant of grace**. The covenant is offered and administered in history to a mixed community; its external administration creates real, non-saving relations to Christ. Covenant curses fall on those in the sphere of the church who yet are not elect. This means that not all in the covenant are elect, but all elect are brought under the covenant. Under examination one must show how this squares with Hebrews’ warnings and with assurance: the warnings are covenantal means by which the elect persevere; apostates break the external covenant bond and demonstrate that they never possessed its saving substance.

Externally, biblical covenant theology must be defended against Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and dispensational alternatives. Lutheran law–gospel dialectic classically resists the language of a prefall **covenant of works** because it fears any “law” in relation to life will obscure the gospel. The Reformed answer is that the law’s function is not univocal. In the state of innocence, law functioned as the pathway to a higher, eschatological good under a gracious condescension; postfall, the law as covenant of works condemns, but under the **covenant of grace** the moral law guides the justified. This multi-use account honors the Lutheran concern to protect forensic justification while preserving the biblical depiction of Adamic probation and the abiding normativity of the moral law.

Roman Catholic theology tends to subsume covenant under sacramental and ecclesial structures, speaking more easily of the “new law” of the gospel and of infused habits than of **federal representation**. The Council of Trent resists the forensic, covenantal reading of justification that Reformed theology, drawing on Romans 5, ties to the two Adams. The Reformed covenantal response is twofold. First, covenant clarifies that God always relates to his people through objective, public, oath-based commitments, so that assurance can be rooted in the stability of divine promise rather than the fluctuation of infused charity. Second, the Adam–Christ covenant framework grounds justification as a once-for-all verdict, not a process, since it depends on Christ’s completed covenant obedience. This does not negate sanctification but situates it within the **covenant of grace** as the fruit of an already secure status.

Dispensationalism presents perhaps the most direct rival account of biblical covenants. Classic forms posit discrete dispensations with varying conditions and often assert a fundamental distinction between Israel and the church. The unconditional Abrahamic, Davidic, and new covenants are then read as guarantees to ethnic Israel, sometimes leading to a bifurcated eschatology. Vos and Kline are especially important here. They insist on the organic unity of the **covenant of grace** running through all these administrations, with Christ as the true seed of Abraham, the ultimate Davidic king, and the mediator of the new covenant that encompasses Jew and Gentile in one body. Land and nation promises are typological and find their telos in the new creation and the international church, not a reversion to an ethnic kingdom. In defending this, one must show from texts like Galatians 3 and Ephesians 2 that the dividing wall is broken and that those in Christ are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to promise. This does not erase Israel but situates her in a larger **redemptive history** centered on Christ.

Contemporary debates bring additional pressure. New Covenant Theology and progressive covenantalism reject the covenant of works and sharply relativize the Mosaic law, arguing that only the law of Christ, understood as the ethic of the new covenant, directly binds believers. They often appeal to Jeremiah 31 and 2 Corinthians 3 to argue that the new covenant is radically discontinuous with prior arrangements. The Reformed federal response, drawing on Augustine, Calvin, and Vos, is to affirm real newness without dissolving continuity. The new covenant is new in efficacy, clarity, and extent; the law is internalized by the Spirit. Yet Jeremiah 31 itself repeats the Decalogue in Deuteronomic paraphrase, and Christ intensifies rather than abrogates the moral law in the Sermon on the Mount. The moral law as summary of God’s character remains, while the ceremonial and civil laws as typological apparatuses are fulfilled. The **covenant of grace** is not abolished in the new covenant; it reaches its climactic administration in union with the resurrected Christ, with the Spirit as arrabōn of the inheritance.

A particularly sharp contemporary challenge concerns **merit** in the covenant of works. Some argue that any notion of Adam meriting eschatological life from God is incoherent because of divine aseity and creator–creature distinction. Others fear that grounding Christ’s obedience in the categories of merit and works makes salvation transactional and non-personal. The best Reformed answer is to recalibrate merit as covenantal, not ontological. The covenant of works is itself a stunning divine condescension: God freely, out of sheer goodness, binds himself by oath to reward finite obedience with infinite life. This does not place God in debt by nature but by promise. Adam’s failure, then, is not the failure to reach a natural destiny but to receive a higher, gratuitously offered good. Christ, the second Adam, fulfills the same works principle, but now in a context of curse-bearing: his **active and passive obedience** under the covenant is the ground of our justification. Far from depersonalizing salvation, this federal framework secures it in the personal obedience and suffering of the incarnate Son, who as mediator consciously embraces the terms of the **covenant of redemption**.

Finally, covenant must be connected to adjacent loci to show its systematic indispensability. In relation to the doctrine of God, covenant is not a compromise of **divine simplicity** or sovereignty; rather, it is the historical form of God’s free, wise decree. God remains simple in essence while entering into complex covenantal relations with creatures. In Christology, the munus triplex of Christ as prophet, priest, and king is covenantal office: he is the covenant mediator, the true Israel, the faithful servant who obeys and suffers as federal head. In soteriology, justification, adoption, and sanctification are all benefits of union with Christ, the covenant head, distributed within the **covenant of grace** by the Spirit. Ecclesiology is covenantal because the church is the visible community under the word, sacraments, and discipline of the new covenant; baptism and the Lord’s Supper are covenant signs and seals, marking out those under the administration of grace. Eschatology is covenantal as well: the new creation is the consummated Sabbath rest promised in the covenant of works and secured in the covenant of grace.

In summary, biblical covenants are not a detachable theme but the architectonic structure of Scripture. Augustine gives the primitive grammar of two testaments and a unified people. Calvin secures the unity of the covenant and the centrality of Christ. Cocceius and Witsius formalize **federal theology** with a clear distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. Vos and Kline renew and refine this structure in modern biblical-theological terms, responding to dispensationalism and shaping internal debates about Sinai and republication. Under examination you must not only be able to describe these developments but also to defend the core claim: God has chosen to relate to humanity covenantally, with Adam and with Christ as heads, so that all of creation and redemption is ordered by his oaths, promises, and sanctions. To abandon this covenantal framework is to fragment the Bible’s story, obscure Christ’s federal headship, and weaken the doctrines of law, gospel, church, and assurance. To embrace it is to see how, from Eden to new Jerusalem, the God of the covenant is faithful to his word.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: A biblical covenant is a divinely initiated, oath-bound relationship of **federal representation**, with promises and sanctions, by which God structures both creation and **redemptive history**, especially in the **covenant of works** with Adam and the **covenant of grace** with sinners in Christ.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: early grammar of two testaments and one people; nascent federal headship in Adam; no explicit covenant of works but real structure of representation.
  - Calvin: unites old and new as one covenant of grace in different administrations; strong continuity of law and church; covenantal but pre-federal in structure.
  - Cocceius: explicitly formulates covenant of works and covenant of grace; stresses historical development and Mosaic law phase.
  - Witsius: classic Reformed **federal theology**; clear distinction and relation of covenant of redemption, works, and grace; balances conditions, merit, and grace.
  - Vos: frames theology in terms of eschatological covenant history; reaffirms Adamic probation and organic unity of the covenant of grace.
  - Kline: shows covenant form in ANE treaty structures; argues for Mosaic **republication** of the works principle at a typological level.
- Debates:
  - Internal: reality and necessity of the **covenant of works**; nature of Mosaic covenant and republication; relation of covenant and election; continuity and discontinuity of law and people of God.
  - External: Lutheran suspicion of prefall works principle; Roman Catholic sacramental–ecclesial focus and process view of justification; dispensationalism’s multiple dispensations and Israel–church divide.
  - Contemporary: New Covenant Theology and progressive covenantalism rejecting covenant of works and minimizing Mosaic law; criticisms of covenantal merit; debates on typology of land, Israel, and justice.
- Defended position: Classic Reformed **federal theology** in which a real prefall **covenant of works** and a postfall **covenant of grace**, grounded in the **covenant of redemption**, provide the architectonic structure of Scripture, with historical covenants as progressive administrations culminating in the new covenant in Christ, preserving both continuity and real historical development.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is the covenant of works actually in Scripture? It is structurally present in Genesis 2, Hosea 6:7, and Romans 5 as an Adamic probation with sanction and implied promise, later named by Reformed theology.
  - Does a works principle undermine grace? No, because the works principle is itself a gracious covenantal condescension and, postfall, is fulfilled only by Christ under the **covenant of grace**.
  - Is the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works or of grace? It is an administration of the covenant of grace that includes a typological works principle governing Israel’s corporate tenure in the land.
  - How do covenant and election relate? Election is the eternal ground of the historical covenant of grace, but covenant includes both elect and non-elect under its external administration, explaining both assurance and apostasy.
  - How does covenant theology differ from dispensationalism? It insists on one **covenant of grace**, one people of God, and typological fulfillment of land and nation promises in Christ and the new creation, rather than parallel divine plans.
