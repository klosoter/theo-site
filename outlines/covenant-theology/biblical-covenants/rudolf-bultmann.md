# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **biblical covenants** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He regarded the covenant motifs in Scripture not as historical or legal realities, but as expressions of the **kerygma**—the proclamation that calls individuals to authentic existence before God in Christ. For Bultmann, the significance of **covenant** lies in its existential meaning for faith, rather than in any objective or redemptive-historical structure.

- "The Old Testament covenant is not a legal contract but a proclamation of the demand and promise of God." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Faith and Understanding (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Covenant Language**
    - Interprets covenant narratives as mythological expressions requiring existential reinterpretation.
    - Rejects a literal or historical reading of biblical covenants.
    - Sees covenant as a symbol for the encounter between God and the individual.
    - Emphasizes the need to translate covenant motifs into contemporary existential terms.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of Kerygma over Historical Covenants**
    - The proclamation of Christ, not the covenant structure, is central to faith.
    - Biblical covenants serve as vehicles for the kerygma, not as binding legal arrangements.
    - The existential call of the gospel supersedes any redemptive-historical framework.
    - The meaning of covenant is realized in the individual's response to the kerygma.
    - "What matters is not the historical event but the proclamation that confronts us here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Covenant**
    - Covenant points to the individual's decision before God.
    - Focuses on the human response of faith rather than divine initiative in history.
    - The covenant is fulfilled in the existential encounter with Christ.
    - Downplays the continuity between Old and New Testament covenants in favor of existential transformation.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of oneself to the word that is proclaimed." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Rejection of Heilsgeschichte (Salvation History)**
    - Denies that biblical covenants form a coherent salvation-historical narrative.
    - Critiques the idea of progressive revelation through covenants.
    - Argues that salvation is not a process unfolding in history but an existential reality.
    - Views the covenant as a mythic form, not a chronological sequence.
    - "History cannot be the bearer of revelation." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant in Existential Encounter**
    - Christ is not the terminus of a covenantal sequence but the event of God's self-revelation.
    - The new covenant is realized in the individual's encounter with the risen Christ.
    - Emphasizes the present, existential dimension of the new covenant.
    - The meaning of covenant is actualized in faith, not in historical continuity.
    - "The Christ who meets us in the word is the eschatological event." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential approach to **biblical covenants** profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, especially in its move away from salvation-historical and redemptive-historical readings. His emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential response to the kerygma challenged traditional Reformed and covenantal frameworks. While his views have been widely critiqued, his work remains influential in discussions of hermeneutics, the nature of biblical authority, and the relationship between history and faith.
