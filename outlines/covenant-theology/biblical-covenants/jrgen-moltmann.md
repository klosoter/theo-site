# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **biblical covenants** through the lens of **eschatology**, **Trinitarian theology**, and the **theology of hope**. He views the covenants as dynamic, forward-looking promises that reveal God's commitment to **creation** and the **redemption of history**, culminating in the **new creation** and universal reconciliation in Christ.

- "The covenant of God with Israel and with all the nations is the promise of a new future for the world." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- Theology of Hope
- The Crucified God
- God in Creation
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit

   - "The trinitarian history of God is the basis for the history of the covenant." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**

   - Emphasizes the cosmic dimension of redemption promised in the covenants.
   - Interprets the Noahic covenant as a sign of God’s commitment to the whole world.
   - Sees the new covenant in Christ as the foundation for universal reconciliation.

   - Connects covenant faithfulness with **social justice** and the transformation of society.
   - Sees the church as a community called to embody the liberating promises of the covenant.
   - "The Exodus covenant is the prototype of liberation and hope." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Covenant and Creation**
   - Integrates the doctrine of **creation** with the theology of covenant.
   - Argues that God’s covenant includes responsibility for the earth and non-human creation.
   - Sees ecological concern as a covenantal obligation.
   - Emphasizes the renewal of creation as the goal of the covenantal promises.

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s interpretation of **biblical covenants** has significantly shaped contemporary theology, especially in the areas of **eschatology**, **ecological theology**, and **public theology**. His emphasis on the universal and cosmic dimensions of the covenant has broadened the scope of covenantal thought beyond traditional confines. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians to connect covenantal themes with hope, liberation, and the renewal of all creation.
