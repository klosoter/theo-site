# Scott Hahn (1957–)

Scott Hahn is a contemporary Roman Catholic theologian whose work on **biblical covenants** emphasizes their centrality in salvation history and the structure of **divine revelation**. He argues that the covenants are the backbone of **salvation history**, progressively unfolding God's plan and culminating in the **New Covenant** established by Christ and actualized in the **sacramental life** of the Church.

- "The covenant is the key to understanding all of salvation history, for it is the means by which God fathers His family."

- Swear to God: The Promise and Power of the Sacraments
- The Kingdom of God as Liturgical Empire: A Theological Commentary on 1–2 Chronicles

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Structure of Salvation History**
    - Covenants are the organizing principle of the entire biblical narrative.
    - Each major biblical covenant (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Christ) marks a new stage in God’s plan.
    - Covenants progressively reveal God’s fatherhood and the expansion of His family.
    - The New Covenant in Christ fulfills and transforms all previous covenants.
    - "From Adam to Christ, the story of salvation is the story of God’s covenants with humanity." (A Father Who Keeps His Promises)

2. **Covenant and Divine Filiation**
    - Covenants establish a familial relationship between God and His people.
    - Divine sonship is granted and deepened through covenantal bonds.
    - The Church is seen as the family of God, constituted by the New Covenant.
    - Baptism is the sacramental entry into this covenantal family.
    - "God’s plan is to make us His sons and daughters through covenant." (A Father Who Keeps His Promises)

3. **Sacraments as Covenant Rituals**
    - Sacraments are the means by which the New Covenant is enacted and maintained.
    - Each sacrament is a covenant oath, binding the believer to Christ.
    - The Eucharist is the supreme covenant meal, renewing the New Covenant.
    - The liturgy is the context in which covenant life is lived and celebrated.
    - "The sacraments are covenant oaths, not mere symbols." (Swear to God)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament covenants prefigure and are fulfilled in Christ.
    - Typology reveals the unity and progression of God’s covenantal plan.
    - Jesus is the true and final mediator of the covenant.
    - The Church is the eschatological fulfillment of Israel’s covenant hopes.
    - "The old covenants are types and shadows; Christ is the substance." (Kinship by Covenant)

5. **Covenant and Kingdom**
    - The covenant establishes God’s kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
    - Kingship and kingdom themes are inseparable from covenant theology.
    - Davidic covenant promises are realized in the Church, the kingdom of Christ.
    - The Church’s mission is to extend the blessings of the covenant to all nations.
    - "The kingdom of God is the covenant family of God, made present in the Church." (The Kingdom of God as Liturgical Empire)

## Legacy and Impact

Scott Hahn has played a pivotal role in reviving interest in **covenant theology** within contemporary Catholic biblical scholarship. His work has influenced both academic and popular audiences, bridging the gap between scholarly exegesis and lay formation. By emphasizing the centrality of **covenant** in understanding Scripture and the sacraments, Hahn has shaped the way many Catholics and Protestants alike approach the unity of the Bible and the nature of the Church. His contributions continue to foster ecumenical dialogue and a deeper appreciation for the biblical foundations of Catholic doctrine.
