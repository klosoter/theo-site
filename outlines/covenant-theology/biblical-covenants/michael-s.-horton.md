# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton is a leading contemporary Reformed theologian whose work on **biblical covenants** emphasizes the unity and diversity of God’s redemptive plan throughout Scripture. He articulates a robust **covenant theology** that distinguishes between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, while highlighting the centrality of **Christ** as the mediator of all God’s promises.

- "The covenant is the backbone of the biblical story, uniting the diverse books and epochs into a coherent drama of redemption." ("God of Promise")

## Key Works

- God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology (2006)
- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way (2011)
- Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ (2007)
- Introducing Covenant Theology (2006)
- Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples (2011)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Distinguishes the **covenant of works** with Adam from the **covenant of grace** initiated after the Fall.
    - Argues that the covenant of works is foundational for understanding human responsibility and Christ’s obedience.
    - Sees the covenant of grace as progressively revealed through Abraham, Moses, David, and fulfilled in Christ.
    - Emphasizes that both covenants are necessary for a coherent doctrine of salvation.
    - "The law-gospel distinction is rooted in the difference between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace." (God of Promise)

2. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenants**
    - Asserts that Christ is the true and final mediator of all God’s covenants.
    - Views Old Testament covenants as types and shadows pointing to Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Stresses the unity of the covenants in their fulfillment in Christ.
    - Maintains that all covenant promises find their ‘Yes’ in Jesus.
    - "Christ is the substance to which all the covenantal types and shadows pointed." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Unity and Diversity in the Covenant Structure**
    - Affirms the essential unity of God’s redemptive plan across Scripture.
    - Recognizes legitimate diversity in covenant administrations (e.g., Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic).
    - Argues that the diversity serves the unfolding of the one covenant of grace.
    - Rejects both radical discontinuity (dispensationalism) and flattening continuity.
    - "The covenants are not competing systems but successive administrations of the one promise." (God of Promise)

4. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs and Seals**
    - Teaches that sacraments are visible signs and seals of the covenant.
    - Connects baptism and the Lord’s Supper to the administration of the covenant of grace.
    - Emphasizes the objective nature of the sacraments as God’s promise, not human testimony.
    - Argues that the sacraments confirm and strengthen faith within the covenant community.
    - "The sacraments are God’s sworn oaths, confirming his covenant to his people." (Introducing Covenant Theology)

5. **Covenant and Assurance**
    - Links assurance of salvation to God’s covenant promises rather than subjective experience.
    - Argues that the external Word and sacraments ground assurance in God’s faithfulness.
    - Warns against introspective approaches that undermine covenantal assurance.
    - Encourages believers to rest in the objective promises of the covenant.
    - "Assurance is rooted in God’s covenant oath, not in our fluctuating feelings." (Covenant and Salvation)

## Legacy and Impact
