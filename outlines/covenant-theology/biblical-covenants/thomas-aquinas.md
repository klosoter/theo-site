# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached the topic of **biblical covenants** through the lens of **divine law**, **salvation history**, and the relationship between the **Old Law** and the **New Law**. He understood the covenants as progressive revelations of God's will, culminating in the **New Covenant** established by Christ, which fulfills and transcends the **Mosaic Covenant**. Aquinas’s treatment of covenants is deeply integrated with his broader doctrines of **grace**, **law**, and **sacrament**.

- "The Old Law was given to prepare the way for the salvation to be brought by Christ, and the New Law is the law of grace itself." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–108 (Treatise on Law)
- Commentary on the Letter to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Selected Questions on the Old and New Law (Quaestiones Disputatae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Old and New Law as Covenantal Stages**
    - The **Old Law** (Mosaic Covenant) was preparatory, revealing sin and pointing toward Christ.
    - The **New Law** (New Covenant) is primarily the grace of the Holy Spirit given through Christ.
    - Both laws are part of a single divine plan, but differ in efficacy and perfection.
    - The New Law fulfills the promises and types of the Old.
    - "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

2. **Unity and Progression of Divine Revelation**
    - God’s covenants reveal a unified, unfolding plan of salvation.
    - The Old Covenant contains figures and shadows; the New brings reality and fulfillment.
    - The covenants are not opposed but are stages in the pedagogy of salvation.
    - The continuity is grounded in the one God and His unchanging will.
    - "The Old Law is the shadow of the New Law, and the New Law is the truth of the Old." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

3. **Role of Law and Grace in the Covenants**
    - The Old Law commands but does not give the power to fulfill; it lacks interior grace.
    - The New Law imparts grace, enabling obedience and transformation.
    - The sacraments of the New Covenant are effective signs of grace.
    - Grace is the distinguishing feature of the New Covenant.
    - "The Old Law, by forbidding, increased the desire for sin; the New Law, by giving grace, takes away sin." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 1)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - The persons, events, and institutions of the Old Covenant prefigure those of the New.
    - Christ is the fulfillment of all Old Testament types and promises.
    - The sacrificial system finds its completion in Christ’s atoning work.
    - The Church is the new people of God, inheriting the promises.
    - "All the sacraments of the Old Law signified Christ, but did not confer grace; the sacraments of the New Law both signify and cause grace." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 61, a. 3)

5. **Covenant and Salvation**
    - Salvation is always by faith, but the object of faith is more clearly revealed in the New Covenant.
    - The Old Covenant saints were saved by faith in the promise of Christ.
    - The New Covenant provides a fuller participation in divine life through Christ.
    - The ultimate end of both covenants is union with God.
    - "The same faith in Christ saves both the ancients and the moderns, though under different signs." (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 2, a. 7)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **biblical covenants** profoundly shaped later Catholic and Protestant understandings of the relationship between the **Old and New Testaments**. His emphasis on the unity of God’s plan and the centrality of **grace** influenced both medieval and Reformation theology. While not developing a covenant theology in the later Reformed sense, Aquinas provided foundational categories for discussing **law, grace, and salvation history** that remain influential in systematic theology.
