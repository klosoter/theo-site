# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s understanding of **biblical covenants** is rooted in his broader theology of **redemptive history** and the unity of **Scripture**. He sees the **Old and New Covenants** as distinct yet organically connected administrations of God’s single plan of salvation, with the **New Covenant** fulfilling and surpassing the Old. Augustine emphasizes the continuity of **grace** and the centrality of **Christ** as the mediator of all covenants.

- "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Spirit and the Letter (De Spiritu et Littera)
- Against Faustus the Manichean (Contra Faustum)
- Sermons on Selected Lessons of the New Testament

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Two Covenants**
    - The **Old and New Covenants** are two phases of one divine plan.
    - Both covenants reveal the same God and share the same ultimate purpose.
    - The New Covenant is hidden in the Old; the Old is revealed in the New.
    - The transition from Old to New is marked by fulfillment, not abolition.
    - "The two Testaments are not opposed to each other, but the New is hidden in the Old and the Old is made manifest in the New." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Covenants**
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all biblical covenants.
    - The promises to Abraham and Israel find their realization in Christ.
    - The sacrificial system and ceremonial laws prefigure Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Faith in Christ is the means of participation in the New Covenant.
    - "All the promises of God are in Him yea, and in Him Amen." (The City of God 17.3)

3. **Grace as the Principle of Both Covenants**
    - Salvation is always by **grace**, not by works, in both covenants.
    - The Law exposes sin and points to the need for grace.
    - The Spirit enables obedience in the New Covenant, overcoming the weakness of the flesh.
    - The gift of the Spirit is the distinguishing blessing of the New Covenant.
    - "For what the law enjoins by threat, it bestows by faith through the Spirit." (On the Spirit and the Letter 21)

4. **Typology and Allegory in Covenant Interpretation**
    - Augustine employs **typology** to interpret Old Testament covenants as foreshadowing New Testament realities.
    - He sees Israel as a type of the Church, and the exodus as a type of salvation.
    - Allegorical readings reveal deeper spiritual truths about Christ and the Church.
    - The sacraments of the Old Covenant prefigure those of the New.
    - "The events of the Old Testament were figures of things to come." (The City of God 16.26)

5. **The Church as the Covenant Community**
    - The Church is the true Israel, the community of the New Covenant.
    - Membership in the Church is defined by faith and participation in the sacraments.
    - The unity of the Church across time reflects the unity of God’s covenant purposes.
    - The visible and invisible Church distinction is rooted in covenantal realities.
    - "The same people of God has been in both Testaments." (The City of God 20.21)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology of **biblical covenants** laid foundational groundwork for later Christian understandings of **redemptive history** and the relationship between the Testaments. His emphasis on the unity of God’s plan and the centrality of **grace** influenced both medieval and Reformation thought. Augustine’s typological and Christocentric approach to the covenants continues to shape theological reflection on the continuity and fulfillment of Scripture.
