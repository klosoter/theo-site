# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust **covenantal theology** that frames the relationship between God and humanity in terms of **divine covenants**. These confessional documents emphasize the unity and continuity of **God’s redemptive plan** through the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, underscoring the centrality of Christ as the mediator of the covenant. Their teaching on **biblical covenants** shapes Reformed identity and provides a doctrinal foundation for understanding **Scripture**, **soteriology**, and the **church**.

- "God made a covenant of works with our first parents, and through their fall, we are received into the covenant of grace by faith in Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 20–21)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19–21, 74, 79
- The Belgic Confession (1561), articles 14, 15, 22, 34
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads of Doctrine I–III
- Lyle D. Bierma, "The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism"
- J. Mark Beach, "The Covenant of Works and the Three Forms of Unity"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works with Adam**
   - God established an initial covenant with Adam, requiring perfect obedience.
   - The promise of life was conditioned on Adam’s fulfillment of God’s command.
   - Adam’s failure brought sin and death to all his descendants.
   - This covenant sets the stage for the necessity of redemption.
   - "God created man good...that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love him, and live with Him in eternal happiness, to glorify and praise Him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 6)

2. **Covenant of Grace in Christ**
   - After the fall, God graciously established a new covenant promising salvation through faith in Christ.
   - The covenant of grace is administered through the preaching of the gospel and the sacraments.
   - Christ is the only mediator and fulfiller of the covenant’s demands.
   - All believers, both in the Old and New Testaments, are included in this covenant.
   - "We believe that Jesus Christ is a high priest forever...who has presented himself in our name before his Father, to appease his wrath with full satisfaction by offering himself on the tree of the cross and pouring out his precious blood for the cleansing of our sins." (Belgic Confession, Article 23)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The covenant of grace is fundamentally one throughout redemptive history.
   - Old Testament believers were saved by faith in the promised Messiah, just as New Testament believers are.
   - The substance of the covenant remains the same, though its administration differs.
   - This unity underscores the continuity of God’s redemptive purpose.
   - "The sacraments of the Old and New Testament signify the same thing." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 80)

4. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs and Seals**
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are visible signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
   - These sacraments confirm God’s promises and strengthen faith.
   - They are not mere symbols but effectual means of grace for believers.
   - The sacraments belong to the covenant community, including believers and their children.
   - "Baptism is...a sign and seal of the covenant of grace." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

5. **Covenant Community and Children**
   - The children of believers are included in the covenant and should receive its sign.
   - This inclusion is grounded in God’s promise to be God to believers and their offspring.
   - The church is the visible community of the covenant, called to nurture faith.
   - Covenant membership entails both privileges and responsibilities.
   - "Infants as well as adults are included in God’s covenant and people, and they, no less than adults, are promised deliverance from sin through Christ’s blood." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, providing a confessional anchor for understanding the unity of God’s redemptive work. Their articulation of the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** has influenced generations of theologians and churches, especially in the Continental Reformed tradition. By grounding the administration of the sacraments and the inclusion of children in the covenant, these documents continue to inform Reformed ecclesiology and practice worldwide.
