# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth reinterpreted the **biblical covenants** as the central axis of God's relationship with humanity, emphasizing the **covenant of grace** as fulfilled in Jesus Christ. He rejected traditional **Reformed federal theology** (covenant of works/covenant of grace) in favor of a **Christocentric** and dynamic understanding of the covenant, where God's self-revelation and election are inseparable from His covenantal action.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation and the meaning of all history." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, esp. III/1, IV/1–2
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (Church Dogmatics I/1–2)
- The Humanity of God
- Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology (Clifford Green, ed.)
- The Theology of Karl Barth (Eberhard Busch)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Basis of Creation**
   - The **covenant** is not a secondary arrangement but the very purpose for which God created the world.
   - Creation exists for the sake of the covenantal relationship between God and humanity.
   - The **covenant of grace** is not a remedial plan but the original intention of God.
   - All of history is interpreted through the lens of God's covenantal purpose.
   - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant, and the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

2. **Christocentric Covenant**
   - Jesus Christ is both the foundation and fulfillment of the covenant.
   - All covenantal promises and obligations are realized in the person and work of Christ.
   - The covenant is not a bilateral contract but a unilateral act of divine grace in Christ.
   - Human response is always secondary to God's initiative in the covenant.
   - "In Jesus Christ, the covenant is both established and fulfilled." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Rejection of the Covenant of Works**
   - Barth rejects the traditional Reformed distinction between a **covenant of works** and a **covenant of grace**.
   - He sees this distinction as unbiblical and inconsistent with the unity of God's gracious action.
   - For Barth, there is only one covenant, grounded in God's eternal election in Christ.
   - Human obedience is always a response to grace, never a means of merit.
   - "There is no room for a covenant of works in the biblical witness." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Election and Covenant**
   - Barth closely links **election** and covenant, seeing election as the choosing of humanity in Christ for covenant fellowship.
   - Election is not arbitrary but is the election of Jesus Christ as the representative of all humanity.
   - The covenant is the historical outworking of God's eternal election.
   - This view opposes any notion of a hidden decree apart from God's self-revelation in the covenant.
   - "Jesus Christ is both the electing God and the elected man." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
   - The covenant in Christ has a universal reference, embracing all humanity.
   - Barth resists limiting the covenant to a particular group or nation.
   - The church is the provisional manifestation of the covenant, but not its exclusive beneficiary.
   - The covenant points toward the reconciliation of all creation in Christ.
   - "The covenant is the form of the divine-human relationship for all men." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of the **biblical covenants** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology, challenging both Reformed orthodoxy and liberal Protestantism. His **Christocentric** approach redirected covenant theology away from legalistic frameworks toward a dynamic, grace-centered understanding. Barth’s influence persists in contemporary debates on election, ecclesiology, and the relationship between **creation and redemption**. His work remains a touchstone for theologians wrestling with the meaning and scope of God’s covenantal purposes.
