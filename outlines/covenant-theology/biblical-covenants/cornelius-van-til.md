# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **biblical covenants** through the lens of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **God’s self-revelation**. He argued that the **covenant relationship** is foundational for understanding the Creator-creature distinction and the unfolding of **God’s sovereign plan** in Scripture.

- "The covenant idea is basic to all of Scripture and to all of life." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Framework for Revelation**
    - The **covenant** is the structure by which God relates to humanity.
    - All of **Scripture** is interpreted through the lens of the covenant relationship.
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is maintained within the covenant context.
    - The covenant reveals both **God’s transcendence and immanence**.
    - "God’s covenantal relationship with man is the presupposition of all revelation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** spans both Old and New Testaments.
    - There is one way of salvation throughout redemptive history.
    - Christ is the fulfillment of all covenant promises.
    - The unity of the covenant opposes dispensational divisions.
    - "The unity of the covenant of grace is the unity of the self-revelation of the triune God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenant and Presuppositional Apologetics**
    - Human knowledge is always covenantally conditioned.
    - Unbelievers suppress the truth of the covenant in unrighteousness.
    - Apologetics must presuppose the truth of the covenantal God.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in covenantal rebellion.
    - "All reasoning is, in the last analysis, reasoning in terms of a covenantal relationship to God." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Covenant and the Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - The covenant upholds the absolute distinction between God and creation.
    - Human beings are always dependent and derivative.
    - The covenant is not a contract between equals but a sovereign arrangement.
    - The image of God is expressed in covenantal terms.
    - "The covenant idea is the expression of the fact that man is always a creature and never a creator." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenant and Redemptive History**
    - The history of redemption unfolds through successive covenants.
    - Each covenant reveals more of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - The climax of redemptive history is found in Christ, the mediator of the new covenant.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment are covenantal in structure.
    - "Redemptive history is the progressive realization of God’s covenantal promises." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s covenantal approach has profoundly shaped **Reformed apologetics** and the understanding of **redemptive history**. His insistence on the **covenant as the interpretive framework** for all theology has influenced generations of theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. By integrating the doctrine of the covenants with presuppositional apologetics, Van Til provided a robust theological foundation for engaging both Scripture and culture.
