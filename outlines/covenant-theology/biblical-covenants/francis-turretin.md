# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust **federal theology** that distinguished sharply between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He emphasized the historical administration and theological unity of the **biblical covenants**, grounding the continuity of redemption in the person and work of Christ as the Mediator of the **Covenant of Grace**.

- "The covenant of grace is nothing else than the agreement entered into by God with the elect, in Christ, the second Adam, concerning the salvation to be given to them on condition of faith." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 12.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Vol. 2, Topics 12–13
- The Doctrine of the Covenants in Reformed Theology (secondary: Geerhardus Vos, for context)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Herman Bavinck, for Turretin’s influence)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as a confessional context for Turretin’s covenantal views)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Works** was made with Adam before the Fall, promising life upon perfect obedience.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** was established after the Fall, promising salvation through faith in Christ.
    - These covenants differ in their parties, conditions, and mediators.
    - The distinction safeguards the gratuitous nature of redemption.
    - "The covenant of works is founded upon the justice of God, the covenant of grace upon his mercy." (Institutes, 12.1.5)

2. **Unity and Diversity in the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
    - Its administration varies between the Old and New Testaments.
    - The promises, types, and ceremonies of the Old Testament pointed to Christ.
    - The New Testament brings greater clarity and fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The covenant of grace is the same in substance under both testaments, though different in mode of administration." (Institutes, 12.6.1)

3. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the sole Mediator and Surety of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - All covenant blessings are secured by his obedience and sacrifice.
    - The covenant is effectual only through union with Christ.
    - The work of Christ fulfills the demands of the broken **Covenant of Works**.
    - "Christ is the Mediator of the covenant, both as to merit and efficacy." (Institutes, 12.7.1)

4. **Conditionality and Unconditionality in the Covenants**
    - The **Covenant of Works** was strictly conditional on Adam’s obedience.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is unconditional in its foundation (God’s promise) but conditional in its reception (faith).
    - Faith itself is a gift granted by grace, not a meritorious work.
    - The conditions of the covenant are met in and through Christ.
    - "The condition of the covenant of grace is faith, but even this is given by God." (Institutes, 12.3.6)

5. **Covenantal Administration and the Church**
    - The visible church is the external administration of the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - The sacraments (circumcision, Passover; baptism, Lord’s Supper) are covenant signs and seals.
    - The covenant is made with believers and their children, supporting infant baptism.
    - The church’s unity across the ages is grounded in the one covenant.
    - "The church is the assembly of the covenant people, both under the law and the gospel." (Institutes, 18.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of **federal theology** provided a systematic and influential account of the **biblical covenants** for later Reformed orthodoxy. His distinctions and formulations shaped the covenantal framework of the Westminster Standards and subsequent Reformed dogmatics. Turretin’s careful balance of unity and diversity in the **Covenant of Grace** continues to inform contemporary discussions on redemptive history and ecclesiology. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the centrality of Christ in all covenantal dealings between God and humanity.
