# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **biblical covenants** through his distinctive **tri-perspectival** framework, emphasizing the unity and diversity of God’s covenantal dealings with humanity. He sees the covenants as central to **redemptive history**, structuring the relationship between God and his people, and culminating in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**. Frame’s analysis highlights the continuity of God’s promises and the dynamic interplay between **law, grace, and kingdom** throughout Scripture.

- "The covenants are the means by which God administers his lordship over his people." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

## Key Works

- "Doctrine of God" (2002)
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord" (2006)
- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief" (2013)
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life" (2008)
- "Covenant and the Kingdom of God" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Divine Lordship Structure**
    - Covenants reveal God’s authority, control, and presence with his people.
    - Each covenant displays the **sovereignty** of God in initiating and maintaining the relationship.
    - The structure of biblical covenants reflects Frame’s triad of **normative, situational, and existential** perspectives.
    - Covenants are not merely agreements but expressions of God’s lordship.
    - "Covenant is the way God exercises his lordship in history." ("Doctrine of God")

2. **Unity and Diversity in Redemptive History**
    - Frame affirms the essential unity of the **covenant of grace** across both Testaments.
    - He recognizes legitimate diversity in the administration of covenants (e.g., Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New).
    - The covenants progressively reveal God’s redemptive purposes.
    - Christ is the fulfillment and mediator of all biblical covenants.
    - "The covenants are unified in their purpose but diverse in their historical administration." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Jesus Christ is the ultimate covenant mediator and fulfiller.
    - All previous covenants point forward to and find their completion in Christ.
    - The New Covenant brings the blessings and obligations of previous covenants to their climax.
    - Frame stresses the inseparability of **covenant and kingdom** in Christ’s work.
    - "Christ is the center and fulfillment of all God’s covenantal dealings." ("Salvation Belongs to the Lord")

4. **Law and Grace in Covenant Context**
    - Frame rejects any absolute dichotomy between law and grace within the covenants.
    - The law is always given within the context of God’s gracious relationship.
    - Obedience is a covenantal response to grace, not a means of earning favor.
    - The Mosaic covenant, while legal in form, is grounded in prior grace.
    - "Law and grace are not opposites, but both are essential aspects of the covenant relationship." ("Doctrine of the Christian Life")

5. **Covenant and Kingdom Ethics**
    - The covenants establish the ethical norms for God’s people.
    - Frame’s tri-perspectivalism shapes his understanding of covenantal ethics (normative, situational, existential).
    - Kingdom living is the outworking of covenantal obligations in all of life.
    - The church, as the covenant community, embodies the ethics of the kingdom.
    - "Covenant is the foundation of Christian ethics and kingdom life." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s covenant theology has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by integrating the biblical covenants into his tri-perspectival method. His emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the centrality of Christ has influenced pastors, theologians, and students seeking a holistic understanding of Scripture. Frame’s work continues to foster robust discussions on the relationship between **law, grace, and kingdom** within the covenantal framework. His approach remains a vital resource for those engaging with the structure and meaning of biblical covenants today.
