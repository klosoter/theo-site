# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **biblical covenants** emphasizes the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **union with Christ**. He situates the covenants within the broader framework of **biblical theology**, highlighting their unfolding through the history of **revelation** and their fulfillment in Christ’s person and work.

- "The history of redemption is covenantal in structure and Christologically centered." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ" (in The Law is Not of Faith, ed. by Bryan Estelle et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Structure of Redemptive History**
   - The **covenants** provide the organizing principle for understanding the flow of **redemptive history**.
   - Each major biblical covenant (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) is organically related and climaxes in Christ.
   - The covenants are not isolated dispensations but progressive revelations of God’s redemptive purpose.
   - The unity of the covenants underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments.
   - "The history of special revelation is covenantal from beginning to end." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment of the Covenants**
   - All biblical covenants find their fulfillment in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is the true seed of Abraham and the mediator of the **new covenant**.
   - The promises and obligations of the covenants are realized in Christ’s death and resurrection.
   - The believer’s participation in the covenant is grounded in **union with Christ**.
   - "Christ is the eschatological realization of all covenantal promises." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Union with Christ as Covenant Participation**
   - **Union with Christ** is the means by which believers partake in the blessings of the covenant.
   - Justification, sanctification, and adoption are all covenant benefits received through union with Christ.
   - The Spirit’s work unites believers to Christ, making them heirs of the covenant promises.
   - The covenant relationship is fundamentally relational and participatory, not merely legal.
   - "All the benefits of salvation flow from union with Christ, the covenant head." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Covenant and Eschatology**
   - The covenants are intrinsically eschatological, pointing forward to consummation in Christ.
   - The resurrection inaugurates the new creation promised in the new covenant.
   - The already/not yet tension of eschatology is rooted in the unfolding of the covenants.
   - The church lives between the inauguration and consummation of the covenant promises.
   - "Eschatology is not an appendix to covenant theology but its very heart." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in the Covenants**
   - There is fundamental **continuity** in God’s covenant dealings, but also significant **discontinuity** with the coming of Christ.
   - The Mosaic covenant is fulfilled and transcended in the new covenant.
   - The law’s function within the covenant is redefined in light of Christ’s fulfillment.
   - The people of God are reconstituted in Christ, transcending ethnic Israel.
   - "The new covenant is both the fulfillment and transformation of all that preceded it." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s covenant theology has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in its emphasis on the centrality of **union with Christ** and the organic unity of redemptive history. His work has influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By integrating covenantal and eschatological themes, Gaffin has contributed to a richer understanding of the coherence of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in all of God’s redemptive dealings.
