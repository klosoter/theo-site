# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the **biblical covenants** as central to the unfolding of **redemptive history** and the unity of **Scripture**. He emphasized the progressive revelation of the **Covenant of Grace**, seeing the covenants as divinely instituted means by which God relates to His people, culminating in the work of **Christ**.

- "The covenant is the form in which God has from the beginning chosen to maintain His relations with men." ("The Plan of Salvation")

## Key Works

- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- "The Idea of Systematic Theology"
- "Revelation and Inspiration"
- Selected articles in The Princeton Theological Review

   - "The Covenant of Grace is one and the same in all dispensations." ("The Plan of Salvation")

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Covenants**
   - Affirmed that God’s covenantal dealings are revealed progressively throughout Scripture.
   - Each covenant builds upon previous revelation, culminating in Christ.
   - The **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, and **New Covenants** are seen as stages in this unfolding plan.
   - Warfield stressed the organic development of biblical theology.
   - "The revelation of the covenant is progressive, reaching its fullness in the New Covenant." ("The Plan of Salvation")

   - The promises to Abraham and David find their realization in Jesus.
   - The New Covenant is the consummation of God’s redemptive plan.

   - Insisted on the necessity of biblical exegesis for understanding the covenants.
   - Defended the Reformed confessional tradition’s covenantal framework.

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **Covenant of Grace** reinforced the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ. His work influenced later covenant theologians and helped shape the confessional identity of American Presbyterianism. Warfield’s insistence on the authority of Scripture and the organic development of biblical covenants continues to inform contemporary discussions in systematic theology.
