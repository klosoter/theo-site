# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the **biblical covenants** not as fixed legal arrangements but as historical expressions of the evolving **God-consciousness** within the Christian community. He reinterpreted traditional covenant theology through the lens of **religious experience** and the development of **Christian faith**, emphasizing the unity of divine revelation rather than discrete covenantal epochs.

- "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenants as Expressions of God-Consciousness**
    - Covenants are not external contracts but manifestations of the developing **God-consciousness** in humanity.
    - The biblical narrative reflects the progressive realization of the divine-human relationship.
    - The Old and New Covenants are stages in the unfolding awareness of God’s presence.
    - Emphasizes inward transformation over external legal arrangements.
    - "The covenants are but historical forms in which the religious self-consciousness is realized." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Unity of Divine Revelation**
    - Rejects sharp discontinuities between Old and New Covenants.
    - Sees revelation as a continuous, organic process culminating in Christ.
    - The covenants are unified by their role in mediating the divine to human consciousness.
    - Christ is the highest expression of the covenant, embodying perfect God-consciousness.
    - "Revelation is a living process, not a series of disconnected acts." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - The meaning of covenant is found in the experience of **absolute dependence** on God.
    - Downplays juridical or forensic aspects in favor of existential and communal dimensions.
    - The church is the community where the covenant is experienced and deepened.
    - Faith, not law, is the primary mode of covenantal relationship.
    - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing but a distinct feeling." (On Religion)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant**
    - Christ represents the perfect realization of the divine-human relationship.
    - The New Covenant is not a new legal arrangement but the full manifestation of God-consciousness in Christ.
    - The person of Christ is central, not the external form of the covenant.
    - The church participates in the covenant through union with Christ.
    - "In Christ, the divine and human are perfectly united." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
    - Doctrine, including covenant theology, develops in response to the church’s historical context.
    - The understanding of covenant adapts as the community’s God-consciousness matures.
    - Emphasizes the dynamic, not static, nature of theological concepts.
    - Tradition is valuable insofar as it expresses the living faith of the community.
    - "Dogmas are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **biblical covenants** shifted the focus from legal and forensic categories to the inward, experiential dimension of faith. His emphasis on the unity of revelation and the centrality of **God-consciousness** influenced modern liberal theology and paved the way for later existential and historical approaches to covenant. While his views diverged sharply from classical Reformed covenant theology, his work remains foundational for understanding the evolution of modern Christian thought on the nature of the divine-human relationship.
