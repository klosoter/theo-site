# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology of the **biblical covenants** is foundational for later Reformed thought, emphasizing the unity and continuity of **God’s redemptive plan** across the Old and New Testaments. He distinguishes between the **Old Covenant** and the **New Covenant** while maintaining that both are administrations of the one **covenant of grace**, centered on Christ as the Mediator.

- "All the covenants made with the fathers were so many renewals of the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 9–11)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Hebrews
- Commentary on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** underlies both Old and New Testaments.
    - Salvation is always by faith in Christ, not by works.
    - The substance of the covenant remains unchanged; only the administration differs.
    - The promises given to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

2. **Distinction Between Old and New Covenant Administrations**
    - The **Old Covenant** is marked by shadows and ceremonies pointing to Christ.
    - The **New Covenant** brings greater clarity and fulfillment in Christ.
    - The external forms change, but the internal spiritual reality is consistent.
    - The law serves a pedagogical function, leading to Christ.
    - "The Old Testament gave birth to hope, and the New Testament gives substance to it." (Institutes, 2.11.4)

3. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the center and substance of both covenants.
    - All covenant promises find their fulfillment in Him.
    - The patriarchs looked forward to Christ by faith.
    - The sacraments of both covenants signify union with Christ.
    - "Christ, therefore, is the foundation of the covenant, and the only bond of connection between God and men." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

4. **Role of the Law in the Covenant**
    - The law reveals God’s righteousness and human sinfulness.
    - It functions as a tutor to lead sinners to Christ.
    - The moral law remains binding, while ceremonial laws are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The law is not opposed to grace but serves its purposes.
    - "The law was given, not to restrain the covenant of grace, but to confirm it." (Institutes, 2.7.2)

5. **Inclusion of Believers’ Children in the Covenant**
    - The covenant promises extend to believers and their offspring.
    - Infant baptism is justified as the sign of covenant inclusion.
    - The church is the continuation of Israel as the covenant community.
    - The unity of the people of God is maintained across the covenants.
    - "The children of believers are heirs of the promise, and therefore to be baptized." (Institutes, 4.16.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust doctrine of the **covenant of grace** shaped the trajectory of Reformed covenant theology, influencing later theologians such as **Herman Witsius** and the Westminster divines. His emphasis on the unity of God’s redemptive plan provided a framework for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. Calvin’s teaching on the inclusion of believers’ children in the covenant laid the groundwork for the Reformed practice of infant baptism. His covenantal insights remain central to Reformed identity and biblical interpretation.
