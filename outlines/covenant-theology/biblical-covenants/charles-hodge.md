# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a robust doctrine of the **biblical covenants** within the framework of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the unity and continuity of **God’s redemptive plan**. He distinguished between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, grounding them in the exegesis of Scripture and integrating them into his broader **systematic theology**.

- "The plan of salvation has always been the same. It has always been by grace, through faith, founded on a covenant." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
   - God established a **Covenant of Works** with Adam as the representative of humanity.
   - The promise of life was conditioned on perfect obedience.
   - The breach of this covenant resulted in the fall and condemnation of all humanity.
   - This covenant sets the stage for understanding the necessity of redemption.
   - "The covenant made with Adam was a real covenant, with a promise of life and a penalty of death." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Covenant of Grace as the Means of Salvation**
   - After the fall, God instituted the **Covenant of Grace** to provide salvation for the elect.
   - This covenant is rooted in God’s sovereign initiative and mercy.
   - Christ is the mediator and fulfiller of the Covenant of Grace.
   - The covenant is administered through various dispensations but remains essentially one.
   - "The covenant of grace is the plan of salvation, which God has revealed, and which He has carried out from the time of the fall." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **Covenant of Grace** spans both Old and New Testaments.
   - The substance of the covenant remains unchanged, though its administration differs.
   - Old Testament believers were saved by faith in the promised Redeemer.
   - The New Testament reveals the fulfillment of the covenant in Christ.
   - "There are not two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same under different dispensations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Federal Headship and Representation**
   - Adam and Christ serve as federal heads in their respective covenants.
   - Adam’s disobedience brings condemnation to all he represents.
   - Christ’s obedience secures righteousness for all in Him.
   - This federal principle undergirds both condemnation and redemption.
   - "The principle of representation runs through the whole plan of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Basis for Covenant Theology**
   - Hodge grounds his covenant theology in careful exegesis of Scripture.
   - He sees the covenants as the organizing principle of biblical revelation.
   - The promises, types, and ceremonies of the Old Testament point to Christ.
   - The New Testament interprets and fulfills the covenant promises.
   - "The whole plan of redemption is presented in the Scriptures under the form of a covenant." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **biblical covenants** became a cornerstone of American Presbyterian theology and influenced generations of Reformed theologians. His clear distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace** provided a framework for understanding the unity of Scripture and the nature of salvation. Hodge’s covenant theology remains a foundational reference point in systematic theology, especially within the confessional Reformed tradition.
