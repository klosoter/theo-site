# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached the **biblical covenants** primarily through the lens of **Law and Gospel**, emphasizing the distinction between the **Old Covenant** (Law) and the **New Covenant** (Gospel) fulfilled in Christ. He viewed the covenants as central to understanding **justification by faith alone**, seeing the promises of God in the covenants as realized and secured through Christ’s redemptive work.

- "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. Grace says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 26)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Commentary on Genesis (1535–1545)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Law-Gospel Distinction**
   - The **Old Covenant** is fundamentally characterized by Law, demanding obedience.
   - The **New Covenant** is the proclamation of the Gospel, offering forgiveness through Christ.
   - The Law exposes sin and drives one to seek grace.
   - The Gospel fulfills the promises of the covenants in Christ alone.
   - "The distinction between Law and Gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Covenants as Promises of God**
   - God’s covenants are unilateral promises, not mutual contracts.
   - The Abrahamic covenant is a prime example of God’s gracious initiative.
   - Faith receives the promise; works do not secure it.
   - Christ is the fulfillment and substance of all covenant promises.
   - "The promise must be believed; it cannot be obtained by works." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Christ as Mediator of the New Covenant**
   - Christ alone mediates the blessings of the New Covenant.
   - The Old Testament covenants point forward to Christ’s atoning work.
   - The sacraments are signs and seals of the New Covenant in Christ.
   - The believer’s union with Christ is the means of receiving covenant blessings.
   - "Christ is the end of the law, that everyone who has faith may be justified." (Romans Preface)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
   - There is a real distinction between the covenants, but also a unity in God’s redemptive plan.
   - The Law prepares for the Gospel, but cannot save.
   - The promises to Abraham are realized in the New Covenant community.
   - The ceremonial aspects of the Old Covenant are abolished in Christ.
   - "The Old Testament is the book of the Law, the New Testament is the book of the Gospel." (Table Talk)

5. **Justification by Faith Alone**
   - The heart of the New Covenant is justification by faith, not by works.
   - The Law’s demands are met only in Christ, not in human effort.
   - The believer is declared righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s merit.
   - Assurance of salvation rests on God’s covenant promise, not human achievement.
   - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the law." (Romans Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s interpretation of the **biblical covenants** profoundly shaped Protestant theology, especially the centrality of **justification by faith** and the Law-Gospel distinction. His emphasis on the unilateral nature of God’s promises influenced later Reformation and Lutheran understandings of the covenants. While he did not develop a systematic covenant theology like later Reformed thinkers, his insights laid crucial groundwork for subsequent debates on the continuity and discontinuity between the Testaments. Luther’s approach continues to inform discussions on the relationship between the Old and New Covenants in biblical and systematic theology.
