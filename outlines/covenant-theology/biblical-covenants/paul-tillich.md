# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the concept of **biblical covenants** through his broader framework of **symbolic theology** and **systematic correlation**. Rather than focusing on the historical or legal aspects of covenants, Tillich interpreted them as expressions of the **divine-human relationship**, emphasizing their existential and ontological significance within the context of **revelation** and **faith**.

- "The biblical covenant is a symbol for the relationship in which man participates in the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Interpretation of History
- The Protestant Era
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic Expression**
    - Covenants are not literal contracts but **symbols** of the relationship between God and humanity.
    - They point to the **ultimate concern** that defines faith.
    - The language of covenant mediates the **divine self-disclosure** in history.
    - Covenants function as existential realities, not merely historical events.
    - "The covenant is a symbol for the participation of man in the divine life." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Revelation Through Covenant**
    - The **covenant** is a primary mode of **revelation** in biblical religion.
    - It reveals the **character of God** as both transcendent and immanent.
    - The covenantal relationship is dynamic, involving both divine initiative and human response.
    - Revelation in the covenant is mediated through history and community.
    - "Revelation is always a revelation in and through the covenantal relationship." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Covenant**
    - Covenants address the **existential estrangement** of humanity from God.
    - They symbolize the possibility of **reconciliation** and **new being**.
    - The existential meaning of covenant transcends specific historical forms.
    - Human participation in the covenant is an act of **faith** and **acceptance**.
    - "The existential meaning of the covenant is the overcoming of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Universal and Particular Dimensions**
    - Tillich sees the **biblical covenants** as having both universal and particular significance.
    - The particular history of Israel points to universal human concerns.
    - The covenant with Israel is a symbol of the universal possibility of **divine-human encounter**.
    - This duality reflects the tension between the concrete and the ultimate in religious symbols.
    - "The particular covenant with Israel has universal significance as a symbol of the divine-human relationship." (Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality)

5. **Covenant and the New Being in Christ**
    - The **New Covenant** is fulfilled in the person and work of **Jesus as the Christ**.
    - Christ represents the ultimate realization of the covenantal promise.
    - The **New Being** in Christ is the existential fulfillment of the covenant.
    - The church as the community of the New Covenant embodies this new reality.
    - "In Christ, the covenant reaches its fulfillment as the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of **biblical covenants** shifted the conversation from legal or historical frameworks to existential and ontological dimensions, influencing later **systematic theology** and hermeneutics. His approach encouraged theologians to see covenants as dynamic symbols of the **divine-human relationship** rather than static doctrines. While his existential method diverged from traditional Reformed covenant theology, Tillich’s work remains a significant resource for those exploring the intersection of **symbolism**, revelation, and faith in the biblical narrative.
