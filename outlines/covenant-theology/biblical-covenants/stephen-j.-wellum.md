# Stephen J. Wellum (1966–)

Stephen J. Wellum is a leading contemporary proponent of **progressive covenantalism**, offering a mediating position between **covenant theology** and **dispensationalism**. He emphasizes the unfolding nature of the **biblical covenants** as the backbone of **redemptive history**, culminating in the person and work of **Jesus Christ** as the fulfillment of all God’s promises.

- "The biblical covenants are the backbone of the storyline of Scripture and are essential for understanding the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan." ("Kingdom through Covenant")

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Peter J. Gentry)
- Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenantal Theologies (editor)
- Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior
- "Baptism and the Relationship Between the Covenants" (in Believer’s Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ)
- "From Adam to Christ: The Covenants as the Structure of God’s Plan" (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Covenantalism as a Middle Way**
    - Argues for a position distinct from both classic **covenant theology** and **dispensationalism**.
    - Sees the covenants as progressively revealed and organically connected.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s plan while respecting the diversity of the covenants.
    - Maintains that each covenant builds upon and clarifies the previous ones.
    - "Progressive covenantalism seeks to do justice to the progression and fulfillment of the covenants in Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Christological Fulfillment of the Covenants**
    - Asserts that all biblical covenants find their ultimate fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Views Christ as the true **seed of Abraham**, the Davidic King, and the mediator of the **new covenant**.
    - Argues that typology and promise are realized in the person and work of Christ.
    - Stresses that the new covenant supersedes and transforms previous covenants.
    - "All of God’s promises are yes and amen in Christ, who fulfills the covenants in himself." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **The Covenants as the Structure of Redemptive History**
    - Treats the covenants as the organizing principle for understanding **redemptive history**.
    - Highlights the progression from **creation**, through **Abraham**, **Moses**, **David**, to the **new covenant**.
    - Argues that the covenants reveal God’s unfolding plan and purposes.
    - Insists that biblical theology must be covenantally structured.
    - "The covenants provide the framework for the entire storyline of Scripture." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Discontinuity and Continuity in Covenant Relationships**
    - Affirms both continuity and discontinuity between the covenants, especially between the old and new.
    - Rejects the idea of a simple one-to-one correspondence between Israel and the church.
    - Argues that the new covenant community is defined by regeneration and faith, not ethnicity or physical descent.
    - Maintains that the law is fulfilled in Christ and applied to believers through the new covenant.
    - "The new covenant brings both continuity and discontinuity with what has come before." (Progressive Covenantalism)

5. **Baptism and New Covenant Membership**
    - Contends that **baptism** is the sign of new covenant membership, administered only to believers.
    - Rejects infant baptism on the grounds of new covenant realities.
    - Emphasizes that new covenant membership is marked by faith and the indwelling Spirit.
    - Argues that the church is the new covenant community, distinct from national Israel.
    - "Only those who have faith in Christ and are united to him by the Spirit are members of the new covenant." (Believer’s Baptism)

## Legacy and Impact

Stephen J. Wellum has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on the **biblical covenants** by articulating and defending progressive covenantalism. His work has provided a robust alternative to both traditional **Reformed covenant theology** and dispensationalism, influencing pastors, scholars, and students. Wellum’s emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the structure of redemptive history has deepened evangelical appreciation for the coherence of Scripture. His writings continue to provoke fruitful debate and reflection on the nature of the covenants and their implications for the church.
