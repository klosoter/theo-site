# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not affirm the traditional doctrine of the **Covenant of Redemption** as articulated in Reformed theology. Instead, he approached such dogmatic constructs through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**, focusing on the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with God in Christ. For Bultmann, the significance of Christ’s work is not found in pre-temporal intra-Trinitarian covenants but in the existential decision of faith prompted by the proclamation of the gospel.

- "Mythological eschatology must be replaced by the existentialist interpretation, which asks what the eschatological event means for me here and now." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Interprets biblical narratives, including covenant motifs, as mythological expressions of existential truths.
    - Rejects literal or metaphysical readings of pre-temporal covenants.
    - Seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind biblical language.
    - Views the **Covenant of Redemption** as a theological construct, not a historical or metaphysical reality.
    - "The real question is not whether the New Testament is mythological, but whether we can accept its message apart from its mythology." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Salvation**
    - Emphasizes the individual's encounter with God in the present.
    - Salvation is not grounded in eternal decrees but in the existential response to the **kerygma**.
    - The meaning of Christ’s work is realized in personal faith, not in pre-temporal agreements within the Godhead.
    - Downplays the importance of speculative dogmatic formulations.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept death." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Christology Centered on Proclamation**
    - Christ’s significance is found in the proclamation (kerygma), not in metaphysical covenants.
    - The focus is on the existential impact of Christ’s message.
    - Rejects speculative Trinitarian frameworks as the basis for understanding Christ’s mission.
    - The relationship between Father and Son is interpreted through the lens of revelation and faith.
    - "Jesus Christ is the eschatological event in so far as he is proclaimed." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Critique of Traditional Dogmatics**
    - Questions the legitimacy of speculative doctrines like the **Covenant of Redemption**.
    - Argues that such doctrines are products of a mythological worldview.
    - Calls for a theology rooted in existential understanding rather than metaphysical speculation.
    - Sees dogmatic covenants as barriers to authentic faith.
    - "Dogmatics must be freed from the mythological framework of the past." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Priority of Present Encounter Over Pre-temporal Decrees**
    - The decisive moment is the individual's present encounter with the Word.
    - Pre-temporal covenants are irrelevant to the existential reality of faith.
    - Theological meaning is found in the now, not in eternal transactions within the Trinity.
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is reinterpreted, if at all, as a symbol of God’s initiative in the present.
    - "What matters is the decision here and now, not a metaphysical event in eternity." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Covenant of Redemption** has profoundly shaped modern theology’s skepticism toward speculative dogmatic constructs. His emphasis on **demythologization** and existential interpretation redirected theological focus from pre-temporal covenants to the immediacy of faith and proclamation. While his views have been sharply criticized by confessional traditions, his work remains influential in discussions about the nature of biblical language, the meaning of salvation, and the limits of systematic theology. Bultmann’s legacy endures in the ongoing debate over the relationship between history, faith, and dogma.
