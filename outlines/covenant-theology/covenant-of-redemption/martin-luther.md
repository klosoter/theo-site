# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not explicitly formulate the **Covenant of Redemption** as later Reformed theologians did, but his theology of salvation centers on the eternal will and decree of God to save sinners through **Christ’s mediatorial work**. Luther emphasized the **pre-temporal counsel** of God and the unity of the Father and the Son in the plan of redemption, focusing on the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s atonement as the outworking of God’s eternal purpose. While he did not use covenantal terminology in this context, his doctrine of **divine election** and the **Trinitarian sending** of the Son align with key aspects of the later covenant of redemption concept.

- "Christ is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, and this was determined in the counsel of the Godhead." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- Commentary on Genesis
- Sermons on John’s Gospel
- Luther’s Small Catechism (for Christological focus)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Mission Rooted in God’s Eternal Will**
    - God’s purpose to save is established before creation.
    - The sending of Christ is the outworking of the Father’s eternal decree.
    - The unity of the Father and Son in redemption is central.
    - Christ’s obedience fulfills the divine plan for salvation.
    - "The sending of the Son was not an accident, but the will of God from eternity." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Emphasis on Divine Election**
    - Salvation is grounded in God’s sovereign choice, not human merit.
    - The elect are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
    - Election is inseparable from Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Assurance is found in Christ, the object of God’s eternal favor.
    - "God has chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world." (Commentary on Genesis)

3. **Trinitarian Shape of Redemption**
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - The persons of the Trinity act in harmony for the salvation of the elect.
    - The Son’s obedience is offered to the Father on behalf of sinners.
    - The Spirit brings the benefits of Christ’s work to believers.
    - "The Father gave the Son, and the Son gave Himself for us, and the Holy Spirit brings us to faith." (Sermons on John’s Gospel)

4. **Necessity and Sufficiency of Christ’s Atonement**
    - Christ’s sacrifice was foreordained by God for the salvation of sinners.
    - The atonement is sufficient for all, but effective for the elect.
    - The cross is the center of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Faith receives what Christ has accomplished according to God’s eternal purpose.
    - "Christ is the Lamb of God, slain for the sins of the world, as God determined from eternity." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Scripture as the Revelation of God’s Redemptive Plan**
    - The Bible reveals God’s eternal purpose in Christ.
    - The promises of the Old Testament point to the fulfillment in Jesus.
    - The gospel proclaims the accomplishment of God’s eternal will.
    - Faith is grounded in the Word, which unveils God’s saving counsel.
    - "The Scriptures testify of Christ, in whom the eternal counsel of God is made known." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s theology laid the groundwork for later reflection on the **Covenant of Redemption**, especially through his focus on the eternal will of God and the centrality of Christ’s mediatorial work. While he did not develop a formal covenantal framework, his insights into **divine election** and the **Trinitarian structure of salvation** influenced subsequent Protestant thought. Reformed theologians built upon these foundations to articulate the covenant of redemption more explicitly, recognizing Luther’s pivotal role in shaping the doctrine’s underlying convictions.
