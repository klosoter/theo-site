# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **Covenant of Redemption** as a foundational aspect of **Reformed theology**, viewing it as the eternal intra-Trinitarian agreement that grounds the work of **redemption** in history. He emphasizes the unity of the **divine plan**, the roles of the **Father, Son, and Spirit**, and the covenantal structure of all of God's dealings with humanity. Frame integrates the **Covenant of Redemption** into his broader emphasis on **Lordship**, **tri-perspectivalism**, and the coherence of God's redemptive purposes.

- "The covenant of redemption is the eternal plan of God, in which the persons of the Trinity agree together to accomplish the salvation of God’s people." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Foundation of the Covenant**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is an agreement among the Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - Each person of the Trinity has distinct roles: the Father sends, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit applies.
   - The unity of the Godhead is preserved even as distinct covenantal roles are affirmed.
   - This covenant is the eternal basis for the historical **Covenant of Grace**.
   - "The covenant of redemption is a covenant among the persons of the Trinity, expressing their unity and diversity in the work of salvation." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Eternality and Immutability**
   - The covenant is eternal, existing before creation.
   - It reflects the **immutability** of God's will and purpose.
   - There is no contingency or change in God's redemptive plan.
   - The eternal nature of the covenant guarantees the certainty of redemption.
   - "God’s plan of redemption is eternal, unchangeable, and certain because it is rooted in his own eternal counsel." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
   - Redemption is structured covenantally, not merely as a decree.
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** provides the legal and relational framework for Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - The Son voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption as covenant representative.
   - The covenant includes promises, conditions, and rewards within the Godhead.
   - "The covenant of redemption is the legal and relational foundation for Christ’s work as mediator." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Integration with Lordship and Tri-Perspectivalism**
   - The covenant is understood through Frame’s **Lordship attributes**: control, authority, and presence.
   - Each perspective (normative, situational, existential) illuminates aspects of the covenant.
   - The Father’s authority, the Son’s obedience, and the Spirit’s application correspond to these perspectives.
   - This integration shows the practical and doctrinal coherence of the covenant.
   - "The doctrine of the covenant of redemption fits naturally with the lordship of God and the perspectives of his revelation." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Ground for Assurance and Application**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** undergirds the believer’s assurance of salvation.
   - It demonstrates the reliability of God’s promises in the **Covenant of Grace**.
   - The believer’s union with Christ is rooted in this eternal covenant.
   - Practical Christian living flows from the security of God’s eternal plan.
   - "Our assurance rests on the unbreakable covenant made within the Trinity itself." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **Covenant of Redemption** has reinforced its significance within contemporary Reformed theology, especially by integrating it with his broader theological method and Lordship paradigm. His clear, accessible presentation has helped students and pastors grasp the covenant’s biblical and doctrinal foundations. Frame’s work has contributed to renewed appreciation for the unity of the **Trinitarian plan of salvation** and its implications for assurance, worship, and Christian ethics.
