# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not affirm the **Covenant of Redemption** as understood in classical **Reformed theology**. Instead, his theology centered on the **Ground of Being**, **existential estrangement**, and the **New Being in Christ**, interpreting biblical covenants symbolically rather than as intra-Trinitarian agreements. Tillich’s approach reframed traditional doctrines, emphasizing the existential and ontological dimensions of divine-human relationship over federal or covenantal constructs.

- "The concept of covenant is a symbol for the relationship between God and man, not a legal contract within the Godhead." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Covenant**
    - Covenants are understood as existential symbols, not literal or historical contracts.
    - The biblical language of covenant points to the depth of the divine-human encounter.
    - Rejects the notion of an intra-Trinitarian pact as found in the **Covenant of Redemption**.
    - Emphasizes the symbolic mediation of ultimate concern through covenant imagery.
    - "The covenant is a symbol of the divine-human relationship, not a metaphysical arrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Primacy of the Ground of Being**
    - God is not a being among beings but the very **Ground of Being**.
    - Theological constructs like the **Covenant of Redemption** are reinterpreted in light of ontological categories.
    - Divine action is understood as the manifestation of being-itself, not as contractual agreement.
    - The focus is on God’s self-revelation rather than intra-divine transactions.
    - "God is the ground of being, not a participant in legal or contractual relationships." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ represents the **New Being** who overcomes existential estrangement.
    - Redemption is seen as the actualization of unity between God and humanity in Christ.
    - The work of Christ is not grounded in a pre-temporal covenant but in the existential transformation he brings.
    - The meaning of redemption is existential, not federal or forensic.
    - "In Christ, the New Being appears, overcoming the estrangement between God and man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Existential Estrangement and Reconciliation**
    - Humanity’s primary problem is existential estrangement from the **Ground of Being**.
    - Reconciliation is achieved through participation in the New Being, not through fulfillment of a covenantal pact.
    - The language of covenant is appropriated to express the depth of existential reconciliation.
    - The focus is on healing the existential rift, not on satisfying covenantal stipulations.
    - "Estrangement is overcome not by contract but by participation in the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Rejection of Federal Theology**
    - Tillich explicitly distances himself from **federal or covenant theology** frameworks.
    - He critiques the legalistic and forensic tendencies of traditional covenantal constructs.
    - Theological focus shifts from legal arrangements to existential and ontological realities.
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is seen as a historical-theological development, not a necessary dogmatic truth.
    - "The federal scheme is inadequate for expressing the existential relationship between God and man." (A History of Christian Thought)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **covenant** language profoundly influenced 20th-century theology, shifting the focus from legal and federal categories to existential and ontological concerns. His rejection of the **Covenant of Redemption** as a literal intra-Trinitarian pact challenged traditional Reformed formulations and encouraged a symbolic, existential reading of biblical motifs. While his views were often at odds with confessional Reformed theology, Tillich’s work remains a significant point of dialogue in discussions of covenant, redemption, and the nature of divine-human relationship.
