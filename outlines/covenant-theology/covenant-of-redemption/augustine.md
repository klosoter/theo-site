# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly formulate the **Covenant of Redemption** as later Reformed theology would, but his writings on the **Trinity**, the **eternal will of God**, and the **mission of the Son** laid crucial groundwork for later covenantal thought. He emphasized the **eternal relationship** between the Father and the Son, the **divine plan of salvation**, and the unity of purpose within the Godhead, themes that would later be foundational for the doctrine of the Covenant of Redemption.

- "The will of the Father and the will of the Son are one, as their nature is one." (De Trinitate, Book I)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Confessiones (Confessions)
- Sermons and Letters (various, on the unity of God’s salvific plan)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Will**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share a single, undivided will.
    - The mission of the Son is rooted in the eternal purpose of the Triune God.
    - There is no division or conflict within the Godhead regarding salvation.
    - The Son’s obedience is a manifestation of intra-Trinitarian harmony.
    - "For the works of the Trinity are inseparable." (De Trinitate, I.7)

2. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not made, by the Father.
    - This eternal relationship grounds the Son’s mission in time.
    - The sending of the Son reflects an eternal order, not subordination.
    - The Son’s role in redemption is consistent with His eternal identity.
    - "The Father is not the Son, but the Father of the Son; and the Son is not the Father, but the Son of the Father." (De Trinitate, V.8)

3. **Divine Plan of Salvation**
    - God’s purpose to save is eternal and unchanging.
    - The incarnation and atonement are the outworking of God’s eternal decree.
    - The Son’s redemptive work is not a reaction but a fulfillment of divine intent.
    - The unity of the plan reflects the unity of the Godhead.
    - "For nothing happens unless the Omnipotent wills it to happen." (Enchiridion, 95)

4. **Christ’s Voluntary Mission**
    - The Son willingly assumes human nature for redemption.
    - The obedience of Christ is freely given, not coerced.
    - The Son’s mission is a demonstration of divine love and purpose.
    - The incarnation is a voluntary act within the eternal counsel of God.
    - "He was sent, not because He was less than the Father, but because He was Son." (De Trinitate, II.9)

5. **Foundation for Later Covenant Theology**
    - Augustine’s Trinitarian framework influenced later covenantal developments.
    - His emphasis on divine unity and purpose shaped Reformed thought.
    - The concept of an eternal agreement within the Godhead finds roots in his theology.
    - Augustine’s categories provided the basis for the later doctrine of the Covenant of Redemption.
    - "The New Testament lies hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum, II.73)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s profound reflections on the **Trinity**, the eternal will of God, and the mission of Christ provided essential categories for the later development of the Covenant of Redemption in Reformed theology. While he did not articulate the doctrine in its mature form, his influence is evident in the way later theologians conceptualized the **eternal counsel** and unity of purpose within the Godhead. Augustine’s thought remains foundational for discussions of divine economy and intra-Trinitarian relations in the history of Christian doctrine.
