# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck robustly affirmed the **Covenant of Redemption** (pactum salutis) as the eternal intra-Trinitarian agreement forming the foundation for the **Covenant of Grace** and the accomplishment of **redemption**. He emphasized the unity of the divine will, the distinct roles of the **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Spirit**, and the necessity of this eternal covenant for the coherence of **Reformed soteriology**.

- "The covenant of redemption is the eternal foundation and presupposition of the covenant of grace." ("Reformed Dogmatics," 3.213)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Sacrifice of Christ and the Idea of Satisfaction in Recent Theology" (essay)
- "The Certainty of Faith" (relevant for covenantal assurance)
- Herman Bavinck: Pastor, Churchman, and Theologian (Ron Gleason, secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Intra-Trinitarian Agreement**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is an eternal pact within the **Trinity**.
   - The **Father** appoints the **Son** as Mediator and the **Son** voluntarily accepts.
   - The **Holy Spirit** is promised to apply redemption to the elect.
   - This covenant precedes and grounds all historical covenants with humanity.
   - "It is not a covenant between God and man, but between the Father and the Son, with the Spirit as witness and executor." (Reformed Dogmatics 3.213)

2. **Unity and Distinction in the Divine Will**
   - The three persons act in perfect unity, not as separate beings.
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** does not divide the divine essence.
   - Each person’s role is distinct but inseparable from the others.
   - The pactum salutis reveals the harmony of the **Trinitarian economy**.
   - "There is but one will in God, but in the work of redemption it is revealed in a threefold manner." (Reformed Dogmatics 3.214)

3. **Foundation for the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is the basis for the historical **Covenant of Grace**.
   - All promises to the elect are secured by the eternal agreement.
   - The Son’s obedience and satisfaction are guaranteed by this pact.
   - The certainty of salvation rests on the unbreakable intra-Trinitarian covenant.
   - "The covenant of grace rests on the covenant of redemption; it is its temporal execution." (Reformed Dogmatics 3.215)

4. **Christ’s Mediatorial Work**
   - Christ’s role as Mediator is rooted in the eternal pact.
   - His obedience, suffering, and exaltation are stipulated in the **Covenant of Redemption**.
   - The elect are given to Christ as His reward.
   - Christ’s work is both representative and substitutionary, fulfilling the pact’s terms.
   - "The Son receives from the Father a people to redeem, and in return, He gives Himself in obedience and sacrifice." (Reformed Dogmatics 3.216)

5. **Necessity for Reformed Soteriology**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** preserves the initiative and sovereignty of God in salvation.
   - It guards against both Pelagianism and arbitrary voluntarism.
   - The pactum salutis ensures the objective ground of redemption.
   - It upholds the immutability and faithfulness of God’s redemptive purpose.
   - "Without the covenant of redemption, the certainty and immutability of salvation would be lost." (Reformed Dogmatics 3.217)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of the **Covenant of Redemption** has shaped modern Reformed theology, providing a coherent framework for understanding the unity of the **Trinitarian work** in salvation. His careful balance of divine unity and personal distinction has influenced subsequent dogmatic treatments of the pactum salutis. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the **Covenant of Redemption** and the **Covenant of Grace**, ensuring its continued relevance in systematic theology.
