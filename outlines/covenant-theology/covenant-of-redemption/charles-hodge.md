# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge affirmed the **Covenant of Redemption** as an eternal, intra-Trinitarian agreement forming the basis for the **Covenant of Grace** and the work of **Christ as Mediator**. He viewed this covenant as essential to understanding the unity of the divine plan of salvation, grounding the **atonement** and the security of the elect in the eternal counsel of God.

- "There was, therefore, a covenant between the Father and the Son, or what is called the covenant of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Intra-Trinitarian Agreement**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is an eternal pact within the **Trinity**, particularly between the Father and the Son.
   - It precedes and grounds the historical **Covenant of Grace**.
   - The Father appoints the Son as Mediator, promising Him a people and the necessary gifts.
   - The Son voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption on behalf of the elect.
   - "The plan of salvation is represented as a covenant between the Father and the Son." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Foundation for the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is the eternal basis for God's dealings with humanity in history.
   - It ensures the certainty and efficacy of the **Covenant of Grace**.
   - The benefits of Christ’s work flow from this eternal agreement.
   - The elect are given to Christ as a reward for His obedience and suffering.
   - "The covenant of grace is founded on the covenant of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christ as Federal Head and Surety**
   - Christ acts as the representative and substitute for the elect in the **Covenant of Redemption**.
   - He fulfills the conditions required by the Father, including perfect obedience and atonement.
   - His role as **Mediator** is established by this eternal covenant.
   - The security of the elect rests on Christ’s fulfillment of the covenant.
   - "Christ, as the head and representative of his people, undertook to do all that was required for their salvation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Divine Initiative and Sovereignty**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** highlights the sovereignty of God in salvation.
   - The Father’s election and the Son’s mission are rooted in divine initiative, not human merit.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of redemption according to the eternal counsel.
   - The entire plan is a manifestation of God’s wisdom and grace.
   - "The whole scheme of redemption is represented as originating in the eternal purpose of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Basis and Theological Necessity**
   - Hodge grounds the doctrine in passages such as Psalm 2, Isaiah 53, John 6, and Hebrews 10.
   - He argues that the **Covenant of Redemption** is a necessary implication of biblical teaching on Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - The doctrine safeguards the unity and coherence of the Reformed system.
   - It provides assurance of salvation by rooting it in the unchangeable will of God.
   - "The Scriptures clearly teach that the salvation of men is the accomplishment of a plan devised by the Father and executed by the Son." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **Covenant of Redemption** became a standard reference in American Reformed theology, shaping the Princeton tradition and influencing later systematicians. His emphasis on the eternal, sovereign, and Trinitarian character of the covenant provided a robust framework for understanding **redemptive history** and the security of the elect. Hodge’s careful biblical and theological exposition continues to inform contemporary discussions of covenant theology within the broader Reformed tradition.
