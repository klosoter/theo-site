# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann does not affirm the traditional **Covenant of Redemption** as articulated in classic **Reformed theology**, but his doctrine of the **Trinity** and focus on the **eternal self-giving of God** in the cross and resurrection touch on related themes. Moltmann emphasizes the **intra-Trinitarian relationships** and the **eternal decision** of God for salvation, reframing covenantal categories in terms of **divine love** and **eschatological hope** rather than legal contracts within the Godhead.

- "The history of Jesus is the history of the triune God himself, and the cross is the open wound of the Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- Experiences in Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Relationality Over Legal Covenants**
    - Prioritizes the **relational dynamics** within the Trinity rather than formalized intra-divine covenants.
    - Views the **Father-Son relationship** as one of mutual love and self-giving, not contractual agreement.
    - Sees the cross as the event where the **Trinitarian God** is revealed in history.
    - Rejects speculative constructions about pre-temporal agreements within the Godhead.
    - "The unity of the Trinity lies in the open, self-giving love of the persons for one another." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Eternal Decision for Salvation**
    - Emphasizes God's **eternal purpose** to redeem humanity, but frames it as a decision of love, not a covenant.
    - The **sending of the Son** is rooted in the eternal will of the triune God.
    - The cross is the historical manifestation of this eternal divine resolve.
    - Salvation history is the outworking of God's **eschatological promise**.
    - "God’s history with the world is grounded in his own eternal decision for the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

3. **The Cross as Revelation of Divine Self-Giving**
    - The **crucifixion** is central to understanding God's eternal nature.
    - The cross reveals the **self-surrender** of the Father and the Son in the Spirit.
    - This event is not a fulfillment of a legal pact but the expression of **divine love**.
    - The suffering of God in Christ is the foundation for hope and reconciliation.
    - "In the cross, the Son suffers the abandonment of the Father, and the Father suffers the death of the Son." (The Crucified God)

4. **Critique of Classical Covenant Theology**
    - Questions the usefulness of **pre-temporal covenants** for understanding God’s freedom and love.
    - Argues that covenant language can obscure the **personal and dynamic** nature of God’s actions.
    - Prefers **eschatological promise** and hope over legalistic frameworks.
    - Sees the **kingdom of God** as the true horizon of God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "The concept of covenant must not be allowed to replace the living relationship of love within the Trinity." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Divine Purpose**
    - God's eternal purpose is oriented toward the **future consummation** of creation.
    - The **kingdom of God** is the fulfillment of God’s promise, not merely the outcome of a covenant.
    - The resurrection and new creation are the ultimate expressions of God’s faithfulness.
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is subsumed under the broader movement of **hope** and **renewal**.
    - "Christian hope sees the future as the horizon of God’s faithfulness, not as the fulfillment of a contract." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach has significantly influenced modern **Trinitarian theology** and the understanding of **salvation history**. By reframing the discussion away from the **Covenant of Redemption** toward the dynamic, relational, and eschatological purposes of God, he has challenged traditional Reformed categories and inspired new theological explorations. His emphasis on the **self-giving love** within the Trinity and the centrality of the cross continues to shape contemporary debates on the nature of God’s eternal purpose.
