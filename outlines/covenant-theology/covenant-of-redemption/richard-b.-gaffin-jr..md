# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. affirms the **Covenant of Redemption** as a foundational aspect of Reformed theology, emphasizing its role in the eternal intra-Trinitarian agreement that grounds the **work of Christ** and the **application of redemption**. He situates the covenant within the broader framework of **federal theology**, highlighting its importance for understanding the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the accomplishment of **salvation** in redemptive history.

- "The covenant of redemption is the pretemporal agreement between the Father and the Son that undergirds the entire economy of salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Intra-Trinitarian Covenant**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is an eternal pact within the Godhead, particularly between the Father and the Son.
   - It establishes the basis for the **mission of Christ** and the accomplishment of redemption.
   - This covenant is distinct yet inseparable from the **covenant of grace** revealed in history.
   - It underscores the unity and purposefulness of God’s redemptive plan.
   - "The pactum salutis is the eternal foundation for the historical outworking of salvation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Christ as Federal Head**
   - Christ is appointed as the representative head of the elect in the **Covenant of Redemption**.
   - His obedience and work are covenantally grounded, ensuring the salvation of his people.
   - The federal structure mirrors Adam’s headship in the **covenant of works**.
   - This headship is essential for understanding **imputation** and union with Christ.
   - "The federal headship of Christ is rooted in the eternal counsel of the triune God." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Redemption and Grace**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** is the eternal ground for the historical **covenant of grace**.
   - There is no sharp division; the two covenants are organically connected.
   - The promises and benefits of the covenant of grace flow from the eternal agreement.
   - This unity safeguards the coherence of redemptive history.
   - "The covenant of grace is the historical outworking of the eternal covenant of redemption." (Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
   - Gaffin stresses the unfolding of the **Covenant of Redemption** in redemptive history.
   - The work of Christ is not abstract but realized in historical events, especially the resurrection.
   - The application of redemption is inseparable from its accomplishment.
   - This approach highlights the dynamic, unfolding nature of God’s covenantal dealings.
   - "Redemption accomplished and applied are inseparably joined in the outworking of the covenant." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Trinitarian Foundation of Salvation**
   - The **Covenant of Redemption** reveals the cooperative work of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - Each person of the Trinity has a distinct role in the economy of salvation.
   - This covenantal arrangement displays the unity and diversity within the Godhead.
   - The Spirit’s application of Christ’s work is rooted in this eternal pact.
   - "The triune God’s saving purpose is covenantally structured from eternity." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **Covenant of Redemption** has reinforced its significance in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in relation to **union with Christ** and the structure of redemptive history. His redemptive-historical approach has shaped the way many understand the coherence between the eternal counsel of God and its historical realization. Gaffin’s work continues to influence systematic and biblical theology, particularly in discussions of the Trinity, Christology, and the application of salvation.
