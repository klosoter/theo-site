# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher did not affirm the traditional **Covenant of Redemption** as articulated in Reformed orthodoxy. Instead, he reinterpreted the idea of divine purpose and the work of Christ through the lens of **God-consciousness**, emphasizing the unity of the divine will and the historical mission of Jesus. Schleiermacher’s approach shifted focus from eternal intra-Trinitarian covenants to the experiential and redemptive significance of Christ within the community of faith.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all others by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Traditional Covenant of Redemption**
   - Denies a pre-temporal, intra-Trinitarian covenant between Father and Son.
   - Views the unity of divine purpose as rooted in the historical mission of Christ.
   - Emphasizes the absence of explicit biblical warrant for the Reformed formulation.
   - Sees the concept as speculative and unnecessary for understanding redemption.
   - "The idea of a covenant between the Father and the Son is not found in the apostolic writings." (The Christian Faith, §93)

2. **Centrality of God-Consciousness in Christ**
   - Christ’s unique God-consciousness is the foundation of redemption.
   - The Redeemer’s consciousness is the means by which divine purpose is realized.
   - Redemption is not a legal transaction but a transformative relationship.
   - The work of Christ is understood through his perfect receptivity to God.
   - "In Him the divine essence was present in its fullness as a constant potency." (The Christian Faith, §93)

3. **Redemption as Historical and Communal**
   - Redemption unfolds within the historical community of believers.
   - The church is the sphere where Christ’s God-consciousness is communicated.
   - The focus is on the ongoing influence of Christ, not a pre-temporal pact.
   - The benefits of redemption are experienced through participation in the community.
   - "The Redeemer communicates his God-consciousness to others, founding the Church." (The Christian Faith, §94)

4. **Doctrine of Election Reinterpreted**
   - Election is not grounded in an eternal covenant but in God’s gracious will.
   - The elect are those who participate in the life of Christ and the church.
   - Emphasizes the dynamic, historical realization of election.
   - Rejects the notion of a fixed, pre-temporal decree involving Christ as federal head.
   - "Election is realized in the historical process of redemption." (The Christian Faith, §120)

5. **Christ’s Mission as Expression of Divine Purpose**
   - Christ’s mission is the concrete realization of God’s redemptive will.
   - The unity of Christ’s will with the divine will is central.
   - Redemption is accomplished through Christ’s obedience and mediation.
   - The focus is on the existential and practical outworking of redemption.
   - "The work of Christ is the historical manifestation of the divine will to save." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **Covenant of Redemption** marked a significant departure from classical Reformed theology, influencing the trajectory of modern Protestant thought. His emphasis on **God-consciousness** and the historical, communal nature of redemption reshaped discussions of Christ’s person and work. While his views were often critiqued by confessional theologians, Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in the ongoing dialogue about the relationship between divine purpose, history, and the experience of salvation.
