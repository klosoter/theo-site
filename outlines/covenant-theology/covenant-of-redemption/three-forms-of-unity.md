# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the **Reformed doctrine of salvation** within a robust **covenantal framework**. While the explicit term **Covenant of Redemption** does not appear, these confessions presuppose an **eternal pact** within the Godhead, grounding the work of **Christ as Mediator** and the certainty of the elect's salvation. This intra-Trinitarian covenant is foundational for understanding the unity of **divine decree**, **atonement**, and the application of redemption.

- "God, who is perfectly merciful and also perfectly just, sent His Son to assume that nature in which the disobedience had been committed, in order to bear in it the punishment of sin by His most bitter passion and death." (Belgic Confession, Art. 20)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 16, 17, 20, and 21
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 15–19
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially First Head of Doctrine, Articles 6–9, 17
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism* (secondary)
- Joel R. Beeke & Sinclair B. Ferguson, *Reformed Confessions Harmonized* (reference)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Divine Counsel**
    - The confessions affirm that the plan of salvation originates in the **eternal counsel of God**.
    - The unity of Father, Son, and Spirit in redemption is presupposed as the basis for election and atonement.
    - The **Canons of Dort** emphasize that Christ was given by the Father from eternity for the elect.
    - This eternal counsel is the foundation for the historical accomplishment and application of redemption.
    - "This counsel, proceeding from everlasting love towards the elect, has from the beginning of the world to this day been powerfully accomplished." (Canons of Dort I.9)

2. **Christ as Mediator by Divine Appointment**
    - Christ’s mediatorial work is rooted in the will and appointment of the Father.
    - The **Belgic Confession** teaches that Christ was sent to assume human nature and bear sin as the representative of the elect.
    - The confessions stress the necessity of a mediator who is both true God and true man.
    - This mediatorship is not arbitrary but established by divine promise and purpose.
    - "We believe that God...sent His only-begotten and eternal Son...to assume that nature in which the disobedience had been committed." (Belgic Confession, Art. 20)

3. **Unity of Decree and Covenant**
    - The confessions closely link the **divine decree** of election with the covenantal accomplishment of redemption.
    - The **Canons of Dort** present the atonement as the outworking of God’s eternal purpose.
    - The elect are given to Christ by the Father, and Christ’s work is effectual for them.
    - The unity of decree and covenant ensures the certainty and particularity of salvation.
    - "For this was the sovereign counsel, and most gracious will and purpose of God the Father, that...He should effectually redeem...all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen unto salvation." (Canons of Dort II.8)

4. **Covenantal Structure of Redemption**
    - The confessions present redemption as unfolding within a **covenantal structure**.
    - The **Heidelberg Catechism** frames Christ’s work as fulfilling the requirements of God’s justice on behalf of the elect.
    - The covenant is not merely historical but rooted in the eternal will of God.
    - This structure undergirds the assurance and comfort offered to believers.
    - "God will have His justice satisfied: and therefore we must make full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 12)

5. **Assurance Grounded in Trinitarian Pact**
    - The certainty of salvation is grounded in the **eternal agreement** within the Trinity.
    - The confessions assure believers that Christ’s work cannot fail because it is based on the Father’s will and promise.
    - The **Canons of Dort** emphasize the unbreakable nature of God’s purpose and Christ’s intercession.
    - Assurance is not subjective but rests on the objective reality of the covenantal arrangement.
    - "The death of the Son of God is the only and most perfect sacrifice and satisfaction for sin." (Canons of Dort II.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed understanding of covenant theology**, providing a confessional foundation for the doctrine of the **Covenant of Redemption** even without explicit terminology. Their articulation of the eternal pact within the Trinity has influenced subsequent Reformed confessions and systematic theologies. By rooting assurance and the efficacy of Christ’s work in the eternal counsel of God, these documents continue to provide theological clarity and pastoral comfort within the Reformed tradition.
