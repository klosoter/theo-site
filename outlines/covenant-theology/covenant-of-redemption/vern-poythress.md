# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress approaches the **Covenant of Redemption** as a foundational aspect of the **Trinitarian economy**, emphasizing the eternal agreement within the Godhead to accomplish **redemption** through the work of Christ. He situates this covenant within a broader **biblical-theological** framework, highlighting its role in the unity of **God’s plan** and the coherence of **covenant theology**. Poythress’s treatment underscores the mutual commitment of the Father, Son, and Spirit in the accomplishment of salvation.

- "The unity of God’s plan is manifest in the eternal covenant among the persons of the Trinity, which grounds all subsequent covenants in history." ("The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses")

## Key Works

- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses (1991)
- Redeeming the Trinity: A Theology of Worship and Redemption (forthcoming/various articles)
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology (1987)
- "Covenant Theology" in Theopedia and various online essays
- In the Beginning Was the Word: Language—A God-Centered Approach (2009)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Foundation of the Covenant of Redemption**
    - The covenant is an intra-Trinitarian agreement, not merely a plan or decree.
    - Each person of the Trinity participates distinctly yet harmoniously.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - This covenant undergirds all historical covenants with humanity.
    - "The covenant of redemption is a Trinitarian reality, not an abstract contract." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

2. **Biblical-Theological Emphasis**
    - The covenant is discerned through the unfolding narrative of Scripture.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment patterns reveal its presence.
    - Old Testament shadows point to the eternal agreement in the Godhead.
    - New Testament texts (e.g., John 17) reflect the Son’s obedience to the Father’s commission.
    - "The Bible’s storyline is shaped by the eternal covenant among Father, Son, and Spirit." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

3. **Unity of God’s Redemptive Plan**
    - The covenant of redemption ensures the coherence of salvation history.
    - All covenants (works, grace) are rooted in this eternal pact.
    - God’s faithfulness is grounded in the unbreakable intra-Trinitarian commitment.
    - The plan of redemption is not a reaction but an eternal purpose.
    - "God’s covenants in history are the outworking of his eternal counsel." (Symphonic Theology)

4. **Christ’s Mediatorial Role**
    - The Son voluntarily undertakes the role of mediator in the covenant.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering are grounded in this eternal agreement.
    - The efficacy of atonement is secured by the Son’s covenantal faithfulness.
    - The Son’s work is both representative and substitutionary.
    - "The Son’s mediatorial work is rooted in his eternal commitment to the Father." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

5. **Covenant and Worship**
    - The covenant of redemption shapes the pattern of worship and obedience.
    - Trinitarian relations provide the model for covenantal fellowship with God.
    - Worship is a response to the accomplished work of the Triune God.
    - The church’s life is grounded in the security of this eternal covenant.
    - "Our worship echoes the harmony and faithfulness of the Triune covenant." (Redeeming the Trinity, lectures/articles)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s articulation of the **Covenant of Redemption** has reinforced the centrality of **Trinitarian theology** within Reformed covenantal frameworks. His biblical-theological method has encouraged a more integrated reading of Scripture, highlighting the unity of God’s redemptive purpose. By emphasizing the eternal, intra-Trinitarian foundation of salvation, Poythress has contributed to a deeper appreciation of the coherence and reliability of God’s covenantal dealings with humanity. His work continues to shape contemporary discussions on covenant theology and the doctrine of redemption.
