# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas does not explicitly articulate a **Covenant of Redemption** as later Reformed theologians do, but his doctrine of the **divine missions**, **Trinitarian relations**, and the **eternal decree** provides foundational concepts for later covenantal developments. Aquinas emphasizes the eternal will and unity of purpose within the **Trinity** regarding the salvation of humanity, focusing on the **Son’s mission** and the **order of salvation** rooted in the divine intellect and will.

- "The mission of the Son is the procession of the Word in time, as He is sent into the world for the salvation of men." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I, q.43 (On the Mission of the Divine Persons)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (On Salvation and the Incarnation)
- De Veritate, q.29 (On the Processions and Missions)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book I

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Will in Salvation**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share one **eternal will** regarding the redemption of humanity.
    - The **plan of salvation** is rooted in the undivided counsel of the Trinity.
    - There is no division or negotiation among the divine persons; their purposes are perfectly harmonious.
    - The sending of the Son is an expression of the single divine will, not a covenantal agreement between separate agents.
    - "The will of the Father and the Son is one and the same, as they are one God." (Summa Theologiae I, q.19, a.4)

2. **Eternal Generation and Mission of the Son**
    - The **eternal generation** of the Son grounds His temporal mission for redemption.
    - The Son’s being sent reflects His origin from the Father, not a pre-temporal pact.
    - The mission is a temporal manifestation of an eternal relationship.
    - The Son’s obedience is rooted in His filial relation, not in a covenantal contract.
    - "The temporal mission only manifests the eternal procession." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

3. **Divine Decree and Predestination**
    - God’s **predestination** of the elect is an eternal act of the divine intellect and will.
    - The decree to save is not a mutual agreement but a single act of God’s providence.
    - The Son’s incarnation and redemptive work are included in the eternal decree.
    - The order of execution in time reflects the order of intention in God.
    - "Predestination is a part of providence, as it is the plan for rational creatures directed to eternal life." (Summa Theologiae I, q.23, a.1)

4. **No Explicit Pactum Salutis**
    - Aquinas does not teach a formal **Covenant of Redemption** between Father and Son.
    - The language of covenant is reserved for God’s relationship with humanity, not intra-Trinitarian relations.
    - The unity of the Trinity precludes the need for a negotiated agreement.
    - Later covenantal theology develops categories not present in Aquinas’s framework.
    - "There is no distinction of wills in God, but one simple act." (Summa Theologiae I, q.19, a.1)

5. **Christ’s Obedience and Merit**
    - Christ’s obedience is the means by which redemption is accomplished.
    - The merit of Christ is rooted in His divine person and assumed human nature.
    - The Son’s obedience is voluntary, flowing from His love for the Father and humanity.
    - The merit of Christ is applied to the elect according to the divine plan, not a covenantal transaction.
    - "Christ by His passion merited salvation for us, not by a pact, but by the superabundance of His charity." (Summa Theologiae III, q.48, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s **Trinitarian theology** and doctrine of the divine missions provided essential groundwork for later discussions of the **Covenant of Redemption**, even though he did not formulate the concept himself. His emphasis on the unity of the divine will and the eternal decree influenced both medieval and Reformation thought. While Reformed theologians would later develop the **pactum salutis** as a distinct category, Aquinas’s careful articulation of the relations and missions within the Trinity remains foundational for understanding the theological context out of which covenantal theology emerged.
