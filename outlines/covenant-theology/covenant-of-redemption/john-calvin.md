# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin did not explicitly formulate the **Covenant of Redemption** as later Reformed theologians did, but his writings laid essential groundwork for the doctrine. Calvin’s theology emphasizes the **eternal counsel of God**, the **Trinitarian unity** in the work of salvation, and the **mediatorial role of Christ**, all of which anticipate later developments of the Covenant of Redemption concept.

- "For God so loved the world, that he determined to reconcile us to himself through Christ." (Institutes II.12.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters 12–14)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Sermons on Ephesians
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill (secondary reference for scholarly analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Counsel of God**
    - God’s plan of salvation is rooted in his eternal, sovereign will.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are united in purpose from eternity.
    - The decree to save is not arbitrary but flows from divine wisdom.
    - Christ’s mission is grounded in the eternal will of the Father.
    - "The Father appointed the Son to be our Mediator, and the Son accepted the office." (Institutes II.12.1)

2. **Trinitarian Unity in Redemption**
    - The work of redemption involves all three persons of the Trinity.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - There is no division of will or purpose within the Godhead.
    - The unity of the Trinity ensures the certainty of salvation.
    - "The will of the Father and the Son is one, and the work of both is the same." (Institutes II.12.2)

3. **Christ’s Mediatorial Role**
    - Christ is appointed as Mediator by the Father’s eternal decree.
    - The Son willingly undertakes the work of redemption.
    - The mediatorship of Christ is central to Calvin’s soteriology.
    - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are the means of fulfilling God’s redemptive plan.
    - "Christ was ordained by the decree of God to be our Redeemer." (Institutes II.12.1)

4. **Covenantal Structure in Salvation**
    - Calvin frequently uses covenantal language to describe God’s relationship with humanity.
    - He emphasizes the continuity of God’s covenant promises throughout redemptive history.
    - The covenant is grounded in God’s faithfulness and initiative.
    - While not explicitly formulating a Covenant of Redemption, Calvin’s framework anticipates it.
    - "All the promises of God are confirmed and fulfilled in Christ." (Institutes II.10.2)

5. **Foundation for Later Covenant Theology**
    - Calvin’s theology provides the exegetical and conceptual basis for later Reformed developments.
    - His emphasis on divine initiative and Trinitarian cooperation influenced the formalization of the Covenant of Redemption.
    - Later theologians systematized what Calvin articulated in seed form.
    - Calvin’s focus on Christ’s eternal appointment as Mediator shaped subsequent covenantal thought.
    - "God, by his eternal and immutable counsel, determined once for all those whom he would admit to salvation." (Institutes III.21.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **eternal counsel of God** and the **Trinitarian unity** in redemption provided the essential theological soil from which the formal doctrine of the Covenant of Redemption would later grow. While he did not use the term or offer a systematic treatment, his influence is evident in the development of Reformed **federal theology**. Calvin’s Christ-centered reading of Scripture and emphasis on God’s sovereign initiative continue to shape Reformed understandings of the covenantal structure of salvation. His legacy endures in the ongoing theological reflection on the unity of the divine will and the work of Christ as Mediator.
