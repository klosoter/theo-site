# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner did not explicitly develop a doctrine of the **Covenant of Redemption** as found in Reformed theology, but his **Trinitarian theology** and understanding of the **self-communication of God** provide a framework for discussing intra-Trinitarian relations and the divine plan of salvation. Rahner emphasized the unity of the **economic and immanent Trinity**, suggesting that God's eternal purpose is revealed in history, though he did not frame this in covenantal terms. His approach shifts the focus from formal covenants to the mystery of **God's self-giving** in Christ and the Spirit.

- "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity." (The Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (1967)
- Foundations of Christian Faith (1976)
- Theological Investigations, Vol. 4: More Recent Writings (1966)
- Hearer of the Word (1941)
- "The Eternal Significance of the Humanity of Jesus for Our Relationship with God" (in Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Economic and Immanent Trinity**
   - Rejects a strict separation between God's eternal being and His actions in history.
   - The revelation of God in Christ is the true revelation of God's inner life.
   - The divine plan of salvation is not a secondary or contingent act.
   - God's self-communication in history reflects His eternal purpose.
   - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Self-Communication of God**
   - God freely gives Himself to humanity in grace.
   - The incarnation is the supreme expression of this self-giving.
   - The divine initiative precedes all human response.
   - The concept of covenant is subsumed under the broader category of self-communication.
   - "Grace is nothing other than the communication of God himself." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Christology as the Center of Salvation**
   - Jesus Christ is the definitive revelation of God’s salvific will.
   - The eternal Son’s mission is rooted in the Father’s will.
   - The incarnation is not an afterthought but central to God’s plan.
   - The relationship between Father and Son grounds the possibility of redemption.
   - "The event of Jesus Christ is the event of God’s self-communication." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Transcendental Anthropology**
   - Every human is oriented toward God’s self-communication.
   - The capacity for God (potentia oboedientialis) is universal.
   - The divine plan is not limited to explicit covenantal arrangements.
   - Human openness to God reflects the universal scope of redemption.
   - "Man is the being who is always already addressed by God." (Hearer of the Word)

5. **Mystery and Freedom in Divine Purpose**
   - God’s salvific will remains ultimately mysterious.
   - The divine plan is enacted in freedom, not necessity.
   - The intra-Trinitarian relations are not reducible to human categories.
   - The language of covenant is metaphorical, pointing to deeper realities.
   - "God’s freedom is the ground of all reality and salvation." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology has profoundly shaped modern Catholic thought, especially in its understanding of the **Trinity** and the relationship between God’s eternal purpose and historical revelation. While he does not use the language of the **Covenant of Redemption**, his emphasis on God’s self-communication and the unity of the economic and immanent Trinity has influenced ecumenical dialogue and contemporary discussions of salvation. Rahner’s approach invites theologians to reconsider traditional covenantal categories in light of the mystery of God’s self-giving in Christ.
