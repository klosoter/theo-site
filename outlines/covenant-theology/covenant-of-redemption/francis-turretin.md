# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Redemption** (pactum salutis), describing it as an eternal, intra-Trinitarian agreement between the **Father** and the **Son** for the accomplishment of the salvation of the elect. He distinguished this covenant from the **Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing its foundational role in the structure of **Reformed federal theology**.

- "The covenant of redemption is not to be confounded with the covenant of grace, but is to be distinguished from it." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 12.2.4)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Redemption as Eternal and Intra-Trinitarian**
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is an eternal pact within the **Trinity**, preceding all temporal covenants.
    - The **Father** appoints the **Son** as Mediator, and the **Son** voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption.
    - This covenant is distinct from, yet foundational to, the **Covenant of Grace** made with the elect.
    - The **Holy Spirit** is involved, ensuring the application of redemption.
    "It is a covenant made between God and Christ, not between God and man." (Institutes, 12.2.4)

2. **Distinctness from the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is not made with humanity but with Christ as the representative Head.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** flows from and is grounded upon the prior pactum salutis.
    - The promises, conditions, and parties differ between the two covenants.
    - Confusing the two undermines the order and structure of redemptive history.
    "The covenant of grace is made with men; the covenant of redemption is made with Christ." (Institutes, 12.2.4)

3. **Necessity and Voluntariness of the Son’s Obedience**
    - The Son’s obedience is both necessary (by covenant) and voluntary (by consent).
    - Christ’s mediatorial work is not imposed but freely undertaken within the covenantal framework.
    - The Son’s active and passive obedience fulfill the stipulations of the pactum salutis.
    - This voluntary obedience secures the redemption of the elect.
    "Christ did not undertake the work of redemption by compulsion, but by the most free consent." (Institutes, 12.2.7)

4. **Legal and Federal Structure of Redemption**
    - The **Covenant of Redemption** is structured with clear promises, conditions, and rewards.
    - The **Father** promises to give the **Son** a people, to equip Him, and to reward His obedience.
    - The **Son** undertakes to fulfill all righteousness and bear the penalty for sin.
    - This legal framework grounds the certainty and efficacy of salvation.
    "There is here a mutual agreement, a stipulation and restipulation, as in other covenants." (Institutes, 12.2.6)

5. **Scriptural Basis for the Covenant of Redemption**
    - Turretin appeals to passages such as Psalm 2, Psalm 40, Isaiah 53, John 17, and Philippians 2.
    - He argues that the language of divine commission, promise, and reward implies a covenantal arrangement.
    - The unity of the divine will is maintained, yet the economic distinctions in the **Trinity** are preserved.
    - The scriptural witness supports the theological necessity of the pactum salutis.
    "The Scriptures clearly teach that the Father gave a command to the Son, and the Son undertook the work." (Institutes, 12.2.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s doctrine of the **Covenant of Redemption** became a hallmark of later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping the federal theology of subsequent generations. His careful distinctions between the eternal pactum salutis and the historical **Covenant of Grace** provided a framework for understanding the unity and diversity of God’s redemptive work. Turretin’s influence endures in confessional Reformed theology, especially in discussions of the **Trinity**, Christ’s mediatorial office, and the grounding of assurance in the eternal counsel of God.
