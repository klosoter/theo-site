# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther viewed the **Mosaic covenant** primarily as an administration of **law** that reveals human inability to achieve **righteousness** before God through works. He distinguished sharply between the **Law** (as given through Moses) and the **Gospel**, emphasizing that the Mosaic covenant, in its legal demands, functions to drive sinners to Christ rather than to establish a lasting **covenant of works**. For Luther, the Mosaic law exposes sin and points to the necessity of **justification by faith**.

- "The Law was given, not to justify, but to show men their sin and drive them to Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Preface to the Epistle to the Romans (1522)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Law-Gospel Distinction**
   - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of **Law**.
   - The Law reveals sin but cannot provide **righteousness** or life.
   - The Gospel, not the Law, is the means of **salvation**.
   - The Law prepares the way for the Gospel by exposing human inability.
   - "The principal point of the Law is to make men not better but worse; that is to say, it shows them their sin." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Mosaic Covenant Not a Covenant of Works in Substance**
   - The Mosaic covenant does not offer life on the basis of perfect obedience.
   - Its function is pedagogical, not salvific.
   - The promise of salvation is found in the **Abrahamic covenant**, not in Moses.
   - The Law points beyond itself to the need for **grace**.
   - "The Law was never given to justify, but to increase transgressions." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Law’s Accusatory Function**
   - The Law accuses and condemns all who are under it.
   - It shows the impossibility of self-justification.
   - The Law drives sinners to despair of their own works.
   - This despair is necessary to receive the **Gospel**.
   - "The Law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done; the Gospel says, 'Believe this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **Continuity of Promise**
   - The promise of **justification by faith** precedes and supersedes the Mosaic Law.
   - The Abrahamic promise is fulfilled in Christ, not annulled by Moses.
   - The Law serves the promise by preparing for Christ.
   - The substance of salvation is always by faith, not works.
   - "The promise was given before the Law, and the Law does not annul the promise." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Law**
   - Christ fulfills the Law’s demands perfectly.
   - Believers are justified by Christ’s righteousness, not their own.
   - The Law’s curse is borne by Christ on behalf of sinners.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s ultimate purpose is to lead to Christ.
   - "Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes." (Romans Commentary)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of **Law and Gospel**. His insistence that the Mosaic law was not a renewed **covenant of works** but a means to reveal sin and point to Christ distinguished his theology from later Reformed developments. Luther’s approach continues to influence Lutheran and broader Protestant discussions on the role of the Law in redemptive history and the centrality of **justification by faith**.
