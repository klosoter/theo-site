# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached the **Mosaic covenant** as a complex administration within the unfolding of **God’s covenantal dealings** with humanity. While he recognized the presence of **legal elements** in the Mosaic economy, Warfield maintained that its **substance** was not a republication of the **covenant of works**, but rather a gracious administration within the overarching **covenant of grace**.

- "The Mosaic dispensation was not a covenant of works, but a form of the administration of the covenant of grace." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation"
- "The Mosaic Legislation" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Development of the Doctrine of Infant Salvation" (for covenantal context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - It does not reintroduce the **covenant of works** as a means of justification.
    - The law serves a pedagogical function, pointing to the need for **Christ**.
    - The gracious promises to Abraham remain operative under Moses.
    - "The law was given not to offer life by works, but to shut men up to the promise by faith." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

2. **Substance vs. Form Distinction**
    - Warfield distinguishes between the **substance** (grace) and the **form** (legal administration) of the Mosaic covenant.
    - The external legal demands do not alter the underlying gracious character.
    - The Mosaic law is a temporary, pedagogical overlay within the covenant of grace.
    - The substance of salvation remains by faith, not by works.
    - "The form may be legal, but the substance is gracious." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Typology and Pedagogy of the Law**
    - The Mosaic law functions as a **tutor** to lead Israel to Christ.
    - Its ceremonies and sacrifices typify the coming work of the Redeemer.
    - The law exposes sin and the impossibility of self-justification.
    - The pedagogical use of the law is essential to the redemptive-historical unfolding.
    - "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ." (The Plan of Salvation)

4. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Warfield emphasizes the **unity** of God’s redemptive purpose from Abraham through Moses to Christ.
    - The Mosaic covenant does not interrupt or replace the Abrahamic promise.
    - All Old Testament administrations point forward to the fulfillment in Christ.
    - The people of God are always saved by grace through faith.
    - "There is but one covenant of grace, variously administered." (The Westminster Assembly and Its Work)

5. **Rejection of Works Principle for Justification**
    - Warfield rejects any notion that the Mosaic covenant offers justification by works.
    - The law’s demands highlight human inability and the necessity of grace.
    - Justification has always been by faith, even under Moses.
    - The Mosaic economy anticipates the gospel, rather than contradicting it.
    - "The law was never given as a means of life, but as a means of conviction." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as an administration of the **covenant of grace** shaped later Reformed discussions on law and gospel. His careful distinction between **substance and form** influenced 20th-century covenant theology, especially in debates over the republication of the covenant of works. Warfield’s legacy endures in his insistence on the unity of redemptive history and the centrality of grace, providing a foundation for subsequent Westminster and confessional scholarship.
