# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress views the **Mosaic covenant** as an administration of the **covenant of grace** that incorporates a typological "works principle" reminiscent of the **covenant of works**. He emphasizes the importance of **typology** and the unfolding of **redemptive history** for understanding the Mosaic covenant’s role in God’s unified plan of salvation.

- "The Mosaic covenant is an administration of the covenant of grace, but it includes a typological layer that echoes the covenant of works." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

## Key Works

- The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses
- Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology
- Understanding Dispensationalists
- "The Mosaic Law and the Covenant of Works" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1996)
- "Kinds of Biblical Theology" (Westminster Theological Journal, 2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typological Function of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant serves as a typological pointer to Christ and the fulfillment of the law.
    - Typology allows the Mosaic covenant to reflect both **works** and **grace** dimensions.
    - The law’s demands highlight human inability and the need for a mediator.
    - The typological layer does not override the gracious substance of the covenant.
    "The law points forward to Christ by showing the need for redemption." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

2. **Substance as Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The sacrificial system and promises anticipate the gospel.
    - Obedience is required, but provision for atonement is central.
    - The gracious promises to Abraham undergird the Mosaic administration.
    "The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of the covenant of works in its essence." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

3. **Echoes of the Covenant of Works**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains a "works principle" in its typological structure.
    - Blessings and curses are presented in terms of obedience and disobedience.
    - This structure points back to Adam and forward to Christ as the true obedient one.
    - The works principle is pedagogical, not ultimate.
    "The works principle in the Mosaic law is typological, not soteric." (WTJ, 1996)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Perspective**
    - The Mosaic covenant must be interpreted within the flow of **redemptive history**.
    - Each covenant administration builds on and clarifies previous revelations.
    - The law’s function changes as redemptive history progresses.
    - Christ fulfills and transforms the Mosaic administration.
    "Redemptive history provides the context for understanding the law’s purpose." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

5. **Multiplicity of Perspectives**
    - Theological understanding benefits from recognizing multiple valid perspectives.
    - The Mosaic covenant can be viewed as both law and grace, depending on the angle.
    - Apparent tensions are harmonized through **symphonic theology**.
    - This approach avoids reductionism in covenant theology.
    "We must be open to seeing multiple perspectives in the Mosaic covenant." (Symphonic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the **Mosaic covenant** and its relation to the **covenant of works**. His emphasis on **typology** and the redemptive-historical context has encouraged a more nuanced reading of Old Testament law within the broader framework of the **covenant of grace**. By advocating for a symphonic approach, he has helped theologians appreciate the complexity and unity of biblical covenants, influencing both academic and pastoral circles.
