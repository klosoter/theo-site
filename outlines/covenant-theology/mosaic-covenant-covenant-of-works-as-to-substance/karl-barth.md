# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth rejected the traditional **Reformed distinction** between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, insisting that all divine covenants are grounded in **God’s grace** and self-revelation in **Jesus Christ**. For Barth, the **Mosaic covenant** is not a republication of a covenant of works, but a historical administration within the one gracious covenant God establishes with humanity in Christ.

- "The covenant with Israel is the form in which the covenant of grace is first revealed and realized in history." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, especially II/2, III/1, IV/1
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (Church Dogmatics I/1)
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology (Clifford Green)
- Barth and Covenant Theology (Michael Allen, in The Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of a Covenant of Works**
    - Denies a prelapsarian covenant of works distinct from the covenant of grace.
    - Asserts that all divine-human covenants are rooted in God’s gracious initiative.
    - Interprets the law at Sinai as a response to grace, not a means of earning life.
    - Views the Mosaic covenant as a historical form of the one covenant in Christ.
    "There is only one covenant, the covenant of grace." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Christocentric Covenant Theology**
    - Jesus Christ is the center and substance of all covenants, including the Mosaic.
    - Old Testament covenants anticipate and participate in the reality of Christ.
    - The law points Israel to its need for redemption in Christ.
    - The Mosaic covenant is preparatory, not antithetical, to the gospel.
    "Jesus Christ is Himself the fulfillment of the covenant." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Emphasizes the unity and continuity of God’s covenantal dealings.
    - The Mosaic administration is not a separate or fundamentally different covenant.
    - Asserts that grace is present throughout redemptive history, including at Sinai.
    - Rejects a division of covenants based on law and gospel.
    "The covenant of grace is the one eternal covenant in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Law as Gift, Not Means of Merit**
    - The law is a gracious gift given to a redeemed people.
    - Obedience to the law is a response to God’s prior act of deliverance.
    - The Mosaic law reveals God’s will but does not establish a works principle.
    - The law’s function is pedagogical, leading to Christ.
    "The law is the form of the Gospel, and the Gospel is the content of the law." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Israel’s Role in Redemptive History**
    - Israel is the elect people through whom God’s covenant purposes unfold.
    - The Mosaic covenant is a stage in the unfolding of God’s plan for all humanity.
    - Israel’s history is both unique and representative of humanity’s relationship to God.
    - The church is grafted into the covenantal history begun with Israel.
    "Israel is the people of the covenant, the bearer of the promise." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of the **covenant of works** as a distinct category profoundly reshaped modern discussions of **covenant theology**, especially within Reformed circles. His insistence on the **unity of the covenant of grace** and the centrality of **Jesus Christ** challenged traditional law-gospel and covenantal distinctions. Barth’s approach has influenced both ecumenical dialogues and contemporary critiques of classical Reformed federal theology, making his views a significant reference point in debates about the nature and substance of the Mosaic covenant.
