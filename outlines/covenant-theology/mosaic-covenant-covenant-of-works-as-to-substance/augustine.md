# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly frame the **Mosaic covenant** in terms of a **covenant of works** versus **covenant of grace** distinction, as later Reformed theology would, but he did see a fundamental continuity and discontinuity between the **Law given through Moses** and the **grace revealed in Christ**. For Augustine, the Mosaic Law was preparatory, exposing sin and pointing to the need for **divine grace**, but it could not itself impart the righteousness it demanded. Thus, while the Law had an external, legal character, its deeper purpose was to drive humanity to seek the **grace of the New Covenant**.

- "The law was given that grace might be sought; and grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- On the Spirit and the Letter (De spiritu et littera)
- City of God (De civitate Dei), esp. Books 16–17
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Against Two Letters of the Pelagians (Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum)
- Sermons on Selected Lessons of the New Testament

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law Exposes Sin, Does Not Heal**
    - The Mosaic Law reveals the reality and depth of **human sinfulness**.
    - It commands righteousness but does not provide the power to fulfill it.
    - Its function is pedagogical, leading to an awareness of the need for **grace**.
    - The Law is not itself salvific, but preparatory for the gospel.
    - "For the law was given, not to take away sin, but to make men conscious of sin." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

2. **Grace is Necessary for Obedience**
    - True fulfillment of the Law is only possible through **divine grace**.
    - The Mosaic covenant, by itself, cannot produce the righteousness it demands.
    - Augustine rejects any notion that humans can merit salvation by works alone.
    - The New Covenant brings the internal renewal needed for obedience.
    - "What the law enjoins by threatening, grace bestows by faith." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity of the Covenants**
    - There is a real continuity in the **promise of salvation** across the covenants.
    - The Mosaic Law is not opposed to the gospel but anticipates it.
    - The **substance** of salvation is always by grace, even if the administration differs.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s external forms are fulfilled and transcended in Christ.
    - "The sacraments of the old law were different in their signs, but the same in the thing signified." (City of God)

4. **Typology and Preparation for Christ**
    - The Mosaic covenant is typological, pointing forward to Christ and the New Covenant.
    - Its ceremonies and sacrifices prefigure the work of Christ.
    - The Law’s inability to justify highlights the necessity of the Savior.
    - The history of Israel under the Law is a preparation for the coming of grace.
    - "All these things happened to them as types, and they were written for our admonition." (City of God)

5. **Faith as the Means of Salvation in All Ages**
    - Augustine maintains that salvation has always been by **faith**, not works.
    - The righteous under the Law were justified by faith in the coming Christ.
    - The external Mosaic Law could not save, but pointed to the promise.
    - The **covenant of grace** is operative throughout redemptive history.
    - "The just lives by faith, whether under law or under grace." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially regarding the relationship between **law and grace**. While he did not use the later Reformed categories of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, his emphasis on the Law’s inability to justify and the necessity of grace laid groundwork for later covenant theology. His typological reading of the Old Testament and insistence on the unity of salvation by faith influenced both medieval and Reformation-era debates. Augustine remains a pivotal figure in discussions of the continuity and discontinuity between the covenants.
