# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **Mosaic covenant** with careful attention to its place in the unfolding of **redemptive history**, emphasizing its typological and pedagogical function within the broader **covenant of grace**. While recognizing the presence of **works-principle** language in the Mosaic administration, Gaffin maintains that, as to substance, it is not a **republication** of the **covenant of works** but rather serves the purposes of the **covenant of grace** in the history of redemption.

- "The Mosaic covenant, in its historical context, is best understood as an administration of the covenant of grace, though with a pronounced works principle at the typological level." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
   - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
   - It advances the redemptive promise first given to Abraham.
   - The law serves a pedagogical function, driving Israel to Christ.
   - The substance is gracious, though the form includes works-principle elements.
   - "The Mosaic covenant, as an administration, does not revert to the covenant of works but continues the gracious trajectory begun with Abraham." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Typological Works Principle**
   - The Mosaic economy includes a typological works principle, especially regarding Israel’s tenure in the land.
   - This principle points forward to Christ’s obedience and fulfillment.
   - The works principle operates at the national, not individual, level.
   - It is not salvific but typological, highlighting the need for a Redeemer.
   - "The works principle in the Mosaic covenant is typological, not soteric, and anticipates Christ’s obedience." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - There is a fundamental unity between the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New covenants.
   - The Mosaic law does not introduce a new way of salvation.
   - The promises and types under Moses are fulfilled in Christ.
   - The law’s demands highlight the necessity of grace.
   - "The unity of the covenant of grace is maintained throughout redemptive history, including the Mosaic administration." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Law-Gospel Distinction within Redemptive History**
   - The law-gospel distinction is crucial for understanding the Mosaic covenant.
   - The law exposes sin and points to the gospel’s necessity.
   - The Mosaic law is not opposed to the promise but serves it.
   - The distinction is eschatological, culminating in Christ.
   - "The law, given through Moses, serves the promise and is fulfilled in the gospel of Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Rejection of Substantial Republication**
   - Gaffin rejects the view that the Mosaic covenant is, in substance, a republication of the covenant of works.
   - He affirms formal similarities but denies a return to works-based soteriology.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s works principle is subordinate to its gracious substance.
   - The focus remains on Christ as the fulfillment of all covenantal types.
   - "The Mosaic covenant is not, in substance, a republication of the covenant of works, but an administration of grace with typological features." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **covenant theology**, especially regarding the relationship between law and gospel. His emphasis on the typological and pedagogical function of the Mosaic administration has helped clarify debates over **republication** and the unity of the covenant of grace. Gaffin’s work continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking to understand the continuity and discontinuity within redemptive history.
