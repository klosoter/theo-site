# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Mosaic covenant** within the framework of **Reformed federal theology**, emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** while acknowledging the **legal** or **works principle** present in the Mosaic administration. He maintained that, as to its **substance**, the Mosaic covenant was gracious, yet it included a **typological republication** of the **covenant of works** to highlight the necessity of Christ’s obedience. Van Til’s analysis sought to uphold the continuity of **redemptive history** without collapsing the distinct roles of law and gospel.

- "The law as given to Israel was not in substance a covenant of works, but it did, in the interests of the covenant of grace, republish the principle of works." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- The Theology of James Daane (secondary discussion)
- Essays in Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - Stressed that all post-Fall covenants, including the Mosaic, are administrations of the one **covenant of grace**.
   - Saw the Mosaic covenant as advancing the promise of redemption found in **Christ**.
   - Emphasized the organic continuity of **redemptive history**.
   - Rejected any notion that the Mosaic covenant was a return to a pure **covenant of works**.
   - "The Mosaic economy is not a break in the covenant of grace, but its further unfolding." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Typological Republication of Works Principle**
   - Affirmed that the Mosaic covenant included a **typological** or **pedagogical** republication of the **works principle**.
   - This republication served to highlight Israel’s inability to achieve righteousness by law.
   - The works principle pointed forward to the necessity of a **mediator**.
   - The typology underscored the contrast between Adam and Christ.
   - "The law was given to drive men to Christ by showing them their inability." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Law-Gospel Distinction Maintained**
   - Upheld a clear distinction between **law** and **gospel** within the Mosaic administration.
   - The law exposes sin and the need for grace.
   - The gospel is present in the sacrificial system and promises.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s legal demands serve a redemptive purpose.
   - "The law and the gospel are not opposed, but the law serves the gospel by preparing the way for it." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Covenantal Antithesis**
   - Emphasized the antithesis between obedience and disobedience as a covenantal reality.
   - The Mosaic covenant intensifies the ethical antithesis in history.
   - Israel’s failure under the law magnifies the necessity of **Christ’s active obedience**.
   - The antithesis is not merely ethical but covenantal, rooted in God’s redemptive plan.
   - "The antithesis is not simply between good and evil, but between covenant faithfulness and unfaithfulness." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - Saw Christ as the fulfillment of the Mosaic law and its demands.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s works principle is ultimately satisfied in Christ’s obedience.
   - The types and shadows of the Mosaic economy point to the substance in Christ.
   - The law’s curse is borne by Christ, securing the blessings of the covenant for believers.
   - "Christ fulfills the law in both its precept and penalty, thus securing the promise for his people." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as gracious in substance, yet containing a republication of the **works principle**, has shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **covenant theology**. His influence is evident in debates over the law-gospel relationship and the role of typology in redemptive history. Van Til’s approach has encouraged theologians to maintain both the unity and diversity of God’s covenantal dealings, reinforcing the centrality of Christ in all administrations. His legacy endures in the ongoing refinement of Reformed federal thought.
