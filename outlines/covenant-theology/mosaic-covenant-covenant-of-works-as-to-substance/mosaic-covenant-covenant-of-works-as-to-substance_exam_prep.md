### ESSAY
The question whether the Mosaic covenant is the **covenant of works as to substance** requires a precise use of the categories bequeathed by classic **federal theology**. In Reformed usage, substance names the essential soteric intent and promise of a covenant, while administration names the outward form through which that promise is dispensed in history. The **covenant of works** is God’s prelapsarian arrangement with Adam, holding out eschatological life upon perfect obedience. The **covenant of grace** is God’s postlapsarian provision of life through a mediator received by faith alone. To ask whether Sinai is the covenant of works as to substance is to ask whether the essence of the Mosaic economy makes eternal life rest on human obedience rather than on a mediator’s righteousness imputed and received by faith. I will argue that Sinai is the covenant of grace in substance, since it offers Christ by promise and shadow to faith, yet it republishes the works principle at a typological and national level that governs Israel’s tenure in the land and publicly re-stages Adam’s probation. This calibrated **republication** neither introduces two ways of salvation nor collapses Paul’s antithesis between law and faith, but rather explains it.

Herman Witsius, writing in the heat of seventeenth-century debates, is the essential architect of this formulation. A pastor-scholar mediating between Voetian and Cocceian schools, his Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man (1677) offered a synthetically ordered account of the two covenants that balanced exegesis, dogmatics, and polemics. Witsius insisted that the law at Sinai was delivered in service to the **covenant of grace**. It was a ministration that multiplied transgression to drive Israel to Christ, embedded the gospel in ceremonies that portrayed substitution and propitiation, and guarded the church in its minority. Yet Witsius also saw within the Mosaic economy what he called a legal condition annexed to the political covenant: a rule of life that attached blessings and curses to Israel’s corporate obedience and disobedience. He interpreted Leviticus 18:5, do this and live, not as a salvific condition by which any postlapsarian sinner could obtain eternal life through works, but as a citation of the original works principle given to Adam, republished to expose sin and to structure Israel’s national experience. His conceptual achievement was to distinguish levels within the Mosaic covenant: soteriologically it administers grace through types and promises, while at the typological-political level it operates a works principle to regulate land tenure and to dramatize the justice of God. By refusing the subservient-covenant theory that made Sinai a third covenant distinct from both grace and works, Witsius preserved the confessional line that there are two covenants in substance while allowing the law’s peculiar administrative role at Sinai.

Francis Turretin sharpened these categories with the scholastic precision that characterizes his Institutes of Elenctic Theology. He repeatedly insists that the law as a covenant of works, the moral law simpliciter, and the law as a rule of life are distinct but closely related. For Turretin, the moral law is the same in substance under Adam and Moses because God’s moral will reflects **divine simplicity** and cannot change, but its covenantal relation changes. At Sinai the same law is delivered within the **covenant of grace** to expose sin and educate the conscience, while, accidentally speaking, its legal tenor appears prominently in the theocratic constitution. Turretin’s careful exegesis of Leviticus 18:5 and Deuteronomy 28 places the promised life and threatened curse within the horizon of temporal blessings typical of the heavenly inheritance. He argues that Paul’s citation of Leviticus 18:5 in Romans 10 and Galatians 3 is not a commendation of a viable postlapsarian path to eternal life by works, but an appeal to the abstract legal principle that cannot justify a sinner. The Mosaic form republished that principle to condemn sin and to direct sinners to Christ. Turretin’s contribution is a grammar: substantial identity of grace across the covenants, with formal diversity that includes a legal-caricature to teach and to typify. That grammar still disciplines the debate.

Two modern figures reframe and, in some cases, polarize the discussion. John Murray, in essays on The Covenant of Grace and The Nature of the Mosaic Covenant, objected to speaking of any **republication** of the covenant of works at Sinai. For Murray, the Mosaic covenant is univocally an administration of the **covenant of grace**, both in intent and in provision. He saw the law at Sinai not as a covenantal works principle but as the transcript of God’s moral character given as a rule of life to a redeemed people. Israel’s obedience was the expression of gratitude that responded to deliverance from Egypt. Murray read Galatians 3 as contrasting the law abstracted into a principle of inheritance by works with the promise to Abraham that is received by faith, but he insisted that this contrast cannot be applied to the Mosaic economy as such without making Moses an anti-promise. He feared that language of republication undermines assurance and carves a wedge between Moses and Abraham that the apostle does not own. On Murray’s telling, the economy of Sinai is characterized by the pedagogical use of the law and by its ceremonies that foreshadow Christ, but the relation between obedience and life is always evangelical, not legal.

By contrast, Meredith G. Kline pressed the republication thesis in a strongly typological key. Drawing on ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty forms in Treaty of the Great King and developing a robust typology of holy war and intrusion in Kingdom Prologue and By Oath Consigned, Kline argued that Israel’s covenant as a national theocracy employed an explicit works principle at the level of land tenure. The Decalogue, prefaced by redemptive grace, governs Israel as a redeemed community relative to salvation, but the Deuteronomic treaty structure stipulates sanctions that are retributive in terms of national blessing and curse. For Kline, this is not a back door to Pelagianism but a dramatic republication of the Adamic probation within an earthly typological stage. The land functions as an image of the eschatological inheritance, and Israel under the Sinai treaty stands as a corporate Adam. Exile is the typological death sanction for corporate disobedience, and the prophetic lawsuit brings the covenant curses to bear on historical Israel to demonstrate that apart from a second Adam the inheritance cannot be secured. Kline’s exegesis highlights that Deuteronomy 4 and 28 treat the covenant sanctions in judicial terms, that Leviticus 26 threatens covenant-breaking with exile, and that Joshua through Kings narrates covenant lawsuit and verdict. When Paul declares the law is not of faith in Galatians 3, Kline hears not mere abstraction but the legal principle as such used to structure Israel’s national experience, so that the church learns to trust the promised Seed. Kline’s typological works principle depends on Vos’s eschatological reading of covenant history.

Geerhardus Vos read biblical history as the progressive realization of the eschatological Sabbath rest. In The Pauline Eschatology and Biblical Theology, he frames Adam under a covenantal probation in which eschatological life is held out upon obedience; Israel, as a microcosm of humanity, reenacts that drama in a typological register. Vos reads Hebrews 3 and 4, with its appeal to the wilderness generation, as teaching that Israel’s failure to enter rest due to unbelief is not merely a moral lapse but an epochal lesson: the law is a pedagogue until Christ. Paul’s appeal to Sinai and Hagar in Galatians 4, associating the present Jerusalem with slavery and Mount Sinai, is a theocratic judgment on a covenant economy that, when absolutized into a principle of inheritance by works, can only enslave. Yet, Vos insists, the promise precedes and outruns the law; the Mosaic administration must be read with Abraham behind it and Christ ahead of it. Thus, the law’s works principle never exists as a soteric alternative but as a typological pedagogy, a rehearsal of Adam’s failed quest, driving toward the second Adam’s accomplishment. Vos’s stress on eschatology corrects readings that freeze the Mosaic economy into a flat legalism or, conversely, dissolve its legal edge into pure grace without pedagogy.

These figures frame internal Reformed debates with clarity. One internal fault line runs between those who, with Witsius, Turretin, Vos, and Kline, affirm some form of **republication**, and those who, with Murray, resist it. Another runs through the seventeenth century in the subservient-covenant thesis associated with Cameron and some English divines, who posited a third covenant at Sinai promising temporal life in Canaan to obedience distinct from both works and grace. Witsius critiqued this as multiplying covenants without necessity and undermining the unity of the **covenant of grace**. The line I defend with Witsius and Turretin avoids a third-covenant construct by distinguishing substance and administration. It secures unity of grace while allowing the theocratic administration to be qualified by a legal principium that governs national tenure. A second internal debate concerns exegesis of Leviticus 18:5 and the Pauline appeals to it. The view defended here reads Paul’s use as a legal-covenantal maxim invoked to demonstrate the impossibility of justification by works for sinners and as the public law of the theocracy at the national level. A third internal debate concerns the relation of this thesis to the doctrine of **imputation** and Christ’s **active obedience**. If Israel corporately failed under a re-staged probation, then Christ recapitulates Israel to fulfill all righteousness and to merit the eschatological inheritance as the obedient Son. Far from endangering **union with Christ** and sola fide, the typological works principle underwrites the necessity of the mediator’s obedience for us and our salvation.

External debates sharpen the stakes. Lutheran theology, in some streams, reads Moses as the ministry of condemnation pure and simple, with minimal attention to covenantal unity. Against this, Reformed theology affirms the Mosaic administration as an administration of the **covenant of grace** that truly offered Christ by promise and sacrificial type. Roman Catholic theology often construes the new covenant as a new law whose grace enables sincere, albeit imperfect, obedience to be accepted unto life. The Reformed must insist that neither at Sinai nor in the new covenant does obedience function as the formal ground of justification. Dispensationalism treats the Mosaic economy as a discrete dispensation of law, succeeded by grace, often severing the church from Israel and misreading Paul’s historical argument about Abraham and Moses. The two-covenant Reformed grammar resists this by locating Sinai within the one economy of grace while maintaining the Pauline antithesis at the level of principles. The New Perspective on Paul frequently interprets works of law as boundary markers, not principled works-righteousness. Yet Paul’s appeal to Deuteronomy and Leviticus and his stark contrast between law and promise suggests that he targets the deeper principle that inheritance does not come by doing but by believing, whether or not boundary maintenance is in view. The typological works principle at Sinai dignifies Paul’s use of the law-language as more than sociological.

Contemporary debates require pastoral clarity. Federal Vision proposals have blurred the line between decretal election and covenant membership, and in some cases have introduced a works principle into final justification that contradicts the Reformed doctrine. A calibrated **republication** actually guards against this confusion by restricting the works principle to the typological-national level and by fortifying the doctrine that, as to eternal life, the Mosaic covenant is an administration of grace received by faith alone. Theonomy, in some forms, urges the abiding civil use of Mosaic law, but the typological reading of the theocracy insists that the sanctions attached to land tenure belong to an epochal administration whose civil form is not directly transferable. Recent denominational reports in the OPC and URCNA on **republication** have sought to police these boundaries, warning against any formulation that puts personal justification at Sinai on a works footing while permitting typological and pedagogical readings. The pastoral stakes concern assurance and the **law-gospel distinction**: if believers hear Sinai only as a works-for-life charter, consciences will be crushed; if they hear it only as gracious suggestion, holiness is trivialized. Reading Sinai as grace in substance with a typological works annex both drives to Christ and tutors the redeemed in sanctification.

Examiners will press texts. Deuteronomy 28 reads as a simple program: obey and you will be blessed, disobey and you will be cursed. Is this not a works covenant tout court? The answer depends on the level. As a national theocracy, Israel’s corporate life in the land is conditioned upon obedience. This is a judicial economy for a typological kingdom under God’s immediate kingship. But individual Israelites were always justified only by faith in the promised mediator signified in the sacrificial system. The bright line between national sanctions and personal salvation is not artificial: Abraham was justified long before Sinai; David prayed for forgiveness on the basis of sacrificial atonement; the prophets called Israel to repent and live by faith, even while announcing exile for corporate disobedience. Thus Deuteronomy 28 does not redefine the ordo salutis; it defines the polis Israel under God. Another examiner challenge: Paul says the law is not of faith and the law came to increase trespass. Does this condemn the Mosaic economy as anti-gospel? Paul’s argument in Galatians 3 distinguishes promise and law as principles of inheritance, not as metaphysical entities. The promise as to Christ remains inviolable; the law served as a pedagogue to shut up all under sin until the faith came. The Sinai law, when deployed as a principle of inheritance, can only condemn. That is precisely why its republication was necessary: it exposed sin and forced the question of where righteousness would be found. Yet the same apostle insists that the law is holy, righteous, and good, and that the oracles of God were entrusted to Israel as a privilege. The Mosaic economy is not anti-gospel but a hard teacher in the school of Christ.

A further objection targets the substance-administration distinction as scholastic hair-splitting that risks reducing the Mosaic covenant to a formal shell. But the distinction corresponds to biblical realities. Hebrews contrasts the old with the new not as two gospels but as two modes of access to the same heavenly reality: the old with shadows and externalities, the new with open access through the finished work of Christ. Jeremiah 31 promises a new covenant that will write the law on the heart and will not be broken like the covenant made when God took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt. The fault of the old was not the gospel it offered, but the weakness of its external administration when faced with sin. Reading Sinai as grace in substance honors Jeremiah and Hebrews while accounting for the covenant’s breakability and the legal tenor of its national sanctions. The subservient-covenant theory attempts to capture this breakability but at the cost of positing a third covenant. A simpler and more biblically controlled reading sees the two covenants as to substance, works and grace, and reads Sinai’s complexity as the admixture of a typological layer into the administration of grace.

This position connects integrally to adjacent loci. Justification is by faith alone on the basis of Christ’s righteousness, which includes his **active obedience** to the law. The typological works principle at Sinai explains why Christ must come as true Israel, pass through the waters, be tested in the wilderness, keep Torah, and ascend the holy hill. He merits the inheritance Adam failed to secure and Israel forfeited by disobedience. With respect to ecclesiology, Israel as church under age is the people of God, yet also a nation under a unique theocratic constitution. The church today inherits the spiritual realities typified by land, temple, and kingship, but the civil-judicial structures and their sanctions are not perpetuated. This guards against both supersessionist arrogance and theonomic misapplication. In sanctification, the moral law delivered at Sinai remains the rule of life for the believer. The preface to the Decalogue grounds obedience in redemption, not in the quest for life. The Reformed threefold use of the law is displayed in the Mosaic form: the civil use in the theocracy, the pedagogical use in exposing sin, and the normative use for the redeemed.

Finally, clarity about **federal headship** and **union with Christ** dissolves the fear that **republication** produces a mixed message. Adam as first head was under a **covenant of works**; Israel as corporate Adam recapitulates his failure in a typological sphere; Christ as second Adam and true Israel fulfills the works principle and receives the inheritance, which he then grants to his people by grace through faith. The believer’s obedience is the fruit of **union with Christ**, not the ground of life. This is why Paul can say that the commandment that promised life proved to be death to me, and at the same time the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set us free. The republication at Sinai thus serves the greater grace by staging, in public history, the impossibility of life by our doing and the necessity of life by Christ’s doing. Far from undermining assurance, it anchors it in a completed obedience outside of us.

To summarize the defended position: Sinai is not the **covenant of works as to substance**. It is the **covenant of grace** administering Christ to faith through promise, sacrifice, and type. Yet within its theocratic administration there is a real, divinely intended **typological works principle** governing Israel’s land tenure, sanctions, and historical experience, which is a **republication** of the Adamic principle not for personal justification but for national pedagogy and typology. Witsius and Turretin supply the distinction of substance and administration and the exegesis of the law’s legal maxim; Vos supplies the eschatological frame; Kline clarifies the national-typological works principle; Murray warns against formulations that could obscure grace. The composite yields a coherent account that satisfies the confessional unity of grace, explains Paul’s law-promise dialectic, protects sola fide and **imputation**, and renders Israel’s history the divinely crafted classroom for the gospel.
