# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann, a leading figure in **20th-century New Testament scholarship**, did not directly engage with the **Mosaic covenant** in terms of the **covenant of works** as articulated in Reformed theology. Instead, Bultmann approached the Old Testament covenants through the lens of **existential interpretation** and **demythologization**, emphasizing the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with God over traditional covenantal frameworks. For Bultmann, the Mosaic law primarily represented a historical and religious context for understanding the **human condition** rather than a theological structure of works versus grace.

- "The law is not a way of salvation, but a means of making sin manifest." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Scripture must be interpreted existentially, not through traditional dogmatic categories.
    - The Mosaic covenant is seen as a mythological expression of Israel’s relationship with God.
    - The focus is on the existential meaning behind covenant narratives, not their legal or forensic structure.
    - Bultmann rejects reading the Mosaic covenant as a literal **covenant of works**.
    - "Mythological thinking projects the transcendent into the immanent, the divine into the world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, superseding covenantal distinctions.
    - The law, including the Mosaic covenant, serves to reveal human need for the gospel.
    - The kerygma reinterprets the Old Testament in light of Christ’s resurrection.
    - The Mosaic law is not salvific but preparatory for the existential encounter with Christ.
    - "The kerygma alone brings the hearer into authentic existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Law**
    - The Mosaic law exposes the reality of **sin** and human estrangement from God.
    - Law is not a means to achieve righteousness but to reveal the impossibility of self-justification.
    - The existential crisis prompted by the law prepares one for faith.
    - The law’s function is anthropological, not soteriological.
    - "The law brings knowledge of sin, not salvation." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Forensic Covenantalism**
    - Bultmann does not accept the Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - He views such categories as products of later dogmatic development, not New Testament concerns.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a legal contract but a narrative of Israel’s historical experience.
    - Salvation is not achieved by works, nor is the Mosaic covenant a failed attempt at such.
    - "Paul’s polemic is not against the law as such, but against the misunderstanding of the law." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Christ is the fulfillment and end of the law, including the Mosaic covenant.
    - The old covenant is relativized in light of the new existential reality in Christ.
    - The Mosaic law’s purpose is completed in the revelation of Christ’s person and work.
    - The believer’s relationship to God is now defined by faith, not by covenantal law.
    - "Christ is the telos of the law for everyone who believes." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** shifted the discussion from traditional covenantal categories to existential and hermeneutical concerns. His emphasis on **demythologization** and the centrality of the **kerygma** influenced generations of New Testament scholars and theologians, particularly in the realm of biblical interpretation. While his views stand in sharp contrast to Reformed covenant theology, Bultmann’s work remains a critical reference point for understanding modern approaches to law, covenant, and salvation in the New Testament context.
