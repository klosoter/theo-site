# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** present the **Mosaic covenant** as an administration of the **covenant of grace**, while recognizing the presence of a **works principle** that echoes the original **covenant of works**. They maintain the unity of the covenant of grace throughout redemptive history, emphasizing that the Mosaic economy ultimately points to Christ and does not offer salvation by works.

- "This covenant [of grace] was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.5)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 20, 30, 93–97)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 12–20, 39–44)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A.A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - It offers the promise of salvation through faith in Christ, consistent with other administrations.
    - The ceremonial and sacrificial system anticipates and points forward to Christ.
    - The law functions as a tutor to lead to Christ, not as a means of meriting salvation.
    "Under the law, it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews..." (WCF 7.5)

2. **Works Principle Present but Not Substantive**
    - The Mosaic covenant includes a **works principle** to reveal sin and the need for a mediator.
    - Legal demands serve a pedagogical, not a soteric, function.
    - The republication of the works principle is typological, not substantial.
    - The law’s curse underscores the necessity of Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which He bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience..." (WCF 19.1)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction Maintained**
    - The Standards distinguish the **moral law** as a rule of life from the gospel as the means of salvation.
    - The law continues to bind all people, but not as a covenant of works for believers.
    - The ceremonial law is abrogated in Christ, but the moral demands remain.
    - The gospel provides justification by faith alone, which the law cannot offer.
    "The moral law doth forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof..." (WCF 19.5)

4. **Typology and Pedagogy of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant’s ceremonies and sacrifices are types and shadows of Christ.
    - The law exposes sin and points to the need for redemption.
    - Israel’s national blessings and curses typify spiritual realities.
    - The pedagogical use of the law is to drive sinners to Christ.
    "The Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ..." (WCF 7.6)

5. **Unity and Diversity in the Covenant of Grace**
    - There is one **covenant of grace** under various administrations.
    - The substance of salvation is the same throughout redemptive history.
    - The Mosaic administration differs in outward form, not in saving content.
    - The unity of the covenant is maintained despite historical diversity.
    "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **Mosaic covenant** and its relationship to the **covenant of works**. Their nuanced articulation has influenced subsequent debates on law, gospel, and the unity of redemptive history. The Standards’ careful distinction between substance and administration remains a touchstone for confessional Reformed churches and theologians, ensuring ongoing theological clarity and fidelity to the biblical covenants.
