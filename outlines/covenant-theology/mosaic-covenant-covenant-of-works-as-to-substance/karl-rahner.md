# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner, a leading Roman Catholic theologian, did not directly address the **Mosaic covenant** in terms of the **covenant of works** as framed in Reformed theology. Instead, Rahner approached the Old Testament covenants, including the Mosaic, through the lens of **salvation history** and the **universal offer of grace**, emphasizing the continuity of God's self-communication rather than a strict law-gospel dichotomy. For Rahner, all covenants are ultimately oriented toward the **supernatural existential** and the fulfillment of humanity in Christ.

- "The history of salvation is the history of the one covenant of God with mankind, which is fulfilled in Christ." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Salvation History**
   - Views the Old and New Testaments as a single, unfolding **history of salvation**.
   - Sees the **Mosaic covenant** as a preparatory stage, not a separate legalistic dispensation.
   - Rejects a sharp law-gospel opposition, emphasizing continuity.
   - All covenants are oriented toward the **self-communication of God** in Christ.
   - "The Old Covenant is not simply abrogated, but fulfilled and transcended in the New." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Supernatural Existential**
   - Every human is endowed with a **supernatural existential**, an orientation toward God’s grace.
   - The Mosaic law is interpreted within this universal openness to grace.
   - The possibility of salvation is not restricted to explicit knowledge of Christ or the gospel.
   - The law serves as a pedagogical means within the broader offer of grace.
   - "Grace is offered to every person, even outside the visible boundaries of the Church." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 4)

3. **Rejection of Covenant of Works/Grace Dichotomy**
   - Does not adopt the Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - Sees all divine-human covenants as gracious from the outset.
   - The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of a works-principle for eternal life.
   - Emphasizes the **primacy of grace** over legal obedience in all covenants.
   - "There is no period in salvation history in which man is left to his own natural powers alone." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - Christ is the fulfillment and center of all covenants, including the Mosaic.
   - The law points forward to the **eschatological reality** realized in Christ.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s significance is found in its preparatory role for the gospel.
   - The law is not salvific apart from Christ, but participates in the one economy of salvation.
   - "The definitive self-communication of God takes place in Jesus Christ." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Universal Offer of Salvation**
   - God’s salvific will is universal, extending to all humanity.
   - The Mosaic covenant is a historical expression of this universal will.
   - The concept of the **anonymous Christian** allows for salvation outside explicit covenantal knowledge.
   - The law is not a means of exclusion but of preparation for universal redemption.
   - "God’s grace is at work everywhere, even where it is not explicitly recognized." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 14)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic theology, especially in its rejection of a strict law-gospel or works-grace dichotomy. His emphasis on the **unity of salvation history** and the **universal offer of grace** has influenced ecumenical dialogue and broadened the understanding of Old Testament covenants within Christian theology. Rahner’s thought continues to challenge Reformed categories, inviting deeper reflection on the nature of divine covenants and the scope of salvation.
