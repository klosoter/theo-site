### ESSAY
To handle the question whether the **Mosaic covenant** is a **covenant of works as to substance**, a Westminster candidate must navigate several converging axes at once: the structure of **federal theology**, the exegesis of key Mosaic texts, the confessional placement of Sinai within the **covenant of grace**, and the contested notion of **republication** of the covenant of works. The question is not whether the Mosaic economy functions graciously in the history of redemption, but whether within that gracious administration there is a substantive works principle that recapitulates Adamic probation at the level of Israel’s national life, so that one may truly speak of a covenant of works as to substance, though not as to historical administration or soteriological outcome.

A precise starting point is to distinguish three things. First, the original **covenant of works** with Adam, involving personal, perfect, and perpetual obedience as the condition of eschatological life, with death as the sanction for disobedience. Second, the **covenant of grace**, in which sinners receive salvation by faith alone in Christ alone, who fulfills the law on their behalf. Third, the Mosaic covenant as a historical, multiform economy integrating law, promise, cultic typology, and national polity. The question is whether the Mosaic economy only republishes the law as norm within grace, or also republishes the covenant of works itself in some substantive way. The classical Reformed voice is internally diverse but not chaotic, and a defensible position must be both textually grounded and confessionally responsible.

John Calvin is decisive because he establishes both the fundamental unity and the subordinate diversity of the covenants. Writing in the Institutes and in his commentaries, Calvin insists on one **substance of the covenant** of grace under both Old and New Testaments: the same Christ, the same righteousness by faith, the same promise of eternal life. This is Calvin’s controlling polemic against both Anabaptists and antinomians, and it gives Westminster its basic architecture. Yet Calvin also strongly stresses the peculiar severity and conditionality of the Mosaic legislation. His exposition of Leviticus and Deuteronomy notes the repeated formula: do this and live, obey and remain in the land, disobey and be cut off. For Calvin, these conditions do not offer eternal life on the basis of fallen human merit; rather, the Lord uses them pedagogically to expose sin, drive Israel to Christ, and maintain outward discipline in a theocratic nation. Calvin thus distinguishes between the underlying gracious **substance** of the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants and the distinct **form** or economy in which this grace is administered at Sinai, with a sharper legal dispensation that terrifies consciences and preserves a people for the coming Messiah.

Examiners will press: Does Calvin give you warrant to call the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works as to substance? The answer is no, in the strict sense. Calvin is careful to protect the one gracious covenant, and while he recognizes a legal dispensation at Sinai, he does not speak of an actual covenant of works being reinstituted with Israel. Instead he speaks of legal preaching within the overarching gracious covenant. This means that if we wish to argue that the Mosaic covenant republishes the covenant of works as to substance, we must go beyond Calvin’s vocabulary, while remaining within his basic structural commitments: one gracious covenant in Christ, with varied legal and ceremonial administrations across history.

Francis Turretin, as a central voice of Post Reformation Reformed **scholasticism**, is crucial because he systematizes the covenantal distinctions implicated in the question. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, Turretin articulates the classic two-Adam federal schema: Adam under a **covenant of nature** or covenant of works, Christ as the second Adam under the **covenant of grace**. When he comes to the Mosaic economy, Turretin explicitly asks whether it is a covenant of works or a covenant of grace. His answer is carefully layered. On the one hand, as to its scope and ultimate end, the Mosaic covenant is a legal economy subservient to the **covenant of grace**, not itself a new covenant of works. It presupposes a fallen people and offers sacrifices that typologically signify Christ. But Turretin also speaks of a certain **legal condition** attached to the possession of temporal blessings in Canaan: Israel’s national tenure in the land is suspended upon obedience to the law. Here Turretin is drawing a distinction that becomes decisive later: soteriological grace versus typological and political conditions.

Turretin is willing to say that there is a kind of covenant of works at play relative to earthly and typological blessings, but not relative to eternal life. The law as covenant, when taken in itself and by abstraction from the gracious promises, repeats the condition of perfect obedience as the way to life and curse for disobedience. Yet that law is embedded within a broader administration of grace that never suspends justification on Israel’s own merit. Examiners may object that this is an artificial bifurcation. Turretin’s strength is that he refuses to flatten the Mosaic economy either into a bare covenant of grace or into a simple covenant of works; he sees a complex relation, in which the legal form recapitulates the covenant of works in a limited, typological sphere while serving the covenant of grace.

Herman Witsius, in The Economy of the Covenants, deepens this nuanced stance and is one of the classic sources for the language that the Mosaic covenant is a covenant of works as to some respect and a covenant of grace as to another. Witsius insists on doctrinal precision: the Mosaic covenant simply cannot be a pure covenant of works, since it presupposes sin and provides sacrifices and priesthood pointing to Christ. Nor can it be a bare covenant of grace identical in form to the New Testament, since its administration included a prominent works principle tied to temporal blessings and curses. Witsius therefore carefully distinguishes the Mosaic covenant considered broadly and strictly. Broadly, it is an administration of the **covenant of grace**, with Christ as its substance, as Paul argues in Galatians 3 and 4. Strictly, when the law is taken in itself and in contrast to promise, it bears the form and substance of a **covenant of works**, repeating the do this and live principle.

Here the category **as to substance** starts to appear: the moral law, as delivered at Sinai, materially reasserts the same command and sanction structure as the Adamic covenant. Witsius emphasizes that this is not for the purpose of offering eternal life by human obedience, which would contradict both the fall and the Abrahamic promises, but for pedagogical and typological purposes. Israel, as a corporate son, is placed under a legal arrangement that reflects Adam’s position in Eden: expulsion from the land functions as a recapitulation of expulsion from paradise. Yet within and through this legal administration, the gospel is preached and the Christ to come is typified in sacrifices and ceremonies. Witsius therefore provides a mature, balanced model of **republication**: the covenant of works is substantially republished in the Mosaic law, but subordinated to and instrumental within the covenant of grace.

John Murray marks a major turning point because he explicitly rejects the classical language of the Mosaic covenant as a covenant of works in any sense. In his essay on the Mosaic covenant and in his broader work on the covenants, Murray argues that the Mosaic economy is unqualifiedly an administration of the covenant of grace. He worries that speaking of a covenant of works at Sinai risks undermining the unity of redemptive grace and suggesting dual ways of salvation for Israel. For Murray, the law–gospel contrast in Paul is not covenantal in the sense of two historical covenants, but methodological: law as a means of justification versus promise in Christ. The Mosaic law functions as a rule of life and a pedagogue to Christ, but does not establish any works principle in the sphere of actual covenantal relations with God’s people.

Murray’s rejection of a works principle at Sinai is bound up with his influential denial of the traditional prefall **covenant of works**, which he prefers to call the Adamic administration. Since he is suspicious of merit language with respect to Adam, he is doubly suspicious of any analogous merit structure for Israel. For him, Israel’s obedience in relation to the land is a matter of filial gratitude and sanctification under grace, not a reintroduction of a works covenant. This Murray trajectory significantly shaped many later Westminster-style theologians and lies beneath contemporary opposition to Mosaic republication. Examiners will likely probe: if you follow Turretin and Witsius rather than Murray, how do you avoid a dualistic soteriology? The answer must be that the works principle at Sinai is strictly typological and national, not eschatological and personal, and that it is always embedded within and subordinate to the saving **covenant of grace**.

Meredith G. Kline revives and radicalizes the republication thesis. For Kline, in works such as Treaty of the Great King and Kingdom Prologue, the Mosaic covenant is structurally a **suzerain–vassal treaty** with a clear **works principle** embedded in its sanctions. Drawing on ancient Near Eastern treaty forms, Kline argues that the do this and live, do this and remain in the land, is a genuine covenant of works at the level of Israel’s national existence. He does not mean that individual Israelites were justified by their obedience; rather, the corporate and typological kingdom order in Canaan is conditional upon Israel’s fidelity, typologically recapitulating Adam’s probation and exile. Kline emphasizes that Israel is a type of the second Adam, and the land a type of the new creation; the Mosaic economy therefore dramatizes the works principle that Christ, as true Israel, will fulfill.

Kline is also careful theologically. He affirms the prefall **covenant of works** with Adam and insists on the **covenant of grace** as the only way of salvation for sinners. He thus frames the Mosaic economy as a complex covenantal entity: in its foundational Abrahamic promises it is gracious, but at the level of its national-legal order it is a covenant of works. This double layering fuels the modern terminology that the Mosaic covenant is a covenant of works as to substance or as to its earthly layer, while still an administration of the covenant of grace as to soteriology and typological intent. Critics charge Kline with bifurcating the covenant and undermining assurance, but his defenders reply that Kline is simply making explicit the very distinctions suggested in Turretin and Witsius, now with the exegetical resources of comparative treaty studies and a more robust biblical theology.

At this point, we can frame the internal Reformed debate. One party, following Murray, insists that the Mosaic covenant is purely an administration of the **covenant of grace**, with no real works principle beyond the general moral order that obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings discipline. Another party, following Turretin, Witsius, and developed by Kline, affirms a real **republication** of the covenant of works at Sinai, at least relative to Israel’s national life in the land. Within the republication camp itself, debate continues over whether the republication is merely formal and pedagogical, or also material and covenantal at the typological level. The phrase covenant of works as to substance intensifies the claim: it says not only that the Mosaic law reminds Israel of the covenant of works, but that it actually reconstitutes Israel as a federal person under a works principle concerning earthly tenure.

External criticisms come from several directions. Lutheran theology, with its sharp law–gospel contrast, tends to identify Sinai simply as law, in opposition to the gospel, but usually does not develop a detailed works-covenant schema at the national level. More significantly for contemporary Reformed debate, many evangelical biblical theologians resist any notion of a works principle applicable post fall. They appeal to texts like Deuteronomy 7 and 9, where God emphasizes that he did not set his love on Israel because of their righteousness, to argue that the Mosaic covenant is fundamentally gracious. From this perspective, any talk of a covenant of works as to substance seems to deny grace and to imply that Israel could earn even temporal blessings.

In response, the republication position must hold several lines together. First, the Mosaic covenant, considered historically and soteriologically, is an administration of the **covenant of grace**. Salvation for Israelites is by faith in the promised Christ alone, grounded in his future fulfillment of the law. The ceremonial system, the Day of Atonement, the priesthood, all presuppose that Israel is sinful and cannot stand before God on the basis of their works. Second, alongside and within this gracious arrangement, God sets up a national order whose continuance in the land visibly dramatizes the works principle. The conditional formulas of Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 are not empty rhetoric; they actually govern the historical course of the theocracy, culminating in exile when Israel, like Adam, breaks the covenant. Third, this typological works principle is itself gracious in intention, because it prepares the way for Christ by showing that even a privileged son, restored to a kind of Edenic order, cannot maintain the kingdom by obedience. In this sense the republication of the covenant of works at Sinai is instrumental within the broader **covenant of grace**.

Contemporary debates raise further issues. Some fear that if you speak of any covenant of works operative after the fall, even in a typological sphere, you will inevitably compromise **justification by faith alone**. The examiner may pose the objection sharply: If God covenanted with Israel on a works basis regarding the land, why could he not covenant with sinners on a works basis regarding heaven? The answer lies in the distinction between prefall and postfall capacities, and between typological and eschatological blessings. The original Adamic **covenant of works** was made with a sinless head, capable in principle of rendering the required obedience by natural powers, had he not fallen. No such arrangement is ever made with sinners; any works principle involving them must therefore be typological, subordinate, and limited to realms that do not involve the earning of eternal life. Israel under Sinai cannot possibly merit heaven by their obedience, and the covenant does not set such a prize before them on such terms. Rather, it holds out temporal blessing and curses that mirror the structure of the original covenant and anticipate Christ’s obedience and curse-bearing.

Another contemporary issue is political. Some versions of theonomy and Christian nationalism look to the Mosaic economy as a timeless political model. A robust republication doctrine responds by insisting that the Mosaic theocracy was a unique, typological order that has been fulfilled and abrogated in Christ. Precisely because the Mosaic covenant contained a national works principle tied to the typological land, it is not a direct blueprint for present nations. The civillaw structure, with its blessings and curses, belonged to Israel’s role as a corporate Adam in a typological Eden; it is not transposable into a post Pentecost church scattered among the nations. Thus a carefully articulated **republication** thesis protects both justification by faith and an appropriate discontinuity between Mosaic theocracy and contemporary political orders.

How then should one answer the exam question: Is the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works as to substance? The defensible position is as follows. The Mosaic covenant, considered in its overarching redemptive function and with respect to the salvation of individuals, is an administration of the **covenant of grace**, one with Abraham and preparatory to Christ. Yet within this gracious administration, God reasserts in a real and covenantal way the **substance of the covenant of works** at the national-typological level. The material command–sanction structure of the Adamic covenant is republished at Sinai in relation to Israel’s life in the land. This republication is not illusory, rhetorical, or merely pedagogical; it is covenantally operative for Israel’s history. But it is never a second way of eternal salvation, never a postfall offer of eschatological life on the basis of human merit.

To maintain this position under scrutiny, one must constantly link it to adjacent loci. The doctrine of **divine simplicity** and immutability guards the unity of God’s saving purpose across the covenants. The doctrine of Christ’s active and passive **obedience** presupposes that the covenant of works remains normatively valid and that Christ, as true Israel and last Adam, fulfills its demands in a fallen world. The doctrine of the church depends on recognizing that the Mosaic church was a mixed theocratic community with a national works principle, whereas the new covenant church is a pilgrim people without a typological land. All these loci converge in a republication doctrine that is precise, limited, and theologically integrated.

If pressed on the wording as to substance, one can answer that the Mosaic covenant republishes the substance of the covenant of works in the sense that the same moral law, with the same fundamental promise of life and threat of death, is covenantally applied to a corporate son in a typological realm. The difference is not in the material content of the law, but in the covenantal context and eschatological horizon. Adam’s arrangement was original and eschatological for the human race; Israel’s arrangement is subordinate and typological, preparing the stage for Christ. In that sense, we may affirm with Turretin, Witsius, and Kline that there is a real covenant of works dimension at Sinai, even while insisting with Calvin and against misconstruals that the one saving covenant of grace is not thereby divided or compromised.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The Mosaic covenant is an administration of the **covenant of grace** that contains a real, typological, national **republication** of the **covenant of works as to substance**, without offering eschatological life by merit to sinners.  
- Decisive figures: Calvin affirms one gracious covenant with a severe legal dispensation at Sinai but does not call it a works covenant; Turretin distinguishes a gracious Mosaic covenant subservient to Christ and a legal condition for temporal blessings; Witsius articulates Mosaic law as materially a covenant of works within the administration of grace; Murray rejects any works covenant category for Sinai and sees Mosaic wholly as covenant of grace; Kline revives and sharpens republication as a national works principle in a suzerain–vassal format.  
- Debates: Internal Reformed debates pit Murray’s anti-republication line against Turretin–Witsius–Kline style republication; external critics, especially Lutheran and evangelical biblical theologians, deny any postfall works principle; contemporary controversies concern justification, typology, theonomy, and the use of Mosaic law in politics.  
- Defended position: The Mosaic covenant is formally and soteriologically an administration of the **covenant of grace**, yet it substantively republishes the **covenant of works** at the level of Israel’s corporate life in the land, functioning typologically and pedagogically without creating a second way of salvation.  
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:  
  - Does republication compromise sola fide? No, because the works principle at Sinai is typological and national, not eschatological and personal, and salvation is always by Christ alone.  
  - In what sense is the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works as to substance? In that the same material command–sanction structure of the Adamic covenant is covenantally applied to Israel’s tenure in the land.  
  - How do you reconcile Deuteronomy’s grace emphasis with republication? God graciously elects Israel unconditionally, yet conditions their enjoyment of typological blessings on obedience, to magnify both grace and the need for Christ.  
  - What is the difference between Adam’s covenant of works and Israel’s? Adam’s was original and eschatological for all humanity; Israel’s is subordinate, postfall, and typological, terminating in exile and Christ’s fulfillment.  
  - Why does this matter for political theology? Because recognizing the Mosaic theocracy as a unique works-based national order guards against directly transplanting its civil structure into modern states.
