# Peter J. Gentry (1952– )

Peter J. Gentry approaches the **Mosaic covenant** through the lens of **biblical covenants** as a unified progression, emphasizing **typology** and the unfolding of **God’s redemptive plan**. He rejects the identification of the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in substance, instead viewing it as part of the gracious movement of God’s dealings with Israel, preparatory for the **new covenant** in Christ.

- "The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of the covenant of creation, but a development within the Abrahamic covenant that anticipates the new covenant." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant (with Stephen J. Wellum)
- "The Covenant of Creation" (SBJT, 2009)
- "The Significance of Covenants in Biblical Theology" (Tyndale Bulletin, 2012)
- "No One Holy Like the Lord" (in God’s Glory Revealed in Christ, 2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is a continuation of the **Abrahamic covenant**, not a separate covenant of works.
    - It functions within the broader framework of **God’s gracious purposes** for Israel.
    - The law is given to a redeemed people, not as a means of earning life, but as a guide for living in covenant relationship.
    - The Mosaic covenant anticipates and points forward to the **new covenant** in Christ.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is best understood as an administration of the Abrahamic covenant, not as a covenant of works." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Typological Function of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant serves as a **type** that foreshadows the work of Christ.
    - Its blessings and curses prefigure the ultimate realities fulfilled in the new covenant.
    - The sacrificial system and priesthood are **shadows** pointing to Christ’s atoning work.
    - Typology connects the Mosaic covenant organically to the entire biblical storyline.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is typological, pointing forward to the realities fulfilled in Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **Law and Grace in Redemptive History**
    - The giving of the law is not antithetical to grace but is embedded within God’s redemptive plan.
    - Obedience to the law is a response to prior redemption, not a means of meriting salvation.
    - The law exposes sin and points to the need for a greater mediator.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s demands highlight the necessity of the **new covenant** transformation.
    - "Law and grace are not opposed in the Mosaic covenant, but law functions within the context of grace." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Distinction from Covenant of Works**
    - Gentry distinguishes the **covenant of creation** (Adam) from the Mosaic covenant.
    - The Mosaic covenant does not offer life on the basis of perfect obedience alone.
    - Its structure is rooted in **God’s promise** and prior acts of deliverance.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s conditionality is typological, not identical in substance to the covenant of works.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is not a simple restatement of the covenant of creation." (Kingdom through Covenant)

5. **Covenant Progression and Fulfillment**
    - The biblical covenants progress toward fulfillment in Christ.
    - The Mosaic covenant is a temporary administration, preparatory for the **new covenant**.
    - Its limitations reveal the need for a better covenant with a perfect mediator.
    - The unity and diversity of the covenants are essential for understanding biblical theology.
    - "The covenants form a progression culminating in the new covenant inaugurated by Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Legacy and Impact

Gentry’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **covenant theology** by emphasizing the typological and progressive nature of the biblical covenants. His rejection of the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in substance has influenced both Baptist and broader evangelical scholarship, challenging traditional Reformed categories. By highlighting the organic unity and redemptive trajectory of the covenants, Gentry has contributed to a renewed understanding of the relationship between law, grace, and the unfolding of God’s plan in Scripture.
