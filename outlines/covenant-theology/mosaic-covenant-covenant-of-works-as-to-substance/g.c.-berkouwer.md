# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the question of the **Mosaic covenant** and its relation to the **covenant of works** with caution, emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history. He critiqued sharp distinctions that would make the Mosaic administration a republication of the covenant of works "as to substance," instead highlighting the continuity of **divine promise** and **grace**. Berkouwer was wary of any construction that would undermine the centrality of **Christ** and the **gospel** in the Old Testament economy.

- "The law is not a detour from the promise, but serves the promise in the history of redemption." (Faith and Justification)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Continuity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Stressed the essential unity of God's redemptive purpose from Abraham through Moses to Christ.
    - Rejected any view that would bifurcate the Mosaic covenant from the overarching covenant of grace.
    - Saw the law as serving, not contradicting, the promise.
    - Emphasized that the Mosaic administration was not a return to a pre-redemptive probation.
    - "The Mosaic law is not a second way of salvation, but is included in the one way of grace." (The Covenant of Grace)

2. **Critique of Substantive Republication**
    - Questioned the theological legitimacy of viewing the Mosaic covenant as a covenant of works "as to substance."
    - Warned against reading later theological categories anachronistically into the biblical text.
    - Argued that such views risked undermining the gracious character of God's dealings with Israel.
    - Maintained that the law's function was pedagogical, not meritorious.
    - "To see the Mosaic covenant as a substantive republication of the covenant of works is to misread the unity of redemptive history." (Faith and Justification)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Affirmed the distinction between law and gospel but resisted a rigid separation within the Mosaic economy.
    - Held that the law points to the need for grace and is fulfilled in Christ.
    - Saw the giving of the law as an act of grace within the covenantal relationship.
    - Emphasized that the law does not offer an alternative path to life apart from promise.
    - "The law, in its deepest sense, drives to Christ and is not opposed to the promise." (Faith and Sanctification)

4. **Christocentric Reading of the Old Testament**
    - Insisted that Christ is the center of all covenantal administrations, including Moses.
    - Interpreted the Mosaic covenant as preparatory and typological, not as an end in itself.
    - Warned against isolating the Mosaic law from the promise of redemption.
    - Saw the fulfillment of the law and covenant in the person and work of Christ.
    - "All the covenants find their fulfillment and meaning in Christ alone." (The Covenant of Grace)

5. **Pastoral and Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - Prioritized the pastoral implications of covenant theology for assurance and faith.
    - Emphasized the redemptive-historical unfolding of God's plan, rather than static legal categories.
    - Sought to avoid legalism by rooting obedience in grace, not merit.
    - Encouraged reading the Mosaic covenant as part of God's gracious pedagogy.
    - "The history of the covenant is the history of God's faithfulness, not man's achievement." (Faith and Justification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer's nuanced approach to the **Mosaic covenant** has shaped Reformed discussions by emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the centrality of **Christ** in all redemptive history. His critique of substantive republication has influenced later theologians to avoid sharp dichotomies between law and gospel within the Old Testament. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a redemptive-historical and pastoral approach to covenant theology, steering the tradition toward a more grace-centered reading of the Mosaic administration.
