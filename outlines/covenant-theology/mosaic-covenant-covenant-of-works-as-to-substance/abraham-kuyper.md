# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper regarded the **Mosaic covenant** as a unique administration within the overarching **covenant of grace**, rather than a simple restatement of the **covenant of works**. He stressed the **pedagogical** and **typological** functions of the Mosaic law, viewing it as preparatory for the coming of **Christ** and as highlighting the necessity of grace for salvation.

- "The Sinaitic covenant is not a return to the covenant of works, but a particular administration of the covenant of grace, with a legal form that serves to prepare for Christ." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration within the **covenant of grace**.
    - It does not offer salvation by works but points to the necessity of grace.
    - The law functions to reveal human inability and drive sinners to **Christ**.
    - The ceremonial and civil laws typologically foreshadow the coming Redeemer.
    "The covenant at Sinai is not a new covenant of works, but a form of the covenant of grace adapted to Israel’s historical situation." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

2. **Substantial Distinction from Covenant of Works**
    - The Mosaic covenant differs in substance from the original **covenant of works** with Adam.
    - Its legal demands do not constitute a new probation for eternal life.
    - The promise of life is not grounded in perfect obedience to the law under Moses.
    - The law is given within the context of **redemptive history**, not as an independent means of justification.
    "The law at Sinai does not reintroduce the probation of Adam, but serves a pedagogical function." (Dictaten Dogmatiek)

3. **Pedagogical Function of the Law**
    - The Mosaic law exposes sin and human inability to fulfill God’s demands.
    - It prepares the way for the gospel by highlighting the need for a mediator.
    - The law acts as a tutor, leading Israel (and all people) to **Christ**.
    - Its strictness is intended to humble and instruct, not to provide a path to life by works.
    "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith." (E Voto Dordraceno)

4. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - The Mosaic covenant’s ceremonies and sacrifices prefigure **Christ’s atoning work**.
    - The historical unfolding of covenants reveals God’s unified redemptive plan.
    - Israel’s experience under the law anticipates the fulfillment in the new covenant.
    - Typology is essential for understanding the relationship between old and new covenants.
    "The shadows of the law find their substance in Christ, who fulfills all righteousness." (De Gemeene Gratie)

5. **Unity and Diversity in the Covenants**
    - All biblical covenants are unified in their ultimate purpose: redemption through **Christ**.
    - There is diversity in administration, reflecting different historical contexts.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s unique features serve the broader covenantal structure.
    - The unity of the covenants is grounded in God’s unchanging promise of grace.
    "The diversity of the covenants does not undermine their unity in the one plan of redemption." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s careful distinction between the **Mosaic covenant** and the **covenant of works** has significantly influenced Reformed covenant theology, especially in Dutch and Neo-Calvinist traditions. His emphasis on the pedagogical and typological roles of the law has shaped later discussions on the function of the Mosaic economy within the **covenant of grace**. Kuyper’s legacy endures in debates over law, gospel, and the unity of redemptive history, offering a nuanced alternative to both strict republication and radical discontinuity models.
