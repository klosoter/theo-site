# Patrick Fairbairn (1805–1874)

Patrick Fairbairn approached the **Mosaic covenant** as a complex administration within the unfolding of **God’s covenantal dealings**, emphasizing its role as a preparatory and pedagogical stage rather than a simple **republication of the covenant of works**. He argued that, while the Mosaic economy bore a legal character and echoed the **law principle**, its substance was ultimately gracious, serving the purposes of the **covenant of grace** and pointing forward to Christ.

- "The law, as given from Sinai, was not designed to be a covenant of works, but a preparatory discipline for the covenant of grace." ("The Typology of Scripture")

## Key Works

- The Typology of Scripture
- The Revelation of Law in Scripture
- The Divine Government: Its Righteousness and Progress
- The Pastoral Epistles (for broader covenantal context)
- The Imperial Bible Dictionary (relevant entries on covenant)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Subordinate to the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is not an independent **covenant of works** but functions within the overarching **covenant of grace**.
    - Its ceremonies and sacrifices point forward to the redemptive work of Christ.
    - The legal demands serve to reveal sin and the need for a mediator.
    - The Mosaic economy is preparatory, not ultimate, in God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The law was a schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, not a rival method of salvation." (The Typology of Scripture)

2. **Pedagogical Use of the Law**
    - The law exposes human inability to achieve righteousness by works.
    - It drives the people to seek mercy and grace outside of themselves.
    - The ceremonial system illustrates the necessity of atonement.
    - The Mosaic law’s severity underscores the gracious provision in Christ.
    - "The law was given, not to supersede grace, but to prepare the way for its fuller manifestation." (The Typology of Scripture)

3. **Typological Function of Mosaic Institutions**
    - Mosaic rites and ordinances are types and shadows of the coming reality in Christ.
    - The sacrificial system prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of the Messiah.
    - The priesthood and tabernacle point to Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The temporal blessings and curses foreshadow spiritual realities.
    - "All that was peculiar to the Mosaic dispensation was typical and prospective." (The Typology of Scripture)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity with the Covenant of Works**
    - There is a formal resemblance to the **covenant of works** in the Mosaic law’s demands.
    - Substantively, the Mosaic covenant is gracious, not meritorious.
    - The republication of the law serves a revelatory, not salvific, function.
    - The Mosaic covenant cannot be isolated from the promise to Abraham.
    - "The law was not a second edition of the covenant of works, but a means of making its necessity felt." (The Revelation of Law in Scripture)

5. **Christological Fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - Christ fulfills the law’s demands and its types.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s purpose is realized in the person and work of Jesus.
    - The transition from law to gospel is the movement from shadow to substance.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s limitations highlight the sufficiency of Christ.
    - "The whole Mosaic economy was framed with a view to Christ and finds its end in Him." (The Typology of Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Fairbairn’s nuanced understanding of the **Mosaic covenant** influenced later Reformed discussions on the relationship between law and grace. His emphasis on the typological and preparatory nature of the Mosaic economy helped clarify the continuity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history. Fairbairn’s work remains significant for those seeking to avoid both legalistic and antinomian misreadings of the Old Testament. His legacy endures in the ongoing conversation about the unity and diversity of God’s covenants.
