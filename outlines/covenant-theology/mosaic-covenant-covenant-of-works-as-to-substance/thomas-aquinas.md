# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas approached the **Mosaic covenant** within the framework of **natural law** and **divine law**, seeing it as preparatory to the fullness of grace in Christ. He did not explicitly identify the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in the later Reformed sense, but he distinguished between the **Old Law** (lex vetus) and the **New Law** (lex nova), emphasizing the former’s insufficiency for salvation apart from grace. For Aquinas, the Mosaic covenant was **substantially gracious** in its orientation toward Christ, though it functioned as a pedagogue through its legal demands.

- "The Old Law was given, not that it might justify, but that it might manifest sin and prepare man for Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–107
- Commentary on the Letter to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Veritate

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Old Law as Preparatory**
    - The **Mosaic covenant** is fundamentally preparatory, directing people toward the coming of Christ.
    - It reveals **sin** and the need for **divine grace**.
    - The Law’s ceremonies and precepts serve as **types and shadows** of the New Covenant.
    - Its function is pedagogical, not salvific in itself.
    - "The Old Law was given to show forth the need for a Savior." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98, a. 2)

2. **Distinction Between Letter and Spirit**
    - The **letter** of the Law cannot justify; only the **Spirit** brings life.
    - The Law’s external commands are insufficient for **internal righteousness**.
    - True fulfillment of the Law requires **grace** imparted by the Holy Spirit.
    - The Law points beyond itself to the **New Law** of Christ.
    - "The Law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the Law might be fulfilled." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 2)

3. **Unity and Diversity of Divine Law**
    - The **Old Law** and **New Law** are united in their divine origin and ultimate purpose.
    - The Old Law differs in its **mode of administration** and **efficacy**.
    - Both covenants are ordered to the same **final end**: union with God.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a separate **covenant of works** but part of the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The Old Law was imperfect and preparatory; the New Law is perfect and consummatory." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 1)

4. **Necessity of Grace for Salvation**
    - Observance of the Mosaic Law alone cannot merit **eternal life**.
    - **Grace** is necessary for the fulfillment of the Law’s demands.
    - The Law exposes human inability and points to the need for **Christ’s mediation**.
    - Even under the Old Covenant, the righteous were saved by faith in the coming Redeemer.
    - "No one was ever justified by the works of the Law without faith in Christ, explicit or implicit." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 2)

5. **Typology and Fulfillment in Christ**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains **types and figures** that are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The ceremonial aspects are **abrogated** in the New Covenant.
    - The moral precepts remain, elevated and perfected by Christ’s teaching.
    - The Law’s ultimate purpose is realized in the **New Law of grace**.
    - "All the sacraments of the Old Law signified Christ and were fulfilled in Him." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 61, a. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** shaped later Catholic and Protestant understandings of the relationship between **law and gospel**. His insistence on the necessity of **grace** and the pedagogical role of the Law influenced both medieval and Reformation theology. While he did not frame the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in the Reformed sense, his distinctions between the Old and New Law provided a foundation for later covenantal discussions. Aquinas remains a central figure in debates about the continuity and discontinuity between the covenants.
