# Michael Horton (1964–)

Michael Horton contends that the **Mosaic covenant** is a unique administration within the overarching **covenant of grace**, yet it distinctly republishes the **covenant of works** principle in a typological and national sense. He maintains that the Mosaic economy applies the law principle externally to Israel, not as a means of salvation, but to highlight the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work and to point forward to the fulfillment found in Him.

- "The Mosaic covenant is not strictly a covenant of works, but it does operate on the principle of works in its typological, national dimension." ("God of Promise," p. 99)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as an Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally part of the unfolding **covenant of grace**.
    - It does not provide a different way of salvation than the Abrahamic or New covenants.
    - The sacrificial system and promises anticipate and point forward to Christ.
    - The law serves a pedagogical function, revealing sin and the need for a mediator.
    "The Mosaic covenant is not a break from grace, but an administration that anticipates Christ." (God of Promise, p. 99)

2. **Typological Republication of the Covenant of Works**
    - The Mosaic covenant republishes the **covenant of works** in a typological, not substantial, sense.
    - Israel’s tenure in the land is conditioned on obedience, reflecting the works principle.
    - This typology points to Christ, the true Israel, who fulfills the law.
    - The works principle is not salvific but pedagogical and typological.
    "The law principle is republished in the Mosaic economy, not as a means of justification, but as a shadow of the original covenant of works." (God of Promise, p. 99)

3. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Horton insists on a clear distinction between **law** and **gospel**.
    - The Mosaic law exposes sin and drives sinners to the promise.
    - The law’s demands cannot be met by fallen humanity.
    - The gospel is the announcement of Christ’s fulfillment of the law.
    "The law commands and the gospel gives; the law says 'do,' the gospel says 'done.'" (The Christian Faith, p. 666)

4. **National and Redemptive-Historical Dimensions**
    - The Mosaic covenant has a national, typological function for Israel.
    - Blessings and curses are tied to Israel’s obedience as a nation, not individual salvation.
    - The land promise is a type of the eschatological inheritance.
    - The redemptive-historical movement points beyond Moses to Christ.
    "The national covenant with Israel is a shadow, not the substance, of the covenant of grace." (God of Promise, p. 101)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - Christ is the true Israel who perfectly obeys the law.
    - He bears the curse of the law for his people.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s demands are met in Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - Believers receive the blessings of the covenant through union with Christ.
    "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes." (The Christian Faith, p. 667)

## Legacy and Impact

Horton’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** and its relationship to the **covenant of works** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on covenant theology. His emphasis on the **law-gospel distinction** and the typological fulfillment in Christ has influenced both scholarly and pastoral approaches to the Old Testament. Horton’s work bridges classic federal theology and modern redemptive-historical perspectives, reinforcing the centrality of Christ in all covenantal administrations.
