# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **Mosaic covenant** stresses the essential unity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history, while acknowledging significant differences in its administration between the Old and New Testaments. He maintains that the Mosaic administration, though marked by a pronounced legal element, is fundamentally gracious in substance and not a true republication of the **covenant of works**.

- "The Old Testament fathers had a covenant founded on the mercy of God, resting on the hope of pardon." (Institutes 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 7–11)
- Commentaries on the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy)
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin’s Tracts and Letters (selected correspondence on law and gospel)
- Calvin and the Federal Vision (ed. J. Mark Beach, secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is one in substance throughout both Old and New Testaments.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of the **covenant of works** in its essence.
    - The promises to Abraham and the giving of the law to Moses are part of the same gracious covenant.
    - Differences between the covenants are administrative, not in the fundamental promise of salvation by grace.
    "The covenant made with all the patriarchs is so much like ours in substance and reality, that the two are actually one and the same." (Institutes 2.10.2)

2. **Pedagogical Use of the Law**
    - The Mosaic law exposes human sinfulness and the need for grace.
    - The law’s demands highlight the impossibility of justification by works.
    - This pedagogical function prepares for Christ and the gospel.
    - The law acts as a "schoolmaster" leading to Christ, not as a means of attaining life by works.
    "The law was added because of transgressions, that it might make transgressions obvious, and thus compel men to seek grace." (Institutes 2.7.6)

3. **Typological and Ceremonial Distinctions**
    - Calvin distinguishes between the moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of the Mosaic law.
    - The ceremonial laws are shadows pointing to the substance found in Christ.
    - The moral law reflects the eternal will of God and continues to bind all people.
    - The Mosaic ceremonies are abrogated in Christ, but their typological significance remains.
    "The ceremonies had no other end than to direct the people to Christ." (Institutes 2.7.1)

4. **External Administration vs. Internal Substance**
    - The Mosaic covenant’s external form appears legal, but its internal substance is gracious.
    - The law, when viewed apart from Christ, seems to offer life by works, but this is not its true intent.
    - The external administration was designed to drive Israel to seek mercy in the promised Redeemer.
    - The substance of the covenant remains faith in God’s promise, not works-righteousness.
    "The law was not given to abolish the promise, but to confirm it, and to keep the people in expectation of the promised salvation." (Institutes 2.7.2)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
    - Calvin recognizes both continuity (one **covenant of grace**) and discontinuity (different administrations).
    - The Mosaic covenant is a distinct phase, marked by greater legal emphasis, but not a return to the **covenant of works**.
    - The law’s function changes with the coming of Christ, who fulfills its demands.
    - The Mosaic period is preparatory, not ultimate, in God’s redemptive plan.
    "The Old Testament differs from the New in the mode of dispensation, not in the substance of the promise." (Institutes 2.11.4)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in debates over **law and gospel** and the unity of the **covenant of grace**. His careful distinction between substance and administration influenced later federal theologians, even as they developed more explicit doctrines of the **covenant of works**. Calvin’s approach remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments and the nature of redemptive history.
