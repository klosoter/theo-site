# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck approached the **Mosaic covenant** as a unique administration within the broader unity of the **covenant of grace**, yet he acknowledged that it bore a certain **legal character** reminiscent of the **covenant of works**. While Bavinck rejected the idea that the Mosaic covenant was a republication of the covenant of works in a strict sense, he recognized that it included elements that echoed the demands and structure of the original covenant with Adam, especially in its typological and pedagogical functions.

- "The law given at Sinai is not a new covenant of works, but it does come with a form that reminds one of the covenant of works and thus serves to drive Israel to Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- Our Reasonable Faith
- "The Covenant of Grace" (in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society)
- "The Law and the Gospel" (in Reformed Dogmatics and related essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the one **covenant of grace**.
    - All Old Testament covenants, including Sinai, point forward to Christ and the gospel.
    - The substance of salvation remains the same throughout redemptive history.
    - The Mosaic law serves a preparatory and pedagogical role within this unified covenantal structure.
    - "The covenant of grace is one in substance, though it appears in different forms." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

2. **Legal Character of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains a pronounced **legal aspect** not found in the same way in other administrations.
    - The giving of the law at Sinai highlights the demands of perfect obedience.
    - This legal dimension is pedagogical, revealing sin and the need for redemption.
    - The law functions as a tutor to lead Israel to Christ, not as a means of ultimate justification.
    - "The law was given to increase the knowledge of sin and to drive people to Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

3. **Typological Function of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant typifies the **covenant of works** in its form and structure.
    - Blessings and curses under Moses echo the original probation in Eden.
    - Israel’s experience under the law serves as a historical type pointing to Christ’s fulfillment.
    - The typology is not identity; the Mosaic covenant is not a literal republication of the covenant of works.
    - "The Sinaitic covenant is a shadow and type, not the substance, of the covenant of works." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

4. **Substance vs. Administration Distinction**
    - Bavinck distinguishes between the **substance** (grace) and the **administration** (form) of the covenant.
    - The Mosaic administration includes law but does not change the gracious substance.
    - The external form may emphasize works, but the underlying promise remains redemptive.
    - This distinction safeguards the unity of redemptive history and the continuity of salvation.
    - "The difference lies not in the substance but in the administration of the covenant." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

5. **Rejection of Strict Republication**
    - Bavinck explicitly denies that the Mosaic covenant is a strict or full republication of the **covenant of works**.
    - He warns against confusing the pedagogical use of the law with a return to works-based righteousness.
    - The Mosaic law’s demands highlight human inability and point to the necessity of grace.
    - The law’s function is subordinate to the promise and fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is not a new covenant of works, but a dispensation of the covenant of grace with a legal form." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.220)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** has shaped Reformed discussions on the relationship between law and gospel, especially regarding the continuity and discontinuity between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**. His careful distinction between substance and administration provided a framework for later theologians to avoid both antinomianism and legalism. Bavinck’s influence endures in contemporary covenant theology, particularly in debates over the republication thesis and the pedagogical role of the law.
