# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **Mosaic covenant** within the broader context of **salvation history** and the unfolding of **divine revelation**. He did not frame the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in the classic Reformed sense, but rather emphasized its provisional and preparatory role in the history of **God’s self-disclosure**, culminating in Christ. For Pannenberg, the Mosaic covenant is significant for its function in the development of **law**, **community identity**, and the anticipation of the **new covenant**.

- "The law is not the final word of God to his people, but a stage in the history of revelation that points beyond itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2
- Revelation as History (with R. Rendtorff, U. Wilckens, T. Rendtorff)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God
- Jesus—God and Man

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Salvation History as the Framework**
   - The Mosaic covenant is interpreted within the progressive unfolding of **salvation history**.
   - It is not an isolated legal arrangement but part of God’s dynamic engagement with humanity.
   - The law given at Sinai is preparatory, pointing forward to the fullness of revelation in Christ.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s significance lies in its historical and communal function.
   - "The history of Israel is the medium of God’s revelation, not merely the backdrop." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Law as Provisional, Not Ultimate**
   - The Mosaic law is a temporary measure, not the final mode of relationship between God and humanity.
   - It reveals human inability to achieve righteousness through works.
   - The law’s pedagogical function is to prepare for the coming of Christ.
   - The ultimate fulfillment of God’s promise is found in the new covenant, not in the Mosaic law.
   - "The law is not the end, but a means to lead to Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Covenant as Community-Forming**
   - The Mosaic covenant establishes Israel as a distinct people of God.
   - It provides the ethical and religious foundation for Israel’s communal life.
   - The covenant shapes Israel’s identity in anticipation of universal salvation.
   - Community is central to God’s historical self-revelation.
   - "The covenant at Sinai creates a people whose life is to be a witness to God’s rule." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Classic Covenant of Works Schema**
   - Pannenberg does not adopt the Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - He sees the Mosaic covenant as part of the one unfolding purpose of God, not as a republication of a works principle.
   - The law’s demands highlight the need for grace, but do not constitute a separate covenantal order.
   - The unity of God’s salvific action is emphasized over legal or forensic categories.
   - "The distinction between law and gospel is historical, not ontological." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant**
   - Jesus Christ is the telos of the Mosaic law and covenant.
   - The Mosaic covenant’s limitations are overcome in the new covenant established by Christ.
   - The law’s true meaning is revealed in the person and work of Jesus.
   - The continuity and discontinuity between covenants is resolved in Christ’s universal significance.
   - "In Christ, the law finds its fulfillment and its end." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** has influenced contemporary theology by emphasizing the unity of **salvation history** and the provisional nature of the law. His rejection of the classic **covenant of works** framework has prompted further discussion about the relationship between law, grace, and revelation. Pannenberg’s work remains significant for those exploring the historical and communal dimensions of biblical covenants, especially in dialogue with Reformed and Lutheran traditions.
