# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin maintained that the **Mosaic covenant** was, in its substance, an administration of the **covenant of grace**, even though it bore an accidental resemblance to the **covenant of works**. He argued that the Mosaic economy, while containing a republication of the law, did not reintroduce the covenant of works as a means of justification but served to drive sinners to Christ by exposing their inability to fulfill the law.

- "The law promulgated by Moses was not given as a covenant of works, but as subservient to the covenant of grace." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 12.6.7)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is, in its essence, part of the unfolding **covenant of grace**.
    - It points forward to Christ and the promise of redemption.
    - The ceremonial law typologically prefigures the gospel.
    - The moral law exposes sin and the need for a mediator.
    "The Mosaic covenant was not given as a covenant of works, but as a subservient administration of the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

2. **Subservient Aspect: Law as Pedagogue**
    - The Mosaic law functions as a **pedagogue** to lead Israel to Christ.
    - It reveals the impossibility of justification by works.
    - The law convicts of sin and drives sinners to seek grace.
    - The pedagogical use is temporary and preparatory.
    "The law was added because of transgressions, that it might be our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ." (Institutes, 12.6.8)

3. **Republication of the Covenant of Works: Accidental, Not Substantial**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains a **republication** of the law given to Adam.
    - This republication is accidental (in the mode of administration), not substantial (in the essence of the covenant).
    - The law’s demand for perfect obedience is reiterated, but not as a means of life.
    - The substance remains gracious, not meritorious.
    "The law was promulgated not as a covenant of works, but as a rule of life in the hand of a mediator." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

4. **Typology and Ceremonial Law**
    - The ceremonial aspects of the Mosaic covenant are **types and shadows** of Christ.
    - These ceremonies point to the need for atonement and a better priesthood.
    - The types are fulfilled in the new covenant.
    - The ceremonies are not themselves means of justification.
    "The ceremonies were shadows, but the body is of Christ." (Institutes, 12.6.9)

5. **Unity and Diversity in the Covenants**
    - There is a fundamental unity between the old and new covenants in the promise of salvation.
    - The diversity lies in the external administration and the clarity of revelation.
    - The Mosaic covenant is more legal in form, but gracious in substance.
    - The law/gospel distinction is maintained within the covenantal structure.
    "The difference is not of substance, but of accidents and circumstances." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as gracious in substance but legal in administration profoundly shaped later **Reformed federal theology**. His careful distinction between the **substance** and **accidents** of the covenant provided a framework for understanding the continuity and discontinuity between the covenants. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary debates over the republication of the covenant of works and the pedagogical function of the law in redemptive history.
