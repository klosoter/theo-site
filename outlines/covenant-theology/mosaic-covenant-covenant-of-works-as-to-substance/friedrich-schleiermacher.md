# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher did not directly address the **Mosaic covenant** in terms of the **covenant of works** as later developed in Reformed theology. Instead, his approach to **covenant theology** was shaped by his emphasis on the **religious consciousness** and the unfolding of **divine revelation** in history. Schleiermacher viewed the Mosaic covenant as a historical stage in the development of **God-consciousness** rather than as a legal or forensic arrangement akin to the traditional **covenant of works**.

- "The Old Testament economy is not to be regarded as a mere legal preparation for the Gospel, but as a positive stage in the progressive revelation of God." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Secondary: "Schleiermacher on Law and Gospel" (in various theological analyses)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
    - The essence of religion is found in the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - Covenants are interpreted as expressions of evolving God-consciousness, not legal contracts.
    - The Mosaic covenant is a historical manifestation of humanity’s developing awareness of the divine.
    - Theological categories are subordinated to the experience of faith within the community.
    - "Religion is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

2. **Historical Development of Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds progressively through distinct historical epochs.
    - The Mosaic covenant is a necessary stage in the maturation of religious consciousness.
    - No sharp dichotomy between law and gospel; both serve the unfolding of divine self-disclosure.
    - The Old Testament is valued for its positive contribution to the history of redemption.
    - "The revelation of God is always mediated through historical forms." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Covenant Categories**
    - Schleiermacher does not adopt the Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - He interprets biblical covenants as relational rather than contractual or legal.
    - The Mosaic law is not viewed as a republication of a works-principle.
    - Emphasis is placed on the unity of God’s gracious dealing with humanity throughout history.
    - "The legal standpoint is always subordinate to the religious." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Christ as Fulfillment, Not Contrast**
    - Christ is the culmination of the religious development begun in Israel.
    - The Mosaic covenant is preparatory, but not antithetical, to the work of Christ.
    - The distinction between law and gospel is reframed as stages in the growth of God-consciousness.
    - Salvation is understood in terms of participation in Christ’s God-consciousness, not legal imputation.
    - "In Christ, the highest stage of God-consciousness is realized." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical Transformation over Legal Obedience**
    - The Mosaic law is valued for its formative ethical influence, not as a means of meriting life.
    - Ethics is rooted in the transformation of the self in relation to God, not in covenantal probation.
    - The law serves to cultivate communal and individual piety.
    - The focus is on the inward renewal of the person, not external conformity to a works principle.
    - "The law educates the people for the higher life of the spirit." (Christian Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** decisively shifted the discussion away from the traditional **covenant of works** framework, emphasizing instead the historical and experiential dimensions of revelation. His influence led to a reorientation of covenant theology in modern Protestantism, prioritizing **religious experience** and the unity of God’s gracious action. While his views diverged sharply from Reformed orthodoxy, they laid the groundwork for later developments in biblical theology and the study of the history of religions. Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the nature and function of biblical covenants.
