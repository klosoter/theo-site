# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Mosaic covenant** with a nuanced understanding, emphasizing its continuity with the **covenant of grace** while recognizing elements reminiscent of the **covenant of works**. He resists a strict identification of the Mosaic covenant as a republication of the covenant of works in substance, instead highlighting its role in the unfolding of **redemptive history** and its function within the broader **biblical covenants**.

- "The Mosaic covenant is an administration of the covenant of grace, though it contains reminders of the covenant of works." (Systematic Theology, p. 81)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Covenant Theology" in Reformed Theological Review (various articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
   - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
   - It points forward to Christ and the fulfillment of God's redemptive promises.
   - The law given at Sinai serves a pedagogical function, revealing sin and the need for a mediator.
   - The sacrificial system underscores the provision of grace within the covenant.
   - "The Mosaic covenant is not a return to the covenant of works, but a further revelation of grace." (Systematic Theology, p. 81)

2. **Presence of Works Principle**
   - The Mosaic covenant contains a **works principle** that echoes the original covenant of works.
   - Obedience is required for Israel to remain in the land, reflecting typological blessings and curses.
   - This principle is not ultimate but points to the need for perfect obedience fulfilled in Christ.
   - The works principle functions within the context of grace, not as a means of ultimate justification.
   - "The works principle is present, but it is not the basis of salvation for Israel." (Systematic Theology, p. 81)

3. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Progression**
   - The Mosaic covenant is typological, foreshadowing the work of Christ.
   - Its ceremonies and laws anticipate the new covenant realities.
   - The historical progression from Moses to Christ demonstrates the unity of God's plan.
   - The Mosaic covenant must be interpreted in light of the whole **redemptive history**.
   - "The Mosaic covenant is a shadow, not the substance; the substance is Christ." (Systematic Theology, p. 82)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
   - Frame affirms a distinction between **law and gospel** but sees them as united in God's covenantal dealings.
   - The law exposes sin and drives sinners to the promise of grace.
   - The gospel is present in the Mosaic covenant through types, promises, and sacrifices.
   - The law is not opposed to grace but serves its purposes within the covenant.
   - "Law and gospel are not enemies, but partners in God's redemptive plan." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord, p. 151)

5. **Covenantal Continuity and Discontinuity**
   - There is both continuity and discontinuity between the Mosaic covenant and other biblical covenants.
   - The substance of salvation by grace through faith remains unchanged.
   - The form and administration of the covenant differ according to redemptive epochs.
   - The Mosaic covenant prepares for and is fulfilled in the new covenant in Christ.
   - "The covenants differ in administration, not in the way of salvation." (Systematic Theology, p. 82)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** has influenced contemporary Reformed discussions by emphasizing both the unity and diversity of the biblical covenants. His insistence on the **covenant of grace** as the overarching framework has shaped debates on law, gospel, and the role of works in redemptive history. Frame’s careful distinctions and redemptive-historical focus continue to inform systematic theology and covenant theology in the Reformed tradition.
