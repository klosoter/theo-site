# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive understanding of the **Mosaic covenant** by arguing that, while it is formally a **covenant of works**, it is administered within the broader context of the **covenant of grace**. Kline emphasized the **typological** and **republication** aspects of the Mosaic economy, asserting that its law principle recapitulates the **works principle** operative in the original **Adamic covenant**. This nuanced view has been influential in Reformed discussions of the relationship between law and gospel.

- "The Mosaic economy was a typological republication of the original works arrangement with Adam." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- "Law Covenant" in The New Dictionary of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Typological Republication**
   - The Mosaic covenant formally reintroduces the **works principle** found in the covenant with Adam.
   - This republication is typological, not soteric, pointing forward to Christ's fulfillment.
   - The law given at Sinai serves as a historical re-enactment of the probationary arrangement.
   - Israel's tenure in the land is conditioned on obedience, mirroring Adam's probation in Eden.
   - "The law was republished at Sinai as a typological works arrangement." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Substance vs. Administration Distinction**
   - The Mosaic covenant is not, in substance, a covenant of grace, but it is administered within the covenant of grace.
   - The works principle operates at the typological and national level, not the ultimate level of salvation.
   - The underlying promise to Abraham remains operative through the Mosaic period.
   - The Mosaic law exposes sin and drives Israel to the need for a Redeemer.
   - "The Mosaic covenant is a typological overlay, not a replacement of the Abrahamic promise." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Law-Gospel Contrast Maintained**
   - Kline insists on a sharp distinction between the **law principle** (do this and live) and the **gospel principle** (grace through faith).
   - The Mosaic covenant's works principle is not a means of ultimate justification.
   - The law's demands highlight the necessity of grace and the insufficiency of human obedience.
   - The gospel is present in the Mosaic era through the sacrificial system and promises.
   - "The law principle is not the gospel principle; the two must not be confused." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Covenant Structure and Ancient Near Eastern Parallels**
   - Kline draws on ancient Near Eastern **suzerain-vassal treaties** to explain the form of the Mosaic covenant.
   - The structure of Deuteronomy mirrors these treaties, emphasizing conditionality.
   - Blessings and curses in the Mosaic covenant reflect the treaty pattern's sanctions.
   - This historical context clarifies the works-based aspect of Israel's national covenant.
   - "The Mosaic covenant is cast in the form of a suzerainty treaty, with its own stipulations and sanctions." (Treaty of the Great King)

5. **Typology and Eschatology**
   - The Mosaic covenant's works principle is typological, foreshadowing Christ's active obedience.
   - Israel's failure under the law points to the necessity of a new and better covenant.
   - The typological function of the Mosaic law is fulfilled in the person and work of Christ.
   - The eschatological hope is grounded in the movement from law to grace, from type to reality.
   - "The typological works principle finds its eschatological fulfillment in Christ." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline's articulation of the **republication thesis** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed debates on the nature of the Mosaic covenant and its relationship to the **covenant of works**. His careful distinction between substance and administration has provided a framework for understanding the continuity and discontinuity between the old and new covenants. Kline's influence persists in discussions of **law and gospel**, typology, and covenant theology, especially among those seeking to maintain both the integrity of Reformed soteriology and the biblical-theological storyline.
