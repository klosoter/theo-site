# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a nuanced interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant**, rejecting the idea that it is a simple republication of the **covenant of works** in substance. Instead, Murray emphasized the **unity of the covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history, while acknowledging formal similarities between the Mosaic administration and the covenant of works. He maintained that the Mosaic covenant is fundamentally gracious, serving the unfolding of **redemptive revelation** rather than reintroducing a works-based principle for life.

- "The Mosaic covenant is an administration of the covenant of grace and not a covenant of works." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - It serves to advance the redemptive purposes begun in the Abrahamic covenant.
    - The law given at Sinai is not a reintroduction of a works-principle for justification.
    - The Mosaic economy points forward to Christ and the fulfillment of the promise.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is not a covenant of works, nor is it a simple repetition of the Abrahamic; it is an administration of the covenant of grace." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Formal Similarities to Covenant of Works**
    - Murray acknowledges formal similarities between the Mosaic and Adamic covenants.
    - The Mosaic law contains conditional elements reminiscent of the covenant of works.
    - Blessings and curses in Deuteronomy echo the structure of the original works covenant.
    - These similarities are pedagogical, not substantive, in nature.
    - "There are features in the Mosaic covenant which bear resemblance to the covenant of works, but the substance is not the same." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - The history of redemption is governed by the unity of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Mosaic covenant is organically connected to both the Abrahamic and New covenants.
    - All administrations of the covenant of grace share the same promise and mediator.
    - The law serves a preparatory and pedagogical function within this unity.
    - "The unity of the covenant of grace is not destroyed by the peculiarities of the Mosaic administration." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Murray affirms a distinction between law and gospel, but not a separation.
    - The law under Moses reveals sin and drives to Christ, rather than offering life by works.
    - The Mosaic law is subordinate to the promise and serves the gospel.
    - The function of the law is to magnify grace, not to establish a works-based righteousness.
    - "The law was given to shut us up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Typology and Redemptive Progression**
    - The Mosaic covenant is typological, pointing forward to the work of Christ.
    - The sacrificial system and ceremonial laws prefigure the gospel realities.
    - The temporal blessings and curses anticipate eschatological fulfillment.
    - The Mosaic administration is a stage in the unfolding of the **covenant of grace**.
    - "The Mosaic economy was a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as an administration of the covenant of grace has shaped Reformed discussions on law, gospel, and redemptive history. His rejection of the Mosaic covenant as a republication of the covenant of works in substance has influenced generations of Westminster theologians. Murray’s emphasis on the unity of the covenant of grace and the typological function of the Mosaic law remains a significant reference point in contemporary covenant theology.
