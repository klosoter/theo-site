# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen maintained that the **Mosaic covenant** was, in its external administration, a **renewal of the covenant of works** as to its substance, yet ultimately served the purposes of the **covenant of grace**. He distinguished between the **substance** and **administration** of covenants, arguing that while the Mosaic economy externally echoed the works principle, it was internally subservient to the promise of **Christ** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The covenant made with Israel at Sinai had a resemblance of the covenant of works, but was not absolutely the same with it." (Works, 22:86)

## Key Works

- "Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews" (especially Vol. 6–7)
- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed"
- "A Discourse Concerning Evangelical Love, Church Peace, and Unity"
- "Works of John Owen," Vol. 22: "Of the Old and New Covenant"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Substance and Administration**
   - The **Mosaic covenant** is not identical in substance to the **covenant of works**, but its administration reflects works principles.
   - The external form at Sinai included a republication of the law as a rule of righteousness.
   - Internally, the Mosaic covenant pointed to the **covenant of grace** and Christ.
   - The law given at Sinai served pedagogical purposes, exposing sin and driving to Christ.
   - "There was a renovation of the covenant of works in respect of the matter and substance of the law, but not as to the form and end of the covenant." (Works, 22:86)

2. **Pedagogical Function of the Law**
   - The Mosaic law was designed to reveal human inability to fulfill righteousness by works.
   - It prepared Israel for the coming of the **Mediator** by exposing sin.
   - The law’s demands highlighted the necessity of **grace**.
   - The ceremonial system pointed forward to the redemptive work of Christ.
   - "The law was given to convince men of sin, and to drive them to Christ." (Works, 22:87)

3. **Typology and Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - The Mosaic covenant contained types and shadows of the coming **Messiah**.
   - Sacrifices and ceremonies prefigured the atoning work of Christ.
   - The covenant’s ultimate purpose was to lead to the **new covenant**.
   - The Mosaic economy was temporary, awaiting fulfillment in Christ.
   - "All the sacrifices and ordinances of the law were types of Christ and his mediation." (Hebrews, Vol. 6)

4. **Conditionality and National Israel**
   - The Mosaic covenant included conditional promises tied to Israel’s obedience.
   - Blessings and curses were administered on a national, temporal level.
   - These conditions did not alter the eternal promises of the **covenant of grace**.
   - The national aspect was distinct from the spiritual, saving benefits.
   - "The covenant at Sinai was made with the people as a nation, not as the seed of Abraham according to the promise." (Works, 22:90)

5. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - Despite administrative differences, the substance of salvation remained by **grace through faith**.
   - The Mosaic covenant did not introduce a new way of salvation.
   - Believers under the law were saved by the same promise as those under the gospel.
   - The law served the unfolding of the single redemptive plan.
   - "The covenant of grace was the same for substance under the Old Testament as under the New." (Works, 22:81)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as a republication of the **covenant of works** in administration, but not in substance, has profoundly shaped Reformed covenant theology. His careful distinctions influenced later theologians in debates over **law and gospel**, and his writings remain a touchstone for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Covenants. Owen’s legacy endures in discussions of **federal theology** and the pedagogical use of the law within the broader Reformed tradition.
