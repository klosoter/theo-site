# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge maintained that the **Mosaic covenant** was, in its outward administration, a **republication of the covenant of works**, yet as to its ultimate design and substance, it remained part of the overarching **covenant of grace**. He distinguished between the **legal** and **evangelical** aspects of the Mosaic economy, arguing that the law given at Sinai served to convict of sin and drive sinners to Christ, rather than to offer life through works.

- "The law was not given as a covenant of works, in order that by obedience men might be justified, but as a schoolmaster to lead us to Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the Law and the Covenants)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as an Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally part of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Its ceremonies and sacrifices pointed forward to Christ and the gospel.
    - The law was given to reveal sin and the need for redemption.
    - The Mosaic economy did not offer salvation by works but by faith in the promised Redeemer.
    - "The Mosaic covenant was not a covenant of works, but a form of the covenant of grace." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Republication of the Covenant of Works in a Subordinate Sense**
    - The Mosaic law externally restated the **covenant of works** principle: “Do this and live.”
    - This republication was pedagogical, not soteric.
    - The law’s demands highlighted human inability and the necessity of grace.
    - The legal element was subordinate to the gracious purpose of the covenant.
    - "The law was republished under Moses, not as the means of justification, but to convince of sin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Distinction Between Substance and Administration**
    - Hodge distinguished between the **substance** (grace) and the **administration** (law) of the Mosaic covenant.
    - The outward form could appear legal, but the underlying substance was gracious.
    - The ceremonial law prefigured Christ and the gospel.
    - The moral law exposed sin but did not provide the means of salvation.
    - "The substance of the covenant under Moses was the same as under Abraham and Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Purpose of the Law: Conviction and Preparation for Christ**
    - The law was intended to show the holiness of God and the sinfulness of man.
    - It served as a **schoolmaster** to lead Israel to Christ.
    - The impossibility of fulfilling the law pointed to the necessity of a Redeemer.
    - The law’s pedagogical function was central in redemptive history.
    - "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace Across Redemptive History**
    - Hodge emphasized the continuity of the **covenant of grace** from Abraham through Moses to Christ.
    - The Mosaic covenant did not introduce a new way of salvation.
    - All Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the promised Messiah.
    - The differences between covenants were administrative, not substantial.
    - "There is, therefore, but one covenant of grace, under all dispensations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s nuanced articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as both a republication of the **covenant of works** (in its legal demands) and an administration of the **covenant of grace** (in its substance) shaped later Reformed discussions on covenant theology. His careful distinctions influenced generations of Presbyterian and Reformed theologians, especially in debates over law and gospel. Hodge’s synthesis remains a standard reference for understanding the relationship between the Mosaic economy and the unity of redemptive history.
