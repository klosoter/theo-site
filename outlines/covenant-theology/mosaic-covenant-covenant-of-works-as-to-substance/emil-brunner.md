# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **Mosaic covenant** through his broader understanding of **divine-human relationship** and **covenant theology**, but he rejected the classic Reformed identification of the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in substance. Brunner emphasized the existential and relational character of all covenants, seeing the Mosaic law as a means of revealing both **human incapacity** and the necessity of **divine grace**, rather than as a republication of a works-principle for salvation.

- "The Law is given, not as a way of salvation, but as a mirror in which man sees his own incapacity and his need of grace." (The Divine Imperative)

## Key Works

- The Divine Imperative (1937)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (1950)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Divine-Human Encounter**
    - The covenant is fundamentally a personal relationship initiated by God.
    - All biblical covenants, including the Mosaic, are rooted in **divine grace** rather than legal contract.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a separate order of salvation but part of God’s ongoing dialogue with humanity.
    - Brunner rejects a strict dichotomy between law and gospel in covenant history.
    - "The covenant is not a contract, but a relationship of trust and obedience." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Law as Revelation of Human Need**
    - The Mosaic law exposes human inability to fulfill God's will.
    - Its purpose is pedagogical, driving humanity to recognize dependence on grace.
    - The law is not a means of attaining righteousness before God.
    - Brunner sees the law as preparatory for the gospel, not as a parallel path.
    - "The Law is the light which reveals the darkness of man’s heart." (The Divine Imperative)

3. **Rejection of the Covenant of Works Schema**
    - Brunner denies the Reformed notion that the Mosaic covenant is a republication of a prelapsarian covenant of works.
    - He views all covenants as fundamentally gracious, even when they contain legal elements.
    - The idea of a covenant of works is, for Brunner, foreign to the biblical witness.
    - He critiques the legalistic tendencies of traditional Reformed federal theology.
    - "There is no way to God by works, not even in the Old Testament." (The Mediator)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant points forward to Christ, who fulfills both law and promise.
    - Brunner emphasizes the unity of salvation history centered on Christ.
    - The law’s demands are met only in Christ’s obedience and atonement.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s ultimate purpose is to prepare for the coming of the Redeemer.
    - "The law finds its end and its fulfillment in Christ." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

5. **Existential and Relational Emphasis**
    - Brunner interprets covenant in existential terms: a living encounter, not a static arrangement.
    - The Mosaic covenant is meaningful only within the ongoing relationship between God and His people.
    - Obedience is a response to God’s initiative, not a means of meriting favor.
    - The relational dimension of the covenant supersedes any legalistic interpretation.
    - "Faith is the answer to God’s call; it is the acceptance of the covenant relationship." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** challenged the traditional Reformed identification of the covenant as a **covenant of works**, emphasizing instead the primacy of **grace** and the existential nature of the divine-human relationship. His approach influenced later covenant theology by highlighting the relational and Christocentric unity of the biblical covenants. While his views were controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, Brunner’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of **law, grace, and covenant** in modern theology.
