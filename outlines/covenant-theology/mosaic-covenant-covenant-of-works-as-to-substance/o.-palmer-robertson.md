# O. Palmer Robertson (1937–)

O. Palmer Robertson approaches the **Mosaic covenant** as a distinct administration within the single, unfolding **covenant of grace**, rejecting the view that it is a republication of the **covenant of works** in substance. He emphasizes the unity of God's redemptive plan, arguing that the Mosaic covenant, while containing law, ultimately serves the purpose of advancing the promise of **redemption** rather than reintroducing a works-based principle for life.

- "The Mosaic covenant is not to be understood as a renewal of the covenant of works, but as a further unfolding of the covenant of grace." ("The Christ of the Covenants")

## Key Works

- The Christ of the Covenants (1980)
- The Christ of the Prophets (2004)
- Covenants: God’s Way with His People (2012)
- The Israel of God: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is a progressive stage in the one **covenant of grace**.
    - All biblical covenants serve the purpose of redemption in Christ.
    - The law given at Sinai is not a means of earning life by works.
    - The Mosaic administration points forward to the fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The Mosaic covenant is not a covenant of works, but a covenant of grace with a particular focus on law." (The Christ of the Covenants)

2. **Law as Pedagogue, Not as Works Principle**
    - The law functions to reveal sin and drive Israel to dependence on God’s mercy.
    - The Mosaic law exposes the need for a mediator and points to Christ.
    - The giving of the law does not suspend or replace the promise.
    - The law is subordinate to the promise, not a parallel means of justification.
    - "The law was given as a tutor to lead to Christ, not as a means of attaining righteousness by works." (The Christ of the Covenants)

3. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - The Mosaic covenant is typological, foreshadowing the work of Christ.
    - Ceremonial and civil laws prefigure the realities fulfilled in the new covenant.
    - The sacrificial system highlights the need for atonement beyond human obedience.
    - The historical progression moves from promise to fulfillment, not from grace back to works.
    - "The Mosaic economy is a shadow, not a substance, of the coming redemption." (The Christ of the Covenants)

4. **Conditionality within the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains conditional elements, but within a gracious framework.
    - Obedience is required for temporal blessings, not for ultimate salvation.
    - The sanctions serve to discipline and preserve the covenant people.
    - The underlying promise of grace remains intact despite Israel’s failures.
    - "The conditionality of the Mosaic covenant is always subordinate to the unconditional promise." (The Christ of the Covenants)

5. **Rejection of Substantial Republication of Works Principle**
    - Robertson explicitly denies that the Mosaic covenant is a republication of the covenant of works in substance.
    - He distinguishes between the pedagogical use of the law and a works-based principle of life.
    - The Mosaic administration is not a return to Adamic probation.
    - The focus remains on God’s redemptive initiative, not human merit.
    - "To interpret the Mosaic covenant as a covenant of works is to misunderstand its place in redemptive history." (The Christ of the Covenants)

## Legacy and Impact

Robertson’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed covenant theology**, especially in debates over the nature of the Mosaic covenant. His emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the redemptive-historical function of the law has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions. By rejecting the substantial republication of the covenant of works at Sinai, he has provided a framework that underscores the continuity of God’s gracious dealings with his people throughout Scripture.
