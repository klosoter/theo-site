# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos taught that the **Mosaic covenant** is, in its **substance**, an administration of the **covenant of grace**, though it includes a typological **republication** of the **covenant of works**. He insisted that the law at Sinai does not reintroduce a true works-principle for salvation but instead highlights the demands of perfect obedience and the necessity of **redemption in Christ**.

- "The Sinaitic covenant is not a simple covenant of works, but a covenant of grace, with a form that recalls the principle of the covenant of works." ("Biblical Theology," p. 129)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology (essay)
- "The Mosaic Covenant" (Princeton Theological Review, 1903)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally gracious in its redemptive-historical context.
   - It continues the promise first made to Abraham and fulfilled in Christ.
   - The sacrificial system points to the need for atonement and the coming Redeemer.
   - The law is given to a redeemed people, not as a means of earning salvation.
   "The Sinaitic covenant is not a break with the covenant of grace, but its further unfolding." ("Biblical Theology," p. 127)

2. **Typological Republication of the Covenant of Works**
   - The Mosaic law republishes the works principle typologically, not as a means of ultimate justification.
   - Israel’s tenure in the land is conditioned on obedience, reflecting the original works principle.
   - This typology serves to magnify the necessity of Christ’s perfect obedience.
   - The republication is pedagogical, not soteric.
   "The law was given to make sin abound, and thus to prepare for the gospel." ("Biblical Theology," p. 130)

3. **Unity of Redemptive History**
   - Vos emphasizes the organic unity between the covenants.
   - The Mosaic administration is a stage in the unfolding of the one plan of redemption.
   - The law and promise are not ultimately opposed but serve distinct roles in God’s economy.
   - The Mosaic covenant anticipates and prepares for the new covenant in Christ.
   "The law is not an isolated dispensation, but a link in the chain of redemptive history." ("Biblical Theology," p. 131)

4. **Pedagogical Function of the Law**
   - The Mosaic law exposes sin and the impossibility of self-justification.
   - It drives Israel (and the reader) to seek salvation outside of themselves.
   - The ceremonial law prefigures Christ’s atoning work.
   - The law’s demands point to the necessity of grace.
   "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ." ("Biblical Theology," p. 132)

5. **Distinction Between Substance and Form**
   - The substance of the Mosaic covenant is gracious, though its form includes legal elements.
   - The external administration may appear legalistic, but the underlying reality is redemptive.
   - The distinction safeguards the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
   - The form serves to highlight the insufficiency of human obedience and the sufficiency of Christ.
   "The form may differ, but the substance remains the same: grace through faith." ("Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s careful articulation of the **Mosaic covenant** as gracious in substance but containing a typological works principle has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology. His approach preserves the unity of the **covenant of grace** while accounting for the pedagogical function of the law in redemptive history. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions on law, gospel, and the structure of biblical covenants, providing a framework that avoids both legalism and antinomianism. His legacy is especially evident in the ongoing development of **redemptive-historical hermeneutics** within Reformed theology.
