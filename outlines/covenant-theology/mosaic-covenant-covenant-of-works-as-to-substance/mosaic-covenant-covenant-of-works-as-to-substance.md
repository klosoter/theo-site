### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The core question asks whether the **Mosaic covenant** at Sinai is, in its essence, the one **covenant of grace**, or whether it is in substance a **covenant of works**, with grace only appended as a remedial overlay. Reformed theology learned to distinguish substance from administration, asserting in Westminster Confession chapter 7 that there is one **covenant of grace** under various administrations, first under law and later under gospel, 1646 to 1648. The covenant of works, traditionally termed *foedus operum*, is that prelapsarian arrangement wherein Adam as federal head owed perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience, with life offered upon obedience and death threatened upon disobedience, a structure that Paul reflects in Rom 5 and that Genesis 2 implied by the probationary command. To call Sinai a republication does not necessarily mean it is soteriologically a covenant of works for eternal life but can mean, on some accounts, that a **works principle** is republished for pedagogical and typological ends within the administration of grace. Thus three proposals emerged: Mosaic as substance of grace with legal form, Mosaic as a **subservient covenant** ordered to earthly goods that serves grace, and Mosaic as a mixed economy where a republication of **covenant of works** functions typologically and nationally. The dogmatic location is within federal theology, touching **law and gospel**, justification by the **imputed active obedience of Christ**, and the unity of Scripture in the **ordo foederum**.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
The narrative of Exod 19 to 24 presents a covenant made with Israel after redemption from Egypt, so the temporal order is grace then law. The Decalogue begins with gospel, I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, then issues commands, enshrining the **law-gospel** rhythm at Sinai. Yet the covenant stipulations include robust conditionality, with Exod 19 stating that if you obey my voice, you shall be my treasured possession, and Deut 28 to 30 detailing blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, binding Israel’s tenure in the land to their fidelity. Lev 18:5 declares, the one who does these things shall live by them, echoed in Rom 10:5 and Gal 3:12 where Paul opposes a principle of works to the principle of faith, the law is not of faith. This raises the question whether Sinai reintroduces the **works principle** intrinsically. Paul in Gal 3 to 4 insists that the law, coming 430 years after the promise to Abraham, does not annul the promise, but was added because of transgressions until the Seed should come, making law a **pedagogue** to Christ and preserving the priority of **Abrahamic grace**. Hebrews 8 calls the first covenant obsolete in view of the **new covenant** promised in Jer 31, and 2 Cor 3 contrasts the letter that kills with the Spirit who gives life, while simultaneously affirming that the law was glorious. The sacrificial system, priesthood, and tabernacle embed continual forgiveness within Sinai, marking it as an **administration of grace**. A coherent synthesis sees two levels: soteriologically, Sinai administers the one **covenant of grace** through types and sacrifices; typologically and nationally, it republishes a **works principle** of corporate obedience for life in the land, Deut 4:25 to 27, Lev 26, as a covenantal pedagogy pointing to Christ who alone achieves true life by obedience, Gal 3:13 to 14.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
The fathers stressed law as pedagogue. **Irenaeus** framed Mosaic law within recapitulation, the Son retracing Adamic history; **Augustine** articulated the uses of the law as accusatory and instructive, aligning Sinai with the exposure of sin and the need for **grace**. Medieval theology, especially **Aquinas**, described the Old Law as imperfect, primarily directive and prohibitive, possessing ceremonial prefigurations, while the New Law is principally the grace of the Holy Spirit, an account that anticipates later **law-gospel** articulations without federal headship categories. The Reformation brought sharper covenantal contours. **Luther** placed Sinai squarely under law, the alien work that drives to Christ, while **Calvin** united the covenants in substance under the one **covenant of grace**, distinguishing the Mosaic legal pedagogy from evangelical promise. Post-Reformation **federal theology** crystalized the covenant of works and covenant of grace distinction. **Ursinus** and **Olevianus** taught catechetically that Sinai served the covenant of grace by exposing sin; **Perkins** and **Ames** refined the **law-gospel** relation. In the later seventeenth century, **Turretin** argued that Mosaic and new covenants are one in substance and end, salvation by grace through a mediator, yet distinct in mode, with Sinai including a republication of the **covenant of works** as to legal demands for pedagogical ends, 1679 to 1685. **Witsius**, in The Economy of the Covenants, 1677, articulated a careful both-and, Mosaic as an administration of grace that contains a **legal economy** for national life and typology. **Owen** offered a **subservient covenant** view, placing Sinai between works and grace, serving the ends of redemption by governing a holy nation with earthly promises. In the eighteenth century, the **Marrow** controversy and **Thomas Boston** advanced a law-gospel clarity that some read as favoring republication for pastoral purposes. The consensus through Westminster and orthodox scholasticism remained that Sinai is not a soteriological covenant of works but does republish the **works principle** in order to magnify Christ and secure typological holiness.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Old Princeton represented by **Charles Hodge** and **A. A. Hodge** held to one **covenant of grace** under different dispensations, 1871 to 1873 for Hodge’s Systematic Theology, and affirmed a real legal element in Sinai. Hodge acknowledged a redemptive administration with a re-enactment of the **moral law** in covenantal form, including Leviticus 18:5 as the law principle, and he used this to anchor the **imputed active obedience of Christ**. **Warfield** maintained confessional unity while insisting that Christ fulfilled the law for us, presupposing a genuine law covenant structure for Christ the second Adam. Dutch Neo-Calvinism, through **Kuyper** and especially **Bavinck**, described Sinai as one in **substance with the covenant of grace**, yet clothed in a legal form, a national-pedagogical administration that preserved the people until the fullness of time, 1895 to 1901. Bavinck highlighted the typology of land, kingdom, and the civil-ceremonial complex, which as shadows could not justify, and he read **Lev 18:5** both as a civil-national principle and as a signpost toward the need for Christ’s obedient life. The Westminster Seminary tradition divided. **John Murray** rejected republication in any works-covenant sense, treating Mosaic as essentially gracious with heightened law, mid twentieth century, while retaining the **law-gospel** distinction. **Meredith Kline**, 1963 to 2006, argued for typological republication, that Israel’s tenure in the land recapitulated a **works principle**, sometimes called intrusion ethics, without jeopardizing soteriological grace, since eternal life remained by promise through a mediator. Later Westminster voices divided, with **Horton** and some OPC and URC pastors defending **republication** for exegetical and confessional reasons, while others feared it compromises the unity of grace and the assurance held in **justification by faith**. The Westminster Standards themselves, 1646 to 1648, read as a whole, portray Sinai as an administration of the covenant of grace, yet chapter 19 and its use of Lev 18:5 preserve a real legal voice that is then fulfilled by Christ.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology, from **Aquinas** to **Trent** in 1547, treats the Old Law as divine pedagogy, not in itself able to justify, with the New Law principally the infused grace of charity, which yields a different account of **law and gospel** and does not deploy a **covenant of works** as a distinct administration. **Lutheran** theology receives Sinai as law, in contrast to gospel, with the Formula of Concord 1577 insisting that the law always accuses, yet Lutherans historically resist covenantal schemes that would introduce a works principle into redemptive history in a way that risks confusing justification by faith alone. Modern **dispensationalism** classifies Mosaic as a discrete economy of law, with **Scofield** 1909 contrasting law and grace across dispensations, a view that can flatten the unity of the **covenant of grace** but preserves real discontinuity. Progressive covenantalism, represented by **Gentry and Wellum** in 2012, emphasizes the progressive and typological character of covenants while questioning the classic **covenant of works** and thus reframing Sinai without a formal republication category. The **New Perspective** on Paul, associated with **Dunn** and **Wright** since the 1980s, reads works of the law as boundary markers, which if pressed can minimize the **works principle** in Lev 18:5 and Gal 3:12 and shift the law-gospel contrast toward ecclesiology. In analytic terms, debates over **merit** ask whether Sinai involves condign merit, congruent merit, or a non-meritorious covenantal condition, with Reformed republicationists arguing for a typological, non-condign works principle for land tenure, while opponents deny any meritorious economy given total depravity and the unity of **grace**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
Advocates of republication, following **Kline**, argue that Israel under Sinai corporately reenacts Adam’s probation in a typological sphere, with **land-temporal sanctions** keyed to obedience, Deut 28, so that the exile functions as covenant curse, and restoration anticipates the **new covenant**. They claim this clarifies Paul’s use of Lev 18:5 in Gal 3 and Rom 10, strengthens the case for the **imputed active obedience of Christ**, and protects sola fide by locating all soteriological blessing in promise, not in Sinai’s conditions. Critics respond that any works-covenant principle under Sinai risks undermining the unity of the **covenant of grace**, confuses believers about the ground of assurance, and misreads the pervasive grace of sacrifices and priesthood within the Mosaic administration. They also worry that the **law-gospel** contrast in Galatians is redemptive-historical rather than formal, and that Paul’s polemic targets misuse of law, not intrinsic works order in Sinai. A mediating position maintains Sinai’s substance as grace with a real legal form that governs the national theocracy and drives sinners to Christ, thus allowing a republication of the **moral law** as covenant demand without constructing a second ladder to heaven. Objections to **Klinean merit** insist that post-Fall sinners could never secure blessings by obedience, to which Klineans reply that Israel’s provisional obedience could secure typological goods, not eternal life, and that this arrangement magnifies the necessity of the perfect obedience of the last Adam.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
The republication discussion touches **Theology Proper** through the **pactum salutis**, the intra-trinitarian counsel by which the Son undertook to fulfill the violated **covenant of works** as mediator. In **Christology**, the **active obedience of Christ** satisfies the law’s positive demands, while his passive obedience bears covenant curses, with Sinai’s legal demands and Deut 28’s curses illuminating the cross as curse-bearing, Gal 3:13. In **Anthropology**, Adam’s original probation frames all later covenants, with Israel recapitulating a corporate Adam under **law**, displaying the depth of depravity and the inability to achieve life by doing. In **Soteriology**, justification is by faith apart from works of the law, yet grounded in Christ’s fulfillment of the works principle, so republication can clarify the distinction between the ground of justification, Christ’s **law-fulfilling obedience**, and the instrument, faith alone. In **Ecclesiology**, Sinai exhibits the church under age, a pedagogue with sacraments that prefigure baptism and the Supper, while the Decalogue remains a rule of **sanctification** in the third use of the law. In **Eschatology**, the land-rest and temple-glory foreshadow the eternal Sabbath, Heb 3 to 4, so that the failure under the **works principle** at Sinai heightens the longing for the eschatological **new covenant** inheritance in Christ.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, preaching from Sinai should announce both the **law that kills** and the **gospel that makes alive**, using the conditionality of Deut 28 to expose sin and the sacrificial rhythms to proclaim the sufficiency of the mediator. Catechesis uses the **Decalogue** as a rule of gratitude, aligning with Heidelberg and Westminster Larger Catechism, while insisting that our obedience is not the ground of **justification**. In counseling the scrupulous, pastors can say that Sinai’s curses have fallen on Christ, so the believer stands under the **covenant of grace**. In church discipline and polity, the Mosaic ethos of holiness informs the church’s call to be a holy nation, while distinguishing the expired civil and ceremonial laws from the enduring **moral law**, Westminster 19. In liturgy, reading the law followed by confession and assurance dramatizes **law-gospel** dynamics, and the Psalms, including Psalm 119, train believers to love the law as fulfilled and sweetened by the **Spirit**. The practical payoff of a careful republication account is clarity: we can uphold the unity of grace, preach the gravity of disobedience, magnify Christ’s obedience, and nurture assurance grounded in **imputed righteousness**.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
Rightly parsed, Sinai is one in substance with the **covenant of grace** while republishing a typological **works principle** that exposes sin, secures earthly types, and drives us to the **imputed active obedience of Christ**.
