# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **Mosaic covenant** not through traditional **Reformed categories** like the **covenant of works**, but as a symbol of the existential relationship between God and humanity. He interpreted biblical covenants as expressions of the **divine-human encounter** and the dynamics of **law and grace**, rather than as legal or forensic arrangements with meritorious conditions.

- "The law is the expression of the divine demand, and the covenant is the expression of the divine offer." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3
- The Protestant Era
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality
- The Interpretation of History
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic Expression**
    - The **Mosaic covenant** is seen as a symbol of the existential bond between God and His people.
    - Tillich resists literal or juridical readings, focusing on the covenant’s meaning for human existence.
    - The covenant represents the encounter with the **ground of being** rather than a contractual arrangement.
    - It functions as a mythic structure shaping religious consciousness.
    - "A covenant is not a contract; it is a symbol of the divine-human relationship." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Law and Grace in Dialectical Tension**
    - The **law** given at Sinai is interpreted as the divine demand confronting human estrangement.
    - Grace is the divine acceptance that overcomes the alienation exposed by the law.
    - The Mosaic law is not a means of meriting favor but reveals the depth of human need for grace.
    - The dialectic of law and grace is central to Tillich’s understanding of biblical religion.
    - "Law without grace is despair; grace without law is presumption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Covenant of Works**
    - Tillich does not affirm a **covenant of works** as a historical or theological reality.
    - He critiques legalistic interpretations that separate law and gospel into distinct dispensations.
    - The idea of meritorious obedience is foreign to his existential theology.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a test of works but a revelation of the human condition.
    - "The separation of law and gospel into two covenants is a distortion of the biblical message." (The Protestant Era)

4. **Universal Significance of the Covenant**
    - The Mosaic covenant is paradigmatic for all divine-human encounters.
    - It expresses the universal structure of revelation and response.
    - The covenant motif transcends Israel and points to the existential situation of all humanity.
    - Tillich sees the covenant as a symbol of the ultimate concern that defines faith.
    - "The covenant is the form in which the ultimate concern becomes concrete in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Historical Relativity and Symbolic Permanence**
    - The Mosaic covenant is historically conditioned but possesses enduring symbolic power.
    - Its legal forms are relative, but its existential meaning persists.
    - Tillich emphasizes the need to reinterpret the covenant for each generation.
    - The substance of the covenant is found in the ongoing encounter with the divine, not in fixed statutes.
    - "The symbols of faith must be reinterpreted as history changes, but their depth remains." (Theology of Culture)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** shifted the discussion from legal and forensic categories to existential and symbolic dimensions. His approach influenced 20th-century theology by challenging traditional **Reformed loci** and emphasizing the dynamic, relational character of biblical covenants. While he did not engage directly with the **covenant of works** debate, his thought provided a framework for understanding covenant as the ongoing encounter between God and humanity, rather than as a static legal arrangement. This legacy continues to shape conversations about the meaning and function of covenant in modern theology.
