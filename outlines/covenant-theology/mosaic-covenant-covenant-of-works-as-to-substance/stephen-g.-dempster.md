# Stephen G. Dempster (1953– )

Stephen G. Dempster approaches the **Mosaic covenant** with sensitivity to its literary and canonical context, emphasizing its continuity with the broader **biblical covenants**. He resists a strict identification of the Mosaic covenant as a **covenant of works** in substance, instead highlighting its role within the unfolding **covenant of grace**. Dempster’s analysis stresses the narrative movement from **creation** through **Sinai** to **new covenant** fulfillment.

- "The Sinai covenant is best understood as a development within the larger Abrahamic promise, not as a fundamentally distinct covenant of works." (Dominion and Dynasty)

## Key Works

- Dominion and Dynasty: A Theology of the Hebrew Bible (2003)
- "The Covenant of Creation" in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect (2002)
- "The Prophets, the Law, and the Covenant" in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology (2000)
- "The Pentateuch" in The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Theology (2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canonical Context of the Mosaic Covenant**
    - Views the Mosaic covenant within the narrative arc of **creation, fall, and redemption**.
    - Emphasizes the literary unity of the **Tanakh** and its covenantal structure.
    - Argues that Sinai is not isolated but organically linked to **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** covenants.
    - Sees the Mosaic covenant as preparatory for the **new covenant**.
    - "The Sinai covenant is not a detour but a stage in the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham." (Dominion and Dynasty)

2. **Law as Gracious Gift**
    - Interprets the giving of the **Torah** as an act of divine grace, not mere legalism.
    - Stresses that Israel’s obedience is a response to **redemption from Egypt**.
    - Argues that the law functions within a **redemptive-historical** framework.
    - Rejects a sharp law/gospel dichotomy at Sinai.
    - "The law is embedded in the story of deliverance, not in a vacuum of merit." (Dominion and Dynasty)

3. **Continuity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Maintains that the Mosaic covenant is a further administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Sees the sacrificial system and priesthood as typological, pointing to **Christ**.
    - Emphasizes the forward movement toward **restoration** and **new creation**.
    - Argues that the Mosaic covenant’s demands highlight the need for a **mediator**.
    - "The Mosaic covenant exposes the need for a heart transformation promised in the new covenant." (Dominion and Dynasty)

4. **Conditionality and Unconditionality**
    - Recognizes both **conditional** (blessings/curses) and **unconditional** (promise) elements.
    - Argues that the conditional aspects serve the larger unconditional promise to Abraham.
    - Sees Israel’s failure as anticipated within the covenant structure.
    - Highlights prophetic hope for **covenant renewal** despite Israel’s disobedience.
    - "The conditionality of Sinai is subsumed under the unconditionality of God’s promise." (Dominion and Dynasty)

5. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Interprets the Mosaic covenant as typological, foreshadowing **Christ** and the **new covenant**.
    - Emphasizes the narrative trajectory from **exodus** to **exile** to **restoration**.
    - Argues that the law’s ultimate purpose is fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah.
    - Sees the Mosaic covenant as both preparatory and provisional.
    - "The Mosaic covenant points beyond itself to a greater exodus and a greater covenant." (Dominion and Dynasty)

## Legacy and Impact

Dempster’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **biblical theology** by situating the Mosaic covenant within the unified narrative of Scripture. His emphasis on the **continuity of the covenant of grace** and the typological function of the law has influenced both Reformed and evangelical readings of the Old Testament. By resisting a reductionist identification of Sinai as a covenant of works, Dempster has encouraged a more nuanced and redemptive-historical approach to covenant theology. His canonical perspective continues to inform scholarly and pastoral engagement with the structure of biblical covenants.
