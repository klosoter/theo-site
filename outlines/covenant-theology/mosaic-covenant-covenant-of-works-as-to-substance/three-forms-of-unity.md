# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed covenant theology** that distinguishes the **covenant of works** from the **covenant of grace**. While these confessions do not explicitly teach the **republication** of the covenant of works in the Mosaic covenant, they affirm that the law given through Moses reflects the original demands of the covenant of works, yet is administered within the broader covenant of grace.

- "God gave his law first to Adam, and afterwards to us, for the same purpose, namely, that we may thereby be led to a knowledge of our sins." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 3)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14, 17, 22, 24, 25
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 3–21, 60, 114–115
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–III
- J. van Genderen & W.H. Velema, Concise Reformed Dogmatics
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The confessions clearly distinguish the **covenant of works** made with Adam from the **covenant of grace** established after the Fall.
    - The law’s original function was to promise life upon perfect obedience.
    - After the Fall, salvation is possible only through faith in Christ, not by law-keeping.
    - The Mosaic administration is subsumed under the covenant of grace, not a separate covenant of works.
    "We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for Jesus Christ’s sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is implied." (Belgic Confession, Art. 23)

2. **Law as a Revelation of God’s Righteousness**
    - The Mosaic law reveals the same standard of righteousness as the original covenant of works.
    - The law serves to convict of sin and drive sinners to Christ.
    - The Decalogue is binding as a rule of gratitude, not as a means of justification.
    - The law’s demands are fulfilled only in Christ, not by human effort.
    "Out of the law of God we learn more and more to know our sinful nature." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 115)

3. **Mosaic Covenant as Administration of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a separate covenant of works but an administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The ceremonial and civil laws point forward to Christ and are abrogated in Him.
    - The moral law remains as a guide for Christian living.
    - The confessions emphasize continuity of the gospel promise from Abraham through Moses to Christ.
    "We believe that the ceremonies and figures of the law ceased at the coming of Christ, and that all the shadows are accomplished." (Belgic Confession, Art. 25)

4. **Typological Function of Mosaic Law**
    - The Mosaic law typologically re-enacts the demands and curse of the covenant of works.
    - The sacrificial system prefigures the atoning work of Christ.
    - The law’s curse demonstrates the necessity of a Mediator.
    - The confessions see the law as a pedagogue leading to Christ.
    "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 19, citing Gal. 3:24)

5. **Impossibility of Justification by the Law**
    - The confessions deny that anyone can be justified by the works of the law, whether under Moses or otherwise.
    - The law exposes sin and the inability of fallen man to fulfill its demands.
    - Justification is by faith alone in Christ’s righteousness imputed to believers.
    - The law’s role is to show the need for grace, not to provide a way of salvation.
    "No mere creature can sustain the burden of God’s eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others from it." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 14)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the confessional identity of Reformed churches, providing a robust framework for understanding the relationship between the **covenant of works** and the **Mosaic covenant**. Their nuanced approach—affirming the law’s substance as reflecting the original covenant of works while maintaining the Mosaic covenant as an administration of grace—has influenced later Reformed covenantal thought and debates. These confessions continue to serve as doctrinal standards, guiding the church’s teaching on law, gospel, and the unity of redemptive history.
