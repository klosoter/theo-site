# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets the **Mosaic covenant** primarily through the lens of **promise**, **liberation**, and **eschatological hope**, rather than the traditional Reformed categories of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. For Moltmann, the Mosaic covenant is a forward-looking, communal event that anticipates the fulfillment of God's redemptive purposes, emphasizing the creation of a liberated people rather than a legal probation or works-based arrangement.

- "The covenant with Israel is the anticipation of the new creation of all things, not a legal contract based on works, but a promise of life in community with God." ("Theology of Hope")

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Way of Jesus Christ (1989)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Promise, Not Legal Contract**
   - The Mosaic covenant is fundamentally a divine promise, not a conditional contract based on human merit.
   - Moltmann sees the covenant as oriented toward the future, grounded in **God’s faithfulness** rather than human obedience.
   - The law is given within the context of liberation, not as a means to earn favor.
   - The covenant is relational and communal, not transactional.
   - "God’s covenant is the anticipation of the new, not the restoration of the old." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Rejection of Works-Grace Dichotomy**
   - Moltmann does not frame biblical covenants in terms of a strict **works/grace** opposition.
   - He critiques legalistic readings that separate law from promise.
   - The Mosaic covenant is part of the ongoing history of **God’s gracious engagement** with humanity.
   - The law serves the promise, not the other way around.
   - "The law is the form of the promise, not its contradiction." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of the Covenant**
   - The Mosaic covenant points forward to the **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ and the new creation.
   - The covenant community is called to anticipate and embody the coming kingdom.
   - The law is provisional, awaiting its fulfillment in the messianic future.
   - The Mosaic covenant is a stage in the movement toward universal liberation.
   - "The history of the covenant is open to the future of God." (The Coming of God)

4. **Liberation and Community**
   - The giving of the law at Sinai is an act of **liberation**, not a re-imposition of bondage.
   - The covenant forms a people called to justice, solidarity, and hope.
   - The law is a gift for communal life, not a test for individual merit.
   - The Mosaic covenant is inseparable from the **Exodus event** and its liberating significance.
   - "The law is the constitution of the liberated people." (The Way of Jesus Christ)

5. **Christological Fulfillment of the Covenant**
   - Jesus is the fulfillment and embodiment of the covenant promises.
   - The Mosaic covenant finds its true meaning in the person and work of **Christ**.
   - The law is interpreted through the lens of Christ’s redemptive mission.
   - The covenant is universalized in the new covenant community.
   - "In Christ, the covenant is opened to all nations and fulfilled in the Spirit." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s interpretation of the **Mosaic covenant** has challenged traditional Reformed readings by shifting the focus from legal categories to **promise**, **liberation**, and **eschatological fulfillment**. His work has influenced contemporary theology’s understanding of covenant as a dynamic, future-oriented relationship rather than a static legal arrangement. Moltmann’s emphasis on the communal and liberative aspects of the covenant continues to shape discussions in **systematic theology** and **ecclesiology**, especially in contexts concerned with justice and hope.
