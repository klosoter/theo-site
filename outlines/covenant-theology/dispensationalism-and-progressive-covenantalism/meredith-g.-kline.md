# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a Reformed biblical theologian who offered a distinctive approach to **biblical covenants** that set him apart from both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. Kline emphasized the unity and progression of the **covenant of grace** while maintaining strong distinctions between the **old** and **new covenants**, critiquing both the sharp discontinuities of dispensationalism and the flattening tendencies of some progressive covenantalists. His work is marked by a robust commitment to **typology**, **kingdom theology**, and the **intrusion ethic**.

- "The biblical covenants are the backbone of redemptive history, structuring the relationship between God and his people." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant Structure as Redemptive Backbone**
   - Sees **covenants** as the organizing principle of biblical history.
   - Argues for a unified **covenant of grace** with epochal administrations.
   - Rejects the dispensationalist division of history into unrelated dispensations.
   - Emphasizes the legal and relational aspects of **covenant oaths**.
   - "The divine covenants are the backbone of the Bible’s redemptive structure." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Typology and Intrusion Ethics**
   - Develops a robust doctrine of **typology** in covenant history.
   - Old covenant institutions prefigure the realities of the new covenant.
   - The "intrusion ethic" explains temporary theocratic judgments as anticipations of final judgment.
   - Contrasts with dispensational literalism and progressive covenantal flattening.
   - "The intrusion of the final judgment into the old covenant theocracy is a typological anticipation of the eschaton." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Kingdom and Eschatology**
   - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Christ but awaits consummation.
   - The old covenant is a typological kingdom, not the final reality.
   - Dispensational expectations of a future earthly kingdom are rejected.
   - The new covenant fulfills and transcends all previous covenantal types.
   - "The new covenant is the eschatological realization of the kingdom typified in Israel." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
   - Affirms substantial continuity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history.
   - Stresses discontinuity between the old (Mosaic) and new covenants in terms of administration and fulfillment.
   - Critiques both dispensational and progressive covenantal models for misunderstanding the nature of fulfillment.
   - The law’s typological functions are fulfilled and transformed in Christ.
   - "The old covenant is abrogated in Christ, who brings the reality to which its types pointed." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Sacraments and Covenant Signs**
   - Views **baptism** and **circumcision** as covenant signs with typological significance.
   - Rejects the dispensational separation of Israel and the church regarding covenant signs.
   - Argues that the sacraments signify union with Christ and participation in the covenant community.
   - The new covenant sign (baptism) supersedes the old (circumcision) in light of fulfillment.
   - "Baptism is the sign of the new covenant, marking participation in the eschatological community." (By Oath Consigned)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenant theology has profoundly shaped **Reformed biblical theology**, offering a mediating position between **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. His emphasis on typology, the kingdom, and the structure of redemptive history continues to influence contemporary debates on the relationship between Israel and the church. Kline’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a robustly biblical and confessional approach to the covenants, especially within the Westminster tradition.
