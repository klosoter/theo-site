# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not address **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism** as later Protestant systems, but his theology of **divine economy**, **covenant**, and the **unity of salvation history** laid foundational concepts for later discussions. Aquinas emphasized the continuity of **God’s revelation** and the fulfillment of the **Old Law** in the **New Law** of Christ, framing salvation history as a unified progression rather than a series of radically distinct dispensations.

- "The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel in which the New Law is contained." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–107 (on Law and the Old/New Covenants)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (on salvation and the Incarnation)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Salvation History**
   - Salvation history is governed by a single divine purpose culminating in Christ.
   - The **Old Law** and **New Law** are distinct but organically related stages.
   - The **covenants** are not radically separated but progressively reveal God’s will.
   - Christ is the fulfillment and center of all previous revelation.
   - "The Old Law was given to prepare the way for Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98, a. 2)

2. **Typology and Fulfillment**
   - Old Testament realities are types that find their fulfillment in the New Testament.
   - The **ceremonial precepts** of the Old Law prefigure the sacraments of the New Law.
   - The moral law persists, while ceremonial and judicial laws are fulfilled and surpassed.
   - Typology underscores continuity rather than discontinuity in redemptive history.
   - "The ceremonies of the Old Law foreshadowed the mysteries of Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 102, a. 2)

3. **Covenant as Divine Pedagogy**
   - God’s covenants are pedagogical, gradually revealing truth to humanity.
   - The Law was given as a tutor leading to Christ and the fullness of grace.
   - The **New Covenant** brings the internalization of the law by the Holy Spirit.
   - The progression of covenants reflects God’s wisdom in accommodating human understanding.
   - "The Old Law was imperfect and directed to the perfection of the New Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 1)

4. **Law and Grace**
   - The Old Law could command but not confer grace; the New Law is the law of grace.
   - The **New Law** is primarily the grace of the Holy Spirit given through Christ.
   - The distinction between law and grace is central to understanding the covenants.
   - The New Law perfects and supersedes the Old without abolishing its moral core.
   - "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

5. **Universal Scope of Redemption**
   - God’s plan of salvation encompasses all peoples, not just Israel.
   - The promises to Israel are fulfilled and extended to the Gentiles in Christ.
   - The unity of the Church transcends ethnic and temporal boundaries.
   - The **covenantal promises** are realized in the universal Church.
   - "The Gentiles are made partakers in the blessings of the New Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 103, a. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology provided a robust framework for understanding the **unity of redemptive history** and the relationship between the Old and New Covenants, influencing both Catholic and Protestant thought. While he did not anticipate later debates over **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, his emphasis on typology, fulfillment, and the organic progression of revelation shaped subsequent covenantal theologies. His work remains a touchstone for discussions on the continuity and discontinuity within salvation history.
