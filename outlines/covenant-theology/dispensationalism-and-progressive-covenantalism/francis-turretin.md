# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, articulated a robust **covenant theology** that underscores the unity and continuity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history. He distinguished sharply between the **covenant of works** and the covenant of grace, providing a systematic alternative to later **dispensational** and **progressive covenantal** models.

- "The covenant of grace, although variously administered as to external rites and ceremonies, is always the same as to substance." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium and Catechism for the Young
- Selected writings in Reformed Dogmatics (as compiled in later anthologies)
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context on Turretin’s covenant thought)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of grace** is one in substance, though various in administration.
   - Both Old and New Testaments are administrations of the same covenant, not fundamentally different covenants.
   - The promises, mediator, and salvation are consistent throughout redemptive history.
   - Rejects any sharp discontinuity between Israel and the church.
   "The covenant of grace is the same in substance under both the Old and New Testaments." (Institutes)

2. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of works** was made with Adam before the Fall, based on perfect obedience.
   - The **covenant of grace** is established after the Fall, grounded in Christ’s mediation.
   - This distinction is foundational for understanding redemptive history.
   - Dispensational divisions are seen as undermining this essential two-covenant structure.
   "The covenant of works differs from the covenant of grace as law from gospel." (Institutes)

3. **Typology and Fulfillment**
   - Old Testament types and ceremonies prefigure New Testament realities.
   - The substance of salvation is present in both covenants, though the form changes.
   - Christ is the fulfillment of all Old Testament promises and types.
   - Progressive revelation does not entail new covenants, but deeper understanding of the one covenant.
   "The Old Testament saints had the same faith in Christ, though under shadows and types." (Institutes)

4. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
   - Turretin opposes dividing history into unrelated dispensations with separate redemptive programs.
   - The church is not a "parenthesis" but the continuation of God’s people.
   - Israel and the church share in the same covenantal blessings.
   - The unity of God’s redemptive plan is emphasized over administrative differences.
   "There is one church, gathered from all ages, under one head, Christ." (Institutes)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Covenant Administration**
   - While the substance of the covenant remains, the external administration changes (e.g., from circumcision to baptism).
   - The moral law is perpetually binding, while ceremonial laws are fulfilled in Christ.
   - Progressive covenantalism’s emphasis on continuity finds precedent in Turretin’s theology.
   - The transition from old to new is one of form, not of substance.
   "The difference between the Old and New Testaments is not of substance, but of accident." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s **covenant theology** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping confessional responses to debates about Israel, the church, and the structure of redemptive history. His careful distinctions and emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** continue to inform contemporary discussions on biblical continuity and discontinuity. Turretin’s systematic approach remains a robust framework for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
