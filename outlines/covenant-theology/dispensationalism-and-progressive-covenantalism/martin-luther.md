# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not articulate a formal system of **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism** as later developed, but his theology of **law and gospel**, **covenant**, and the unity of **Scripture** laid groundwork for later discussions. Luther emphasized the continuity of God's redemptive work through the **covenants** while distinguishing the old and new in terms of promise and fulfillment in **Christ**. His approach to biblical history focused on the centrality of **justification by faith** and the unfolding of God's promises rather than discrete dispensations.

- "All the promises of God are in Christ, yes and amen." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- Commentary on Genesis
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 35: Word and Sacrament I

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Emphasizes the fundamental difference between the demands of the **law** and the promises of the **gospel**.
    - Views the law as preparatory, driving sinners to Christ and the gospel as the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.
    - Rejects any notion that the law and gospel are two separate dispensations; rather, they are two words of God throughout all ages.
    - Sees the gospel as present even in the Old Testament through the promises to the patriarchs.
    - "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Affirms that God's covenant with humanity is unified in Christ, not divided into unrelated dispensations.
    - Believes the promises to Abraham and the patriarchs are fulfilled in the new covenant through faith.
    - Rejects a sharp division between Israel and the Church; both are recipients of the same promise by faith.
    - Sees the sacraments as signs of the one covenant of grace, not as markers of separate dispensational eras.
    - "There is, therefore, one faith and one covenant for all the saints from the beginning of the world." (Commentary on Genesis)

3. **Christocentric Interpretation of Scripture**
    - Interprets all of Scripture as pointing to Christ, the fulfillment of all God's promises.
    - Argues that both Old and New Testaments reveal the same gospel, though in different forms.
    - Opposes readings that separate God’s dealings with Israel from his dealings with the Church.
    - Emphasizes typology and promise-fulfillment rather than strict chronological dispensations.
    - "Christ is the center and circumference of the Bible." (Table Talk)

4. **Justification by Faith Across Redemptive History**
    - Maintains that justification by faith is the means of salvation in every era.
    - Asserts that Old Testament saints were justified by faith in the promise of Christ.
    - Denies that salvation was ever by works or through a different dispensation.
    - Stresses the continuity of the gospel message from Genesis to Revelation.
    - "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Critique of Speculative Systems**
    - Warns against constructing elaborate systems that divide history into arbitrary dispensations.
    - Prioritizes the clear proclamation of Christ over speculative chronology.
    - Argues that the unity of God’s redemptive plan is more important than human schemes.
    - Encourages reading Scripture with Christ and the gospel as the interpretive key.
    - "Let us not be led away by human inventions, but cling to the plain Word of God." (Preface to the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s emphasis on the **unity of the covenant of grace** and the centrality of **justification by faith** shaped Protestant approaches to biblical theology and the interpretation of redemptive history. While he did not develop dispensationalism or progressive covenantalism, his rejection of sharp divisions in God’s dealings with humanity influenced later Reformed and Lutheran critiques of dispensational thought. Luther’s Christocentric reading of Scripture remains foundational for those who stress the continuity of God’s promises across both Testaments.
