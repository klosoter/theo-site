### TITLE
Christ, Covenant, and Kingdom: Evaluating Dispensationalism and Progressive Covenantalism as Canonical Architectures

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: How does Scripture’s unified yet unfolding storyline relate Israel, the church, and the inaugurated–consummated kingdom within a coherent **biblical theology of covenant**.
- Decisive figures: John Nelson Darby, Charles Ryrie, Craig Blaising, Darrell Bock, Peter Gentry, Stephen Wellum.
- Relevant traditions: classic and revised **dispensationalism** in American evangelicalism, **progressive dispensationalism**, Reformed **federal theology**, and contemporary **progressive covenantalism** as a mediating canonical proposal.
- Debates: internal – classic vs revised vs progressive dispensationalism; differing versions of Reformed covenant theology vs progressive covenantalism; external – dispensationalism versus covenant theology on Israel–church and law–gospel; contemporary – hermeneutics, typology, political Israel, and already–not yet eschatology.
- Defended position: Progressive covenantalism most faithfully captures the canonical structure of Scripture and the centrality of Christ and the new covenant, while retaining what is right in covenant theology and correcting both traditional and progressive dispensationalism at crucial points.

### ESSAY
Dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism are rival proposals for the **architectonic structure of redemptive history**. At stake is not a marginal organizational scheme but the grammar by which we read the whole Bible: how we relate Old and New Testaments, Israel and the church, law and gospel, promise and fulfillment, and the already–not yet of the kingdom. For a Westminster examiner, the pressure point will be whether your canonical architecture is compatible with **classical theism**, **Christological unity**, and a robust **federal theology**, while doing justice to textual particularity and the future of ethnic Israel.

To clarify the field, we must first define classic dispensationalism as crystallized in John Nelson Darby and systematized by Charles Ryrie, then trace the development into progressive dispensationalism with Craig Blaising and Darrell Bock, and finally set this over against the emerging proposal of progressive covenantalism as argued by Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum. Throughout, the question is: which framework best accounts for the Bible’s own covenantal shape and the centrality of Christ and the new covenant, without collapsing legitimate distinctions or multiplying dualisms foreign to the text.

John Nelson Darby (1800–1882), often called the father of dispensationalism, emerged in the context of the Plymouth Brethren and the post-Enlightenment crisis of Christendom. His method combined a strong biblicist impulse with a sharp distinction between Israel and the church and an expectation of imminent eschatological rupture. For Darby, the **economies of God’s administration** are successive, testing humanity under different arrangements, with the church age understood as a parenthesis in God’s primary earthly program for Israel. His eschatology was marked by a pretribulational rapture, a literal millennium centered on national Israel, and a hermeneutic in which Old Testament promises to Israel retain a univocal, national, geo-political reference even in the face of New Testament fulfillment language.

Darby’s most enduring conceptual contribution is the **Israel–church distinction as a structural dualism**. Israel is an earthly people with earthly promises; the church is a heavenly people with heavenly promises. This distinction drove his reading of prophecy and ecclesiology. Under interrogation, a Westminster examiner will probe whether Darby’s dualism undermines the **unity of the covenant of grace** and the **one people of God in Christ**. A Reformed answer must argue that while Scripture acknowledges redemptive-historical stages and differing covenant administrations, it does not authorize two parallel peoples of God with ultimately divergent destinies. Ephesians 2 and Romans 11, read canonically, present a single olive tree, a single household, a single new humanity in Christ, even as they preserve a future ingathering of ethnic Israel. Darby’s scheme cannot sustain this unity without severe tension.

Charles Ryrie (1925–2016) gave classic American dispensationalism its mid‑twentieth century systematic clarity. In works such as Dispensationalism Today and its revisions, he articulated three sine qua non marks: a consistent literal hermeneutic, a fundamental distinction between Israel and the church, and the doxological – rather than soteriological – center of God’s purpose in history. Ryrie’s emphasis on a single control hermeneutic is conceptually decisive. By “literal,” Ryrie meant a normal, plain sense reading that does not allow later revelation to reinterpret earlier promises in a way that alters their original reference. Hence Old Testament land and kingdom promises to Israel must find fulfillment in a restored, national Israel in history, even if the church experiences spiritual blessings related to those promises.

The Ryrie proposal sharpened the hermeneutical contrast with Reformed **covenant theology**. For Reformed federal theologians, from the Westminster divines through twentieth-century exponents, the Scripture’s unity is structured by **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, with historical covenants as administrations of that one gracious covenant culminating in the new covenant. Old Testament promises are read through the lens of Christ, and typology is not an optional overlay but intrinsic to the divine intention of the text. The same Spirit who inspired the prophets also inspires the apostles to show how the shadows find substance in Christ. A “literal” reading in the Ryrie sense, which restricts prophetic fulfillment to the horizon of original ethnic and territorial referents, is inconsistent with the New Testament’s own hermeneutic, where Abraham’s seed is Christ, the land promise opens into the **new creation**, and the true circumcision is in union with the Messiah.

Under oral examination, you will be pressed here: does the commitment to a single, rigid literal sense expose classic dispensationalism to the charge of denying the New Testament’s inspired rereading of the Old? One must answer that the New Testament’s fulfillment logic is not merely additional application; it frequently relativizes the original typological shell. Hebrews treats the entire Levitical cultus as shadow; Ephesians 2–3 sees the inclusion of Gentiles in one body as a mystery now revealed; Galatians 3–4 recasts Abrahamic descent around Christ and the Spirit. A hermeneutic that bars such Christocentric re‑reading for the sake of an inviolable national referent is in tension with **Christ as the telos of Scripture**.

Progressive dispensationalism, centrally articulated by Craig Blaising and Darrell Bock in the late twentieth century, emerges precisely as an internal reform movement attempting to correct these tensions while retaining the Israel–church distinction and future for national Israel. Blaising’s contribution lies especially in his adoption of an already–not yet understanding of the Davidic kingdom. In works such as Progressive Dispensationalism, Blaising argues that Christ is now enthroned and the kingdom is already inaugurated, yet its earthly, political dimension awaits consummation. Crucially, progressive dispensationalists introduce the notion of “complementary hermeneutics”: later revelation can expand and deepen earlier promises without canceling their original meaning or referent. Thus church participation in Abrahamic and new covenant blessings is real, but the specific national and territorial elements of the Old Testament covenants also await future realization for ethnic Israel.

Darrell Bock, working extensively in Luke–Acts, has stressed the **unified plan of God** across the canon and the centrality of Christ’s exaltation as the pivot of redemptive history. Bock is more willing than classic dispensationalists to speak of the church as participating in the new covenant, and to acknowledge an inaugurated kingdom in the present age. Under cross‑examination, one must recognize that progressive dispensationalism has moved significantly toward a more Christocentric, already–not yet paradigm and away from Ryrie’s strict literalism. Yet it retains the constitutive Israel–church dualism as a permanent structural feature, not merely a historical distinction of administration.

Here emerges the internal debate among dispensationalists themselves. Classic forms insisted the new covenant was made strictly with Israel and Judah, with the church related only indirectly through spiritual blessings. Revised dispensationalists softened but retained this line. Progressives grant more direct ecclesial participation in new covenant realities. However, as a Westminster student you must ask whether partializing the new covenant in this way is coherent with Hebrews’ claim that Christ is mediator of a better covenant that renders the old obsolete for the people of God as such. A divided new covenant threatens to fracture the unity of **union with Christ**, **justification**, and the **effectual call** across Jew and Gentile. If Gentile believers are grafted into the one olive tree, they do not stand in a different covenantal relation than Jewish believers.

Progressive covenantalism, especially in the work of Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum in Kingdom through Covenant, consciously positions itself as an alternative both to traditional covenant theology and to dispensational schemes, including their progressive form. Gentry, as a biblical theologian with expertise in the ancient Near East and the Septuagint, emphasizes the textual particularity and intertextual development of the biblical covenants. Wellum, as a systematic theologian, works out the implications for **Christology**, **soteriology**, and **ecclesiology**. Together they argue that the Bible’s structure is best understood not by a supra‑historical covenant of works and covenant of grace, nor by multiple unrelated dispensations, but by the unfolding, organically related covenants: from creation to Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and new, all centered and fulfilled in Christ, the true seed, true Israel, and true son of David.

Their hermeneutical center is **Christological fulfillment in a typological–covenantal framework**. Types are not arbitrary illustrations but God‑intended patterns embedded in the covenants themselves. Israel as a nation functions as a typological son, priesthood, and kingdom that anticipates and is superseded by Christ and his body. The land promise is not denied but transformed by being taken up into the broader category of new creation and worldwide kingdom. The church, as Jew and Gentile united to Christ, is the eschatological people of God, the locus of the new covenant. Ethnic Israel retains a future in the plan of God only as they are grafted back into the one people through faith in the Messiah, not as a distinct parallel people with separate covenantal status.

Under examiner scrutiny, progressive covenantalism will be challenged on at least three fronts. First, does it abandon the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** in a way that undercuts the Reformed understanding of Adam’s federal headship and the forensic structure of justification. Here one must respond that Gentry and Wellum are critical of certain formulations but not of the underlying realities. They affirm that Adam stands as a representative whose disobedience brings death to all and that Christ, the last Adam, obeys and secures righteousness for his people. They question whether the traditional nomenclature and some historical dependencies best capture the textual data but do not deny the **federal headship** structure. A Reformed progressive covenantalist can maintain the doctrinal substance of these covenants while acknowledging that Scripture’s own explicit covenantal language focuses on the historical covenants as they crescendo in Christ.

Second, critics will press whether progressive covenantalism adequately secures the continuity of moral law, especially the abiding normativity of the Decalogue. Classic covenant theology locates the Decalogue as a republication in covenant form of the creational moral law; dispensationalism often treats the Mosaic law as a unit abrogated in Christ with only overlapping moral norms re‑appropriated under the law of Christ. Progressive covenantalism argues that the moral law is grounded in creation and is thus trans‑covenantal, but that the Mosaic law as such is tied to the old covenant and passes away as a covenantal code. The new covenant believer is under the **law of Christ**, which reaffirms and transforms the creational moral norms in light of Christ’s teaching and the work of the Spirit. In oral defense, you should insist that this does not entail antinomianism: murder, adultery, and idolatry remain prohibited because grounded in God’s character and creation order. The shift lies in the covenantal form and locus of law, not in the evaporation of moral obligation.

Third, from the other side, traditional dispensationalists will object that progressive covenantalism “spiritualizes” Old Testament land and kingdom promises and erases any distinctive future for ethnic Israel. Your answer must emphasize that the New Testament itself universalizes and escalates the promises. Romans 4 presents Abraham as heir of the world, not merely Canaan; Hebrews 11 suggests the patriarchs looked beyond the land to a better, heavenly country; Matthew 5 locates the meek inheriting the earth. The new creation, not a narrow strip of geography, is the ultimate land. As for Israel, Romans 9–11 can be read as promising a future large‑scale turning of ethnic Jews to Christ, but this does not require a reversion to an old covenant theocracy or a separate set of covenantal promises. Progressive covenantalism leaves room for a future ingathering of ethnic Israel while insisting they are saved into the one new covenant people, not alongside them.

Compared to progressive dispensationalism, progressive covenantalism removes the structural Israel–church dualism and insists on a single people of God across the canon, without flattening historical distinctives. It affirms an inaugurated–consummated kingdom theology but resists the notion of a distinct earthly kingdom realization for ethnic Israel as a separate track. Where progressive dispensationalism appeals to “complementary hermeneutics” to retain both the church’s participation in new covenant blessings and a future distinct realization for national Israel, progressive covenantalism argues that this introduces an unnecessary redundancy and threatens the sufficiency of Christ’s fulfillment. If Christ is the true seed and true Davidic king, and if in him Jew and Gentile receive every spiritual blessing, it is hard to see what is left for a national restoration that would not either repeat or relativize what is already given in Christ.

From the standpoint of adjacent loci, these frameworks deeply affect **Christology**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramentology**. Classic dispensationalism tends to bracket the church as a mystery parenthesis, which can unintentionally marginalize the church’s role as the central eschatological community. Covenant theology and progressive covenantalism, by contrast, place the church as the climax of redemptive history, the bride of Christ, the temple of the Spirit, anticipating the new creation. This bears directly on questions about baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Traditional covenant theology, with its emphasis on one covenant of grace across administrations, grounds infant baptism in the continuity between Abrahamic and new covenant community markers. Progressive covenantalism, stressing the newness of the new covenant and its regenerate membership, typically rejects paedobaptism, arguing that the church is to be a believing, baptized community. A Westminster examiner may press you here: is progressive covenantalism structurally Baptist. The honest answer is that in its current leading exponents it tends toward credobaptism, but one can argue that its covenantal framework could be adapted to a Reformed paedobaptist understanding by distinguishing more carefully between the invisible and visible church while maintaining new covenant newness.

My defended position is that progressive covenantalism, suitably calibrated by classical Reformed commitments to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and forensic justification, best captures the canonical architecture of Scripture. It corrects the over‑rigid literalism and Israel–church dualism of classic and even progressive dispensationalism, while sharpening some of the underdeveloped biblical‑theological moves in traditional covenant theology. It allows us to speak robustly of one plan in Christ, one people of God, and one eschatological hope, without erasing the particularities of Israel’s role, the historical covenants, or the inaugurated–consummated structure of the kingdom.

To defend this under sustained questioning, you must keep several lines clear. First, hermeneutically, you affirm **Christ as the hermeneutical center** and accept that later revelation can and does deepen and sometimes transform the apparent scope of earlier promises through divinely intended typology. Second, theologically, you hold fast to one covenant of grace in substance, even if you do not insist that Scripture itself uses that very label or structure, and you maintain Adam–Christ federalism as nonnegotiable for the gospel. Third, ecclesiologically, you reject any final dualism of peoples, insisting on one olive tree, one body, one bride, while allowing that ethnic Israel may experience a future turning to Christ. Fourth, ethically, you ground the abiding moral norms in God’s character and creation order, expressing them under the **law of Christ** in the new covenant context.

When asked to compare progressive dispensationalism directly with progressive covenantalism, you should acknowledge real advances in Blaising and Bock over Darby and Ryrie: a more nuanced kingdom theology, greater attention to canonical unity, and some willingness to embrace New Testament typology. But you must press that as long as the Israel–church distinction is treated as an ultimate structuring principle, not simply a historical phase, the integrity of the new covenant and the fullness of Christ’s fulfillment are compromised. Conversely, you should admit that progressive covenantalism must guard vigilantly against collapsing everything into undifferentiated “spiritual” fulfillment and must continue to articulate clearly how the concrete, historical dimensions of promise, including land and nationhood, find real, not merely metaphorical, realization in the new creation and the embodied, resurrected people of God.

In sum, the dispute between dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism is not mainly about piety or evangelistic zeal but about the **canonical ontology** of God’s redemptive work. Does God pursue two distinct yet parallel programs, or one coherent plan in Christ. Does the new covenant represent the climax and definitive form of God’s saving relationship to his people, or one phase within a larger, multi‑track schema. Progressive covenantalism, properly integrated with Reformed dogmatics, provides a robustly christocentric, ecclesially centered, and eschatologically rich answer: there is one plan, one Christ, one covenant climax, one people, and one kingdom, already inaugurated and awaiting consummation in the new creation.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism are competing models of the Bible’s **covenantal and kingdom architecture**, especially concerning Israel–church relations, promise–fulfillment, and the structure of the covenants.
- Decisive figures: Darby – introduced a sharp Israel–church dualism and parenthesis ecclesiology; Ryrie – codified classic dispensationalism with a single literal hermeneutic and doxological focus; Blaising and Bock – reworked dispensationalism into a progressive, already–not yet, complementary hermeneutic while retaining an ultimate Israel–church distinction; Gentry and Wellum – articulated progressive covenantalism as a typological–covenantal, Christocentric alternative grounded in the unfolding covenants.
- Debates: internal – classic vs revised vs progressive dispensationalism on the new covenant and kingdom; covenant theology vs progressive covenantalism on covenant of works/grace and law; external – dispensational dualism versus Reformed **federal theology** on one people of God; contemporary – hermeneutics of typology, the future of ethnic Israel, land and kingdom, and law–gospel under the **new covenant**.
- Defended position: Progressive covenantalism, calibrated by Reformed commitments to Adam–Christ federalism and forensic justification, best accounts for the unity and diversity of Scripture, the centrality of Christ and the new covenant, and the one people of God, while correcting both classic and progressive dispensationalism.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does progressive covenantalism deny the covenant of works and covenant of grace?  
    Answer: No, it questions some formulations but affirms Adam’s federal headship and one gracious plan culminating in Christ.
  - How does your view preserve a future for ethnic Israel without reintroducing dual peoples of God.  
    Answer: By expecting a future large‑scale Jewish turning to Christ within the one new covenant people, not a parallel covenantal track.
  - Why reject the dispensational commitment to strict literalism.  
    Answer: Because the New Testament’s own Spirit‑given hermeneutic employs typological fulfillment that sometimes transforms, not merely repeats, earlier referents in Christ.
  - What happens to the Decalogue and moral law in progressive covenantalism.  
    Answer: The moral norms, grounded in creation and God’s character, continue under the **law of Christ**, even though the Mosaic covenant as a legal code is obsolete.
  - How does this framework impact ecclesiology and sacraments.  
    Answer: It locates the church as the eschatological people of God under the new covenant, tending toward a regenerate church membership and credobaptism, though a Reformed paedobaptist adaptation is possible in principle.
