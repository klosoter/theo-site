# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged with both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism** from a Reformed perspective, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of the **covenant of grace**. He rejected the sharp discontinuities of dispensationalism, instead advocating for a Christ-centered continuity between the **Old and New Testaments** and the unfolding of God’s **salvific plan** through covenant.

- "The unity of the covenant is not a unity of abstract ideas, but a unity of the redemptive work of God in Christ." (The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Unifying Principle**
   - The **covenant of grace** is the central thread of biblical revelation.
   - Rejects the fragmentation of history into unrelated dispensations.
   - Sees the Old and New Testaments as organically connected.
   - Emphasizes the fulfillment of the covenant in Christ.
   - "The covenant is not a peripheral concept but the heart of the relationship between God and man." (Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Justification)

2. **Critique of Dispensational Discontinuity**
   - Dispensationalism introduces artificial divisions in redemptive history.
   - Argues that such divisions undermine the unity of God’s saving work.
   - Stresses the dangers of separating Israel and the Church too sharply.
   - Maintains that salvation has always been by grace through faith.
   - "The separation of Israel and the Church in dispensationalism is foreign to the biblical witness." (The Triumph of Grace in the Theology of Karl Barth)

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment of the Covenant**
   - Christ is the fulfillment and center of all biblical covenants.
   - The promises to Israel find their realization in Jesus.
   - All of Scripture points to the redemptive work of Christ.
   - The Church is the continuation of God’s covenant people.
   - "In Christ, all the promises of God are yes and amen." (Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ)

4. **Organic Progression in Redemptive History**
   - Redemptive history unfolds progressively, not in discrete dispensations.
   - The covenant develops organically from promise to fulfillment.
   - God’s revelation is cumulative and coherent.
   - The unity of Scripture is preserved through this organic progression.
   - "Revelation is not a sequence of disconnected acts, but a continuous history of redemption." (Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture)

5. **Critical Engagement with Progressive Covenantalism**
   - Affirms the progression and fulfillment themes highlighted by progressive covenantalists.
   - Warns against minimizing the abiding significance of the covenant of grace.
   - Stresses the necessity of maintaining Reformed categories in covenant theology.
   - Recognizes value in seeing Christ as the center of all covenants.
   - "The covenant of grace remains the decisive framework for understanding redemptive history." (Studies in Dogmatics: Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s robust defense of the **unity of the covenant** has shaped Reformed critiques of both dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism. His insistence on the organic connection between the Old and New Testaments continues to influence covenant theology and biblical interpretation. By emphasizing the centrality of Christ and the continuity of God’s redemptive plan, Berkouwer remains a key voice in contemporary discussions on the structure of biblical revelation.
