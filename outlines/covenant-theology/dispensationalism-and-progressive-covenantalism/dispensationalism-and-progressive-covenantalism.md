### ESSAY
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
At stake is the relation of the **biblical covenants** across the canon and the identity of the people of God. Classical dispensationalism posits multiple discrete economies or **dispensations** in which God administrates his plan, distinguishing Israel and the church and postponing national promises to a future earthly millennium; progressive covenantalism contends for one plan of God structured by successive **covenantal administrations** climaxing in Christ and forming one new people. The dogmatic location touches **ecclesiology**, **eschatology**, and **hermeneutics**, with implications for **soteriology** and sacramental theology.

Classical dispensationalism, systematized by **J. N. Darby** in the 1830s and popularized by **C. I. Scofield** in 1909, maintains a hard Israel-church distinction and a consistently **literal-grammatical** reading of national and land promises. Revised and progressive dispensationalists nuance this with the **already-not yet kingdom**, seeing partial fulfillment now and consummation later. By contrast, progressive covenantalism, articulated by **Stephen Wellum and Peter Gentry** in 2012, emphasizes **typological fulfillment** in Christ and the church as the eschatological Israel, while still honoring textual specificity. Both frameworks seek to honor the **unity of Scripture**, yet differ over the extent and manner of continuity across covenants.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
The Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 12, 15, and 17 promises seed, land, and blessing, and is sealed by divine oath; dispensationalists foreground the **unconditional land promise**, while progressive covenantalists stress **typology realized** in Christ and the worldwide inheritance. Galatians 3:16 reads the seed as Christ, and 3:29 locates Gentile believers in Abraham, a key plank for **one new people**; yet Romans 11:28–29 affirms Israel’s irrevocable calling, a central text for **future national restoration**.

The Mosaic covenant at Sinai (Exodus 19–24) introduces law, priesthood, and cultus; Hebrews 8–10 interprets these as **shadows fulfilled** in Christ’s priesthood and sacrifice. Dispensationalists often maintain a sharper law-gospel disjunction across **dispensational economies**, whereas progressive covenantalism centers the law’s moral core as transposed through the **new covenant ethic**. Matthew 5:17–20 holds together continuity and fulfillment as Christ completes Torah, a crux for debates about **Sabbath and moral law**.

The Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7; Psalm 89) promises an eternal throne. Luke-Acts presents Jesus as the **Davidic king**, with Acts 2:30–36 arguing that resurrection-exaltation is enthronement, reinforcing **already-not yet**. Progressive dispensationalists posit present installment with future fullness, while progressive covenantalists argue for **eschatological temple and land** realized in Christ and his body. Acts 15 cites Amos 9 to depict the rebuilding of David’s tent as Gentile inclusion, a watershed in the **Israel-church relation**.

Jeremiah 31:31–34 and Ezekiel 36–37 ground the **new covenant**, Spirit-renewal, and heart transformation. Hebrews 8 applies the new covenant to believers, raising questions whether it is with the church as Israel-by-union or with ethnic Israel later. Ephesians 2:11–22 teaches the **one new humanity**, with the dividing wall broken and Gentiles fellow citizens, forming a **temple-people**. Revelation 21–22 culminates in new creation where the land promise expands to cosmic scope, a locus for a **typology-to-teleology** reading.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
Seventeenth-century Reformed federalism formulated **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** to unify Scripture. The **Westminster Confession (1646–1648)** taught one covenant of grace under varied administrations, anticipating the gospel under types and shadows. **Johannes Cocceius** (1603–1669) stressed progressive history; **Herman Witsius**’s Economy of the Covenants (1677) synthesized biblical and dogmatic loci, establishing **federal theology** as orthodoxy.

Dispensationalism arose in the **Plymouth Brethren** circles with **Darby** in the 1830s, teaching a pretribulational rapture and distinct programs for Israel and the church. The **Niagara Conferences (1878–1897)** and **Scofield Reference Bible (1909/1917)** disseminated **classical dispensationalism**. **Lewis Sperry Chafer** founded Dallas Theological Seminary in 1924, systematizing the view in his Systematic Theology (1947), while **Charles Ryrie** articulated revised dispensationalism in 1965 with a clarified **dispensational sine qua non**: literal hermeneutics, Israel-church distinction, doxological purpose.

In the late twentieth century, **progressive dispensationalism** emerged through **Blaising and Bock** (1993–1995), embracing already-not yet kingdom and partial fulfillment. Parallel to this, Reformed biblical theology matured through **Geerhardus Vos** (Biblical Theology, 1948), **Herman Ridderbos** (Paul, 1966), and **Meredith Kline** (Treaty of the Great King, 1963; By Oath Consigned, 1968), deepening **covenantal structure** and typology. This trajectory paved the way for **progressive covenantalism**, framed by **Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum** in Kingdom through Covenant (2012), drawing on canon-sensitive exegesis and **Christological fulfillment**.

A mediating stream, often called **New Covenant Theology** in the 1990s, critiqued the tripartite law and advanced **Christocentric ethics**, feeding into progressive covenantalism’s credobaptist and ecclesial conclusions. The result is a spectrum: from classical dispensationalism with **two peoples** and a future theocratic kingdom, through progressive dispensationalism’s **complementary hermeneutic**, to progressive covenantalism’s **one-people-through-covenants**.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Old Princeton, represented by **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield**, defended the **covenant of grace** and unity of the people of God while engaging higher criticism with a **grammatico-historical** method subordinated to canonical coherence. Warfield’s amillennial leanings and critique of **dispensational literalism** preserved the Christological center without collapsing historical progression, an approach that shapes Reformed engagement with **progressive covenantalism**.

Dutch Neo-Calvinism, through **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** (Reformed Dogmatics, 1895–1901), integrated **common grace** and the **kingdom of God** across culture, preferring amillennial or inaugurated eschatology that affirms one covenant people. **Ridderbos** and **Vos** expounded **redemptive-historical exegesis**, highlighting corporate and eschatological categories that underwrite typological readings of land and temple. This tradition resonates strongly with **progressive covenantalism**, though it diverges over baptism and law.

The Westminster Standards consolidate the Reformed stance: one **covenant of grace** under diverse administrations, sacraments as signs and seals, and a **tripartite law** distinction. Paedobaptist readings use **circumcision-baptism continuity** to defend infant inclusion, while progressive covenantalists argue for **new covenant membership by regeneration** and credobaptism. **Meredith Kline**’s republication proposal complicated the picture by distinguishing Mosaic typology and works principle at the typological level, a move both appealed to and contested in debates with **progressive covenantalism**.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic theology frames salvation history as a unified **divine economy** of covenants culminating in Christ and the church as the **new Israel**. Post **Vatican II (1962–1965)** documents like Nostra Aetate affirm Israel’s ongoing significance while maintaining **typological fulfillment** in the sacramental church. The Catholic magisterium resists a hard **Israel-church duality**, employing figural exegesis to integrate land and temple into **Eucharistic ecclesiology**.

Lutheran theology centers the **law-gospel distinction** and tends to amillennialism, reading Israel’s promises through **justification by faith** and the cross. The Augsburg Confession and the two kingdoms doctrine guard against politicized **Christian Zionism**, while honoring the Old Testament as promise fulfilled in Christ. Lutherans often reject the Reformed **tripartite law** scheme yet converge with progressive covenantalism on **Christocentric hermeneutics**.

Modern evangelical scholarship birthed **progressive dispensationalism** as a corrective to classical forms, employing the **complementary hermeneutic** wherein New Testament revelation expands but does not overturn Old Testament meanings. Meanwhile, canonical and biblical-theological projects, from **G. K. Beale** on temple to **Richard Hays** on figural reading, underwrite **progressive covenantalism’s typology**. In analytic theology, questions of type-identity, **promise-fulfillment semantics**, and the metaphysics of corporate identity probe whether Israel and the church can be numerically distinct yet **covenantally one**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
The charge of **supersessionism** shadows discussions. Dispensationalists warn that progressive covenantalism dissolves **ethnic Israel’s** promissory specificity; progressive covenantalists counter with **fulfillment not replacement**, arguing Romans 11’s fullness comes through incorporation into Christ, the **true Israel**. Political theology complicates matters: some link classical dispensationalism to **Christian Zionism**, while others insist theological claims need not entail specific statecraft.

Hermeneutically, critics allege **hermeneutical dualism** in dispensationalism, with divergent rules for testaments. Progressive dispensationalism responds with **already-not yet** and **complementarity**, yet retains a future for national Israel. Progressive covenantalists are pressed on the durability of **land promises** and whether new creation universalizes Israel-specific commitments. The status of **Jeremiah 31** and Eucharistic words of institution also raise whether the church participates in a covenant explicitly cut with Israel and Judah.

Ecclesially, baptism and the **Lord’s Day/Sabbath** mark divergences. Paedobaptists see Abrahamic continuity; progressive covenantalists appeal to **new covenant regenerate membership**. Dispensationalists sometimes separate **kingdom ethics** as future ideal, while progressive views press **Sermon on the Mount** as inaugurated norm. Eschatologically, debates persist over **pretribulational rapture** and the nature of the **millennium**, with Revelation 20 contested in structure and symbolism.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Trinitarianly, the **divine economy** unfolds covenants as missions of Son and Spirit, so that **Rahners Rule** cautions against divorcing Israel’s history from the church’s identity; Christology centers Jesus as **mediator of the new covenant** whose Davidic kingship orders ecclesial life now. Pneumatology underwrites **new heart and Spirit** promises, locating continuity-discontinuity in the **indwelling Spirit’s** eschatological gift.

Soteriologically, both systems affirm **justification by faith** across history, yet they parse the administration of promises differently; progressive covenantalism insists on one **covenant of grace** historically advanced, while dispensationalism emphasizes **distinct economies** with constant salvation content. Anthropologically, Israel’s corporate identity functions as typological anthropology fulfilled in **the church as royal priesthood**; ecclesiology then adjudicates **sacramental signs**, membership, and discipline.

Missiologically, the Abrahamic promise of **blessing to the nations** sets the global horizon; the ethics of kingdom life shape public witness whether framed as **already realized** or future. Eschatology integrates **land, temple, and kingdom** as either national-historical realities in a millennium or as cosmic new creation realities already inaugurated and awaiting consummation. Bibliology and hermeneutics mediate all this through **canonical context** and the primacy of Christ in interpretation.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastors must help congregations read the Old Testament as **Christian Scripture** without erasing authorial intent. Preaching should model **promise-fulfillment** in Christ, showing how law, temple, and land reach telos in the gospel. Catechesis can map the covenants, training believers to hold **continuity and discontinuity** together, and to navigate debates without polemic.

Liturgically, the sacraments embody covenant identity: the Supper as **new covenant meal** and baptism as **union-with-Christ** sign. Churches should articulate whether they practice **paedo- or credobaptism** and why, acknowledging Reformed and progressive covenantal arguments. Prayers for the Jewish people should reflect **Romans 9–11 hope**, avoiding triumphalism while confessing that salvation is in **Messiah Jesus**.

In public theology, leaders should distinguish theological commitments from **geopolitical prescriptions**, resisting simplistic appeals while honoring the gravity of **land and people** themes. Discipleship can frame kingdom ethics as **Spirit-empowered** participation now, anticipating consummation without escapism. The payoff is a robust confidence in the **unity of Scripture** that fuels mission and worship.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
At the intersection of Israel and the church, land and new creation, dispensational economies and progressive covenants pose a single claim: in the **one Christ** God fulfills his promises for one people, already and not yet.
