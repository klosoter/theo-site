# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth was a leading figure in twentieth-century theology whose approach to **biblical revelation** and the **unity of Scripture** stands in sharp contrast to both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. Barth rejected the notion of discrete dispensations or epochs with fundamentally different divine economies, instead emphasizing the singular **covenant of grace** fulfilled in **Jesus Christ** as the center of all Scripture and redemptive history.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation, and creation is the way to the covenant." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, esp. volumes I/2, II/2, IV/1
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Dogmatics in Outline
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology (ed. Clifford Green)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Unity of Scripture**
   - All of **Scripture** is unified around the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
   - Barth rejects any hermeneutic that divides redemptive history into unrelated dispensations.
   - The Old and New Testaments are inseparably linked in their witness to Christ.
   - The covenant is not a sequence of different arrangements but a single divine purpose realized in Christ.
   - "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God whom we have to hear and whom we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Rejection of Dispensationalism**
   - Barth opposes the idea of distinct dispensations with separate divine economies.
   - He critiques the fragmentation of biblical history into unrelated periods.
   - Barth sees dispensationalism as undermining the continuity of God's self-revelation.
   - The church is not a parenthesis in God's plan but the community called into being by Christ.
   - "The revelation of God is one and the same in every age." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Covenant as the Framework of Revelation**
   - The **covenant of grace** is the central structure of God's relationship with humanity.
   - Creation itself is oriented toward covenant fellowship with God.
   - Barth interprets all biblical covenants as aspects of the one covenant fulfilled in Christ.
   - He resists both legalistic and purely historical readings of covenant.
   - "The history of the covenant is the inner basis of all history." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Critique of Progressive Covenantalism**
   - Barth does not affirm a progression of covenants as discrete stages in redemptive history.
   - He emphasizes the qualitative difference between human covenants and the divine covenant in Christ.
   - Progressive covenantalism’s focus on historical development is subordinated to the eternal purpose in Christ.
   - For Barth, the covenant is not merely a sequence but a singular event in Christ’s person and work.
   - "In Jesus Christ, the covenant is both established and fulfilled." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

5. **Revelation as Event, Not System**
   - Divine revelation is a dynamic event, not a static system of dispensations or covenants.
   - Barth resists systematizing Scripture into epochs or stages.
   - The Word of God confronts each generation anew, transcending historical schemas.
   - The focus is on God’s free act in revealing Himself, not on humanly constructed frameworks.
   - "God reveals Himself. He reveals Himself through Himself. He reveals Himself." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robustly **Christocentric** approach has profoundly shaped modern theology, challenging both **dispensational** and **progressive covenantal** frameworks by insisting on the unity and singularity of God’s covenant in Christ. His influence has led many to reconsider the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the centrality of **revelation** over historical or systematic divisions. Barth’s thought continues to provoke critical engagement among scholars wrestling with the structure of redemptive history and the nature of biblical covenants.
