# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **covenant theology** that stands in contrast to both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. Emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history, the Standards reject the sharp discontinuities of dispensationalism and maintain a more confessional, structured approach than progressive covenantalism.

- "Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism
- Westminster Shorter Catechism
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Directory for Public Worship

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The Standards teach one overarching **covenant of grace** throughout Scripture.
   - Old and New Testament administrations differ in form, not in substance.
   - The church is one people of God across both testaments.
   - The promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and the church.
   - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

2. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
   - No radical separation between Israel and the church.
   - The moral law, especially the **Ten Commandments**, remains binding.
   - Typological elements of the Old Testament are fulfilled in Christ.
   - The Standards do not teach a future earthly millennium for ethnic Israel.
   - "The visible Church... is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God." (WCF 25.2)

3. **Continuity of the Moral Law**
   - The moral law is perpetually binding on all people.
   - Ceremonial and civil laws are abrogated or fulfilled in Christ.
   - The law serves as a rule of life for believers under the covenant of grace.
   - The Sabbath commandment is upheld as a creation ordinance.
   - "The moral law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof." (WCF 19.5)

4. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs**
   - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the two sacraments of the New Testament.
   - Both are signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
   - Infant baptism is warranted as a sign of covenant continuity.
   - The sacraments replace, but do not abolish, the spiritual realities of Old Testament signs.
   - "Baptism is... a sign and seal of the covenant of grace." (WCF 28.1)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of All Covenants**
   - Christ is the mediator of the covenant of grace.
   - All previous covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic) point to and are fulfilled in Him.
   - The promises and types of the Old Testament culminate in Christ’s person and work.
   - The unity of redemptive history centers on Christ.
   - "The covenant of grace was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel... under the gospel, Christ... is held forth in more fullness." (WCF 7.5–6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have shaped **Reformed covenant theology** for centuries, providing a confessional alternative to both dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism. Their emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the continuity of the church has influenced Presbyterian and Reformed traditions worldwide. The Standards remain a central reference point in debates over the relationship between Israel and the church, the law, and the sacraments. Their robust covenantal framework continues to inform systematic theology and ecclesiology in the Reformed tradition.
