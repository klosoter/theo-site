# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin did not articulate a system of **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism** as later developed, but his theology is foundational for **Reformed covenant theology**. Calvin emphasized the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history, seeing continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture.

- "All the covenants made with the fathers were so many renewals of the covenant of grace." (Institutes 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 9–11)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, and Hebrews
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill (secondary reference for covenant theology)
- Calvin and the Reformed Tradition by Richard Muller (secondary, for historical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - Calvin taught that the **covenant of grace** underlies both Old and New Testaments.
   - He rejected sharp discontinuities between Israel and the Church.
   - The promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers.
   - The substance of the covenant remains the same, though its administration differs.
   - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes 2.10.2)

2. **Typology and Fulfillment in Christ**
   - Calvin viewed Old Testament ceremonies as **types** fulfilled in Christ.
   - He emphasized the **progressive revelation** of God's redemptive plan.
   - The law points forward to the gospel and is not a separate dispensation.
   - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all covenant promises.
   - "The Old Testament is a testimony of God's mercy and fatherly care, which is fully revealed in Christ." (Institutes 2.9.2)

3. **Continuity of the People of God**
   - Calvin identified the **Church** as the continuation of Israel, not a replacement.
   - He maintained one people of God across redemptive history.
   - The sacraments of the Old and New Testaments signify the same spiritual realities.
   - Children of believers are included in the covenant community.
   - "The Lord has always adopted His people, and the Church has existed from the beginning." (Commentary on Genesis 17:7)

4. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
   - Calvin did not divide history into distinct dispensations with separate rules of salvation.
   - He opposed any notion of a future, earthly Jewish kingdom distinct from the Church.
   - The law and gospel are not two ways of salvation but one unfolding promise.
   - He interpreted prophecy Christologically, not as predictions of a restored national Israel.
   - "It is a perverse fancy to restrict to the Jews what is said concerning the kingdom of Christ." (Commentary on Isaiah 2:2)

5. **Covenant Administration and Diversity**
   - Calvin acknowledged differences in the outward administration of the covenant.
   - He saw the Mosaic law as a temporary pedagogue leading to Christ.
   - The New Covenant brings greater clarity and spiritual efficacy, not a new substance.
   - The ceremonial law is abrogated, but the moral law remains.
   - "The difference between the Old and New Testaments lies in the mode of administration, not in the substance." (Institutes 2.11.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust **covenant theology** became foundational for later Reformed thought and provided a strong alternative to both **dispensationalism** and modern **progressive covenantalism**. His emphasis on the unity of the covenant of grace and the continuity of the people of God shaped confessional standards and ecclesiology in the Reformed tradition. While Calvin did not directly address later systems, his work remains a critical reference point in debates over the structure of redemptive history and the relationship between Israel and the Church.
