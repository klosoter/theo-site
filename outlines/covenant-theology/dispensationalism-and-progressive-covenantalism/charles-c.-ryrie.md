# Charles C. Ryrie (1925–2016)

Charles C. Ryrie was a leading proponent of **dispensationalism**, articulating a system that emphasizes the distinction between **Israel and the Church**, a literal interpretation of **biblical prophecy**, and a consistent **hermeneutic** across Scripture. He critiqued **progressive covenantalism** for blurring these distinctions and maintained that God’s redemptive plan unfolds through distinct **dispensations** rather than a single, unified covenantal structure.

- "The essence of dispensationalism, then, is the distinction between Israel and the church." ("Dispensationalism," p. 39)

## Key Works

- Dispensationalism (1995)
- Basic Theology (1986)
- The Basis of the Premillennial Faith (1953)
- Revelation (Everyman's Bible Commentary, 1968)
- Balancing the Christian Life (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Israel and the Church**
   - Maintains that **Israel** and the **Church** are two separate peoples in God’s redemptive plan.
   - Argues that biblical promises to Israel are not spiritually transferred to the Church.
   - Sees the Church as a **parenthesis** in God’s dealings with Israel.
   - Rejects the idea that the Church fulfills Old Testament covenants.
   - "A dispensationalist keeps Israel and the church distinct." ("Dispensationalism," p. 39)

2. **Consistent Literal Hermeneutic**
   - Advocates for a **literal, grammatical-historical** interpretation of all Scripture, including prophecy.
   - Critiques covenantal and progressive covenantal approaches for spiritualizing Old Testament texts.
   - Insists that prophecies concerning Israel’s land, kingdom, and future must be fulfilled literally.
   - Sees typology as subordinate to the plain sense of the text.
   - "Literal interpretation is the basis of dispensationalism." ("Dispensationalism," p. 80)

3. **Progressive Revelation Through Dispensations**
   - Teaches that God’s plan unfolds in distinct **dispensations** or economies.
   - Each dispensation is marked by a new divine arrangement and human responsibility.
   - Emphasizes the progression and discontinuity between dispensations.
   - Rejects the idea that all biblical covenants are simply different administrations of one covenant of grace.
   - "Dispensationalism views the world as a household run by God." ("Dispensationalism," p. 29)

4. **Premillennial Eschatology**
   - Holds to a **premillennial** and **pretribulational** view of Christ’s return.
   - Believes in a future, literal fulfillment of Old Testament promises to Israel.
   - Sees the millennium as a distinct dispensation following the Church age.
   - Argues that progressive covenantalism undermines the future role of national Israel.
   - "The premillennial return of Christ is a necessary part of dispensationalism." ("Dispensationalism," p. 17)

5. **Clarity and Simplicity of the Gospel**
   - Stresses **salvation by grace through faith** alone, apart from works.
   - Warns against confusing the gospel with requirements from other dispensations.
   - Argues that progressive covenantalism risks conflating law and gospel.
   - Emphasizes assurance and security for believers in the Church age.
   - "Salvation is always by grace through faith, but the content of faith may vary in different dispensations." ("Dispensationalism," p. 123)

## Legacy and Impact

Ryrie’s articulation of **dispensationalism** shaped generations of evangelical pastors, scholars, and laypeople, especially through his accessible writings and the influential Ryrie Study Bible. His insistence on the **distinction between Israel and the Church** became a hallmark of mainstream dispensational thought. While his views have been critiqued by proponents of **progressive covenantalism** and Reformed theology, Ryrie’s work remains foundational for understanding the development and defense of dispensational systems in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
