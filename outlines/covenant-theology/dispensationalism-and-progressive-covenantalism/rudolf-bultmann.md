# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not directly engage with **Dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, but his approach to **biblical hermeneutics** and **demythologization** significantly influenced later discussions about the structure of **redemptive history**. Bultmann’s existential interpretation of the New Testament challenged traditional readings of **salvation history** and questioned the viability of any rigid historical schema, including those found in dispensational or covenantal frameworks.

- "The task of theology is to interpret the biblical message in such a way that its existential meaning becomes clear to modern man." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Sought to reinterpret biblical myths in existential terms.
    - Argued that mythological worldviews are incompatible with modern scientific understanding.
    - Emphasized the need to uncover the existential message behind biblical narratives.
    - Rejected literalist readings of salvation history.
    - "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Redemptive History**
    - Viewed the Bible as addressing the individual's existential situation rather than outlining a historical sequence of dispensations or covenants.
    - Interpreted salvation as an existential event rather than a chronological process.
    - Downplayed the significance of historical epochs in favor of personal encounter with the kerygma.
    - Critiqued any theological system that imposed a rigid historical framework on revelation.
    - "What matters is not the historical sequence but the existential decision." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Critique of Heilsgeschichte (Salvation History)**
    - Questioned the objectivity and usefulness of salvation history as a theological category.
    - Saw the proclamation of Christ as transcending historical periods or dispensations.
    - Emphasized the present encounter with the Word over past historical acts.
    - Considered salvation history to be a mythological construct.
    - "The real content of faith is not a salvation history but the event of encounter with God in the present." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Rejection of Literal Eschatology**
    - Denied a future-oriented, literal fulfillment of biblical prophecies.
    - Interpreted eschatological texts as existential calls to decision.
    - Opposed millenarian and dispensational readings of the New Testament.
    - Located eschatology in the present experience of faith, not in a future dispensation.
    - "Eschatology is not a doctrine of future events, but a way of understanding human existence." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - Focused on the proclamation of Christ as the core of Christian faith.
    - Held that the kerygma transcends historical and covenantal structures.
    - Saw the message of the cross and resurrection as existentially transformative.
    - Believed the kerygma must be demythologized to be meaningful today.
    - "The kerygma alone is the bearer of the saving event." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s **demythologization** project profoundly shaped twentieth-century biblical scholarship, especially in its skepticism toward rigid **dispensational** or **covenantal** frameworks. His existential approach to **redemptive history** influenced later debates about the structure of biblical revelation, even as many disagreed with his rejection of historical continuity. While Bultmann is not a direct participant in the dispensationalism versus progressive covenantalism discussion, his work remains a critical reference point for any theology that seeks to relate biblical history to contemporary faith.
