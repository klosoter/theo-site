# Craig A. Blaising (1949– )

Craig A. Blaising is a leading proponent of **progressive dispensationalism**, a mediating position between traditional **dispensationalism** and **covenant theology**. He emphasizes the unfolding of the **biblical covenants** across redemptive history, arguing for both continuity and discontinuity in **God’s plan** for Israel and the Church. Blaising’s work seeks to integrate a robust **biblical theology** with a nuanced understanding of **eschatology** and the **kingdom of God**.

- "Progressive dispensationalism is an attempt to develop dispensational theology in light of contemporary biblical scholarship and hermeneutics." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

## Key Works

- Progressive Dispensationalism (with Darrell L. Bock)
- Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church: The Search for Definition (editor)
- Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond (contributor)
- The People, the Land, and the Future of Israel (contributor)
- "The Fulfillment of the Biblical Covenants" (in Progressive Dispensationalism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Revelation of the Kingdom**
    - Argues that the **kingdom of God** unfolds progressively through the biblical covenants.
    - Sees the **Davidic** and **New Covenants** as inaugurated in Christ but awaiting future consummation.
    - Emphasizes both "already" and "not yet" aspects of the kingdom.
    - Maintains that Israel and the Church have distinct roles in redemptive history.
    - "The kingdom is present in Christ but awaits its full realization in the future." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity in God’s Plan**
    - Affirms real continuity between **Israel** and the **Church** while preserving their distinctions.
    - Rejects replacement theology, holding that God’s promises to Israel remain valid.
    - Sees the Church as participating in the blessings of the covenants without nullifying Israel’s future.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s redemptive purpose across dispensations.
    - "The church participates in the promises, but Israel’s national future is not negated." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

3. **Hermeneutical Development**
    - Advocates a **complementary hermeneutic** rather than strict literalism.
    - Recognizes the New Testament’s expansion and reinterpretation of Old Testament promises.
    - Stresses the importance of both grammatical-historical and canonical-contextual interpretation.
    - Sees typology as a legitimate means of understanding fulfillment.
    - "The New Testament complements, rather than simply repeats, Old Testament revelation." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

4. **Centrality of the Biblical Covenants**
    - Places the **Abrahamic**, **Davidic**, and **New Covenants** at the center of biblical theology.
    - Argues that these covenants structure the unfolding of salvation history.
    - Views the covenants as progressively revealed and partially fulfilled in Christ.
    - Maintains that ultimate fulfillment awaits Christ’s return and the restoration of Israel.
    - "The biblical covenants provide the framework for understanding God’s redemptive plan." (Progressive Dispensationalism)

5. **Eschatological Hope for Israel and the Nations**
    - Affirms a future for **ethnic Israel** in God’s eschatological purposes.
    - Sees the restoration of Israel as part of the consummation of the kingdom.
    - Holds that the nations will also share in the blessings of the new creation.
    - Maintains a premillennial expectation of Christ’s return and reign.
    - "God’s promises to Israel will be fulfilled in the eschaton alongside blessings for the nations." (Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond)

## Legacy and Impact

Craig A. Blaising has significantly shaped the conversation around **dispensationalism** by articulating a progressive, biblically grounded alternative to both classical dispensationalism and covenant theology. His work has fostered greater dialogue between evangelical traditions and contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the **kingdom of God** and the role of Israel in redemptive history. Blaising’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **biblical theology**, hermeneutics, and eschatology, making him a pivotal figure in the development of progressive covenantal thought.
