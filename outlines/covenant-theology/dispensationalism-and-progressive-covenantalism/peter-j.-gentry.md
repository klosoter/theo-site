# Peter J. Gentry (1952– )

Peter J. Gentry is a leading advocate of **progressive covenantalism**, emphasizing the unity of the biblical covenants and their fulfillment in Christ. He critiques **dispensationalism** for its sharp distinction between Israel and the church, instead arguing for a **canonical** and **typological** reading of Scripture that highlights the continuity of God’s redemptive plan. Gentry’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.

    - Contrasts with dispensationalism’s literalistic hermeneutic.
    - Sees Christ as the true Israel and the substance of all covenant promises.
    - "All the covenants find their fulfillment in the person and work of Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - Emphasizes both continuity and discontinuity between the covenants.
    - Argues for a **progressive revelation** that maintains unity without flattening distinctions.
    - Rejects both covenant theology’s over-continuity and dispensationalism’s over-discontinuity.

    - "The new covenant brings both continuity and transformation to God’s people." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Canonical Hermeneutics**

    - Critiques dispensationalism for atomizing the biblical narrative.
    - Sees the canon as a unified witness to God’s redemptive purposes.
    - "A canonical approach reveals the coherence and unity of the biblical covenants." (Kingdom through Covenant)

5. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Denies a permanent distinction between **Israel and the church**.
    - Argues that the church is the eschatological people of God, incorporating Jew and Gentile.
    - Sees the land promise as typologically fulfilled in Christ and the new creation.
    - Critiques the postponement of the kingdom in classic dispensationalism.
    - "The church is the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham, not a parenthesis in God’s plan." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Legacy and Impact

Gentry’s advocacy for **progressive covenantalism** has provided a robust alternative to both traditional covenant theology and dispensationalism, influencing evangelical biblical theology. His emphasis on the centrality of the covenants and a typological reading of Scripture has shaped how scholars and pastors understand the unity of the Bible. Gentry’s work continues to foster dialogue and reassessment of the relationship between Israel, the church, and the fulfillment of God’s promises in Christ.
