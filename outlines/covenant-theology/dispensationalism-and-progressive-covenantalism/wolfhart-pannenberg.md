# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg did not identify with **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, but his theology offers a critical perspective on both through his emphasis on the **unity of revelation** and the **historical unfolding of God’s self-disclosure**. Pannenberg’s approach stresses the continuity of **salvation history** and the centrality of **Christ’s resurrection** as the key to understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, challenging sharp divisions between **biblical covenants** or dispensations.

- "The unity of the history of God with the world is the presupposition of all Christian theology." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vols. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Basic Questions in Theology (1970)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
    - Revelation is not a static deposit but unfolds dynamically in history.
    - God’s self-disclosure culminates in the historical event of **Jesus’ resurrection**.
    - All previous acts of God are interpreted in light of Christ.
    - This challenges any strict periodization of God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "Revelation is not a series of supernatural communications but the event of history itself." (Revelation as History)

2. **Unity of Salvation History**
    - The Old and New Testaments form a single, coherent narrative.
    - The promises to Israel find fulfillment in Christ, not in separate dispensations.
    - The church is the continuation of God’s people, not a parenthesis in history.
    - Theological reflection must avoid fragmenting redemptive history.
    - "The history of Israel and the history of Jesus belong together as one history of God with the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
    - Christ is the center and goal of all biblical covenants.
    - The meaning of earlier covenants is revealed only in light of Christ.
    - Dispensational distinctions are relativized by the finality of Christ’s work.
    - Progressive revelation finds its telos in the resurrection.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the proleptic revelation of the end of history." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - God’s purposes are oriented toward the eschaton, not toward discrete dispensations.
    - The future fulfillment in Christ shapes the meaning of all previous covenants.
    - The church lives in anticipation of the consummation of God’s kingdom.
    - Theological systems must be open to the future completion of God’s promises.
    - "Christian faith is oriented toward the future, toward the coming kingdom of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

5. **Critique of Artificial Periodization**
    - Pannenberg rejects rigid divisions of history into dispensations.
    - He sees such schemes as undermining the unity of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The continuity of God’s action is more important than external epochs.
    - Theological categories must reflect the wholeness of God’s revelation.
    - "The separation of salvation history into unrelated epochs is foreign to the biblical witness." (Basic Questions in Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s insistence on the **unity of salvation history** and his **Christocentric** reading of Scripture have provided a robust alternative to both dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism. His work has influenced ecumenical dialogue and challenged theologians to ground their understanding of the covenants in the historical reality of Christ’s resurrection. While not directly engaging with these evangelical systems, Pannenberg’s theology remains a significant resource for those seeking a holistic, historically grounded account of God’s dealings with humanity.
