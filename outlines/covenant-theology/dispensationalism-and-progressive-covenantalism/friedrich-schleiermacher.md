# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher did not directly address **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, as these frameworks developed after his time. However, his approach to **biblical revelation**, the **unity of Scripture**, and the **development of Christian doctrine** laid groundwork that influenced later discussions about the relationship between the **Old and New Testaments**. Schleiermacher emphasized the organic continuity of **Christian faith** and the centrality of **Christ** in interpreting the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christian Ethics
- Hermeneutics: The Handwritten Manuscripts

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Scripture reveals a unified, developing understanding of **God’s self-disclosure**.
    - Emphasizes the continuity between the **Old and New Testaments**.
    - Rejects sharp divisions in redemptive history, favoring a progressive unfolding.
    - Christ is the interpretive center of all revelation.
    - "The Old Testament is related to the New as the promise to the fulfillment." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Centrality of Christ**
    - Christ is the culmination and key to understanding all of **biblical history**.
    - All doctrines and covenants are interpreted through the person and work of Christ.
    - The unity of the church is grounded in the **redemptive work of Christ**.
    - Christ’s consciousness of God is the model for Christian faith.
    - "All doctrines must be related to the redemption accomplished by Christ." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Development of Doctrine**
    - Doctrine evolves as the church reflects on the meaning of revelation.
    - Theological systems must account for historical and cultural development.
    - Emphasizes the living, dynamic nature of **Christian doctrine**.
    - Rejects static or purely propositional approaches to theology.
    - "Doctrine is the result of reflection upon the Christian religious consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Religious Experience as Foundation**
    - True religion is rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence on God.
    - The **covenantal relationship** is experienced inwardly, not merely externally.
    - Emphasizes the subjective appropriation of God’s promises.
    - The church is the community of shared religious experience.
    - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing but a feeling." (On Religion)

5. **Hermeneutical Emphasis**
    - Interpretation of Scripture must consider historical context and the unity of the text.
    - Advocates for a **historical-critical** approach to biblical interpretation.
    - The meaning of covenants and dispensations is discerned through careful exegesis.
    - The interpreter must seek the intention of the biblical authors within the whole of Christian faith.
    - "Understanding is the reconstruction of the original experience of the author." (Hermeneutics)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s emphasis on the **organic unity of revelation** and the centrality of Christ influenced later theological approaches to the relationship between the **Old and New Testaments**. While he did not develop **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, his thought provided resources for understanding the continuity and development of **redemptive history**. His focus on religious experience and hermeneutics shaped modern theology and set the stage for future debates about the structure of biblical covenants and dispensations.
