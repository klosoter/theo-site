# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner did not directly engage with **Dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, but his theology of **revelation**, **salvation history**, and the **unity of the covenants** offers a critical alternative to these frameworks. Rahner emphasized the continuity of **God’s self-communication** throughout history, rejecting sharp divisions in the divine economy and instead advocating for a unified, Christocentric understanding of **salvation history**.

- "The history of salvation is the history of God’s self-communication to humanity." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Hearer of the Word
- Revelation and Tradition (with Joseph Ratzinger)
- The Shape of the Church to Come

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Salvation History**
   - Rejects strict periodization of history into unrelated dispensations.
   - Emphasizes the single, unfolding narrative of **God’s self-revelation**.
   - Sees all covenants as oriented toward and fulfilled in **Christ**.
   - Argues that the Old and New Testaments are inseparable in the economy of salvation.
   - "The Old and New Testaments are not two histories, but one history of God with humanity." (Theological Investigations)

2. **Transcendental Revelation**
   - Revelation is not limited to discrete epochs but is a continuous, existential reality.
   - God’s self-communication is universally accessible, not confined to specific dispensations.
   - The human subject is always addressed by God’s offer of grace.
   - Revelation culminates in Christ but is operative throughout all history.
   - "God’s self-communication is the permanent ground of all revelation." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - All previous covenants and revelations find their fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is the center and goal of all salvation history, not merely a new dispensation.
   - The meaning of Israel and the Church is interpreted through the person and work of Christ.
   - The unity of the covenants is realized in the incarnation.
   - "Christ is the absolute and unsurpassable self-communication of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

4. **Rejection of Dispensationalism**
   - Critiques any theology that divides history into unrelated dispensations with different means of salvation.
   - Argues that such divisions undermine the unity of God’s salvific will.
   - Maintains that grace is operative throughout all periods, not just the New Testament era.
   - Emphasizes the continuity of the people of God across both Testaments.
   - "There is only one salvific will of God, operative throughout all ages." (Theological Investigations)

5. **Dynamic Understanding of Covenant**
   - Views covenant as a dynamic, relational reality rather than a static legal arrangement.
   - The covenant is God’s ongoing invitation to relationship, not merely a series of contracts.
   - The Church participates in the one covenant established and fulfilled in Christ.
   - The Spirit actualizes the covenant in the life of believers across all times.
   - "The covenant is the form of God’s self-giving to humanity in history." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s theology challenged the **dispensationalist** tendency to fragment salvation history and provided a robust alternative grounded in the unity of **revelation** and **covenant**. His influence shaped post-Vatican II Catholic thought, especially in its approach to **biblical theology** and the relationship between Israel and the Church. Rahner’s emphasis on the continuity of God’s salvific action remains a significant resource for ecumenical dialogue and contemporary covenantal theology.
