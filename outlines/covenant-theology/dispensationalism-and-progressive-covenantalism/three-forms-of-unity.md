# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed covenant theology** that stands in contrast to both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. These confessions emphasize the unity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history, rejecting sharp discontinuities between Israel and the church and affirming the continuity of God’s redemptive purposes in Christ.

- "We believe that all the time, from the fall of Adam to the end of the world, the whole church has existed and will exist in this world, that is, a community chosen for eternal life and united in true faith." (Belgic Confession, Article 27)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 16, 22, 27, and 34
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 19, 54, 74, and 80
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–V
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis by Lyle D. Bierma

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Asserts one overarching **covenant of grace** from Genesis to Revelation.
    - Denies a radical separation between Old and New Testament peoples of God.
    - Sees Christ as the center and fulfillment of all covenant promises.
    - Emphasizes the inclusion of believers and their children in the covenant community.
    - "This holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the whole world, even though for a time it may appear very small." (Belgic Confession, Article 27)

2. **Continuity of the People of God**
    - Identifies the church as the true Israel, united by faith in Christ.
    - Rejects the notion of two separate redemptive peoples (Israel and the church).
    - Affirms the ongoing validity of Old Testament promises in the New Covenant.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are seen as covenant signs for the one people of God.
    - "For since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant and church of God, and since both redemption from sin and the Holy Spirit…are promised to them no less than to the adult..." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q74)

3. **Typology and Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Old Testament types and ceremonies are fulfilled, not abolished, in Christ.
    - The ceremonial law pointed forward to Christ and is now obsolete.
    - Moral law remains binding as a rule of gratitude for believers.
    - Christ is the substance to which all shadows pointed.
    - "The ceremonies and symbols of the law have ceased with the coming of Christ, and all the shadows are fulfilled." (Belgic Confession, Article 25)

4. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Denies multiple, fundamentally distinct dispensations with separate redemptive programs.
    - Opposes a future earthly millennium distinct from the present reign of Christ.
    - Sees the church as the continuation, not interruption, of God’s covenant people.
    - Emphasizes the one way of salvation by faith alone throughout history.
    - "We believe that through faith in Jesus Christ we are justified, apart from works of the law." (Belgic Confession, Article 22)

5. **Sacraments as Signs and Seals of the Covenant**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace for the covenant community.
    - Both sacraments signify and seal the promises of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Children of believers are included in the covenant and receive baptism.
    - The sacraments underscore the unity of God’s people across the ages.
    - "Baptism is to children of believers as well as to adults, for they are included in the covenant and people of God." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q74)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped the identity and theology of Reformed churches worldwide, providing a robust confessional alternative to both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism**. Their emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the continuity of the church as the true Israel has influenced generations of theologians and ecclesiastical practice. These confessions continue to serve as a theological anchor for Reformed communities, distinguishing their covenantal framework from later evangelical developments.
