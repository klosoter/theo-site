# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for his development of **biblical theology** within the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the organic unity and progressive unfolding of **redemptive history**. While not directly engaging with **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism** as later defined, Vos’s work provides a foundational critique of **artificial periodization** and underscores the continuity of the **covenant of grace** throughout Scripture.

- "The history of redemption is the warp and woof of the Scriptures." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Pauline Eschatology
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- Reformed Dogmatics
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (ed. Richard B. Gaffin, Jr.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Scripture reveals a single, unified **history of redemption** centered on Christ.
    - Rejects sharp discontinuities between **Old and New Testaments**.
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of **God’s covenant purposes** through historical progression.
    - Views typology as integral, not merely illustrative, to biblical revelation.
    - "Revelation is not an isolated deposit, but a living, organic process." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Critique of Artificial Dispensational Schemes**
    - Opposes dividing history into unrelated **dispensations** with distinct divine economies.
    - Argues that such schemes undermine the unity of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Maintains that the promises to Israel find fulfillment in Christ and the church.
    - Sees **dispensationalism** as foreign to the biblical pattern of promise and fulfillment.
    - "The Reformed view recognizes but one covenant of grace running through all dispensations." (Reformed Dogmatics)

3. **Centrality of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is the backbone of biblical history.
    - All administrations (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) are unified in purpose.
    - Christ is the mediator and fulfillment of the covenant throughout redemptive history.
    - The church is the eschatological community inheriting the promises.
    - "The covenant is the form in which the relation between God and His people is embodied." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Progressive Revelation**
    - Revelation unfolds progressively, not in static or repetitive cycles.
    - Later revelation builds organically on earlier stages, culminating in Christ.
    - Typology and prophecy point forward to their fulfillment in the New Covenant.
    - Rejects the notion of radical new beginnings with each biblical epoch.
    - "The later stages of revelation are organically connected with the earlier." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Kingdom of God as Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The **kingdom of God** is central to both Old and New Testaments.
    - The kingdom arrives in Christ, fulfilling all previous covenantal promises.
    - Eschatology is not merely future but is inaugurated in Christ’s first coming.
    - The church is the present manifestation of the eschatological people of God.
    - "The kingdom is the highest good, the supreme end of all history." (The Teaching of Jesus)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s biblical-theological method has profoundly shaped Reformed responses to **dispensationalism**, providing a robust framework for understanding the unity and progression of **redemptive history**. His emphasis on the **covenant of grace** and organic development of revelation laid the groundwork for later critiques of both dispensational and progressive covenantal approaches. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of biblical theology, covenant, and eschatology.
