# C.I. Scofield (1843–1921)

C.I. Scofield was a leading advocate of **dispensationalism**, emphasizing a strict distinction between **Israel and the Church** and a literal approach to **biblical prophecy**. He systematized the concept of **successive dispensations** in salvation history, each marked by a unique divine arrangement, and rejected **covenant theology** as insufficiently attentive to these distinctions.

- "Not only are there several dispensations, but also the Church is not Israel, and the promises to Israel are not fulfilled in the Church." (Scofield Reference Bible, Introduction)

## Key Works

- The Scofield Reference Bible (1909, 1917 editions)
- Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth (1888)
- What Do the Prophets Say? (1918)
- Addresses on Prophecy (compiled sermons and lectures)
- The Bible: Its Structure and Purpose (various pamphlets)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinct Dispensations in Redemptive History**
    - Divides history into seven **dispensations**, each with a unique test and revelation.
    - Each dispensation ends in human failure and divine judgment.
    - Emphasizes God’s progressive revelation and administration.
    - Sees dispensations as hermeneutically necessary for understanding Scripture.
    "A dispensation is a period of time during which man is tested in respect to obedience to some specific revelation of the will of God." (Scofield Reference Bible, Introduction)

2. **Israel and the Church Are Distinct**
    - Maintains a sharp distinction between **national Israel** and the **New Testament Church**.
    - Promises to Israel (land, kingdom) are not transferred to the Church.
    - The Church is a "parenthesis" in God’s plan for Israel.
    - Eschatological fulfillment for Israel remains future and literal.
    "The promises made to Israel are not fulfilled in the Church, but await the coming kingdom." (Scofield Reference Bible, note on Matthew 6:10)

3. **Literal Fulfillment of Prophecy**
    - Advocates for a **literal, grammatical-historical** interpretation of prophecy.
    - Rejects spiritualizing or allegorizing Old Testament promises.
    - Expects a literal millennium and restoration of Israel.
    - Sees prophetic fulfillment as validating dispensational distinctions.
    "Prophecy must be interpreted literally, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise." (Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth)

4. **Rejection of Covenant Theology**
    - Argues that **covenant theology** blurs biblical distinctions.
    - Critiques the idea of a single, overarching covenant of grace.
    - Sees covenants as real but subordinate to dispensational structure.
    - Emphasizes the inadequacy of covenantal frameworks for prophecy.
    "Covenant theology... fails to observe the dispensational divisions of the Word." (Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth)

5. **Pretribulational Premillennialism**
    - Teaches a **pretribulational rapture** of the Church.
    - The tribulation is for Israel, not the Church.
    - Christ’s second coming inaugurates the literal millennium.
    - The Church reigns with Christ, but Israel receives national promises.
    "The Church will be caught up before the tribulation, and Israel will pass through it." (Scofield Reference Bible, note on 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17)

## Legacy and Impact

Scofield’s **dispensationalism** profoundly shaped American evangelicalism, especially through the widespread influence of the Scofield Reference Bible. His system provided a framework for interpreting prophecy and understanding the relationship between Israel and the Church, fueling the rise of **premillennialism** and popular prophecy conferences. While later developments such as **progressive covenantalism** have challenged his sharp distinctions, Scofield’s legacy endures in many conservative and fundamentalist circles. His work remains a touchstone for debates over biblical interpretation and the structure of redemptive history.
