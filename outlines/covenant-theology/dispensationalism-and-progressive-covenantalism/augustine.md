# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not articulate a system of **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism** as later developed, but his theology of **redemptive history** and the **unity of the covenants** profoundly shaped subsequent Christian thought. He emphasized the continuity of **God’s plan of salvation** across the Old and New Testaments, interpreting the covenants as unfolding stages in the singular work of **divine grace** culminating in Christ.

- "The Old Testament is fully revealed in the New, and the New is hidden in the Old." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On Christian Doctrine
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- Tractates on the Gospel of John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenants**
    - Augustine taught that the **Old and New Covenants** are two phases of a single divine plan.
    - He saw the **promises to Israel** as fulfilled spiritually in the Church.
    - The **Law and the Gospel** are not opposed but are successive revelations of God’s grace.
    - Typology is central: Old Testament realities prefigure New Testament fulfillment.
    - "In the Old the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Questions on the Heptateuch)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Redemptive History**
    - Christ is the center and goal of all **biblical covenants**.
    - All previous dispensations find their meaning in the incarnation and work of Christ.
    - The Church, as the body of Christ, inherits the promises made to Israel.
    - Augustine rejected any sharp division between Israel and the Church.
    - "All things in the Old Testament point to Christ." (The City of God)

3. **Spiritual Interpretation of Israel**
    - Augustine interpreted **Israel** and its promises primarily in spiritual, not ethnic or national, terms.
    - The Church is the true Israel, the community of the redeemed.
    - Earthly Jerusalem is a type of the heavenly city, the **Civitas Dei**.
    - The fulfillment of prophecy is found in the spiritual realities inaugurated by Christ.
    - "The Church is the true seed of Abraham." (The City of God)

4. **Progressive Revelation**
    - Augustine affirmed that God’s revelation unfolds progressively through history.
    - Each covenant builds upon and clarifies the previous, culminating in Christ.
    - The Law was preparatory, leading to the fullness of grace in the Gospel.
    - The unity of Scripture is maintained through the progressive unveiling of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - "God dispensed His grace in various ways through the ages." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

5. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Augustine did not recognize distinct, unrelated dispensations with separate divine purposes.
    - He opposed any notion of a future, earthly reign for ethnic Israel apart from the Church.
    - The eschatological hope is realized in the **heavenly city**, not a restored earthly kingdom.
    - Salvation history is a single, unified drama centered on Christ and His Church.
    - "The kingdom of God is not of this world, but of the world to come." (The City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology decisively shaped the **Western Christian understanding of covenant** and the unity of redemptive history, providing a foundation for later **Reformed covenant theology** and influencing the critique of dispensationalism. His spiritual interpretation of Israel and emphasis on the Church as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises became standard in both Catholic and Protestant traditions. While he did not anticipate progressive covenantalism, his thought laid groundwork for viewing the covenants as organically related stages in God’s singular plan of salvation.
