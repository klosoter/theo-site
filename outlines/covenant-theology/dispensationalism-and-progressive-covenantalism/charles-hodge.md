# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Old Princeton Theology**, did not directly engage with later systems such as **dispensationalism** or **progressive covenantalism**, but his robust articulation of **covenant theology** laid foundational critiques of emerging dispensational thought. Hodge emphasized the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout Scripture, contrasting with the sharp distinctions of dispensationalism and anticipating some concerns addressed by progressive covenantalism.

- "The plan of salvation has always been the same; it has always been by grace, through faith, founded on the blood of Christ." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on covenant theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - Hodge maintained that the **covenant of grace** spans both Old and New Testaments.
   - He rejected the notion of radically distinct dispensations with different means of salvation.
   - Emphasized continuity in God’s redemptive plan centered on Christ.
   - Saw the church as one people of God across all ages.
   - "The plan of salvation has always been the same; it has always been by grace, through faith, founded on the blood of Christ." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Critique of Dispensational Distinctions**
   - Hodge opposed dividing history into unrelated dispensations with separate redemptive economies.
   - He argued that such divisions undermine the unity of Scripture and the gospel.
   - Saw the promises to Israel as fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
   - Emphasized typology and fulfillment rather than literalistic separation.
   - "The Church under the old dispensation was the same as the Church under the new." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Organic Progression of Revelation**
   - Affirmed that revelation unfolds progressively but organically, not in disconnected epochs.
   - Each stage of revelation builds upon the previous, culminating in Christ.
   - The Old Testament is preparatory and anticipatory of the New.
   - Rejected the idea that God’s purposes change between dispensations.
   - "The old dispensation was preparatory, the new is consummative." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Centrality of Christ in All Scripture**
   - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all biblical covenants.
   - Both Old and New Testament saints are saved through Christ alone.
   - The promises to Abraham and David find their ultimate realization in Jesus.
   - The unity of salvation history is grounded in the person and work of Christ.
   - "The whole plan of redemption is founded on Christ and terminates in Him." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Reformed Hermeneutic and Ecclesiology**
   - Advocated a **Reformed hermeneutic** that sees the church as the true Israel.
   - Opposed the dispensational separation of Israel and the church.
   - Emphasized the sacraments as signs and seals of the one covenant of grace.
   - Upheld the continuity of God’s people and the means of grace.
   - "The Church is one under all dispensations, and the sacraments are its divinely appointed seals." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s defense of **covenant theology** provided a systematic alternative to the later rise of dispensationalism, shaping Reformed responses to its distinctive doctrines. His insistence on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the organic progression of revelation influenced both confessional Presbyterianism and modern discussions of **progressive covenantalism**. While he did not directly address these later systems, his work remains a touchstone for evaluating the continuity and discontinuity in redemptive history. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the relationship between Israel, the church, and the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
