# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **Dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism** from a distinctly **Reformed** and **presuppositional** perspective, emphasizing the unity of **God’s redemptive plan** and the centrality of **covenant theology**. He critiques traditional Dispensationalism for its sharp distinctions between Israel and the church, while appreciating progressive covenantalism’s attempt to maintain biblical continuity without collapsing all distinctions.

- "The unity of God’s plan is a central theme of Scripture, and any theological system must do justice to that unity." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Covenant and Dispensational Theologies" (article in Perspectives on the Christian Life)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Unifying Principle**
    - Argues that **covenant** is the primary structure for understanding Scripture’s unity.
    - Sees all of redemptive history as unfolding through successive, organically related covenants.
    - Rejects the sharp Israel-church dichotomy of classic Dispensationalism.
    - Affirms that the **new covenant** fulfills and transforms previous covenants.
    - "Covenant is the central biblical category for understanding God’s relationship with his people." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Critique of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Challenges the rigid separation between Israel and the church.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of God’s people across redemptive history.
    - Argues that promises to Israel find their fulfillment in Christ and the church.
    - Views the church as the true heir of Old Testament promises.
    - "The church is not a parenthesis in God’s plan, but its fulfillment." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Appreciation for Progressive Covenantalism**
    - Recognizes progressive covenantalism’s effort to balance continuity and discontinuity.
    - Affirms the unfolding nature of biblical covenants culminating in Christ.
    - Appreciates the emphasis on Christocentric fulfillment of Old Testament promises.
    - Sees value in avoiding both Dispensational and traditional covenantal extremes.
    - "Progressive covenantalism rightly seeks to honor both the unity and diversity of God’s redemptive work." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Presuppositional Hermeneutics**
    - Applies a **presuppositional** approach to biblical interpretation.
    - Insists that theological systems must be judged by Scripture, not vice versa.
    - Critiques Dispensationalism for imposing external frameworks on the text.
    - Stresses the necessity of interpreting all Scripture through the lens of Christ.
    - "Our theology must always be subject to the authority of Scripture itself." (The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God)

5. **Christ as the Center of Redemptive History**
    - Asserts that all covenants and dispensations point to Christ.
    - Maintains that Christ fulfills the promises to both Israel and the nations.
    - Argues that the church’s identity is rooted in union with Christ, not ethnicity.
    - Emphasizes the eschatological unity of God’s people in Christ.
    - "Jesus is the center and goal of all God’s covenants." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s engagement with **Dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism** has shaped contemporary Reformed thought by insisting on the primacy of **covenant theology** and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture. His critiques have encouraged greater theological clarity and biblical fidelity in discussions of redemptive history. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a robust, Christ-centered approach to biblical theology.
