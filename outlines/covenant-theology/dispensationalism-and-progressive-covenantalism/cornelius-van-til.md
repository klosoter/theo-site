# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til critiqued both **dispensationalism** and **progressive covenantalism** from the standpoint of **Reformed covenant theology** and **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the unity of **God’s redemptive plan** and the antithesis between **covenant continuity** and any system that divides redemptive history into unrelated epochs or diminishes the organic unity of Scripture. Van Til’s approach insists that all theological systems must be evaluated by their fidelity to the **self-attesting revelation of God** in Scripture.

- "The covenant idea is basic to the whole of Scripture and therefore to all true theology." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Unifying Principle of Scripture**
    - The **covenant** is central to understanding all of redemptive history.
    - Dispensationalism fragments Scripture by positing unrelated dispensations.
    - Progressive covenantalism, while an improvement, still lacks the full organic unity of classic Reformed covenant theology.
    - The **covenant of grace** encompasses all of God’s dealings with His people.
    - "The Reformed faith sees the covenant as the very warp and woof of revelation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Critique of Dispensationalism’s Hermeneutic**
    - Dispensationalism’s literalistic hermeneutic undermines the typological and Christocentric unity of Scripture.
    - It introduces a dualism between Israel and the Church, contrary to the one people of God.
    - Such a system fails to recognize the **organic progression** of revelation.
    - Dispensationalism is inconsistent with the presuppositional necessity of a unified worldview.
    - "The dispensationalist fails to see the unity of the covenant and thus the unity of the people of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Presuppositional Evaluation of Theological Systems**
    - All theological systems must be critiqued at the level of presuppositions.
    - Dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism both reflect non-Reformed starting points.
    - Only a consistently Reformed, covenantal presupposition does justice to the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in covenantal categories.
    - "We must challenge the very foundations of any system not built on the self-attesting Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Redemptive history unfolds organically, not in disconnected epochs.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** provide the proper structure for biblical history.
    - Progressive covenantalism moves toward this unity but stops short of the Reformed position.
    - The unity of the testaments is essential for a Christian worldview.
    - "The history of redemption is the history of the unfolding of the one covenant of grace." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Primacy of the Self-Attesting Revelation of God**
    - Scripture is the ultimate authority and interprets itself.
    - Dispensationalism’s external criteria for interpretation undermine biblical authority.
    - Progressive covenantalism must be measured by its submission to the self-attesting Word.
    - True theology arises from the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit to the covenantal Word.
    - "The Bible must be its own interpreter, and the covenant is its own context." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s critique of **dispensationalism** and his insistence on the **covenant as the organizing principle** of theology have profoundly shaped Reformed responses to alternative evangelical systems. His presuppositional approach has influenced generations of theologians to evaluate all theological constructs by their foundational commitments. While progressive covenantalism has sought to address some of the weaknesses of dispensationalism, Van Til’s legacy remains a benchmark for assessing the unity and authority of Scripture within the Reformed tradition.
