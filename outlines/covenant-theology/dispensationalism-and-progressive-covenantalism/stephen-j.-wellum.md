# Stephen J. Wellum (1966– )

Stephen J. Wellum is a leading advocate of **progressive covenantalism**, a mediating position between **dispensationalism** and **covenant theology**. He emphasizes the centrality of the **biblical covenants** in understanding **redemptive history**, arguing that Christ is the fulfillment of all God’s promises, while maintaining both continuity and progression in the unfolding of Scripture.

- "Progressive covenantalism argues that the Bible’s own covenantal structure is the key to understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Peter J. Gentry)
- Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenant Theologies (editor)
- "Baptism and the Relationship between the Covenants" in Believer’s Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ
- "The New Covenant Work of Christ: Priesthood, Atonement, and Intercession" in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Covenants**
    - Christ is the center and goal of all **biblical covenants**.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - Rejects the sharp Israel-church distinction of classic **dispensationalism**.
    - Sees the **new covenant** as the climactic fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan.
    "All of God’s promises find their ‘Yes’ in Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Progressive Revelation of the Covenants**
    - The covenants unfold progressively, revealing God’s plan in stages.
    - Each covenant builds upon and clarifies the previous ones.
    - The unity of the **biblical storyline** is maintained without flattening distinctions.
    - The Old Testament covenants are preparatory and typological, pointing to Christ.
    "The covenants are the backbone of the storyline of Scripture." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **Rejection of Dispensational Distinctions**
    - Denies a strict separation between Israel and the church.
    - Argues against multiple peoples of God or separate redemptive plans.
    - Sees the church as the eschatological people of God, rooted in the **new covenant**.
    - Emphasizes continuity in God’s redemptive purposes across the covenants.
    "There is only one people of God, united in Christ." (Progressive Covenantalism)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament types (e.g., land, temple, sacrifices) are fulfilled in Christ.
    - Typological patterns are real, historical, and divinely intended.
    - The **new covenant** brings the reality to which the types pointed.
    - Fulfillment is both already and not yet, inaugurated in Christ and consummated at his return.
    "The types and shadows of the Old Testament find their substance in Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

5. **Baptism and the New Covenant Community**
    - Baptism is reserved for those who are part of the new covenant by faith.
    - The new covenant community is regenerate, unlike the mixed community of previous covenants.
    - Rejects infant baptism as inconsistent with new covenant realities.
    - Emphasizes believer’s baptism as the sign of new covenant membership.
    "Only those who have faith in Christ are members of the new covenant community." (Believer’s Baptism)

## Legacy and Impact

Stephen Wellum’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **biblical theology** and the relationship between the Testaments. His articulation of **progressive covenantalism** provides a robust alternative to both dispensationalism and traditional covenant theology, influencing pastors, scholars, and students in evangelical circles. Wellum’s emphasis on Christ as the fulfillment of all God’s promises has helped clarify the unity and diversity of the biblical covenants for a new generation of theologians.
