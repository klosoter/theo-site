### TITLE
One people or two? Israel, the covenants, and the kingdom between dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: whether Scripture discloses one unified people and plan of God across the covenants or two parallel peoples and programs, and how **canonical typology**, **grammatical-historical** exegesis, and **inaugurated eschatology** adjudicate that question.
- Decisive figures: John Nelson Darby, Charles Ryrie, Craig Blaising, Peter Gentry, Stephen Wellum, Meredith Kline.
- Relevant traditions: Dispensationalism and its progressive reformulation, progressive covenantalism and its new-covenant antecedents, Reformed **federal theology** with Klinean biblical-theological development.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: classical vs progressive dispensationalism on **Israel–church distinction**; within progressive covenantalism on law, baptism, land; within Reformed covenantalism on republication and typology.
  - External: Reformed **federal theology** versus both dispensational and progressive covenantal frameworks.
  - Contemporary: modern Israel and political theology, Messianic Judaism, hermeneutics of the New Testament’s use of the Old Testament, Revelation 20 and millennial expectations.
- Position defended: one plan and one people of God in Christ; land and temple promises find typological fulfillment in the new covenant and new creation; progressive covenantalism offers gains over dispensationalism but lacks the dogmatic coherence of classic **federal theology**, which better secures ecclesiology, sacramentology, and the moral law.

### ESSAY
The dispute between dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism turns on a single pressure point: does Scripture teach a single people and plan of God realized across successive covenants culminating in Christ, or does it teach two peoples with parallel divine programs, an earthly Israel and a heavenly church, administered in discrete economies? Under that pressure point lie the hermeneutical engines that drive each system: how one construes the **grammatical-historical** sense, the status and reach of **canonical typology**, and the structure of biblical covenants as they bear on the **kingdom**, the **new covenant**, and the **Israel–church distinction**. The stakes are doctrinal, not only biblical-theological. Ecclesiology, sacramentology, and eschatology are either interlocked with or unmoored from **federal theology** depending on where one stands on these questions.

John Nelson Darby is the seminal architect of dispensationalism’s modern contours. Emerging from the Plymouth Brethren in the nineteenth century, Darby assembled a reading of Scripture divided into distinct dispensations, each a mode of divine administration with its own test of obedience and consequent judgment. His signature reconfiguration lies in a strict **Israel–church distinction** and a two-track eschatology in which the church is raptured before a resumed Jewish program that climaxes in an earthly millennial kingdom. Though Darby’s corpus does not offer a single systematic treatise, his collected writings and wide preaching cast the imaginative template that made its way into American evangelicalism through the Scofield Reference Bible and later through Dallas Theological Seminary. Darby’s hermeneutical instincts prized a consistent literal reading of prophetic promises such that Old Testament land and temple expectations must be realized for national Israel in earthbound history. That insistence made sense within a broader resistance to allegory and a desire to protect the integrity of God’s word to Israel. Yet precisely those instincts enshrined what would become the sine qua non of the school: a nonnegotiable separation of Israel and church, the necessity of a future geo-political realization of Abrahamic and Davidic promises for ethnic Israel, and pretribulational premillennialism as the eschatological mechanism to secure it.

Charles Ryrie served as the modern systematizer of this vision. In Dispensationalism Today and its later revision, he formalized the three sine qua non: a strict Israel–church distinction, a consistently literal hermeneutic, and a doxological unifying purpose of God. Ryrie’s second plank makes or breaks the first. He argued that if the church fulfills Israel’s promises through typology or rereading in light of Christ, then literal interpretation has been swapped for spiritualization. The result would be a different Bible and a collapse of the dispensational framework. Ryrie anticipated the obvious rejoinder that the New Testament itself seems to reread the Old and replied that such a shift is apparent rather than real. He styled New Testament uses of the Old as illustrations rather than alterations of meaning and pressed that complementary revelation never recasts earlier promise. Under examination, this move exposes the heart of the hermeneutical tension: whether Christ constitutes the canonical horizon that gives the earlier text its proper literal sense within the canon, or whether the earlier text’s own historical horizon sets a meaning that cannot be reshaped without violating authorial intent.

Progressive dispensationalism arose when Craig Blaising and Darrell Bock conceded that Ryrie’s hermeneutic could not bear the weight of the New Testament’s own exegesis. In Progressive Dispensationalism, Blaising proposed a “complementary hermeneutics” in which the New Testament does not cancel the Old Testament’s promises but expands and partially realizes them in an already-not-yet pattern. Thus the Davidic covenant finds present realization in Christ’s heavenly session while reserving a consummate earthly expression. The church participates in spiritual blessings of the new covenant while national Israel enjoys a future role in an earthly millennial phase of the one kingdom. This is a crucial reformulation. Blaising keeps a future for ethnic Israel and retains a form of premillennialism, but he rejects the rigid two-program schema that fueled the older system’s parenthesis ecclesiology. Methodologically, he embraces **inaugurated eschatology**, recognizing that the New Testament locates the kingdom’s arrival in Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension, and that the Spirit’s outpouring signals that the age to come has burst into the present. Theologically, he tries to secure both continuity and discontinuity without collapsing either side: continuity in one redemptive plan and one kingdom under the Messiah, discontinuity in the historical administration of covenant blessings and the specific role of Israel in the consummation.

Blaising’s move is decisive because it accepts the canon’s Christological pressure while trying to preserve a future national Israel distinct from the church without retreating to two peoples of God. Examiners will press whether this is stable. If the Davidic Son now reigns and the new covenant is inaugurated, why is a separate administrative allotment for national Israel necessary except to satisfy a certain reading of land promises? Blaising answers that complementary hermeneutics adds but does not cancel; unfulfilled aspects await completion. The rejoinder is twofold. First, the New Testament’s appropriation of land and temple idioms to Christ and the church appears not to be mere additive but transformative. Hebrews locates the true rest as heavenly and identifies the promised inheritance with the world to come, not Canaan narrowly. Second, the argument that national Israel must play a discrete covenantal role, even if within one people of God, bends toward the earlier sine qua non and reintroduces the duality that progressive dispensationalism sought to purge. The tension is evident in debates over whether there is one new covenant applied in two phases or two new covenants. Progressive dispensationalists generally affirm one new covenant, but their hesitation to name the church as the eschatological Israel illumines the lingering gravitational pull.

Progressive covenantalism enters as both correction and alternative. Peter Gentry’s linguistic and intertextual competence and Stephen Wellum’s dogmatic instincts, on display in Kingdom through Covenant and its popular distillation, argue that the covenants progressively reveal and realize God’s single plan in Christ. They reject the superstructure of classic **federal theology** that frames redemptive history under a prelapsarian covenant of works and a postlapsarian covenant of grace, but they also reject the dispensational fragmentation of people and plan. The theological center is Christ the mediator of the **new covenant**, the true seed of Abraham and David whose priest-king office unites promises under a single reality. Methodologically, they elevate **canonical typology** as the God-given way creation, Adam, Israel, land, temple, and king form a pattern that escalates and culminates in Christ and his church. Typology is not allegory because it is historical and authorially embedded by divine intention. The problem they seek to solve is how to affirm deep continuity of promise while also affirming real discontinuity in covenant administration, especially regarding the people-sign complex of circumcision and baptism and the composition of the covenant community.

Wellum’s detailed development is especially decisive for evangelical readers. He contends that the old and new covenants differ in kind regarding membership and structure. Circumcision marked a mixed community that included believers and unbelievers in a typological nation ordered to Christ, whereas the new covenant is new in efficacy and scope, conferring the Spirit such that all members know the Lord. For him, Jeremiah 31 must be taken in its own confessed cadence: the new covenant is unlike the old such that circumcision-baptism continuity fails, and the church is a regenerate community marked by believer’s baptism. He further argues that the land promise is fulfilled not by a future national allotment but by the new creation, with Christ as the locus of temple and land. This draws on Gentry’s work in seeing how the royal grant and suzerain treaty forms frame the covenants and how prophetic promises expand to encompass the whole world. Against dispensationalism he contends that Abraham’s seed promise is Christological and ecclesiological in Galatians 3, that Ephesians 2 names one new humanity in place of the two, and that Acts 15 identifies Amos’s rebuilt Davidic tent with the multinational church gathered by the risen Christ. Against classic Reformed formulations he questions whether the covenant of works or a single covenant of grace is textually warranted, arguing instead that the covenants themselves, progressively and historically, provide the canonical architecture.

At this point, the Reformed Klinean trajectory supplies a crucial counterweight and resource. Meredith Kline’s Treaty of the Great King, By Oath Consigned, and Kingdom Prologue married **federal theology** to rigorous biblical theology. Kline argued that Sinai recapitulates a works principle at the typological level, a republication not for eternal salvation but for Israel’s tenure in the land. That is, the Mosaic covenant embeds a law-for-land schema that functions as an intrusion of the eschatological judgment into history. This allows Kline to maintain the Reformed law-gospel distinction while affirming what Gentry and Wellum emphasize, namely, the typological shape of Israel’s national life. It also explains the conditional and temporary character of the land promise such that its failure drives toward the need for a better covenant with a better mediator. For Kline, the true and final land is the new creation secured by Christ under the covenant of grace, and the typological theocracy of Israel is intentionally provisional. Kline thus gives a principled basis for strong **land typology** while integrating it within a robust doctrinal framework that includes the moral law, the visible-invisible church distinction, and sacramental continuity in sign and thing signified. He also secures one people of God across administrations without importing two parallel peoples or abandoning a prelapsarian covenantal frame that secures Adamic headship and Christ’s obedience as last Adam.

Bringing these figures into direct contest clarifies the internal, external, and contemporary debates at stake. Internally, dispensationalism fractured precisely at the hermeneutical fulcrum. The classical insistence on a consistently literal hermeneutic could not easily account for the New Testament’s appropriation of Old Testament promises in Christ. Progressive dispensationalists rightly perceived that an entirely futurist, national frame for Davidic and new covenant fulfillment misreads apostolic testimony. Yet their retention of a distinctive future for national Israel risks reconstructing the very dualism they sought to move beyond. The ongoing debate within that camp over the present reign of Christ on David’s throne exposes the fragility of a framework that must say already and not yet without collapsing either into realized ecclesiology or deferral to a millennial Israel-first phase. Progressive covenantalism’s internal debates concern the law and the church. If the decalogue’s covenant form is specifically Mosaic and thus transcended in Christ, what normative anchor secures Christian moral obligation beyond a generic appeal to the law of Christ? Wellum answers by rooting ethics in Christ’s lordship and the moral norms grounded in creation and the new covenant’s internalization. Critics reply that without the classic threefold use of the law grounded in **federal theology**, the moral life of the church risks either antinomian drift or biblicism unmoored from dogmatics. A second internal pressure concerns sacramentology. Progressive covenantalists’ credobaptist conclusion coheres with their regenerate new covenant membership. Yet examiners will press how one can deny the Reformed continuity of sign and promise from Abraham to Christ without undermining Paul’s argument in Romans 4 and Colossians 2 that ties Abrahamic faith to Christian sacramental identification. The response from Wellum’s side is that the Abrahamic covenant is fulfilled in Christ and reconfigured, not simply continued, and that the sign changes with the shift in covenant membership structure. The Reformed reply is that the thing signified remains, the promise to be God to you and your children remains in the one covenant of grace, so the sign’s recipients still include believers and their children, even if its administration shifts from a national to an ecclesial setting.

Externally, the contest with Reformed **federal theology** is decisive. Classical covenant theology articulates one covenant of grace administered variously after the fall, with the church as the expansion of Israel’s remnant and the sacraments maintaining an organic unity of sign and promise. It asserts one people of God, insists the Abrahamic promise is the charter of the gospel, and reads the land and temple through a robust **canonical typology** that is nevertheless anchored in the **grammatical-historical** sense as determined by the canon’s own final form and the divine author’s intent. It integrates eschatology with Christology and soteriology such that there is one way of salvation across the ages by grace through faith in the mediator. Kline’s refinement clarifies how the Mosaic economy can carry a works principle without contradicting grace and how that principle justifies both Israel’s exile and the typological nature of theocratic judgment. Against dispensationalism, this tradition denies two peoples of God and rejects postponement schemes that make Pentecost a parenthesis. Against progressive covenantalism, it cautions that discarding the covenant of works and a unitary covenant of grace deprives the church of doctrinal architecture that secures the law-gospel distinction, the objectivity of Christ’s active obedience, and sacramental continuity that safeguards the church’s catholicity across time.

Contemporarily, the political theology of the modern state of Israel forces the issue. Dispensationalism has often fueled Christian Zionism, mapping prophetic promises onto twentieth-century events and encouraging geopolitical stances on that basis. Progressive dispensationalists moderate this, yet retain a theological expectation for national Israel’s future role. Progressive covenantalism rejects political readings of prophecy and interprets land promise in terms of the new creation realized in Christ, thereby shifting Christian political posture from geopolitical support to gospel mission toward Jew and Gentile alike. Reformed covenant theology has similar missional implications while allowing a principled appreciation for the Jewish people’s historical vocation without conflating it with eschatological program. Examiners will test Romans 11. Does it teach a corporate, future salvation of ethnic Israel distinct from the church? The properly Reformed answer is that Paul expects a future influx of Jews into the one olive tree, not a separate redemptive structure. The partial hardening will end, and the deliverer will banish ungodliness from Jacob, but salvation will be by incorporation into Christ’s church, not by restoration of a theocracy. This allows one to affirm a future mercy for the Jews without reactivating a two-track program.

At the exegetical level, key texts anchor these choices. Jeremiah 31’s new covenant is made with the house of Israel and Judah. Does that preclude the church as beneficiary? Hebrews reads the text and applies it to the church on the logic that the church is the eschatological people of God united to the true Israelite, Christ. This is not supersession but fulfillment: the promises to Israel are realized in Israel’s Messiah and extend to the nations by union with him. Galatians 3 identifies Christ as the seed and those united to him as Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise. Ephesians 2 announces one new humanity, the dividing wall removed, a new temple built on apostolic and prophetic foundation with Christ as cornerstone. Acts 1:6’s question about restoring the kingdom to Israel receives neither a direct negation nor a timetable but a redirection to Spirit-empowered mission to the nations. Acts 15’s appeal to Amos 9 interprets the restored Davidic tent as the ingathering of the nations into Christ’s reign now. If a literal sense is to be respected, it must be the literal sense of Scripture’s final canonical form under the divine author who unites type to antitype. That is, the real literal sense is the canonical sense, and **canonical typology** is not a hermeneutical escape hatch but the Spirit’s pedagogy.

A common examiner objection is that such typology spiritualizes promises and risks collapsing the particularity of Israel into an undifferentiated ecclesial blob. The answer is to specify the levels of fulfillment. Particularity is not erased but elevated: the seed of Abraham is not dissolved into a metaphor; he is Jesus of Nazareth, son of David, whose Jewish identity is constitutive of salvation history. The twelve apostles, representing Israel’s tribes, govern the church; the gospel is to Jew first and then Gentile. The integrity of Israel’s historical role is honored precisely by locating its telos in Christ and his multinational body. Another objection concerns Revelation 20. Does amillennial or inaugurated readings bypass the millennium’s clarity, especially in light of the resurrection language and the mention of nations? The response is that apocalyptic genre and the structure of Revelation as recapitulation require reading chapter 20 in light of the whole. The first resurrection is best understood as the martyr’s vindication and the reign of souls with Christ, while the millennium functions as a symbolic depiction of the interadvent age. Nothing in Revelation 20 reintroduces two peoples of God or recovers a national land program. To insist on a premillennial earthly kingdom governed by ethnic Israel is to import a framework not demonstrable from the text when read canonically.

The position that emerges is clear. Scripture teaches one plan and one people of God in Christ, with the covenants progressively revealing and summing up that plan in the **new covenant**. Land and temple promises function as types that find their consummation in Christ and the new creation, not as separate geo-political restorations for national Israel alongside the church. Dispensationalism, in both classical and progressive forms, identified real biblical discontinuities but constructed a duality of people and program that the New Testament refuses. Progressive covenantalism rightly recovers **canonical typology** and **inaugurated eschatology** and rightly rejects a strict **Israel–church distinction**. Yet by eschewing the classic **federal theology** of covenant of works and covenant of grace, it introduces liabilities in law, sacrament, and ecclesiology that Reformed dogmatics better resolves. A Klinean Reformed approach appreciates the progressive structure of the covenants, affirms the typological republication at Sinai to explain law and land, and secures the moral law and sacramental continuity vital for the church’s life, while maintaining that all the promises of God are Yes and Amen in Christ.

This coherence matters for adjacent loci. Soteriologically, a single covenant of grace secures one way of salvation across ages and protects the necessity of Christ’s active and passive obedience under the covenant of works. Ecclesiologically, identifying the church as the eschatological Israel clarifies the church’s identity as the locus of the **kingdom’s** present manifestation, the nature of its discipline, and the scope of its mission. Sacramentally, continuity of sign and promise from Abraham to Christ grounds paedobaptism and catechesis without collapsing the need for personal faith. Ethically, the abiding validity of the moral law, grounded in creation and republished in Mosaic form, provides shape to discipleship under the law of Christ. Hermeneutically, **grammatical-historical** exegesis elevated to the canonical level protects authorial intent by honoring the divine author’s patterning across the Testaments. Examiners will ask whether this risks a Christomonistic reading that erases the human authors. The answer is that Scripture’s dual authorship ensures that Christological fulfillment is not imposed but embedded, and the New Testament’s use of the Old is the authorized exemplar of how to read the Bible with the grain of the Spirit.

Finally, the contemporary church’s witness depends on these judgments. If the church is the firstfruit of the **new creation**, then Christian political posture toward Israel and the nations is cruciform and missional, not programmatic and geopolitical. If the land and temple are in Christ, then the church is the temple where God dwells, and holy space is created by word and sacrament, not by territorial control. If one people of God spans the covenants, then the unity for which Christ prayed is dogmatically grounded and eschatologically secured, and the divisions that paralyze mission can be healed by careful attention to the covenants’ progressive unity. Dispensationalism’s pastoral strength lay in its urgency about Christ’s coming and its deep reverence for God’s fidelity to promise. Progressive covenantalism’s pastoral strength lies in its redemptive-historical clarity and Christocentric focus. Reformed **federal theology** integrates both strengths while avoiding their liabilities, offering the most theologically coherent, exegetically responsible, and ecclesially fruitful account available. This is the position to own and to defend under examination.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism are rival frameworks for relating the covenants, the **Israel–church distinction**, and the **kingdom**, with dispensationalism positing distinct economies and often two peoples, and progressive covenantalism asserting one plan fulfilled in Christ via **canonical typology** but without classic **federal theology**.
- Decisive figures:
  - John Nelson Darby: architect of strict Israel–church dualism and rapture-centered schema.
  - Charles Ryrie: formalized sine qua non of literalism, Israel–church distinction, doxological purpose.
  - Craig Blaising: progressive dispensationalism, complementary hermeneutics, inaugurated Davidic reign.
  - Peter Gentry: covenant forms and typology, land and temple expanded to new creation.
  - Stephen Wellum: Christocentric new covenant, regenerate church, credobaptism, law of Christ.
  - Meredith Kline: Reformed republication, land typology, covenant of works and grace integration.
- Debates:
  - Internal: dispensational literalism vs complementary hermeneutics; progressive covenantalism on law, baptism, land; Reformed debates on republication and typology.
  - External: Reformed **federal theology** challenges both on unity of the covenant of grace, moral law, and sacramental continuity.
  - Contemporary: modern Israel and Christian Zionism, Messianic Judaism, New Testament use of Old Testament, Revelation 20’s millennium.
- Defended position: One people and plan of God in Christ; land and temple promises fulfilled in the **new covenant** and new creation; progressive covenantalism improves on dispensationalism but the Klinean Reformed **federal theology** best secures doctrinal coherence and canonical exegesis.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does typology violate literal sense? Answer: The literal sense is the canonical sense under the divine author; typology is God-authored, historical escalation to Christ.
  - What of Romans 11 and Israel’s future? Answer: A future ingrafting of Jews into the one olive tree, not a parallel redemptive program.
  - How do you read Jeremiah 31’s “house of Israel and Judah”? Answer: Fulfilled in Israel’s Messiah and applied to his multinational body in Hebrews, not bypassing Israel but realizing Israel in Christ.
  - Does your view flatten the law? Answer: The moral law abides, grounded in creation and republished at Sinai, received under the law of Christ within the covenant of grace.
  - Why not progressive dispensationalism’s compromise? Answer: It rightly sees inaugurated fulfillment but retains a distinct national role that reintroduces dualism the New Testament dissolves in Christ.
