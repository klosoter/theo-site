# Norman Shepherd (1933–2020)

Norman Shepherd is known for his controversial role in the development of the **Federal Vision** movement and his advocacy of **monocovenantalism**, which challenges traditional distinctions between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. Shepherd emphasized the continuity of **covenant faithfulness**, integrating **faith and obedience** in the believer’s justification and sanctification, and critiqued classical Reformed formulations of **justification by faith alone** as insufficiently covenantal.

- "The covenant is one and the same throughout redemptive history, and the obligations of faith and obedience are inseparable within it." (Call of Grace, p. 50)

## Key Works

- The Call of Grace: How the Covenant Illuminates Salvation and Evangelism (2000)
- Thirty-Four Theses on Justification in Relation to Faith, Repentance, and Good Works (1978)
- “Justification by Faith in Pauline and Reformed Theology” (Presbyterion, 1979)
- The Shepherd Controversy and Its Implications (various essays and responses)
- Federal Vision (contributor, 2004)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Monocovenantalism: One Covenant of Grace**
    - Argues that there is a single, unified **covenant** throughout Scripture, not a fundamental distinction between **works** and **grace** covenants.
    - Sees the obligations of faith and obedience as present in all covenantal administrations.
    - Rejects the idea that Adam’s covenant was purely legal, emphasizing relational and gracious elements.
    - Views the Mosaic and New Covenants as differing in administration, not in substance.
    - "There is no essential difference between the covenant with Adam before the fall and the covenant of grace after the fall." (Thirty-Four Theses)

2. **Faith and Obedience as Covenant Conditions**
    - Maintains that **faith** and **obedience** are inseparable responses required by the covenant.
    - Opposes any sharp dichotomy between faith as instrument and obedience as fruit.
    - Teaches that true faith is always a living, active, and obedient faith.
    - Asserts that covenant membership entails ongoing faithfulness, not mere profession.
    - "Faith, repentance, and obedience are not meritorious, but they are necessary conditions of covenant life." (Call of Grace)

3. **Critique of Traditional Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Challenges the classical Reformed distinction between **justification** and **sanctification**.
    - Argues that justification is not by faith alone in a purely forensic sense, but by a living, obedient faith.
    - Suggests that works are not the ground but are inseparable from justifying faith.
    - Emphasizes the covenantal context of justification, not an abstract legal transaction.
    - "Justification is by faith, but that faith is never alone; it is always accompanied by the obedience of faith." (Thirty-Four Theses)

4. **Objectivity of the Covenant**
    - Stresses the real, objective inclusion of all baptized members in the covenant.
    - Holds that covenant promises and threats apply to all covenant members, not just the elect.
    - Warns against a purely invisible church concept that undermines covenant warnings.
    - Teaches that apostasy is possible for those truly in covenant, though not elect.
    - "Baptized children are truly in covenant with God and must respond in faith and obedience." (Call of Grace)

5. **Critique of Law/Gospel Distinction**
    - Argues that the traditional **law/gospel** distinction is overstated and unbiblical.
    - Sees both law and gospel as present in all covenantal administrations.
    - Maintains that the gospel includes commands and the law includes promises.
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s covenantal dealings with humanity.
    - "The law/gospel antithesis is not a biblical distinction but a theological construct." (Presbyterion, 1979)

## Legacy and Impact

Norman Shepherd’s advocacy of **monocovenantalism** and his role in the **Federal Vision** movement have had a profound and polarizing impact on contemporary Reformed theology. His teachings prompted significant controversy at Westminster Theological Seminary and contributed to ongoing debates about **covenant theology**, justification, and the nature of faith and obedience. While many in the Reformed tradition have strongly critiqued his views, Shepherd’s work has influenced a generation of theologians and pastors seeking to rethink the relationship between covenant, faith, and works. His legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the boundaries of Reformed orthodoxy.
