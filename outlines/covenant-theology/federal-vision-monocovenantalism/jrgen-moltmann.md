# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann does not directly engage with **Federal Vision** or **monocovenantalism** as defined in Reformed debates, but his theology of **covenant**, **eschatology**, and the **people of God** offers critical resources for rethinking covenantal relationships. Moltmann emphasizes the dynamic, future-oriented nature of the **covenant of God** with humanity, focusing on the **community of hope** and the inclusive scope of God's promises.

- "The covenant of God is the fellowship of the divine with the human, and its goal is the community of creation." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology
- Theology of Hope
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit
- The Crucified God
- God in Creation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Eschatological Fellowship**
    - Views the **covenant** as a forward-looking, open-ended relationship grounded in God's promise.
    - Emphasizes the **future fulfillment** of the covenant in the coming kingdom of God.
    - Rejects static or purely legal definitions of covenant.
    - Sees the covenant as encompassing all creation, not just a particular people.
    - "The covenant is not a contract but a promise that opens up the future." (The Coming of God)

2. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
    - Argues that God's covenant aims at the reconciliation of all creation.
    - Stresses the **inclusive** nature of God's promises, moving beyond ethnic or ecclesial boundaries.
    - Critiques exclusivist or nationalistic interpretations of covenant.
    - Connects the covenant with the **renewal of the world** in Christ.
    - "God’s covenant embraces the whole world and all its peoples." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

3. **Community of Hope and Participation**
    - Defines the covenant people as a **community of hope** anticipating God's future.
    - Emphasizes active participation in God's redemptive work.
    - Rejects passive or merely institutional understandings of the church.
    - Links covenant identity to mission and solidarity with the oppressed.
    - "The people of God are the people of hope, living toward the coming kingdom." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Critique of Legalism in Covenant Theology**
    - Warns against reducing the covenant to legal or contractual terms.
    - Advocates for a relational, dialogical understanding of God's dealings with humanity.
    - Sees the law as oriented toward liberation, not bondage.
    - Critiques any theology that severs covenant from the **Spirit’s renewing work**.
    - "The law of the covenant is the law of freedom for the community of the redeemed." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

5. **Eschatological Renewal over Monocovenantalism**
    - Does not affirm a single, undifferentiated covenant (**monocovenantalism**), but sees covenant history as dynamic and open.
    - Emphasizes the **eschatological transformation** of all covenants in Christ.
    - Sees continuity and discontinuity in God’s dealings with humanity across history.
    - Prioritizes the future fulfillment of covenant promises over static theological systems.
    - "The history of the covenant is the history of God’s future breaking into the present." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **covenant**, especially in ecumenical and liberationist contexts. His emphasis on the **eschatological** and universal dimensions of God’s promises challenges both monocovenantal and Federal Vision approaches that may restrict covenant to particular forms or communities. While not directly addressing Reformed debates, Moltmann’s work invites theologians to reconsider the scope and purpose of covenant in light of God’s coming kingdom. His influence endures in discussions of hope, participation, and the renewal of creation.
