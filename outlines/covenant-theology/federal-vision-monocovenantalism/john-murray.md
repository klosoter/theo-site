# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray was a staunch advocate of **classic Reformed covenant theology**, emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** while maintaining the distinction between the **covenant of works** and the covenant of grace. He rejected both **monocovenantalism** and the later **Federal Vision** movement, insisting on the historic Reformed understanding of the covenants as foundational for a proper doctrine of salvation and ecclesiology.

- "The sharp antithesis between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is of the essence of Reformed theology." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- The Covenant of Works (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Westminster Theological Journal articles on covenant theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
   - Murray maintained a clear doctrinal separation between the **covenant of works** with Adam and the **covenant of grace** inaugurated after the Fall.
   - He argued that this distinction is essential for understanding **federal headship** and the nature of **justification**.
   - The **covenant of works** was based on Adam’s obedience, while the **covenant of grace** is grounded in Christ’s redemptive work.
   - Denying this distinction leads to confusion regarding the nature of law and gospel.
   - "The distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is basic to Reformed theology." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - Murray affirmed the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history, from Abraham to Christ.
   - He saw the various administrations (Abrahamic, Mosaic, New) as unfolding the same gracious promise.
   - The substance of the covenant is always **salvation by grace through faith** in Christ.
   - This unity does not erase the historical progression or the unique features of each administration.
   - "The covenant of grace is one in essence throughout all its administrations." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Monocovenantalism**
   - Murray explicitly rejected the idea that there is only one covenant in Scripture, or that the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are essentially the same.
   - He argued that monocovenantalism undermines the **federal structure** of Reformed theology.
   - The law/gospel distinction is compromised if the covenants are collapsed into one.
   - Such views threaten the doctrine of **imputed righteousness** and the uniqueness of Christ’s obedience.
   - "To obliterate the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is to subvert the gospel." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Critique of Federal Vision Theology**
   - While Murray predated the Federal Vision controversy, his writings provide a foundation for critiquing its tendencies.
   - He opposed any blurring of the distinction between **justification by faith alone** and covenantal faithfulness.
   - Murray’s emphasis on **imputation** and the forensic nature of justification stands in contrast to Federal Vision’s formulations.
   - He insisted that covenant membership and saving union with Christ are not identical.
   - "Justification is a declarative act of God, not a process or reward for faithfulness." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Covenant and Assurance**
   - Murray taught that assurance of salvation rests on the objective promises of the **covenant of grace**.
   - He warned against grounding assurance in covenantal membership or external signs alone.
   - True assurance flows from faith in Christ’s finished work, not from participation in the visible church per se.
   - The sacraments are means of grace, but not automatic guarantees of salvation.
   - "Assurance is not to be equated with presumption based on external covenant privilege." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s rigorous defense of the **distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and provided a bulwark against both monocovenantalism and later Federal Vision errors. His careful exegesis and theological clarity continue to influence discussions on **covenant theology** in Reformed seminaries and churches. Murray’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking to uphold the historic Reformed understanding of the covenants.
