# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not engage directly with the **Federal Vision** controversy or **monocovenantalism**, but his theology of **covenant** and **systematic theology** offers a distinct perspective on the relationship between God and humanity. Tillich’s existential approach reframes **covenant** not as a legal or federal arrangement but as a symbol of the **divine-human encounter** within the context of **ultimate concern** and **New Being**.

- "The meaning of the word ‘covenant’ is the mutual promise and demand between God and man, which creates a community." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Protestant Era
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic Expression**
    - The **covenant** is not a literal contract but a symbol of the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - Emphasizes the **mutual promise and demand** inherent in the divine-human encounter.
    - Rejects legalistic or federal frameworks in favor of existential and ontological categories.
    - Sees the covenant as a dynamic, living reality rather than a static arrangement.
    - "The covenant is not a legal contract but a symbol of the community between God and man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Unity of Divine-Human Relationship**
    - Tillich’s theology resists sharp distinctions between different covenants or dispensations.
    - Stresses the **unity of revelation** and the ongoing nature of the divine-human relationship.
    - The relationship is grounded in the **New Being** revealed in Christ, transcending historical divisions.
    - This approach resonates with aspects of **monocovenantalism**, though framed existentially.
    - "The history of revelation is the history of the one covenant." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Law and Gospel**
    - Law and gospel are interpreted as existential realities, not merely historical or legal categories.
    - The **law** reveals the estrangement of humanity, while the **gospel** points to reconciliation in the **New Being**.
    - Both law and gospel are united in the existential encounter with God.
    - This unity challenges strict federal or dual-covenant schemes.
    - "Law and gospel are united in the experience of the ultimate concern." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Forensic Federalism**
    - Tillich critiques the forensic and juridical emphases of traditional **federal theology**.
    - He views salvation and covenant in terms of **ontological transformation** rather than legal imputation.
    - The focus is on participation in the **New Being**, not on covenantal merit or works.
    - This stands in contrast to both classic federalism and monocovenantal legalism.
    - "Salvation is participation in the New Being, not the result of a legal transaction." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Covenant and Ultimate Concern**
    - The covenant is an expression of humanity’s **ultimate concern**—the orientation of the whole person toward God.
    - Faith is the act in which the covenant becomes real, existential, and transformative.
    - The **community of faith** is the living context of the covenant relationship.
    - The covenant is thus existentially universal, not limited to specific historical arrangements.
    - "The covenant is the form in which ultimate concern becomes manifest in history." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and symbolic approach to **covenant** has influenced modern theology by challenging both traditional **federal theology** and monocovenantal frameworks. His emphasis on the **unity of the divine-human relationship** and the existential depth of covenant language has shaped discussions about the nature of faith, community, and revelation. While not directly addressing the Federal Vision debate, Tillich’s work provides a critical alternative to legalistic and forensic models, emphasizing the transformative and universal dimensions of the covenant.
