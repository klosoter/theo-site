# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **bipartite covenant theology**, distinguishing the **Covenant of Works** made with Adam from the **Covenant of Grace** established after the Fall. This framework stands in contrast to **monocovenantalism** and the **Federal Vision** movement, both of which blur or reject the distinction between these covenants, thereby challenging the confessional understanding of **justification**, **law and gospel**, and the nature of **federal headship**.

- "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and to him, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 20–36)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 12–20)
- The Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652 (ed. Chad Van Dixhoorn)
- The Theology of the Westminster Standards: Historical Context and Theological Insights (J.V. Fesko)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bipartite Covenant Structure**
    - Asserts a real and substantial distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - The **Covenant of Works** required perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience for life.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** offers salvation by faith in Christ alone, apart from works.
    - Rejects any system that conflates or collapses these two covenants into one.
    - "Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.3)

2. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam is the federal head of humanity in the **Covenant of Works**.
    - Christ is the federal head of the elect in the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - The imputation of Adam’s guilt and Christ’s righteousness are central to salvation.
    - Denies that covenant membership alone confers salvific benefits apart from union with Christ.
    - "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in that first transgression." (WSC 16)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The **law** is summarized in the **Covenant of Works**; the **gospel** is the promise of grace in Christ.
    - The law continues to function as a rule of life, but not as a means of justification.
    - The gospel offers what the law cannot: righteousness by faith in Christ.
    - Rejects any teaching that reintroduces works as a ground of justification under the gospel.
    - "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which He bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience." (WCF 19.1)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is an act of God’s free grace, received by faith alone.
    - Works have no instrumental role in justification, though they are the fruit of faith.
    - The **Federal Vision**’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness as instrumental in justification is contrary to the Standards.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on Christ’s finished work, not covenantal performance.
    - "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." (WCF 11.2)

5. **Sacraments and Covenant Membership**
    - Sacraments are signs and seals of the **Covenant of Grace**, not automatic conveyors of saving grace.
    - Not all who are outwardly in the covenant are inwardly united to Christ.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on the work of the Spirit and the faith of the recipient.
    - Rejects the notion that baptismal union with Christ guarantees final salvation.
    - "The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither doth the efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that doth administer it." (WCF 27.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have shaped **Reformed covenant theology** by maintaining a clear distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, which remains a defining feature of confessional Presbyterianism. Their rejection of **monocovenantalism** and the theological innovations of the **Federal Vision** has provided a bulwark for orthodox teaching on justification, federal headship, and sacramental efficacy. The Standards continue to serve as a doctrinal benchmark for evaluating contemporary covenantal debates within the Reformed tradition.
