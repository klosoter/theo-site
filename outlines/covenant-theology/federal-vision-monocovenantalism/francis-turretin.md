# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading Reformed scholastic who articulated a robust **bipartite covenant theology**, sharply distinguishing the **Covenant of Works** from the **Covenant of Grace**. He rejected **monocovenantalism** and insisted on maintaining the law-gospel distinction, which became central in later controversies such as the **Federal Vision** debate.

- "The covenant of works differs essentially from the covenant of grace, not only in degree, but in kind." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics 6–12)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected writings in Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Dennison)
- Willem J. van Asselt, "The Federal Theology of Francis Turretin"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Works** was made with Adam before the Fall, based on perfect obedience.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is established after the Fall, grounded in Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - These covenants differ not merely in administration but in substance and principle.
    - Turretin opposes any reduction of both covenants to a single, overarching covenant.
    "The law and the gospel are so distinct that they cannot be confounded without injury to the truth." (Institutes)

2. **Law-Gospel Antithesis**
    - The law (Covenant of Works) promises life upon perfect obedience.
    - The gospel (Covenant of Grace) offers salvation by faith in Christ alone.
    - Turretin insists on the necessity of distinguishing law and gospel for the integrity of the Reformed system.
    - He warns against any teaching that would make gospel obedience a condition of justification.
    "The law is the doctrine of works; the gospel is the doctrine of faith." (Institutes)

3. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acts as federal head in the Covenant of Works; Christ as federal head in the Covenant of Grace.
    - Adam’s disobedience is imputed to his posterity; Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers.
    - This federal structure undergirds the doctrines of original sin and justification.
    - Turretin’s federalism stands in contrast to monocovenantal or non-federal approaches.
    "The imputation of Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteousness rests on the federal headship of each." (Institutes)

4. **Rejection of Monocovenantalism**
    - Turretin explicitly denies that the prelapsarian and postlapsarian covenants are one in substance.
    - He critiques any view that would make the Mosaic covenant a republication of the Covenant of Works in substance.
    - The unity of the covenant of grace is maintained, but not at the expense of the law-gospel distinction.
    - He sees monocovenantalism as a threat to the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
    "It is false that the covenant of grace is nothing but a renewal of the covenant of works." (Institutes)

5. **Covenant Conditions and Grace**
    - The Covenant of Works is conditioned on human obedience; the Covenant of Grace is conditioned on Christ’s obedience.
    - Faith is the sole instrument of justification in the Covenant of Grace, not a meritorious work.
    - The promises of the Covenant of Grace are received by faith alone, apart from works.
    - Turretin’s view safeguards the gratuitous character of salvation.
    "The condition of the covenant of grace is faith, not as a work, but as the instrument by which we receive Christ." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **bipartite covenant theology** decisively shaped later Reformed confessions and provided a bulwark against **monocovenantalism** and related errors. His distinctions between the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** remain central in debates over the Federal Vision and other contemporary covenantal controversies. Turretin’s influence endures in the confessional Reformed tradition, especially regarding the law-gospel distinction and the doctrine of justification.
