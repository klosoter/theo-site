# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s theology stands in sharp contrast to **Federal Vision** and **monocovenantalism**, as he reconfigures the doctrine of the **covenant** around the person of **Jesus Christ** rather than a sequence of historical covenants or a singular, undifferentiated covenant. Barth’s **Christocentric** approach to the **covenant of grace** rejects both the traditional Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** and the monocovenantalist tendency to collapse all of God’s dealings with humanity into one covenantal structure. For Barth, the covenant is fundamentally the event of God’s self-revelation and reconciliation in Christ.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation, and creation is the way to the covenant." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election and Covenant)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- Church Dogmatics III/1 (Doctrine of Creation and Covenant)
- Karl Barth and Covenant Theology (ed. Michael Allen, secondary)
- The Humanity of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant is Christocentric**
    - The covenant is realized and fulfilled in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the God who promises and the human who responds, uniting God and humanity.
    - The covenant is not a bilateral contract but a unilateral act of divine grace.
    - All humanity is included in the covenant through Christ’s representative obedience.
    - "In Jesus Christ, the covenant between God and man is established, maintained, and fulfilled." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Covenant of Works/Grace Distinction**
    - Barth denies a prelapsarian **covenant of works** distinct from a postlapsarian **covenant of grace**.
    - He sees all of God’s dealings with humanity as gracious from the beginning.
    - The law is always given within the context of grace, not as a separate principle.
    - The historical sequence of covenants is subordinated to the eternal covenant in Christ.
    - "There is only one covenant, the covenant of grace, which is the covenant of God with man in Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Covenant as the Meaning of Creation**
    - Creation exists for the sake of the covenant relationship between God and humanity.
    - The covenant is not an addendum to creation but its inner purpose and goal.
    - The doctrine of election is inseparable from the doctrine of creation and covenant.
    - Humanity’s existence is defined by being called into covenant fellowship with God.
    - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant, and the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

4. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
    - The covenant in Christ has a universal dimension, encompassing all humanity.
    - Election and reconciliation are corporate realities grounded in Christ’s representative role.
    - Barth resists any narrowing of the covenant to a particular community or visible church.
    - The covenant’s benefits are objectively accomplished in Christ, though subjectively appropriated by faith.
    - "In Him, all men are elected, and in Him, all are called to participate in the covenant." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Covenant as Divine Initiative and Grace**
    - The covenant is established solely by God’s initiative, not by human merit or response.
    - Human faith is a response enabled by God’s prior act of grace in Christ.
    - The structure of the covenant is not conditional or contractual but unconditional and gracious.
    - Barth’s emphasis on divine sovereignty challenges any synergistic or merit-based covenant theology.
    - "God’s faithfulness to His covenant is the ground and guarantee of all human response." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **Christocentric covenant theology** decisively influenced 20th-century discussions on the doctrine of the covenant, challenging both traditional Reformed **bipartite covenant schemes** and monocovenantalist tendencies. His rejection of a **covenant of works** and insistence on the unity of God’s gracious action in Christ set his thought apart from both Federal Vision and classic Reformed orthodoxy. Barth’s approach continues to provoke debate regarding the nature of the covenant, election, and the relationship between law and gospel. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to rethink covenant theology in light of the centrality of Christ.
