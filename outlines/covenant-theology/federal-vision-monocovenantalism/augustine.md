# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s theology of the **covenant** is foundational for later Christian thought, though he does not articulate a fully developed **federal theology** or **monocovenantalism** as seen in later Reformed debates. He emphasizes the unity of **God’s redemptive plan** across history, particularly through the continuity of the **covenant of grace** from the Old to the New Testament, while also maintaining important distinctions between the **old and new covenants**. Augustine’s approach laid groundwork for later covenantal frameworks but does not directly align with the specifics of the **Federal Vision** controversy.

- "In the two Testaments, the old and the new, there is one and the same God, one and the same faith, one and the same people of God." (Contra Faustum, 12.13)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- Contra Faustum
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of God’s Redemptive Plan**
   - Emphasizes a single divine purpose throughout **salvation history**.
   - Sees the **covenant** as uniting Old and New Testament believers.
   - Argues for the continuity of **faith** and **grace** across both covenants.
   - Rejects the idea of two separate peoples of God.
   - "The grace of the New Testament was hidden under the veil of the Old." (Contra Faustum, 14.4)

2. **Distinction Between Old and New Covenants**
   - Recognizes the **old covenant** as preparatory and typological.
   - Asserts the **new covenant** fulfills and surpasses the old.
   - Maintains the necessity of **Christ** for true covenant participation.
   - Views the sacraments of the old as shadows, the new as realities.
   - "The sacraments of the old law were signs of things to come; ours are signs of things already accomplished." (Letter 138)

3. **Covenant and the Church**
   - Identifies the **church** as the true people of God in both Testaments.
   - Stresses the importance of **visible and invisible church** distinction.
   - Argues that only the regenerate truly belong to the covenant.
   - Sees the church as the locus of **salvation** and covenant blessings.
   - "The same Church existed in the saints of old, though under different signs." (The City of God, 20.27)

4. **Role of Law and Grace**
   - Teaches that the **law** exposes sin but cannot save.
   - Emphasizes the necessity of **grace** for covenant faithfulness.
   - Argues that the Spirit enables obedience under the new covenant.
   - Rejects any notion of human merit apart from grace.
   - "The law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 21)

5. **Typology and Fulfillment**
   - Interprets Old Testament covenants as **types** pointing to Christ.
   - Sees fulfillment of covenant promises in the **incarnation** and church.
   - Uses typology to explain continuity and discontinuity in redemptive history.
   - Affirms that all covenantal blessings are realized in Christ.
   - "All these things were figures of things to come, and were fulfilled in Christ." (Enchiridion, 98)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s covenantal thought profoundly shaped the **Western Christian tradition**, providing a theological foundation for later developments in **Reformed covenant theology**. His emphasis on the unity of God’s people and the centrality of grace influenced both medieval and Protestant understandings of the **covenant of grace**. While not a proponent of monocovenantalism or the Federal Vision, Augustine’s insights remain essential for any discussion of covenant continuity and the relationship between law, grace, and the church. His work continues to be a touchstone for debates on the nature of the **church** and the unfolding of redemption in history.
