# Peter J. Leithart (1959–)

Peter J. Leithart is a leading advocate of the **Federal Vision** movement, which challenges traditional Reformed distinctions between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace** by advancing a **monocovenantal** framework. Leithart emphasizes the continuity of the **covenant community**, the objectivity of **baptism**, and the communal nature of **justification** and **salvation**, often critiquing classical Reformed dichotomies in favor of a more unified biblical narrative.

- "The Bible does not teach two covenants, one of works and one of grace, but a single covenant administered in different ways." (The Baptized Body)

## Key Works

- The Baptized Body (2007)
- The Kingdom and the Power: Rediscovering the Centrality of the Church (1993)
- Against Christianity (2003)
- "The Federal Vision" (contributor, 2004)
- Delivered from the Elements of the World (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Monocovenantalism**
    - Argues for a single, unified **covenant** throughout redemptive history.
    - Rejects the sharp distinction between the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - Sees all of God's dealings with humanity as gracious and covenantal.
    - Emphasizes the continuity of God's purposes from Adam to Christ.
    - "There is one covenant, not two, and it is always a gracious covenant." (The Baptized Body)

2. **Objectivity of the Covenant**
    - Asserts that membership in the **covenant community** is real and objective, not merely potential or invisible.
    - Baptism incorporates individuals into the visible church in a meaningful way.
    - The covenant includes both blessings and curses for all members.
    - Covenant status is not identical with election but is nonetheless significant.
    - "Baptism really does something; it makes you part of the people of God." (The Baptized Body)

3. **Sacramental Realism**
    - Upholds the efficacy of the sacraments, especially **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**.
    - Argues that sacraments are means by which God acts, not mere symbols.
    - Connects sacramental participation to covenantal identity and perseverance.
    - Critiques Zwinglian or memorialist views as inadequate.
    - "The sacraments are not empty signs but effectual means of grace." (The Baptized Body)

4. **Communal Justification**
    - Stresses the corporate dimension of **justification** and **salvation**.
    - Justification is not only a legal declaration but also involves incorporation into the covenant people.
    - The church is the locus of God’s saving activity.
    - Faith is inherently communal, not merely individual.
    - "Justification is about being declared righteous as part of the justified community." (Against Christianity)

5. **Critique of Traditional Reformed Distinctions**
    - Challenges the law/gospel and works/grace dichotomies as unbiblical.
    - Argues that all of God’s commands are gracious and all of His grace is demanding.
    - Sees the Reformed tradition as sometimes captive to extra-biblical categories.
    - Calls for a more biblical, narrative-driven theology.
    - "The law is always gracious, and grace always comes with obligations." (The Federal Vision)

## Legacy and Impact

Leithart’s advocacy of **Federal Vision** and **monocovenantalism** has provoked significant debate within Reformed and Presbyterian circles, challenging long-standing confessional boundaries. His work has influenced discussions on **covenant theology**, sacramental practice, and ecclesiology, prompting both renewed interest in biblical-theological approaches and strong criticism from confessional Reformed bodies. While controversial, Leithart’s writings have contributed to ongoing reassessment of the relationship between **covenant**, church, and salvation in contemporary theology.
