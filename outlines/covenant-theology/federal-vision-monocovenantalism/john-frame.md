# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Federal Vision** and **monocovenantalism** debates with a commitment to **Reformed confessionalism** and a focus on **covenant theology** as central to biblical interpretation. He is critical of monocovenantalism’s tendency to blur the distinction between the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, while also urging charity and clarity in theological controversies. Frame emphasizes the necessity of maintaining both the unity and diversity within the **covenantal structure** of Scripture.

- "The distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is not only traditional but also essential to the Reformed understanding of redemption." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s engagement with the **Federal Vision** and monocovenantalism debates has reinforced the importance of classic **Reformed covenant theology** within contemporary discussions. His insistence on both doctrinal clarity and charitable dialogue has shaped how many Reformed theologians approach controversial issues. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking to navigate the complexities of covenantal thought while remaining anchored in confessional orthodoxy.
