# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher’s theology is not directly aligned with the **Federal Vision** or **monocovenantalism**, but his reconfiguration of **covenant theology** and emphasis on the **religious consciousness** laid groundwork for later debates about the nature of the **covenant of grace**. Schleiermacher rejected traditional **Reformed federalism** and instead emphasized the unity of the divine-human relationship, which some interpret as a precursor to monocovenantal tendencies. His focus on the communal and experiential aspects of faith shifted the discussion from legal covenants to the lived experience of **redemption** within the church.

- "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of an absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Traditional Federalism**
   - Denied the classical distinction between the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - Saw the divine-human relationship as a unified, ongoing reality rather than a series of legal arrangements.
   - Emphasized the continuity of God’s redemptive activity throughout history.
   - Influenced later critiques of federal theology’s dual-covenant structure.
   - "The distinction between the so-called covenant of works and covenant of grace is not essential to the Christian faith." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
   - Located the heart of religion in the immediate self-consciousness of dependence on God.
   - Saw the covenant as realized in the communal experience of the church.
   - Downplayed external legal or forensic categories in favor of inward experience.
   - This approach undermined the legal framework central to traditional covenant theology.
   - "Religion is neither a knowing nor a doing but a distinct feeling." (On Religion)

3. **Christ as the Mediator of Covenant**
   - Christ is the archetype and realization of the God-consciousness for the community.
   - The covenant is mediated through Christ’s ongoing presence in the church.
   - Emphasized the ethical and communal transformation brought by Christ.
   - Saw the work of Christ as uniting humanity to God, not merely fulfilling a legal contract.
   - "Christ is the Redeemer because in Him the God-consciousness was absolutely powerful." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Unity of Redemption and Revelation**
   - Rejected sharp distinctions between different dispensations or covenants.
   - Saw revelation and redemption as a single, unfolding process in history.
   - The church is the locus of this ongoing covenantal relationship.
   - This unity anticipates later monocovenantal themes.
   - "Revelation is the communication of the God-consciousness, which is also redemption." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical Community as Covenant Expression**
   - The church embodies the covenant through its ethical life and communal worship.
   - Focused on the transformation of individuals within the community.
   - The covenant is not a legal arrangement but a lived reality in the church.
   - This ethical focus shifts the meaning of covenant from law to life.
   - "The church is the fellowship of those who share in the God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reimagining of **covenant theology** paved the way for later theological movements that questioned the dual-covenant structure of classic Reformed thought. His emphasis on the unity of the divine-human relationship and the communal experience of faith influenced both liberal Protestantism and some streams of covenant theology, including discussions around **monocovenantalism**. While not a direct precursor to the Federal Vision, his ideas contributed to the broader shift away from forensic categories toward relational and experiential understandings of the covenant.
