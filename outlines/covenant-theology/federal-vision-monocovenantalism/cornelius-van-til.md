# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til was a staunch defender of **Reformed confessionalism** and a critic of any system that blurred the distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He rejected **monocovenantalism** and the later **Federal Vision** movement, insisting on the importance of maintaining the **Creator-creature distinction** and the orthodox Reformed understanding of covenant theology.

- "The difference between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is basic to Reformed theology." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- Essays on Christian Education
- "Covenant Theology" (in The New Twentieth Century Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-creature distinction is foundational**
    - Emphasizes the absolute ontological difference between God and humanity.
    - Rejects any theological system that blurs this distinction, including monocovenantalism.
    - Argues that covenant theology must preserve the transcendence of God.
    - Insists that all revelation and relationship are covenantal, but not univocal.
    - "God and man can never be placed on the same plane, even in covenantal relationship." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Two distinct covenants: Works and Grace**
    - Affirms the historic Reformed distinction between the Covenant of Works (pre-Fall) and the Covenant of Grace (post-Fall).
    - Critiques monocovenantalism for collapsing these into a single, undifferentiated covenant.
    - Maintains that the Covenant of Works was based on law, while the Covenant of Grace is based on promise.
    - Sees this distinction as essential for preserving the gospel.
    - "The Reformed faith insists on the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenant as the framework for all revelation**
    - Holds that all of God's dealings with humanity are covenantal in nature.
    - Argues that covenant is the organizing principle of biblical revelation.
    - Rejects any natural theology or autonomous reason outside of covenantal context.
    - Sees the covenant as the context for both epistemology and soteriology.
    - "All revelation is covenantal revelation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Antithesis between belief and unbelief**
    - Stresses the radical antithesis between those in covenant with God and those outside.
    - Warns against any theological system that minimizes this antithesis, as in Federal Vision.
    - Argues that covenant membership is not merely external or formal.
    - Maintains that true covenant participation is by faith alone.
    - "There is an absolute ethical antithesis between the regenerate and the unregenerate." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Covenant theology safeguards justification by faith alone**
    - Insists that the distinction between the covenants protects the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
    - Critiques Federal Vision for introducing confusion regarding faith, works, and assurance.
    - Argues that monocovenantalism undermines the forensic character of justification.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of imputed righteousness in the Covenant of Grace.
    - "Justification by faith alone is safeguarded only when the covenants are properly distinguished." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **Creator-creature distinction** and his insistence on the two-covenant structure have shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists. His critique of monocovenantalism and the theological tendencies that would later emerge in the Federal Vision movement has provided a framework for confessional Reformed responses to these controversies. Van Til’s covenantal apologetics continue to influence discussions on the nature of **Reformed orthodoxy**, covenant theology, and the relationship between law and gospel.
