### ESSAY
Federal Vision and monocovenantalism together name a coordinated challenge to classic Reformed **federal theology**. At the center lies a question basic to justification and ecclesiology: does Scripture teach a twofold covenantal economy in which Adam is placed under a real yet condescending works arrangement in creation, over against the postlapsarian **covenant of grace** in which sinners receive life by faith in the Mediator, or does it teach one gracious covenant from creation onward, inside of which covenantal fidelity functions as the way of life? Federal Vision advocates, often building on Norman Shepherd’s revisionist proposals, press for the latter. The Reformed confessional tradition has defined itself by the former, not as dispensational fragmentation but as a principled **law–gospel distinction** ordered to **imputed righteousness** in Christ. The stakes are not semantic. They are doctrinal coherence across loci: the nature of Adam’s probation, the Mosaic economy, the form of justification, the efficacy of baptism, the reality and limits of apostasy, and the structure of the church as visible and invisible.

Norman Shepherd is decisive as the catalyst of recent monocovenantalism. Teaching at Westminster Seminary in the 1970s, he rejected a meritorious **covenant of works** in Eden and reframed justification as through a living, obedient faith. In theses and lectures that later coalesced in The Call of Grace, Shepherd spoke of faith and obedience in relation to covenant membership such that the traditional Reformed opposition between faith receiving Christ and works as the ground or instrument of justification was blurred. If Adam’s probation was not a works arrangement and if the covenant is uniformly gracious from the beginning, then the same covenantal logic governs Abraham, Moses, Christ, and the church. The practical result is a robust ecclesial and sacramental emphasis: baptism brings one truly into Christ and his benefits, though not eschatologically indefectible, and perseverance is covenantally conditioned. Shepherd’s conceptual move from bicovenantalism to monocovenantalism reframed the topic’s center. Debates over final justification, the role of obedience, and the meaning of apostasy in Hebrews became debates over the architecture of covenant itself. Shepherd did not intend to deny sola fide, but by redefining faith in its covenantal obedience, and by collapsing the legal test on Adam into grace, he reshaped justification’s grammar.

Meredith G. Kline, though not a partisan of every expression of classic scholasticism, became the most formidable Reformed counter to Shepherd’s monocovenantalism and to the later Federal Vision. Kline’s exegetical and biblical-theological work on treaty forms, sacred space, and kingdom intrusion sharpened the structural needs of **federal theology**. In By Oath Consigned and Kingdom Prologue he argued that Scripture embeds a real works principle at creation and that the Mosaic economy republishes that principle at the typological level, not in soteriological contradiction to the **covenant of grace** but as covenantal pedagogy. His appeal to ancient Near Eastern suzerainty forms and to the dual sanctions of covenant clarified that Adam stood under a probation whose condition was perfect obedience, not as condign merit but as pactal obedience under **divine condescension**. This preserves the creator-creature difference and rejects Pelagian contortions while honoring the real forensic backbone of the two-Adams structure in Romans. Kline’s **republication** thesis defends the unity of redemptive history while maintaining distinct covenantal principles. Moses re-enacts the works principle typologically for Israel as a corporate Adam in the land, so that exile and curse dramatize the need for the second Adam. Kline’s solution bears directly on the Shepherd and Federal Vision claims that the whole Bible operates on one gracious covenantal structure. By distinguishing soteric and typological layers, Kline shows how one can affirm unbroken grace in the ordo salutis while preserving a law principle in the historia salutis that is pedagogical and typological. This stance underwrites a firm **law–gospel distinction** without collapsing Scripture’s unity.

The Federal Vision proper, popularized by Douglas Wilson, extended and publicized monocovenantal impulses into a full ecclesial and sacramental agenda. In Reformed Is Not Enough and related essays, Wilson argues for the objectivity of the covenant, for baptism’s conferring real union with Christ and covenantal election, and for a richer doctrine of apostasy in which truly united persons may be cut off. The language of faithfulness and covenant loyalty received renewed primacy, and assertions about final justification according to works were recast as faith’s living character rather than as a separate ground. Wilson sought to exorcise revivalist individualism and thin sacramental practice by re-centering ecclesiology. The risk is not minor. By denying a properly forensic account of justification grounded in Christ’s **imputed righteousness** received by faith alone and by speaking of baptismal union as bringing all the benefits of Christ head-on, Wilson’s program threatens to redraw the Reformed map on justification, sacramental **efficacy**, and perseverance. Critics charged, rightly, that the movement’s monocovenantal frame cannot stably sustain the confessional distinctions between the visible and invisible church, the unbreakable nature of decretal election, and the sole instrumentality of faith. When justification’s instrument is defined as obedient faith as loyalty, it is no longer clear what work is performed uniquely by faith in receiving an alien righteousness.

Francis Turretin offers the classic, confessional benchmark for adjudicating these claims. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology he articulates a **covenant of works** that rests not on the creature’s power to merit God in an absolute sense but on **divine condescension** that promises eschatological life to Adam’s obedience. This covenant was legal in principle, opposed not to grace as kindness but to grace as the mode of salvation for sinners. After the fall, the **covenant of grace** is founded in the satisfaction and obedience of the Mediator, imputed to believers through the sole instrumentality of faith. The works principle does not disappear from Scripture but is reconfigured typologically and pedagogically in the Mosaic legislation, which Turretin describes in ways compatible with later **republication** articulations. Turretin’s insistence that the righteousness by which sinners are justified is entirely alien and imputed creates the doctrinal boundary against any intrusion of inherent obedience into the ground or instrument of justification. This boundary polices the Federal Vision’s tendency to define faith in obsequious categories and to expand baptism’s meaning beyond its confessional sign and seal language. Turretin’s precise distinctions between the administration of the covenant and its essence help stabilize the visible–invisible church distinction against monocovenantal over-realization.

John Murray, finally, must be reckoned as a transitional figure whose revisionary impulse indirectly prepared the way for monocovenantalism. Murray hesitated to speak of a **covenant of works** and preferred to frame Adam’s arrangement in terms of a graciously bestowed promise of life. In a desire to avoid a merit scheme that seemed to some to compromise grace, he described the Adamic relation with God in terms that softened the classic works principle. He also rethought certain aspects of the relation of law and grace within the Mosaic economy. Although Murray himself defended justification by faith alone and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, his reluctance to retain bicovenantal vocabulary and his flattening of merit categories created a conceptual gap that Shepherd and others would exploit. If Adam’s arrangement is not a proper works covenant, then the redemptive-historical necessity of the second Adam’s active obedience may become less clear, and the grammar of a purely receptive faith becomes vulnerable to redefinition in covenantal obedience terms. Murray thus functions as a hinge: his theological instincts are orthodox in soteriology, but his covenantal hesitations make the stricter boundaries of Turretin appear unnecessary to those influenced by his rhetoric.

With these figures in view, the internal debates within the Reformed tradition can be clear. First, the status of the **covenant of works**. Is it essential to **federal theology** or a pedagogical construct that can be safely excised? The confessional and scholastic tradition argues it is essential, because it grounds the two-Adams structure of Romans and supplies the forensic grammar that makes **imputed righteousness** necessary. If Adam’s probation is not a works test under **divine condescension**, Christ’s obedience risks becoming exemplary rather than representative. Second, does Moses republish that works principle, and if so, how? Kline’s answer keeps the works principle typological in the land and cult, preventing any soteriological rollback while honoring texts that speak of life in the land tied to obedience. Third, what is the relation of the visible and invisible church to covenant membership and apostasy? Classic Reformed ecclesiology affirms an objective administration with real external union and non-saving operations of the Spirit, while restricting saving union to the elect and insisting that sacraments are signs and seals whose **efficacy** is tied to the Spirit’s work in the elect and to faith as the sole instrument. Federal Vision collapses these layers, producing a broader and more fragile notion of union and a thicker view of apostasy.

External debates sharpen the issues further. Roman Catholic theology requires infused righteousness and sacramental causality as the form of justification. Federal Vision proposals often sound similar to examiners precisely because they return obedience to the justificatory grammar and elevate sacramental causality, though FV proponents deny identity with Rome. The New Perspective on Paul’s covenantal nomism also exerts pressure by redefining justification as ecclesial badge rather than verdict of acquittal. Some Federal Vision writers appropriated themes from the New Perspective, encouraging a monocovenantal emphasis on belonging and faithfulness. A classical Lutheran critique presses the **law–gospel distinction** even more starkly than Reformed federalism and will accuse any talk of covenantal conditions of compromising the gospel. The Reformed response should be that the law–gospel distinction is crucial at the level of the ground and instrument of justification, while Christological and covenantal categories allow for richer accounts of union, sanctification, and the third use of the law without importing works into justification.

The contemporary debates are pastoral and ecclesial. Multiple Reformed communions have judged Federal Vision teachings to be out of accord with their confessions. Reports emphasize the denial or compromise of the **imputed righteousness** of Christ, the conflation of faith and works in justification, the redefinition of the sacraments’ **efficacy**, and the confusion of visible and invisible church. Pastors face questions about assurance and apostasy. If baptism confers union simpliciter, then to lose that union is either to imply the loss of salvation or to redefine salvation as covenant location without forensic security. If union is two-layered, as classic Reformed ecclesiology claims, then one can affirm the reality of apostasy from the administration of the covenant and from common operations of the Spirit without implying the loss of saving union for the elect. Paedocommunion emerges as a corollary when covenant membership is treated as homogeneous; the confessional tradition resists this by insisting on a credible profession of faith as requisite for the Supper’s discerning participation. Assurance is protected in the confessional system by locating the ground of justification outside the believer in Christ’s righteousness and by distinguishing the judgment according to works from the ground of that verdict. In monocovenantal frames assurance tends to ride on covenant loyalty and so waxes and wanes with performance.

I defend the confessional bicovenantal position with a Klinean clarification. Adam’s probation was a real works arrangement under **divine condescension**, designed to lead the human race into confirmed eschatological life. After the fall, sinners are justified solely by Christ’s **imputed righteousness**, received by faith alone as sole instrument. The Mosaic economy republishes the works principle typologically for Israel in the land to magnify sin and to point to Christ. The **law–gospel distinction** is therefore structural and necessary, not as two competing deities but as two covenantal principles, one legal and creational, the other evangelical and redemptive. The sacraments are objective signs and seals of the **covenant of grace**, conferring nothing ex opere but truly exhibiting and confirming Christ and his benefits to the elect through faith by the Spirit. The church is visible and invisible. There is real covenant membership short of saving union, and there is apostasy from that administration, but there is no loss of decreed election or of justification.

Examiners will press several objections. Does Kline’s **republication** compromise grace and reintroduce works into salvation history? The answer is that Kline distinguishes the typological and soteriological layers. Israel’s tenure in the land is a microcosm of Adamic probation to teach the necessity of Christ, not to provide an alternate salvific path. The Reformed tradition has always confessed multiple ends of the law, one of which is pedagogical. Republication magnifies this end without denying that believers under Moses were justified by the same Christ through the same faith. Does the **covenant of works** imply merit in a way that violates the creator-creature distinction? No. Classic Reformed divinity defines Adam’s merit as pactal, founded in **divine condescension**. God freely promised life for obedience and freely constituted a probation that would be fitting for a finite image-bearer. This is not condign merit that binds God in justice apart from covenant; it is a faithfulness to his own covenantal promise. Does monocovenantalism better account for the unity of Scripture? It achieves unity by flattening redemptive-historical distinctions and by turning the legal into the evangelical. Biblical unity is better preserved by confessing one **covenant of grace** administered in diverse economies while acknowledging a real prelapsarian legal covenant and a Mosaic typological republication, which gives Scripture its eschatological tension that only Christ resolves. Does the defended view make the sacraments mere memorials and the church a thin voluntary society? Confessional bicovenantalism denies both. Sacraments are means of grace whose **efficacy** is real and Spirit-wrought; baptism truly engrafts into the visible church and seals the promises to believers and their children. The church is a divine institution with real authority and discipline. The difference from Federal Vision is not in the affirmation of objectivity but in its boundaries and referents.

The adjacent loci must be ordered accordingly. Christology is at stake because the obedience of the second Adam must be representative and vicarious to satisfy the failed works probation of the first. If Adam did not stand under a works principle, the necessity and nature of Christ’s active obedience wobble. Soteriology is at stake because justification by **imputed righteousness** received by faith alone excludes every form of covenantal obedience as instrument or ground. Sanctification and the third use of the law retain their place without encroaching on justification because the **law–gospel distinction** secures their proper relation. Ecclesiology is at stake because the visible–invisible distinction and a proper doctrine of means of grace protect assurance and discipline. Ethics and pastoral care are at stake because exhortations to obedience must be preached as fruit and evidence, not as instrument of our right standing before God. In preaching and catechesis, the confessional model avoids both antinomianism and neonomianism by placing obedience after union with Christ and within the **covenant of grace**, not before it and not as its condition for justification.

Returning to the decisive figures, we can now weigh their contributions. Shepherd’s emphasis on covenantal obedience as integral to justification and his denial of a works covenant for Adam catalyzed a suite of revisions that, however well intentioned, dissolve the line between faith and works in the justificatory act and destabilize the ordo salutis. Kline’s defense of the prelapsarian works principle, his typological **republication**, and his covenantal hermeneutic recover federal architecture in biblical exegesis and preserve both the unity and diversity of Scripture. Wilson’s ecclesial and sacramental thrust rightly seeks churchly objectivity but grounds it in a monocovenantal logic that confuses administration with essence and threatens the doctrine of perseverance and assurance. Turretin supplies the dogmatic grammar that exposes such confusions and safeguards the forensic center of the gospel. Murray’s hesitation to retain bicovenantal language demonstrates how subtle changes in covenant architecture generate downstream soteriological pressures.

A candidate should be ready to explain, in one breath, why the **covenant of works** is not ungracious, why **republication** does not threaten sola gratia, why baptism’s **efficacy** is real yet not automatic, how apostasy is real in the administration yet not a loss of salvation, how final judgment according to works is a vindicatory manifestation rather than an alternate ground, and how Christ’s active obedience is nonnegotiable because Adam’s failed probation was real. To defend this is to defend the confessional Reformed system as an integrated whole. Monocovenantalism and Federal Vision fail not because they love covenant or church too much but because they alter the covenant’s internal grammar, which then necessarily rearranges justification, sacrament, and church. The bicovenantal frame, clarified and sharpened by Kline’s typological insights and secured by Turretin’s dogmatic precision, offers the stable path between neonomianism and antinomianism, secures the unique honor of Christ’s **imputed righteousness**, and sustains a robust ecclesial practice with genuine objectivity without collapsing administration into essence. That is the position to defend before examiners and congregations alike.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Federal Vision and monocovenantalism assert a single gracious covenant structure from creation onward, collapsing the **covenant of works** into the **covenant of grace** and redefining faith, obedience, and sacramental **efficacy** in ways that blur the **law–gospel distinction** and threaten sola fide.

  - Francis Turretin: provided confessional federal boundaries, grounded **imputed righteousness** and faith alone, distinguished administration and essence.
  - John Murray: softened bicovenantal vocabulary and merit categories, unintentionally paving the way for monocovenantal emphases.
- Debates:
  - Internal: reality of the **covenant of works**, scope and sense of **republication**, instrumentality of faith versus obedience, visible–invisible church, sacramental **efficacy**.

- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does republication reintroduce works into salvation? Answer: no, it is typological and pedagogical, not soteriological.
  - Is the covenant of works ungracious or Pelagian? Answer: no, it is pactal under **divine condescension**, not condign merit.
  - Does your view make sacraments mere memorials? Answer: no, they are means of grace whose efficacy is Spirit-wrought and tied to faith.
  - How is apostasy real if election is indefectible? Answer: from the administration and common operations, not from saving union.
  - Why is Christ’s active obedience necessary? Answer: because Adam’s probation was a real works test that Christ fulfilled for us.
