# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a staunch defender of classic **Reformed covenant theology**, sharply distinguishing between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He rejected any form of **monocovenantalism** and would have critiqued the **Federal Vision** movement for blurring the lines between law and gospel, as well as for undermining the traditional understanding of **justification by faith alone**.

- "The covenant of works and the covenant of grace differ essentially in their nature, conditions, and promises." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on covenant theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bicovenantalism: Two Distinct Covenants**
    - Firm distinction between the **Covenant of Works** (with Adam) and the **Covenant of Grace** (with Christ).
    - The **Covenant of Works** was based on perfect obedience, promising life for obedience and death for disobedience.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is grounded in Christ’s obedience and received by faith alone.
    - Rejects any scheme that conflates or merges the two covenants into one.
    - "The plan of salvation revealed in the gospel is not a new law, but a covenant of grace." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Maintains a sharp theological and hermeneutical distinction between law and gospel.
    - The law reveals God’s righteous demands and humanity’s inability to fulfill them.
    - The gospel proclaims Christ’s fulfillment of the law and the offer of salvation by grace.
    - Blurring this distinction undermines the doctrine of justification.
    - "The law is not the gospel; the gospel is not the law." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is a forensic act, declaring sinners righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s imputed righteousness.
    - Faith is the sole instrument of justification, not faith plus works or covenantal faithfulness.
    - Any view that makes works or covenant membership a ground of justification is rejected.
    - The **Federal Vision** approach is seen as a threat to this doctrine.
    - "Justification is not by works, nor by faith and works, but by faith alone." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Objective and Subjective Aspects of the Covenant**
    - The covenant has both an objective promise (God’s commitment) and a subjective requirement (faith).
    - Membership in the visible church does not guarantee saving benefits; only the elect receive the full blessings.
    - Sacraments are means of grace but do not confer grace automatically or ex opere operato.
    - The internal/external distinction in the covenant is essential to avoid confusion.
    - "All who are in the covenant are not partakers of its saving benefits." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Critique of Monocovenantalism and Federal Vision**
    - Monocovenantalism collapses the distinction between law and grace, leading to doctrinal confusion.
    - The **Federal Vision**’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness as a condition for justification is unbiblical.
    - Hodge insists on the historical and theological necessity of two covenants.
    - The integrity of the gospel depends on maintaining these distinctions.
    - "To confound the covenant of works with the covenant of grace is to subvert the gospel." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s rigorous defense of **bicovenantalism** and the **law-gospel distinction** has profoundly shaped confessional Presbyterian and Reformed theology. His systematic articulation of covenant theology remains a standard reference against which later developments, including the **Federal Vision** and monocovenantalism, are measured and critiqued. Hodge’s influence endures in debates over justification, covenant membership, and the nature of the gospel within Reformed circles.
