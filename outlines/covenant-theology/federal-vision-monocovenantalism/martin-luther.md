# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s theology is foundational for later debates on **covenant theology**, though he did not articulate a formal doctrine of **monocovenantalism** or engage directly with the **Federal Vision** controversy. Luther emphasized the distinction between **Law and Gospel**, viewing the covenants primarily through the lens of **justification by faith alone** and the radical discontinuity between the old and new covenants. His approach laid groundwork for later Reformed developments but differs significantly from both monocovenantal and Federal Vision perspectives.

- "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. Grace says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 26)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Maintains a fundamental division between **Law** (commands, demands) and **Gospel** (promise, grace).
    - Sees the Law as exposing sin and driving one to Christ, not as a means of life or covenantal blessing.
    - Rejects any blending of Law and Gospel in the order of salvation.
    - Views the Gospel as the exclusive means of **justification** and new life.
    - "Distinguishing between the Law and the Gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Central doctrine: sinners are declared righteous solely by faith in Christ, apart from works.
    - The covenant with Abraham is fulfilled in Christ and received by faith, not by covenantal faithfulness or obedience.
    - Rejects any notion of covenant membership or justification by works, whether ceremonial or moral.
    - Faith is a passive reception of God’s promise, not a covenantal condition.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, apart from the works of the Law." (Romans Commentary)

3. **Discontinuity Between Old and New Covenants**
    - Emphasizes the radical newness of the **New Covenant** in Christ.
    - The Old Covenant is preparatory, pointing to Christ but not identical in substance with the New.
    - Sees the Mosaic covenant as fundamentally law-based, not a gracious administration of the covenant of grace.
    - Rejects monocovenantalism: does not view all biblical covenants as one continuous covenant of grace.
    - "The Law was given, not to justify, but to show sin and point to Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
    - Interprets all Scripture as centered on Christ and the promise of the Gospel.
    - The covenants are meaningful only as they reveal Christ and the justification He brings.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in Christ, not in a single, overarching covenant structure.
    - The promises to Abraham and David are fulfilled in Christ, not in a monocovenantal framework.
    - "All the promises of God find their Yes in Christ." (2 Corinthians Commentary)

5. **Sacraments as Means of Grace, Not Covenant Markers**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means by which God delivers His promise, not badges of covenant membership.
    - Rejects any view that makes sacraments conditional on covenantal obedience or faithfulness.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on God’s promise, not on human response or covenantal status.
    - Sacraments serve to strengthen faith in the Gospel, not to mark out a visible covenant community.
    - "The sacraments are signs of the promise, not of our works." (Large Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s sharp distinction between **Law and Gospel** and his doctrine of **justification by faith alone** set the stage for later Protestant debates on covenant theology, though he did not develop a formal system of covenants. His rejection of monocovenantalism and any works-based understanding of the covenant stands in contrast to later Federal Vision proposals. While Luther’s influence is indirect, his Christocentric and grace-centered approach remains a critical reference point in evaluating both monocovenantal and Federal Vision theologies.
