# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not address the **Federal Vision** or **monocovenantalism** directly, as these are later theological developments, but his doctrine of the **covenant** (foedus) and understanding of **law and grace** significantly shaped later Western thought on these issues. Aquinas distinguished between the **Old and New Law**, emphasizing the unity of God's salvific purpose while maintaining important distinctions between different **dispensations** in salvation history.

- "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–108 (Treatise on Law)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Old and New Law**
    - The **Old Law** prepared for the **New Law** and was fulfilled in Christ.
    - The Old Law was primarily external, while the New Law is internal, written on the heart by the Spirit.
    - Both laws are part of God's unified plan, but they differ in efficacy and mode.
    - The New Law brings the fullness of grace, which the Old Law only prefigured.
    - "The New Law is called a law of perfection, because it brings man to the ultimate end." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 1)

2. **Unity of Divine Economy**
    - God’s plan of salvation is unified across history, though administered in different covenants.
    - The **covenant with Abraham** and the Mosaic Law are preparatory for the New Covenant in Christ.
    - There is a continuity in the promise of salvation, but a discontinuity in its administration.
    - Aquinas avoids collapsing all covenants into one, maintaining both unity and distinction.
    - "The Old Law was a figure of the New Law, and the New Law is a figure of glory." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

3. **Role of Grace in Both Covenants**
    - True righteousness is only possible through **grace**, not by the works of the Law alone.
    - The Old Law could not confer grace by itself; it pointed to the need for Christ.
    - The New Law is effective because it is accompanied by the grace of the Holy Spirit.
    - Aquinas rejects any notion of salvation by mere external observance.
    - "The Old Law was given that it might lead to the New Law, and the New Law that it might lead to eternal life." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 3)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - The ceremonies and sacrifices of the Old Covenant are types fulfilled in Christ.
    - The unity of the covenants is seen in their common orientation toward Christ.
    - The New Covenant is the reality to which the Old pointed.
    - Aquinas emphasizes the **eschatological** fulfillment of all covenants in Christ.
    - "All the sacraments of the Old Law signified Christ, and were fulfilled in Him." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 61, a. 3)

5. **Law, Gospel, and the Moral Life**
    - The moral precepts of the Old Law remain, but ceremonial and judicial laws are abrogated in Christ.
    - The Gospel perfects the Law by giving the power to fulfill its demands through the Spirit.
    - Aquinas upholds the abiding validity of the **natural law** within the New Covenant.
    - The distinction between law and gospel is not absolute, but one of fulfillment and perfection.
    - "The New Law is not written on tables of stone, but on the heart by the grace of the Holy Spirit." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s nuanced distinction between the **Old and New Covenants** provided a foundation for later Reformed and Catholic debates on covenant theology, even though he did not articulate a **monocovenantal** or **Federal Vision** framework. His emphasis on the unity of God’s salvific purpose, the necessity of grace, and the fulfillment of the Old in the New shaped the Western understanding of **covenant continuity and discontinuity**. While Aquinas is not directly cited in Federal Vision debates, his categories remain influential in discussions of **law, gospel, and the structure of redemptive history**.
