# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. has been a leading critic of the **Federal Vision** movement and its **monocovenantalism**, emphasizing the classic **Reformed distinction** between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He maintains that the integrity of **justification by faith alone** and the structure of **redemptive history** depend on upholding this covenantal distinction, which Federal Vision proponents blur or reject.

- "The denial or blurring of the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is not a minor adjustment but a fundamental revision of Reformed theology." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in the New Testament
- "Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ" (essay in The Law is Not of Faith)
- "The New Perspective on Paul: An Analysis and Assessment" (WTJ article)
- "Westminster and the Gospel" (WTJ article)
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (WTJ article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace are Distinct**
    - The **Covenant of Works** with Adam is foundational for understanding redemptive history.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is God's response to the Fall, fulfilled in Christ.
    - Collapsing these covenants into one undermines the gospel's structure.
    - The distinction safeguards the uniqueness of Christ’s obedience.
    - "The distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is essential to the Reformed system." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Justification by Faith Alone is Non-negotiable**
    - Justification is a forensic act, not a process.
    - Works play no role in the believer’s standing before God.
    - Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness risks confusion with **Roman Catholic** views.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not covenantal performance.
    - "Justification is by faith alone, apart from works, and this must not be compromised." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Union with Christ is Central, but Not at the Expense of Forensic Justification**
    - Union with Christ encompasses all benefits of salvation.
    - Forensic justification is distinct within union, not absorbed by it.
    - Federal Vision’s approach tends to conflate justification and sanctification.
    - The ordo salutis must preserve the unique role of justification.
    - "Union with Christ is central, but justification retains its distinct, declarative character." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Covenantal Nomism is Incompatible with Reformed Soteriology**
    - The New Perspective and Federal Vision both risk introducing works into justification.
    - The Reformed tradition rejects any form of **covenantal nomism**.
    - Obedience is the fruit, not the ground, of salvation.
    - The law/gospel distinction must be maintained.
    - "Any scheme that makes obedience a condition for justification is contrary to the gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Confessional Fidelity to Westminster Standards**
    - The Westminster Standards clearly distinguish the two covenants.
    - Gaffin defends the confessional language against revisionist readings.
    - Federal Vision theology is seen as a departure from Westminster orthodoxy.
    - The confessions are not negotiable or merely historical artifacts.
    - "The Westminster Confession’s teaching on the covenants is not optional for Reformed churches." (WTJ article)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s rigorous defense of the **covenant of works/covenant of grace distinction** has shaped contemporary Reformed responses to the Federal Vision and New Perspective movements. His work has reinforced the centrality of **justification by faith alone** and the importance of confessional boundaries within Reformed theology. Gaffin’s influence is especially evident in seminaries and denominations committed to the Westminster Standards, where his critiques of monocovenantalism continue to inform theological education and ecclesiastical debates.
