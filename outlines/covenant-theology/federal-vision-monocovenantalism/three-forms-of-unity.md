# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed covenant theology** that distinguishes between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. These confessions reject **monocovenantalism** and the **Federal Vision**'s blurring of law and gospel, instead upholding a clear distinction between the pre-fall covenant with Adam and the post-fall covenant in Christ. Their formulations emphasize the gracious character of salvation and the necessity of faith alone for justification.

- "We believe that our good works are of no account towards our justification, for it is by faith in Christ that we are justified, even before we do good works." (Belgic Confession, Art. 24)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14–24
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 20–23, 60, 86–91
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–III/IV
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The pre-fall covenant with Adam required perfect obedience for life.
    - After the fall, salvation is offered only through the **Covenant of Grace** in Christ.
    - The law/gospel distinction is foundational for understanding redemption.
    - The confessions explicitly reject any confusion of these covenants.
    - "God gave unto Adam a commandment of life, by the strict obedience whereof he should obtain life." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

2. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is by faith apart from works, grounded in Christ’s righteousness.
    - Good works are the fruit, not the ground, of justification.
    - The confessions deny any form of justification by faith plus works.
    - Assurance is rooted in Christ’s finished work, not covenantal faithfulness.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, or by faith apart from works of law." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 60)

3. **Covenant Membership and Election**
    - Not all members of the visible church are elect or savingly united to Christ.
    - The **Canons of Dort** affirm unconditional election and the perseverance of the saints.
    - The sacraments are means of grace but do not guarantee regeneration.
    - The confessions reject any automatic efficacy of covenant membership.
    - "Not all who are called by the gospel are called according to God’s purpose of election." (Canons of Dort I.6)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The law reveals sin and drives sinners to Christ.
    - The gospel proclaims free grace in Christ for those who believe.
    - The confessions maintain a sharp distinction between the demands of the law and the promises of the gospel.
    - The law continues to guide believers in gratitude, not as a means of justification.
    - "The law discovers the great depravity of our nature, but the gospel reveals the remedy." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 3–5, 19)

5. **Covenant Conditions and Grace**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is unconditional in its establishment and effectual for the elect.
    - Faith is the sole instrument of receiving Christ and his benefits.
    - Obedience is a necessary response but not a condition for justification.
    - The confessions reject any notion that covenant faithfulness (works) is a co-instrument of salvation.
    - "Faith is only the instrument by which we embrace Christ, our righteousness." (Belgic Confession, Art. 22)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have decisively shaped the confessional boundaries of Reformed churches, providing a robust theological bulwark against **Federal Vision** and **monocovenantalism**. Their clear articulation of the **law/gospel distinction** and the two-covenant structure remains central to Reformed identity. These confessions continue to serve as authoritative standards for doctrine, worship, and pastoral practice in Reformed and Presbyterian traditions worldwide.
