# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck firmly upheld the classic **Reformed doctrine of the covenants**, distinguishing between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He rejected **monocovenantalism** and the later developments of the **Federal Vision**, emphasizing the historical and theological necessity of a prelapsarian covenant distinct from the postlapsarian order of redemption.

- "Scripture itself teaches us to distinguish between a covenant of works and a covenant of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.199)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Covenant of Grace" (article, 1902)
- Essays on Religion, Science, and Society

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bifurcation of the Covenants**
    - Maintains a clear distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Argues that the **Covenant of Works** is foundational for understanding the structure of redemptive history.
    - Sees the **Covenant of Grace** as God's gracious response to human failure under the first covenant.
    - Rejects any flattening of the covenants into a single, undifferentiated relationship.
    - "The difference between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is fundamental." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.199)

2. **Covenant of Works as Prelapsarian**
    - Asserts that the **Covenant of Works** was established with Adam before the Fall.
    - Views this covenant as based on law and requiring perfect obedience for life.
    - Holds that the breach of this covenant necessitated the introduction of grace.
    - Insists that the **Covenant of Works** is not merely hypothetical but a real historical arrangement.
    - "The covenant of works is not a legal fiction but a historical reality." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.202)

3. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive**
    - Describes the **Covenant of Grace** as God's initiative to restore fallen humanity.
    - Emphasizes Christ as the Mediator and fulfillment of the covenant promises.
    - Stresses faith as the means of participation in the covenant, not meritorious works.
    - Sees the covenant as administered through the means of grace and the church.
    - "The covenant of grace is the way in which God leads his people to their eternal destiny." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.224)

4. **Rejection of Monocovenantalism**
    - Opposes the idea that all divine-human covenants are essentially the same in structure and content.
    - Warns that monocovenantalism undermines the uniqueness of grace in salvation.
    - Argues that the law-gospel distinction is rooted in the two-covenant schema.
    - Maintains that the Federal Vision’s blurring of covenant boundaries is unfaithful to Reformed orthodoxy.
    - "The Reformed have always maintained the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.199)

5. **Covenant and Assurance**
    - Connects the objective structure of the covenant to the believer’s assurance of salvation.
    - Teaches that assurance rests on God’s faithfulness to his covenant promises, not human performance.
    - Warns against covenantal formulations that make assurance contingent on works.
    - Upholds the perseverance of the saints within the context of the covenant of grace.
    - "The certainty of faith rests in the faithfulness of God to his covenant." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.246)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **bifurcated covenant structure** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s response to monocovenantalism and the Federal Vision. His careful exegesis and theological synthesis continue to provide a standard for distinguishing law and gospel within covenant theology. Bavinck’s influence endures in contemporary debates, ensuring that the classic Reformed distinctions remain central in discussions of covenant, assurance, and the nature of grace.
