# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a staunch critic of **Federal Vision** theology and its associated **monocovenantalism**, advocating instead for a sharp distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He emphasized the **law-gospel antithesis** and maintained that the structure of biblical covenants is fundamentally **bipartite**, not monocovenantal, thus preserving the Reformed doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.

- "The Federal Vision program is a radical revision of the Reformed doctrine of the covenants, collapsing the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- "Covenant Theology Under Attack" (Presbyterion, 2004)
- Structure of Biblical Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bipartite Covenant Structure**
    - Insists on a fundamental distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Argues that monocovenantalism undermines the biblical law-gospel contrast.
    - Sees the Adamic covenant as a probationary, law-based arrangement.
    - Views the Mosaic covenant as a republication of the works principle, not a pure administration of grace.
    - "The Reformed tradition has always insisted on the basic two-covenant structure of redemptive history." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Law-Gospel Antithesis**
    - Maintains that the principle of inheritance under the **Covenant of Works** is fundamentally different from that under the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Warns that Federal Vision blurs the distinction, threatening the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.
    - Emphasizes that the gospel is not a new law but the announcement of Christ’s finished work.
    - Argues that any confusion of law and gospel leads to legalism or antinomianism.
    - "The gospel is not a new law, but the announcement of a finished work." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Republication of the Works Principle**
    - Interprets the Mosaic covenant as a typological republication of the **works principle**.
    - Distinguishes between typological, national blessings and eternal, redemptive blessings.
    - Argues that Israel’s tenure in the land was conditioned on obedience, unlike the unconditional promise to Abraham.
    - Uses this framework to critique monocovenantal readings of the Mosaic economy.
    - "The law principle was republished in the Mosaic economy, but only at the typological, national level." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Covenant Signs and Membership**
    - Teaches that covenant signs (circumcision, baptism) signify both blessing and curse, not automatic inclusion in saving grace.
    - Critiques Federal Vision’s view of baptismal efficacy and objectivity of the covenant.
    - Emphasizes the distinction between external and internal covenant membership.
    - Argues that the sacraments do not guarantee regeneration or perseverance.
    - "Covenant signs are double-edged, signifying both blessing and curse depending on faith." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Preservation of Reformed Soteriology**
    - Defends **justification by faith alone** as the heart of the gospel.
    - Rejects any system that introduces works as an instrument of justification.
    - Warns that monocovenantalism inevitably leads to confusion about the ground of salvation.
    - Upholds the forensic, imputed righteousness of Christ as the sole basis for acceptance with God.
    - "To confuse the covenants is to confuse the gospel itself." (Covenant Theology Under Attack)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s rigorous defense of the **law-gospel distinction** and his critique of monocovenantalism have shaped contemporary Reformed responses to the Federal Vision controversy. His covenant theology remains influential in seminaries and churches committed to confessional Reformed orthodoxy. By articulating a robust bipartite covenant structure, Kline helped preserve the integrity of classic Reformed soteriology and the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
