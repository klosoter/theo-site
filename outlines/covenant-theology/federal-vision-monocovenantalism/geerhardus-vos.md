# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is a foundational figure in **Reformed biblical theology**, known for his robust articulation of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as distinct, successive administrations in redemptive history. He firmly rejected **monocovenantalism** and any blurring of the law-gospel distinction, positions that set him at odds with later developments such as the **Federal Vision** movement. Vos’s theology underscores the historical progression and theological significance of the covenants, maintaining the integrity of **justification by faith alone**.

- "The covenant of works and the covenant of grace are not simply two forms of the same covenant, but two essentially distinct covenants." (Biblical Theology, p. 42)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially Vol. 2: Anthropology)
- The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology (article)
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit" (Princeton Theological Review)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace are Distinct**
    - The **covenant of works** with Adam is fundamentally different from the **covenant of grace** initiated after the Fall.
    - The former is based on **law and obedience**, the latter on **promise and faith**.
    - Vos rejects any notion that these covenants are merely administrative variations of a single covenant.
    - This distinction safeguards the **law-gospel antithesis** central to Reformed soteriology.
    - "The two covenants differ not merely in degree but in kind." (Biblical Theology, p. 42)

2. **Historical Progression of Redemptive Revelation**
    - Vos emphasizes the unfolding of **redemptive history** through distinct covenant epochs.
    - Each covenant administration reveals new aspects of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - The **Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New Covenants** are organically related but not identical.
    - This progression refutes monocovenantal flattening of biblical history.
    - "Revelation is not an abstract doctrine but a historical process." (Biblical Theology, p. 5)

3. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - The **covenant of works** is characterized by law, while the **covenant of grace** is characterized by gospel.
    - Vos insists that the principle of inheritance in each covenant is fundamentally different.
    - Any confusion of law and gospel undermines the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.
    - The Federal Vision’s blurring of this distinction is incompatible with Reformed orthodoxy.
    - "The law is not of faith; but the man that doeth them shall live in them." (Biblical Theology, p. 131)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Vos sees the Old Testament covenants as typological, pointing forward to fulfillment in **Christ**.
    - The **Mosaic covenant** is not a republication of the covenant of works in its entirety, but contains typological elements.
    - Christ fulfills both the demands of the law and the promises of grace.
    - This typological structure is lost in monocovenantal readings.
    - "The Old Testament is not merely preparatory but typico-symbolic of the realities in Christ." (Biblical Theology, p. 318)

5. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Vos upholds **sola fide** as the exclusive means of justification in the covenant of grace.
    - Works have no meritorious role in the believer’s standing before God post-Fall.
    - The Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenantal faithfulness risks undermining this doctrine.
    - Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not covenantal performance.
    - "Faith is the sole instrument of justification, excluding all works." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4, p. 246)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s rigorous defense of the **bi-covenantal structure** has profoundly shaped Reformed theology and provided a bulwark against **monocovenantalism** and the theological innovations of the Federal Vision. His biblical-theological method continues to influence scholars committed to maintaining the law-gospel distinction and the integrity of **justification by faith alone**. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to articulate a historically grounded, confessionally Reformed covenant theology.
