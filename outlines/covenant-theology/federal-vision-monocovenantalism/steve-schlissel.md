# Steve Schlissel (1954– )

Steve Schlissel is a prominent advocate of the **Federal Vision** movement, known for his **monocovenantal** approach that rejects the traditional Reformed distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He emphasizes the objective reality of **covenant membership** and calls for a renewed focus on the visible church and sacraments within Reformed theology.

- "The Bible knows nothing of a covenant of works made with Adam, nor of a covenant of grace made with Christ and the elect." (from "More Than Before: The Federal Vision and the Covenant," 2002 Auburn Avenue Pastors Conference)

## Key Works

- "More Than Before: The Federal Vision and the Covenant" (2002 Auburn Avenue Pastors Conference address)
- "Covenant and Apostasy: Apostasy in the New Covenant Community" (2002)
- Contributions to "The Federal Vision" (edited by Steve Wilkins, 2004)
- "A New Way of Seeing? A Response to the Critics of Federal Vision" (various essays and online articles)
- "The Covenant of God: A New Perspective" (conference lectures and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Monocovenantalism**
    - Rejects the sharp distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Argues that God has always related to humanity through a single, gracious covenant.
    - Views the Adamic and post-Adamic covenants as differing administrations of one overarching covenant.
    - Emphasizes the unity and continuity of God's dealings with His people.
    "There is one covenant, graciously administered by God, from Adam to Christ and beyond." (Auburn Avenue address, 2002)

2. **Objective Covenant Membership**
    - Asserts that all baptized individuals are truly members of the **covenant community**.
    - Stresses the visible, historical church as the locus of God's covenant dealings.
    - Warns against reducing covenant membership to invisible election.
    - Holds that covenant status brings real blessings and responsibilities, regardless of ultimate election.
    "Baptism brings one into real covenant relationship with God and His people." (Federal Vision, 2004)

3. **Critique of Traditional Reformed Distinctions**
    - Challenges the law/gospel and works/grace dichotomies in classic Reformed theology.
    - Argues these distinctions are foreign to the biblical narrative.
    - Sees such dichotomies as undermining the unity of Scripture and the covenant.
    - Calls for a return to a more biblical, less scholastic covenant theology.
    "The law/gospel antithesis is not a biblical category, but a later theological imposition." (More Than Before, 2002)

4. **Covenant Faithfulness and Apostasy**
    - Teaches that covenant members can fall away from the covenant and suffer real judgment.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of perseverance and faithfulness within the covenant.
    - Warns against presumption and antinomianism among the baptized.
    - Argues that apostasy is a real danger for those in the visible church.
    "Apostasy is possible only for those who are truly in covenant with God." (Covenant and Apostasy, 2002)

5. **Sacramental Realism**
    - Affirms the objective efficacy of the **sacraments** in marking out the covenant people.
    - Rejects a merely symbolic or memorialist view of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.
    - Sees the sacraments as means by which God publicly claims and nourishes His people.
    - Connects sacramental participation with covenant identity and responsibility.
    "The sacraments are not empty signs but effectual means of covenant inclusion." (Federal Vision, 2004)

## Legacy and Impact

Steve Schlissel has played a significant role in shaping the **Federal Vision** conversation, especially regarding the unity of the covenant and the nature of covenant membership. His advocacy for **monocovenantalism** has provoked debate within Reformed and Presbyterian circles, challenging traditional formulations and prompting denominational responses. While controversial, his work has forced renewed attention on the biblical foundations of covenant theology and the practical implications for church life and discipline.
