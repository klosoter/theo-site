# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, critiqued both classical **covenant theology** and the later developments of **monocovenantalism** as seen in the Federal Vision movement. Brunner emphasized the existential encounter between God and humanity in **revelation**, rejecting rigid covenantal frameworks that, in his view, undermined the dynamic and personal nature of the divine-human relationship.

- "The relation between God and man is not a legal, but a personal relation." (The Divine Imperative)

## Key Works

- The Divine Imperative (1937)
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)
- Man in Revolt (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
    - Brunner insists that **revelation** is fundamentally a meeting between God and the individual, not a contractual arrangement.
    - He critiques any theological system that reduces the relationship to legal or forensic categories.
    - The divine initiative is always primary, with human response as secondary and derivative.
    - This approach stands in contrast to the Federal Vision’s emphasis on covenantal structure.
    - "God does not give us something, but Himself." (The Mediator)

2. **Critique of Monocovenantalism**
    - Brunner rejects the idea of a single, overarching covenant that encompasses all divine-human relations.
    - He sees monocovenantalism as flattening the diversity and dynamism of biblical covenants.
    - The Federal Vision’s approach is viewed as too systematic and insufficiently attentive to existential realities.
    - Brunner emphasizes the discontinuity between **law** and **gospel**.
    - "The Law and the Gospel are not two stages, but two different things." (The Divine Imperative)

3. **Existential Approach to Covenant**
    - For Brunner, the covenant is not a static legal bond but an existential call to relationship.
    - He prioritizes the **personal** and **relational** over the juridical.
    - The covenant is realized in the ongoing encounter with Christ, not in formal membership or external signs.
    - This stands in tension with Federal Vision’s focus on objective covenant membership.
    - "Faith is not assent to a doctrine, but trust in a Person." (Dogmatics I)

4. **Rejection of Federal Vision’s Objectivity of the Covenant**
    - Brunner is wary of any theology that equates external participation with true covenantal relationship.
    - He stresses the necessity of **personal faith** and inward transformation.
    - The church is not defined merely by outward covenantal markers, but by the reality of faith.
    - Sacraments are signs of the personal encounter, not automatic conveyors of grace.
    - "The Church is the fellowship of those who have heard the call of God." (The Divine Imperative)

5. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Brunner maintains a sharp distinction between **law** and **gospel**, contrary to monocovenantal frameworks.
    - The law convicts and exposes, while the gospel reconciles and redeems.
    - He resists any synthesis that would blur the unique function of each.
    - This distinction is central to his critique of Federal Vision’s covenantal continuity.
    - "The Gospel is not a new law, but the end of the law." (The Divine Imperative)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s critique of **monocovenantalism** and his existential approach to **covenant theology** have influenced both Reformed and broader Protestant discussions on the nature of the divine-human relationship. His insistence on the **law-gospel distinction** and the primacy of personal encounter over legal frameworks stands in marked contrast to the Federal Vision movement. While not directly engaged with Federal Vision, Brunner’s theology provides a significant counterpoint to its emphases, shaping later debates on covenant, faith, and ecclesiology.
