# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann, a leading figure in twentieth-century **New Testament scholarship** and **existential theology**, did not directly engage with the **Federal Vision** controversy or the **monocovenantalism** debate as found in Reformed circles. However, his approach to **covenant theology** was shaped by his emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential encounter with the **kerygma**, rather than traditional covenantal structures. Bultmann’s theology reframes biblical covenants as existential events rather than as legal or historical frameworks.

- "The Old Testament is not a book of doctrine or of law, but a witness to the history of God’s dealings with men." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Argues that biblical language, including covenantal terms, is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
    - Sees the **covenant** not as a legal contract but as a proclamation calling for personal decision.
    - Rejects literal or historical readings of covenantal narratives.
    - Emphasizes the existential meaning behind biblical motifs.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the other-worldly in terms of this world." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with the Kerygma**
    - The heart of faith is the individual's response to the proclamation of Christ.
    - The **kerygma** transcends covenantal or legal frameworks.
    - Faith is not adherence to a covenantal structure but an existential act.
    - The New Testament’s message is about personal transformation, not covenantal continuity.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of man’s own possibilities and the acceptance of the possibility which comes from God." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Heilsgeschichte (Salvation History) as Objective Framework**
    - Critiques the idea of a unified, objective history of redemption.
    - Views biblical history as interpreted proclamation, not factual sequence.
    - Downplays the significance of **covenantal continuity** across redemptive history.
    - Focuses on the present encounter with God rather than past covenants.
    - "History cannot be understood as a closed system of cause and effect." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Anthropological Focus in Theology**
    - Centers theology on the human experience of existence before God.
    - Interprets biblical covenants as expressions of existential realities.
    - Moves away from legal or forensic categories in favor of personal encounter.
    - Sees the covenant as a metaphor for the human condition and divine address.
    - "The question of God is the question of the meaning of existence." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Critique of Traditional Covenant Theology**
    - Challenges the Reformed emphasis on **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - Argues these categories are foreign to the existential message of the New Testament.
    - Sees such frameworks as imposing alien structures on the biblical text.
    - Advocates for a theology rooted in existential response, not covenantal order.
    - "Dogmatic systems are always attempts to domesticate the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **covenant theology** profoundly influenced modern biblical interpretation by shifting focus from historical or legal frameworks to existential meaning. While his views stand in sharp contrast to both **Federal Vision** and **monocovenantalism**, his emphasis on the **kerygma** and existential encounter challenged traditional Reformed categories. His legacy endures in debates over the nature of biblical authority, the role of history in theology, and the interpretation of covenantal motifs in Scripture.
