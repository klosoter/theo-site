# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust understanding of **typology and fulfillment** within the framework of **covenant theology**. They emphasize the organic unity of **Scripture**, teaching that the **Old Testament types**—such as sacrifices, priesthood, and ceremonies—find their ultimate fulfillment in **Christ** and the **new covenant**. This typological reading underscores the continuity and progression of **redemptive history**.

- "The ceremonies and symbols of the law ceased at the coming of Christ, and all the shadows are accomplished; so that the use of them must be abolished among Christians." (Belgic Confession, Art. 25)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, especially Articles 25 and 33–35
- Heidelberg Catechism, Questions 19, 31, 66–82
- Canons of Dort, Main Points I–V (contextual references to covenant and fulfillment)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism: A Reformation Synthesis (Lyle D. Bierma)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is grounded in covenant unity**
    - The unity of **God’s covenant** binds the Old and New Testaments.
    - Types are divinely instituted signs pointing forward to Christ.
    - The promises given to the patriarchs are fulfilled in the gospel.
    - The church is one people of God across both covenants.
    - "We believe that the ceremonies and figures of the law ceased at the coming of Christ, and that all the shadows are accomplished." (Belgic Confession, Art. 25)

2. **Christ is the fulfillment of all types**
    - All Old Testament sacrifices and ceremonies prefigure Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Christ’s priesthood, kingship, and prophetic office are the realities to which types pointed.
    - The sacraments of the new covenant signify and seal what was typified before.
    - The substance of the gospel is present in both testaments, but fully revealed in Christ.
    - "The truth and substance of these is in Christ, without whom they would be of no value." (Belgic Confession, Art. 33)

3. **Ceremonial law abrogated, moral law upheld**
    - Ceremonial laws were shadows that expired with Christ’s coming.
    - The moral law remains binding as a rule of gratitude and life.
    - The abrogation of types does not abolish the law’s ethical demands.
    - The distinction between ceremonial and moral law is maintained.
    - "The ceremonies and symbols of the law ceased at the coming of Christ, and all the shadows are accomplished." (Belgic Confession, Art. 25)

4. **Sacraments as signs and seals of fulfillment**
    - New covenant sacraments (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) replace Old Testament types.
    - Sacraments signify Christ’s benefits and confirm faith in his finished work.
    - The Lord’s Supper is the fulfillment of the Passover, pointing to Christ’s sacrifice.
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of covenant inclusion.
    - "Baptism has come in the place of circumcision. Therefore infants as well as adults are to be baptized." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 74)

5. **Typology shapes redemptive-historical reading**
    - Scripture is interpreted through the lens of promise and fulfillment.
    - Typology reveals the progressive unfolding of God’s plan.
    - The unity of redemptive history is maintained from creation to consummation.
    - The church is called to read the Old Testament in light of Christ.
    - "The gospel was first revealed in Paradise, afterwards published by the patriarchs and prophets, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q. 19)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed hermeneutics**, especially in their approach to **typology and fulfillment**. Their articulation of the unity of the covenant and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture has influenced generations of theologians and confessional documents. This typological framework continues to inform Reformed preaching, sacramental theology, and biblical interpretation, emphasizing the coherence and redemptive purpose of the entire biblical canon.
