# Stephen G. Dempster (1953– )

Stephen G. Dempster emphasizes the organic unity of the **Old and New Testaments** through a robust understanding of **typology and fulfillment**. He argues that the **Hebrew Bible’s narrative structure** anticipates and finds its culmination in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**, with typological patterns serving as divinely intended foreshadowings within **redemptive history**.

- "The Tanakh is a messianic document, and its narrative and poetic structures are designed to create expectation for fulfillment." (Dominion and Dynasty)

## Key Works

- Dominion and Dynasty: A Theology of the Hebrew Bible (2003)
- "Typology and the Canonical Shape of the Hebrew Bible" (in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect, 2002)
- "From Many Texts to One: The Formation of the Hebrew Bible" (in Interpreting the Old Testament: A Guide for Exegesis, 2016)
- "Messianic Patterns in the Hebrew Bible" (various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Canonical Shape Guides Typology**
   - The **structure of the Hebrew canon** is theologically significant for understanding typological trajectories.
   - Typological patterns are embedded within the **arrangement and narrative flow** of the biblical books.
   - The canonical order creates expectation for **eschatological fulfillment**.
   - Typology is not arbitrary but rooted in the **final form** of Scripture.
   - "The shape of the canon itself is a theological statement, guiding readers toward fulfillment." (Dominion and Dynasty)

2. **Typology as Redemptive-Historical Pattern**
   - Typology reflects **God’s providential ordering** of history, not mere literary analogy.
   - Events, persons, and institutions in the Old Testament serve as **types** pointing forward to greater realities.
   - These patterns are **progressive**, culminating in the New Testament.
   - Typology is a means by which **God reveals his purposes** across the covenants.
   - "Typology is the divinely intended correspondence between earlier and later acts in redemptive history." (Dominion and Dynasty)

3. **Messianic Expectation in the Old Testament**
   - The **Hebrew Bible** is structured to foster anticipation of a coming **Messianic King**.
   - Key figures (e.g., Adam, David) function as **types** of the Messiah.
   - The narrative arc moves toward **promise and fulfillment**.
   - Messianic hope is woven into the fabric of Israel’s story.
   - "The entire narrative is messianically charged, pointing beyond itself to ultimate fulfillment." (Dominion and Dynasty)

4. **Fulfillment in Christ**
   - Jesus is the **climax of typological patterns** established in the Old Testament.
   - The New Testament presents Christ as the **fulfillment** of Israel’s story.
   - Typological correspondences are **actualized** in the person and work of Jesus.
   - Fulfillment is both **historical and theological**, not merely predictive.
   - "The New Testament writers see Christ as the goal toward which the entire Old Testament moves." (Dominion and Dynasty)

5. **Unity of Scripture**
   - The Bible is a **coherent, unified narrative** centered on God’s redemptive plan.
   - Typology demonstrates the **interconnectedness** of biblical texts.
   - The unity of Scripture is essential for understanding **fulfillment**.
   - Both Testaments must be read in light of the **whole canon**.
   - "Scripture’s unity is revealed through its typological structure and fulfillment in Christ." (Dominion and Dynasty)

## Legacy and Impact

Dempster’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **biblical theology**, especially regarding the **canonical approach** to typology and fulfillment. His emphasis on the narrative and structural unity of the Hebrew Bible has influenced both evangelical and broader academic circles. By foregrounding the messianic trajectory and typological coherence of Scripture, Dempster has contributed to a renewed appreciation for the theological depth of the Old Testament within the Christian canon.
