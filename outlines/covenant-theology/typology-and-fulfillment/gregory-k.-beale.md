# Gregory K. Beale (1949– )

Gregory K. Beale is a leading advocate for a robust, redemptive-historical approach to **typology and fulfillment** in biblical theology. He argues that the **Old Testament** is filled with **types**—persons, events, and institutions—that find their ultimate **eschatological fulfillment** in **Christ** and the **new creation**, emphasizing the unity and coherence of **Scripture** through **biblical-theological** interpretation.

- "The New Testament writers interpret the Old Testament in a way that reveals deeper, Christ-centered fulfillment, often through typological patterns." (Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is rooted in divine intention**
    - Typological patterns are established by God, not merely by human authors.
    - The **Old Testament** contains divinely intended anticipations of **Christ** and his work.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but grounded in the **canonical** shape of Scripture.
    - The **Holy Spirit** guides both the formation and recognition of typological connections.
    - "Typology is not merely retrospective but is built into the fabric of redemptive history." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

2. **Fulfillment is eschatological and Christocentric**
    - The ultimate fulfillment of Old Testament types is found in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Fulfillment often involves both an "already" and "not yet" dynamic.
    - Christ inaugurates the **new creation**, fulfilling and transforming Old Testament patterns.
    - The church participates in fulfillment as the body of Christ and temple of the Spirit.
    - "The New Testament sees Christ as the center and goal of all Old Testament typology." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

3. **Scripture interprets Scripture**
    - The **New Testament** provides authoritative interpretations of Old Testament types.
    - Later revelation clarifies and expands the meaning of earlier texts.
    - Intertextual connections are essential for understanding fulfillment.
    - The unity of the biblical canon is presupposed in typological interpretation.
    - "The New Testament writers are inspired interpreters of the Old Testament, showing how Scripture interprets Scripture." (Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament)

4. **Typology is historical and literary**
    - Types are real historical events, persons, or institutions, not mere allegories.
    - Literary patterns and motifs connect Old and New Testament passages.
    - Typology respects the historical context while recognizing deeper significance.
    - Theological meaning emerges from both history and inspired literary design.
    - "Typology is grounded in real history, but its significance is revealed through inspired literary patterns." (A New Testament Biblical Theology)

5. **Temple as a central typological motif**
    - The **temple** is a key type fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - The movement from Eden to the eschatological temple frames biblical history.
    - The presence of God with his people is the heart of temple typology.
    - The new creation is the ultimate fulfillment of the temple theme.
    - "The temple is a microcosm of God’s redemptive plan, culminating in Christ and the new creation." (The Temple and the Church’s Mission)

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially regarding the continuity between the **Old and New Testaments**. His rigorous defense of **typology and fulfillment** has influenced both academic scholarship and pastoral preaching, encouraging a Christ-centered reading of all Scripture. Beale’s emphasis on the **eschatological** and **canonical** dimensions of typology continues to inform debates on hermeneutics and the unity of the Bible.
