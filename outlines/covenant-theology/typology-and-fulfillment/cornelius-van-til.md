# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **typology and fulfillment** through the lens of **redemptive-historical revelation** and **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized that all **types** in Scripture find their ultimate **fulfillment in Christ**, and that the unity of **special revelation** is grounded in the self-attesting authority of the **triune God**. For Van Til, typology is not merely literary but is rooted in the ontological relationship between God’s plan and its historical outworking.

- "All the facts of history must be interpreted in terms of the plan of God as it is revealed in Scripture." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology grounded in the self-revelation of God**
   - Typology is not arbitrary but arises from God’s sovereign authorship of history.
   - The meaning of types is determined by their place in the unfolding of **special revelation**.
   - Types point forward to their **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ.
   - The unity of typology is rooted in the ontological Trinity.
   - "The facts and their interpretation are equally revelational." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Christ as the fulfillment of all types**
   - All Old Testament types are preparatory and find their telos in the person and work of Christ.
   - The unity of **redemptive history** is centered on Christ as the antitype.
   - Fulfillment is not merely predictive but ontologically grounded in Christ’s mediatorial role.
   - The Old Testament cannot be rightly understood apart from its fulfillment in the New.
   - "Christ is the fulfillment of all the promises and types of the Old Testament." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Presuppositional approach to typology**
   - Typology must be interpreted from within a Christian worldview, not from neutral ground.
   - The unbeliever suppresses the true meaning of types due to the noetic effects of sin.
   - Only by presupposing the truth of Scripture can one rightly discern typological fulfillment.
   - The antithesis between belief and unbelief extends to biblical interpretation.
   - "There is no area of neutrality in the interpretation of Scripture." (A Christian Theory of Knowledge)

4. **Organic unity of revelation**
   - The progress of revelation is organic, not mechanical or merely successive.
   - Types and their fulfillment are organically related within the covenantal structure.
   - The unity of Scripture is maintained by the one covenant of grace.
   - Typology is an aspect of the unfolding unity of God’s redemptive plan.
   - "Revelation is always organically related to the totality of God’s plan." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Analogy of revelation and the Creator-creature distinction**
   - Human knowledge of typology is analogical, reflecting the Creator-creature distinction.
   - Fulfillment in Christ is the archetype; types are ectypal and derivative.
   - The meaning of types is not exhausted by historical events but by their relation to God’s eternal purpose.
   - The analogical relationship safeguards against rationalism and mysticism in typological interpretation.
   - "All our knowledge is analogical of God’s knowledge." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** has profoundly shaped Reformed hermeneutics, especially in emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the necessity of a presuppositional stance in biblical interpretation. His insistence on the **self-attesting authority of Scripture** and the organic unity of revelation continues to influence contemporary discussions on biblical theology and the Christocentric reading of the Old Testament. Van Til’s legacy endures in the work of his students and in the ongoing development of covenantal and redemptive-historical approaches to Scripture.
