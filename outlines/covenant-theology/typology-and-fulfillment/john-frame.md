# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **typology and fulfillment** through his distinctive **multiperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity and diversity of **Scripture** as it unfolds God's redemptive plan. He sees typology as a legitimate, divinely intended pattern in **biblical revelation**, culminating in the person and work of **Christ** as the ultimate fulfillment of Old Testament types.

- "Typology is not merely a matter of literary parallelism, but of God’s own intention in history and revelation." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology as Divine-Historical Pattern**
    - Typology arises from God's sovereign orchestration of history.
    - Old Testament events, persons, and institutions prefigure New Testament realities.
    - Typological connections are not arbitrary but grounded in God's covenantal purposes.
    - Fulfillment in Christ is the telos of all biblical types.
    - "God himself is the author of both the type and the antitype." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

2. **Multiperspectival Interpretation**
    - Typology is best understood through normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
    - No single interpretive angle exhausts the richness of biblical types.
    - Multiperspectivalism guards against reductionism in reading fulfillment.
    - This approach encourages humility and openness to the complexity of Scripture.
    - "We need all the perspectives we can get to understand the fullness of God’s revelation." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - All typological patterns find their ultimate realization in Christ.
    - Jesus is the center of both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - Typology highlights the unity of the redemptive story centered on Christ.
    - The church’s reading of Scripture must be oriented toward Christ as fulfillment.
    - "Christ is the fulfillment, the reality, of all the types and shadows." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Scripture’s Self-Interpreting Character**
    - The Bible itself models and authorizes typological interpretation.
    - New Testament writers interpret Old Testament types under the Spirit’s guidance.
    - Typology is rooted in the canonical context, not external speculation.
    - The authority of typology rests on the authority of Scripture itself.
    - "Scripture interprets Scripture, and this includes its typological connections." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Covenantal Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - Typology demonstrates both continuity and discontinuity between the covenants.
    - Types reveal God’s unchanging purposes, while fulfillment shows redemptive progression.
    - The new covenant brings both correspondence and escalation of Old Testament types.
    - The church participates in fulfillment but awaits consummation.
    - "The covenants are organically related, with types pointing forward to greater realities." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** has shaped contemporary Reformed hermeneutics by emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ. His **multiperspectivalism** has encouraged theologians and pastors to read Scripture with greater depth and flexibility. Frame’s work continues to influence discussions on biblical theology, covenant theology, and the nature of **biblical authority** in the interpretation of types and their fulfillment.
