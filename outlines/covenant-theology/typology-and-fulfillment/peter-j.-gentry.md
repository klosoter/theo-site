# Peter J. Gentry (1952– )

Peter J. Gentry is a leading evangelical scholar whose work on **typology** and **fulfillment** emphasizes the organic unity of **biblical covenants** and the progressive unfolding of **biblical revelation**. He argues that **typology** is grounded in the historical and literary structures of Scripture, culminating in the person and work of **Jesus Christ** as the ultimate fulfillment of Old Testament patterns.

- "Typology is rooted in the historical and literary realities of the biblical covenants, not in arbitrary allegory." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant (with Stephen J. Wellum)
- How to Read and Understand the Biblical Prophets
- "The Use of the Old Testament in the Book of Revelation" (essay)
- "Typology in Biblical Theology" (essay in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology)
- "The Structure of Biblical Covenants" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is covenantally grounded**
   - Typology arises from the progression and structure of the **biblical covenants**.
   - Patterns in Israel’s history are established by God’s covenantal dealings.
   - The covenants provide the framework for understanding **promise and fulfillment**.
   - Typological connections are not imposed but emerge from the text’s covenantal logic.
   - "Typology is the result of God’s own design in the unfolding of the covenants." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Historical reality undergirds typology**
   - Types are real historical events, persons, or institutions in redemptive history.
   - These realities are divinely intended to prefigure greater realities in Christ.
   - Typology is not mere allegory but is rooted in the actual narrative of Scripture.
   - The historical grounding ensures the reliability of typological interpretation.
   - "Typology is not allegory; it is the recognition of historical patterns established by God." (Kingdom through Covenant)

3. **Fulfillment centers on Christ**
   - All typological patterns find their ultimate fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is the true Israel, the final Davidic king, and the substance of all Old Testament shadows.
   - The New Testament authors interpret the Old Testament typologically with Christ as the climax.
   - Fulfillment does not erase the type but brings it to its intended goal.
   - "The fulfillment of the Old Testament types is found in the person and work of Christ." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Typology is progressive and organic**
   - Typological patterns develop progressively through **redemptive history**.
   - There is an organic relationship between type and antitype, not a mechanical one.
   - The unfolding of typology is tied to the movement from promise to fulfillment.
   - This progression reflects the unity and diversity of biblical revelation.
   - "Typology is organic, growing out of the soil of redemptive history." (Kingdom through Covenant)

5. **Scripture interprets Scripture**
   - The Bible itself models and authorizes typological interpretation.
   - Later biblical texts clarify and fulfill earlier types.
   - The canonical context is essential for discerning legitimate typological connections.
   - Typology is a hermeneutical principle grounded in the unity of Scripture.
   - "The New Testament’s use of the Old Testament provides the pattern for typological interpretation." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter J. Gentry’s work has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical understanding of **typology** and **fulfillment**, especially through his emphasis on the covenantal and historical foundations of biblical theology. His approach has provided a robust alternative to both allegorical and purely historical-critical readings, influencing scholars and pastors in the Reformed tradition and beyond. Gentry’s insistence on the organic unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in fulfillment continues to inform discussions on **biblical theology** and hermeneutics.
