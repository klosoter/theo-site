# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **typology** within the framework of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the organic unity of **redemptive history**. They teach that the **Old Testament types**—such as sacrifices, ceremonies, and offices—find their ultimate **fulfillment** in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**, who is the substance to which all shadows pointed.

- "Beside this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to the people of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws, containing several typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits." (Westminster Confession of Faith 19.3)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 8, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 34–40, 191)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 20–26)
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is grounded in covenant theology**
    - The Standards interpret **biblical typology** through the lens of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Types are seen as divinely instituted signs pointing forward to Christ and his redemptive work.
    - The unity of the **one covenant of grace** undergirds the continuity between Old and New Testaments.
    - Typological elements serve to instruct and prepare God’s people for the coming Messiah.
    - "This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel." (WCF 7.5)

2. **Old Testament ceremonies and ordinances are types**
    - The ceremonial law is described as containing "typical ordinances" prefiguring Christ.
    - Sacrifices, priesthood, and festivals are explicitly identified as shadows of the substance found in Christ.
    - These types are temporary, intended for the period before Christ’s advent.
    - The abrogation of ceremonial laws is grounded in their fulfillment in Christ.
    - "All which ceremonial laws are now abrogated under the New Testament." (WCF 19.3)

3. **Christ is the fulfillment of all types**
    - Jesus is the "substance" to which all Old Testament types and shadows pointed.
    - His person and work accomplish what the types only prefigured.
    - The Standards emphasize the sufficiency and finality of Christ’s fulfillment.
    - The typological system culminates in the reality of the New Covenant.
    - "The covenant of grace was always administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances... all foresignifying Christ to come." (WCF 7.5)

4. **Typology is essential for biblical interpretation**
    - The Standards model a **Christocentric hermeneutic** that reads the Old Testament in light of its fulfillment in Christ.
    - They encourage the church to see the unity of Scripture through typological connections.
    - The catechisms teach believers to recognize Christ in the types and shadows of the Old Testament.
    - Typology safeguards against both legalism and antinomianism by rooting ethics and worship in Christ’s finished work.
    - "The outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption, are his ordinances... all which are made effectual to the elect for salvation." (WSC Q.88)

5. **Typology underscores the unity and progress of redemptive history**
    - The Standards affirm the **organic progression** from promise to fulfillment in God’s plan.
    - They teach that the church under the Old Testament and the church under the New Testament are essentially one people of God.
    - Typology demonstrates God’s faithfulness and the reliability of his promises.
    - The fulfillment of types in Christ marks the climax of redemptive history.
    - "Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance, was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments." (WCF 7.6)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology’s** understanding of typology and fulfillment, providing a framework for reading the whole Bible as a unified story centered on Christ. Their articulation of **covenant theology** and typological fulfillment has influenced generations of pastors, theologians, and confessional documents. The Standards’ approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on biblical theology, hermeneutics, and the relationship between the Testaments. Their legacy endures in the ongoing emphasis on Christ as the center and goal of all Scripture.
