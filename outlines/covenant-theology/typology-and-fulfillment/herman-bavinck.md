# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** is rooted in his commitment to the organic unity of **redemptive history** and the progressive unfolding of **revelation**. He sees biblical types as divinely intended correspondences that find their ultimate realization in **Christ** and the **new covenant**, emphasizing both continuity and escalation between the **Old and New Testaments**.

- "The New Testament is concealed in the Old, and the Old is revealed in the New." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:448)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 4: Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation
- "The Catholicity of Christianity and the Church" (essay)
- Biblical and Religious Psychology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - Scripture unfolds as a single, divinely orchestrated story.
    - Types are not arbitrary but arise from God’s sovereign design in history.
    - The Old and New Testaments are inseparably linked in their witness to redemption.
    - Fulfillment in Christ is the culmination, not the abolition, of typological patterns.
    - "Revelation is the interpretation of history, and history is the realization of revelation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:372)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - All types ultimately point to and are fulfilled in the person and work of Christ.
    - Christ is the substance to which all shadows and figures in the Old Testament refer.
    - The typological relationship is not merely predictive but participatory in Christ’s reality.
    - The new covenant brings the reality to which the types aspired.
    - "Christ is the antitype, the fulfillment, the reality of all Old Testament types and shadows." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3:222)

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s self-disclosure is gradual, moving from promise to fulfillment.
    - Types serve as preparatory stages in the unfolding of redemption.
    - Each stage in redemptive history builds upon and surpasses the previous.
    - Fulfillment does not negate the type but brings it to its intended goal.
    - "The Old Testament is promise; the New Testament is fulfillment." (Reformed Dogmatics, 1:340)

4. **Covenantal Structure**
    - Typology is grounded in the unity and progression of the **covenants**.
    - The covenants provide the framework for understanding the movement from type to fulfillment.
    - The church is the continuation and fulfillment of Israel in Christ.
    - The sacraments of the new covenant correspond to and surpass Old Testament types.
    - "The covenant of grace runs through both Testaments, uniting them in one redemptive purpose." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3:224)

5. **Historical Realism of Types**
    - Types are real historical events, persons, or institutions, not mere allegories.
    - God’s providence ensures that history itself is shaped to bear typological significance.
    - Typology respects the literal sense of Scripture while recognizing deeper fulfillment.
    - The reality of fulfillment does not diminish the historical value of the type.
    - "The types are not arbitrary symbols, but realities ordained by God to foreshadow the coming Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4:448)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust doctrine of **typology and fulfillment** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its insistence on the organic unity of **redemptive history**. His Christ-centered approach to the relationship between the Testaments has influenced generations of theologians and preachers. Bavinck’s careful balance of continuity and escalation in typology remains a touchstone for contemporary discussions on biblical interpretation and covenant theology.
