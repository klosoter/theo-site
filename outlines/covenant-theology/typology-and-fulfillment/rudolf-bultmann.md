# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **typology and fulfillment** through the lens of his program of **demythologization**, emphasizing existential interpretation over traditional historical or typological readings. He argued that the **New Testament’s** use of Old Testament motifs is not about predictive fulfillment but about expressing the **kerygma**—the proclamation of Christ—in existential terms relevant to the hearer. For Bultmann, the significance of biblical typology lies in its power to confront individuals with the call to authentic existence, not in a literal correspondence between Old and New Testament events.

- "The Old Testament is not a book of prophecies which are fulfilled in the New Testament, but a witness to the history of Israel, which is interpreted in the New Testament as a prefiguration of the Christ-event." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth)
- Theology of the New Testament
- History and Eschatology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - The biblical text contains mythological elements that must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - Typological patterns are not supernatural predictions but existential symbols.
    - The focus is on the existential message rather than historical fulfillment.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the true meaning behind biblical imagery.
    - "What matters is not the mythological world picture but the existential understanding of human existence." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Typology**
    - Typology is meaningful as it addresses the existential situation of the reader.
    - The fulfillment is not historical but existential, realized in the individual's encounter with the kerygma.
    - Old Testament figures serve as paradigms for authentic existence, not as literal types.
    - The Christ-event is interpreted as the decisive moment for authentic human response.
    - "The real content of the typological interpretation is the existential decision to which the kerygma calls man." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Predictive Prophecy**
    - Bultmann denies that Old Testament texts are direct predictions of New Testament events.
    - Fulfillment language is a theological interpretation, not a historical correspondence.
    - The New Testament reinterprets Israel’s history in light of the Christ-event.
    - Prophecy is understood as proclamation, not foretelling.
    - "The Old Testament is not a book of prophecies which are fulfilled in the New Testament." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the heart of the New Testament message.
    - Typology serves to illuminate the existential significance of the kerygma.
    - Fulfillment is realized in the present encounter with the preached word.
    - The Christ-event is the interpretive key for all Scripture.
    - "The kerygma alone is the word of God, and it alone confronts man with the demand for decision." (Kerygma and Myth)

5. **Historical-Critical Method**
    - Bultmann employs rigorous historical criticism to distinguish myth from history.
    - Typological readings are subjected to critical scrutiny regarding their historical plausibility.
    - The meaning of Scripture is not tied to historical events but to existential truth.
    - The historical Jesus is less important than the existential message of the Christ proclaimed.
    - "Faith does not rest on the historical Jesus but on the proclamation of the risen Lord." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** profoundly shaped twentieth-century biblical scholarship, especially in the realm of **existential theology** and the use of the **historical-critical method**. His emphasis on demythologization challenged traditional views of prophecy and typology, shifting the focus from predictive fulfillment to existential encounter. While controversial among confessional theologians, his work remains foundational for discussions on the relationship between **Scripture, history, and faith** in modern theology.
