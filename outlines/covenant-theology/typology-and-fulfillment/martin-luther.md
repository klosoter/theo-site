# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther approached **typology** as a Christ-centered reading of Scripture, emphasizing that the Old Testament finds its true meaning and **fulfillment** in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**. For Luther, the entire biblical narrative is unified by the promise and realization of the **gospel**, with Old Testament types serving as anticipations of the New Testament realities revealed in Christ.

- "All the stories of Holy Writ, if viewed aright, point to Christ." (Luther’s Works, 22:119)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis
- Preface to the Old Testament (1523)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 22: Sermons on Gospel of John
- Table Talk

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Typology**
    - All **types** in the Old Testament ultimately point to Christ as their fulfillment.
    - The unity of Scripture is grounded in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Typological interpretation is valid only when it leads to the proclamation of the gospel.
    - Christ is the "center and star" around which all Scripture revolves.
    - "Take Christ from the Scriptures, and what more will you find in them?" (Preface to the Old Testament)

2. **Promise and Fulfillment Structure**
    - The Old Testament is fundamentally a book of **promises** awaiting fulfillment.
    - The New Testament reveals the realization of these promises in Christ.
    - Typology demonstrates the continuity of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The law and the prophets serve as shadows pointing to the substance found in Christ.
    - "The Old Testament is the book of the promises of God, and the New Testament is the book of the fulfillment of these promises." (Preface to the Old Testament)

3. **Literal and Spiritual Senses**
    - Luther affirms the **literal sense** as foundational but allows for a spiritual (typological) reading centered on Christ.
    - He rejects allegory that is not grounded in the text or does not lead to Christ.
    - The spiritual sense is valid when it arises naturally from the literal sense.
    - Typology is distinguished from speculative allegory by its focus on Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "The right way to read the Scriptures is to look for Christ in them." (Table Talk)

4. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Typology illustrates the distinction between **law** (types, shadows) and **gospel** (fulfillment in Christ).
    - The law prepares for and points to the gospel, but cannot save.
    - Fulfillment in Christ brings the reality to which the types pointed.
    - The distinction safeguards the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - "Whatever is written of Christ serves to comfort and strengthen our faith." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Scripture’s Clarity and Unity**
    - The clarity of Scripture is revealed in its testimony to Christ through types and fulfillment.
    - All parts of Scripture, though diverse, are unified in their witness to the gospel.
    - Typology is a means by which the unity and coherence of the biblical narrative is displayed.
    - The Holy Spirit illumines the reader to see Christ as the fulfillment of all types.
    - "Scripture is its own light; it makes itself plain and clear." (Preface to the Old Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s **Christocentric hermeneutic** profoundly shaped Protestant approaches to typology and fulfillment, emphasizing the unity of the Old and New Testaments in the person of Christ. His insistence on the centrality of the gospel and the distinction between law and gospel became foundational for later Reformed and Lutheran biblical interpretation. Luther’s approach continues to influence contemporary discussions on biblical theology, typology, and the interpretation of Scripture within the broader Christian tradition.
