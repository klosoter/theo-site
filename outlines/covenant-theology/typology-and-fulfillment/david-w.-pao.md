# David W. Pao (1966– )

David W. Pao is a leading contemporary scholar on **biblical typology**, especially as it relates to the **fulfillment of Old Testament patterns in the New Testament**. He emphasizes the continuity of **redemptive history**, arguing that the New Testament authors intentionally interpret Israel’s Scriptures in light of **Christological fulfillment** and the **inauguration of the new covenant**. Pao’s work highlights the theological coherence and narrative unity of Scripture through typological interpretation.

- "Typology is not merely a literary device but a theological conviction rooted in the belief that God’s redemptive plan unfolds consistently throughout history." ("Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus")

## Key Works

- Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus (2000)
- "The Use of Scripture in the Acts of the Apostles" in Hearing the Old Testament in the New Testament (2006)
- "Let the Reader Understand: Reader-Response Criticism and the Gospel of Mark" (1995)
- "Scripture and Tradition in the Letters to Timothy and Titus" (2012)
- "The Church as the New Temple in Acts" in Heaven on Earth: The Temple in Biblical Theology (2004)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology as Theological Interpretation**
    - Typology is grounded in the conviction that **God’s actions in history** are purposeful and patterned.
    - The New Testament writers discern **divinely intended correspondences** between Old Testament events and Christ.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but arises from the **canonical context** and narrative trajectory of Scripture.
    - It serves to reveal the **unity of God’s redemptive plan** across both Testaments.
    - "Typology presupposes a theological worldview in which God’s dealings with his people are consistent and purposeful." (Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus)

2. **Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Jesus is the **climactic fulfillment** of Old Testament types, especially in relation to the **Isaianic New Exodus**.
    - The New Testament presents Christ as the realization of **Israel’s story** and prophetic hopes.
    - Fulfillment is not merely predictive but **participatory**, as believers are incorporated into Christ.
    - The church’s identity is shaped by its participation in the **fulfilled realities** anticipated in the Old Testament.
    - "The Isaianic New Exodus finds its ultimate realization in the person and work of Jesus." (Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus)

3. **Scripture’s Narrative Unity**
    - The Bible is read as a **coherent narrative** with a unified redemptive-historical plot.
    - Typological interpretation highlights the **progressive unfolding** of God’s promises.
    - The New Testament’s use of the Old Testament is rooted in a **shared theological vision**.
    - This unity is essential for understanding the **mission of the church** in Acts and beyond.
    - "The narrative unity of Scripture is presupposed in the apostolic proclamation." (Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus)

4. **Ecclesiological Implications of Typology**
    - The church is depicted as the **new Israel** and the locus of God’s fulfilled promises.
    - Typology shapes the church’s **self-understanding** as the continuation of God’s covenant people.
    - The **temple motif** in Acts illustrates the church’s role as the dwelling place of God’s Spirit.
    - Ecclesiology is inseparable from the **typological fulfillment** of Old Testament institutions.
    - "The church is portrayed as the new temple, embodying the fulfillment of Old Testament hopes." (Heaven on Earth: The Temple in Biblical Theology)

5. **Missional Orientation of Fulfillment**
    - Fulfillment in Christ leads to the **expansion of God’s people** to include the nations.
    - Typology undergirds the **universal mission** of the church as seen in Acts.
    - The **Isaianic vision** of salvation reaching the ends of the earth is realized in the apostolic mission.
    - The church’s mission is both a fulfillment and continuation of Old Testament expectations.
    - "The Isaianic new exodus provides the theological foundation for the church’s mission to the Gentiles." (Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus)

## Legacy and Impact

David W. Pao has significantly shaped contemporary understanding of **typology and fulfillment** by demonstrating the theological depth and narrative coherence of the New Testament’s use of the Old Testament. His scholarship has influenced both academic and ecclesial readings of Acts, especially regarding the **Isaianic New Exodus** and the church’s identity. Pao’s work continues to inform discussions on **biblical theology**, hermeneutics, and the mission of the church in redemptive history.
