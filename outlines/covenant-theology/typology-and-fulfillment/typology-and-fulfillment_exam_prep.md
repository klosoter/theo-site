### TITLE
From Shadow to Substance: Divine Authorial Intent, Covenant History, and the Logic of Typology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: how to define and regulate biblical typology so that claims of fulfillment in Christ are textually warranted, theologically coherent, and nonarbitrary under **divine authorship**.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, Meredith Kline, Henri de Lubac.
- Traditions: Patristic figural exegesis, medieval fourfold sense, Reformed **federal theology** and **redemptive-historical** method, modern ressourcement and theological interpretation.
- Debates:
  - Internal: literal sense and **sensus plenior**, authorial intent and **divine authorship**, criteria for typology, scope of **Christotelic hermeneutic**.
  - External: historical-criticism and anti-typological skepticism, dispensational discontinuity, Jewish–Christian disputes over fulfillment.
  - Contemporary: retrievals of figural reading, canonical intertextuality, charges of supersessionism, ethics of application.
- Position: Typology is the divinely intended, covenantally embedded patterning of history whereby earlier persons, events, and institutions prefigure and are escalated in Christ and his body; it belongs to the **sensus literalis** under **divine authorship**, governed by canonical usage and the **covenantal structure** of Scripture.

### ESSAY
Typology names the recognition that God orders the actual events, persons, and institutions of redemptive history to prefigure and anticipate later, climactic realities in Christ. It is not a free association of ideas but a hermeneutic grounded in **divine authorship** and **providence**, in which earlier realities are themselves divinely designed signs that correspond to and are surpassed by their antitypical fulfillment. A type is a historical reality embedded in a covenantal economy that, by God’s design, carries forward a pattern brought to its telos in Christ and the new creation. Fulfillment is not a semantic trick but the eschatological actualization of these patterns in the person and work of Jesus, in the constitution of the church as his body, and in the descent of the Spirit. To defend typology as intrinsic to the **sensus literalis** is to affirm that Scripture’s literal sense is what God intended through its human authors and through the events themselves, and that God’s intention includes both the immediate meaning in its original horizon and its place within the teleology of the canon.

The patristic foundation for this account is Augustine. Writing amid the anti-Manichaean controversies and catechetical needs of a post-Constantinian church, Augustine framed interpretation in terms of signs and things, with Scripture as the divinely given signum leading to the res which is God and the charity that binds the city of God. In On Christian Doctrine and the City of God he articulates the classic maxim that the New is hidden in the Old and the Old is unveiled in the New. For Augustine, Israel’s institutions are figurae of Christ and the totus Christus. He distinguishes between the carnal observance of the old signs and their spiritual end, insisting that the old institutions were good as shadows ordered to the substance of Christ. The conceptual contribution is decisive: he situates typology within salvation history rather than mere wordplay, and submits figural meaning to the rule of faith and the end of love. Yet Augustine also opened the door to exuberant allegorization when the moral end could not be secured by the surface narrative. The examiner will ask whether Augustinian figuration risks subjectivity. The answer is that Augustine himself provides constraints: figuration must cohere with the creed, serve charity, and arise from the economy of God, but these controls need further sharpening in terms of historical correspondence and covenantal structure. Augustine’s impulse is right, but his method requires the later development that ties spiritual meaning more strictly to the realities of God’s economy.

Thomas Aquinas supplied the metaphysical and hermeneutical precision that Augustinian instincts lacked. In the Summa Theologiae he articulates the multiple senses of Scripture while defending the primacy of the literal sense. His crucial move is to redefine the literal sense as what the divine author intends through words and through things. Because God is the author of reality, historical events can be divinely intended to signify other realities. This is the theological warrant for typology as a species of the spiritual sense, which for Thomas is founded on the literal. The crossing of the Red Sea is a real event that literally occurred and, because God authors history, it also literally signifies baptism under the spiritual sense. Aquinas secures two controls that remain essential. First, the authority of the senses of Scripture is not parallel or competitive. The spiritual sense depends on God’s intention in the realities themselves, not on a reader’s ingenuity. Second, the Christological and ecclesial orientation of the spiritual sense is fixed. The spiritual sense always concerns what Christ and the church are and do. Against the historical-critical charge that typology is a pious projection, Aquinas offers a doctrine of God and creation in which **providence** orders beings to signify beyond themselves without erasing their integrity. The examiner may press whether Aquinas permits unlimited spiritual senses. The answer is no. Because God’s authorship is simple and wise, the signifying order of history is coherent and teleological. The canon is the arena in which that coherence is recognized. Aquinas’s insistence that the **sensus litteralis** has pride of place is the bulwark against invention, even as his account of things-as-signs grounds typology ontologically.

John Calvin, commenting across the canon and systematizing in the Institutes, receives the Augustinian and Thomist inheritance but recasts it in the key of **federal theology**. He champions the **sensus literalis** against medieval excesses, yet he embraces robust typology by locating it in the legal-cultic and monarchical institutions of Israel understood as shadows. Calvin’s doctrine of covenant continuity and discontinuity frames typology. The one covenant of grace is administered diversely across epochs. Thus ceremonial laws and the Levitical priesthood are divinely appointed types of Christ’s sacrifice and priesthood, and the Davidic kingship foreshadows the reign of Christ. For Calvin, the difference between typology and allegory is the difference between historically grounded institutions that God designed to foreshadow Christ and arbitrary readings that ignore the historical shape of the text. Hebrews supplies the canonical grammar: shadow and substance, copy and reality. Calvin brings methodological rigor by insisting on two criteria. Types must be grounded in covenantal institutions that the text itself marks as provisional or promissory. And the New Testament’s use of the Old consolidates the mapping from type to antitype. The examiner may object that this makes the New Testament a tyrant over the Old. Calvin’s response is that the Spirit who authored both testaments intended one **covenantal structure**, and that Old Testament authors themselves spoke of the insufficiency of their institutions and anticipated a greater day. Calvin’s negotiation of continuity and transformation remains the decisive Reformed template.

Geerhardus Vos develops Calvin’s instincts into a full **redemptive-historical** method. Working against both rationalist historicism and speculative dogmatics, Vos insists that revelation is organically connected to the unfolding of the history of redemption. Typology for Vos is not later Christian gloss but a feature of the progressive organization of revelation, in which God through successive epochs educates his people by repeating and transforming patterns. The exodus, the wilderness, the conquest, and the monarchy are not only events but morphing patterns with an inherent eschatological goal. Vos gives three distinct advances. He clarifies that typology is a form of prophecy-in-act. It is prospective because God ordered the earlier reality to point forward, even if human authors only dimly perceived the fullness. He anchors typology in eschatology: the antitype is not merely later, it is the intrusion of the final into the temporal. And he integrates typology with the corporate solidarity of Adam, Israel, and Christ. The examiner may ask how Vos avoids imposing later meaning onto earlier texts. Vos’s answer is the doctrine of **divine authorship**, the progressive shape of the canon, and the recurrent intra-Old Testament use of patterns. The prophets already reuse exodus and Davidic motifs in ways that show the patterning at work. Vos’s biblical theology guards against atomism and against speculative allegory by showing how the canon itself educates the reader in typological grammar.

Meredith Kline, building on Vos, supplies covenantal and ANE legal texture that tightens typological claims. He demonstrates that biblical covenants mirror ancient suzerain treaties, clarifying the legal and symbolic architecture within which types function. His temple mountain work shows how the garden, Sinai, Zion, and the end-time city form a single **temple typology** in which heaven-earth communion is staged and escalated. Kline’s doctrine of intrusion is especially vital. Israel’s theocracy is a typological intrusion of eschatological judgment and blessing into the flow of common grace history. This guards ethics and politics from misappropriation of typological patterns by showing that holy war and land sanctions are not normative for the church-age but are types of the final assize. Kline expands the repertoire of covenantal types beyond isolated persons and events to entire institutions and civic orders. He insists that typology arises where the text itself casts an institution as symbolic or temporary and ties it to the promises. His archetype-ectype distinction clarifies how the heavenly reality stands behind the earthly copy across the canon. The examiner may raise the concern that Kline’s intrusion theory dehistoricizes Israel. On the contrary, it prevents dehistoricization by honoring Israel’s unique covenantal role and by preventing anachronistic moral flattening. Kline stands as a decisive figure because he gives a juridical and cultic framework that restrains arbitrariness and protects the church from repeating Israel’s theocratic forms under new slogans.

Henri de Lubac, though not Reformed, must be treated because he catalyzed the modern retrieval of figural reading. In Medieval Exegesis he argues that the four senses develop a Christian metaphysic in which Scripture’s unity and Christological center are both secured and nourished. He criticizes historicism that confines meaning to original context and recovers a sacramental ontology in which created realities are ordered to communicate grace by participation. De Lubac rightly perceives that the separation of literal from spiritual, history from theology, dissolves the church’s reading of Scripture. His retrieval is a salutary warning against flattening the text. Yet the Reformed critic must note that de Lubac risks collapsing the **sensus literalis** into a generalized mystical totality, making control difficult. The solution is not to reject his insight but to locate it under Aquinas’s rule that spiritual senses are grounded in things intended by God, and under Vos and Kline’s rubric that the economy itself specifies the typological architecture. De Lubac is decisive for contemporary debates because his influence shapes theological interpretation of Scripture and the renewed appeal to figural reading across confessional lines.

With these figures in place, the debate layers can be integrated. Internally, Reformed discussions wrestle over authorial intent and **sensus plenior**. Some insist that typology must be limited to what the human author could reasonably have intended. Others argue, following Aquinas and Vos, that the single intent of the divine author includes meanings beyond the conscious horizon of the human author, yet within the teleology of the canon. The solution is to reject an either-or. There is a single communicative intention of the triune God realized through human authors. The human intention is not violated by a greater divine intent when the divine intent is latent in the covenantal structures and in the textual echoes that the Old Testament itself already develops. The canonical deployment of Hosea 11:1 in Matthew 2:15, for example, is not a hermeneutical mistake but an appeal to the Israel-son motif in which the exodus pattern recurs in the true Son. The control is the internal patterning already present. Another internal debate concerns scope. How far can typology go? The guardrails are clear. Types are ordinarily anchored in covenant institutions and promissory figures marked as provisional or symbolic in the text. Recurrence of a pattern within the Old Testament strengthens a typological trajectory. New Testament usage is normative where available. The analogy of faith prohibits types that undermine doctrinal loci. These guardrails exclude fanciful correspondences and secure a truly **Christotelic hermeneutic** rather than a Christ forced upon every detail.

Externally, historical-critical approaches often reject typology as after-the-fact theologizing. Here the doctrine of **divine authorship** and **providence** is the decisive counter. If God is the simple, wise Lord of history, he can design historical events to be both themselves and signs. The literal sense, under divine authorship, is thicker than modern historicism allows. In addition, the Old Testament itself exhibits typological recursion. The prophets reshape exodus, wilderness, and Davidic themes for future salvation. The return from exile is narrated in exodus idiom, yet consciously less-than-exodus, establishing a typological longing for a greater exodus. Seen within the canon’s compositional strategy, apostolic typology is not alien but climactic. Dispensational readings form another external pressure. By severing Israel and the church into distinct peoples with distinct promises, dispensationalism reduces typology to illustrative parallels. But Hebrews interprets the entire Levitical complex as shadow and copy. Ephesians 2 declares the one new humanity. The land promises are taken up into the Abrahamic promise of the world and the hope of new creation. Typology does not annul Israel but fulfills Israel in the Messiah, extending Abrahamic blessing to the nations under the risen Son of David. A third external challenge arises from Jewish–Christian relations. Typology can become a blunt instrument of supersessionism. The proper reply is to distinguish punitive replacement from eschatological fulfillment. Paul’s olive tree insists on continuity of covenantal identity while recognizing the mystery of hardening and future grafting. Typology affirms Israel’s priority as the historical womb of Messiah and the ongoing fidelity of God to his promises. The church, as the Israel of God, is not a gentile usurper but a Jew-plus-gentile reality in the Messiah who embodies Israel. If an examiner presses whether this dissolves ethnic Israel, the answer is no. It reconfigures covenant membership around Christ while leaving room for God’s faithfulness to his people according to the flesh in the eschatological future.

Contemporary debates focus on the retrieval of figural reading, canonical intertextuality, and the ethics of application. Theological interpretation of Scripture urges a return to premodern figuration, often appealing to de Lubac. The gain is a renewed sense of Scripture’s unity and Christological texture. The danger is detachment from the text’s covenantal and historical architecture. A Reformed typology welcomes the retrieval but insists on Kline’s and Vos’s controls. Canonical intertextuality can clarify typological signals. Echo, allusion, and repeated imagery within the canon are often the textual footprints of an intended pattern. Yet intertextuality cannot be a license; it must submit to the canon’s own construal of its story. Ethical use of types is fraught. Kline’s intrusion doctrine teaches restraint. Holy war was a type of final judgment, not a model for modern statecraft. The land as an inheritance type becomes the world, relativizing territorial theologies. Sabbath typology demands both moral continuity and eschatological rest fulfilled in Christ. The examiners may test whether this approach undermines contemporary ecclesial practice, for instance sacramental theology. The opposite is true. Typology undergirds sacramental realism. Baptism as antitype of the flood and the exodus is not mere symbol but participation by the Spirit in Christ’s death and resurrection. The Lord’s Supper as Passover-transfigured is a communion in the body and blood of the antitypical Lamb. Typology thus integrates sacramentology, ecclesiology, and eschatology under one **covenantal structure**.

The defended position can now be stated precisely. Typology is the divinely intended, covenantally embedded patterning of redemptive history, recognized within the canon itself and brought to fulfillment in Christ and his body. It belongs to the **sensus literalis** when literal is defined under **divine authorship** as the single, wise intention of God realized through human authors and through the events themselves. It is regulated by the economy God instituted and by the canon God gave. Augustine supplies the Christological orientation and ecclesial telos. Aquinas grounds the metaphysical possibility of things-as-signs and reasserts the primacy of the literal. Calvin specifies covenantal institutions as the field of types and subjects figuration to New Testament control. Vos unfolds the **redemptive-historical** logic whereby types are progressive and eschatological. Kline clarifies covenantal and cultic architecture, protecting typology from arbitrariness and ethical abuse. De Lubac warns against historicism and reawakens the church to figuration’s vitality, even as Reformed controls are needed to prevent subjectivism.

Several objections typically arise and can be preemptively answered. First, is this not just a baptized **sensus plenior** that allows anything later to be read back? No. The plenitude affirmed here is not a second sense detached from the text, but the fullness of the one literal sense under divine authorship, recognized through canonical development and covenantal patterning. The New Testament’s figural use of the Old is both exemplary and regulative. Second, does this model dishonor the human author? No. It honors the human author as the instrumental communicator of God’s design and respects the integrity of his historical context, while recognizing that he participates in a larger economy he could not exhaustively apprehend. Third, how do we distinguish typology from allegory? Allegory freely assigns meanings to textual elements irrespective of covenantal function or canonical development. Typology identifies divinely instituted patterns that recur in the history of redemption and are explicitly escalated in Christ and his people. Fourth, how can one avoid supersessionism? By defining fulfillment as Christ’s embodying and extending Israel’s story to the nations and by maintaining Paul’s olive-tree logic. The church is not a replacement of Israel but the expansion of Israel in the Messiah, with continued hope for the people according to the flesh. Fifth, how do we ensure doctrinal coherence across loci? By tethering typology to doctrines of God, Scripture, covenant, Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology, ensuring, for example, that the typology of priesthood upholds the once-for-all sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice and the priesthood of all believers.

Concrete cases secure the approach. Adam is a type of Christ, a public person whose obedience or disobedience constitutes many. The exodus is the paradigmatic type of salvation and judgment, culminating in Christ’s death and resurrection, the true Passover and Red Sea. The tabernacle and temple are types of God’s dwelling, fulfilled in Christ’s body and extended by the Spirit to the church and consummated in the new creation. The Sabbath spans creation to consummation, fulfilled in Christ’s rest and anticipated liturgically and ethically. The land is a type of inheritance that, through Abraham’s promise, expands to the world and finally the renewed earth. The Davidic kingship is a type of messianic reign that takes cruciform shape and universal scope. Each case is constrained by covenantal institution, Old Testament repetition, prophetic escalation, and New Testament ratification. The result is not a scattered pile of metaphors but an architectonic unity within the canon.

Adjacent loci sharpen the defense. Inspiration and canon secure the single intention of the **divine authorship** that permits things to signify. **Divine simplicity** secures the unity of that intention across diverse historical media. **Federal theology** supplies the administrative diversity in unity that underwrites typological variety. Christology locates every fulfillment in the person and mediatorial office of Christ as prophet, priest, and king. Ecclesiology receives typology’s implications for the identity of the church as the eschatological people. Sacramentology binds typology to visible words. Eschatology guarantees that types are not exhausted in the first coming but press toward the consummation where shadow gives way to unveiled glory.

What, finally, of method? Good typology is disciplined recognition rather than creative imposition. It asks: Is there a covenantal institution marked as symbolic or provisional? Does the Old Testament itself reuse and escalate this pattern? Does the New Testament authorize the mapping? Does the reading cohere with the analogy of faith? Does it protect the Creator-creature distinction and the economy of salvation? Does it avoid flattening Israel’s unique role? Does it guard against anachronistic ethics by honoring Kline’s intrusion? If the answers are yes, typology is not only permissible but required by fidelity to Scripture’s own pedagogy.

Typology and fulfillment, then, are not an optional homiletical flourish but the canonical logic by which God has taught his people. Augustine taught us to look from sign to thing in charity. Aquinas taught us that God authors things to signify beyond themselves. Calvin taught us to find types in the divine covenants and to let the New Testament name the antitype. Vos taught us to trace the organic progress of the **redemptive-historical** drama. Kline taught us to read Israel’s institutions within the legal-temple architecture of covenant, to restrain theocratic misprisions, and to see the temple pattern running from garden to glory. De Lubac taught us to resist the modern sundering of history and theology. Together they equip the examiner and the candidate to defend a nonarbitrary, theologically thick, pastorally rich account in which shadow yields to substance, promise to presence, and type to the crucified and risen Lord who is himself the Yes and Amen of God.
