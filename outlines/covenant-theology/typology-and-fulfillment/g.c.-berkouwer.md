# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **typology and fulfillment** with a strong emphasis on the **Christological center** of Scripture and the dynamic unity of **redemptive history**. He was cautious of speculative or allegorical uses of typology, insisting that all typological interpretation must be grounded in the **historical reality** of both the Old and New Testaments and oriented toward the **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ.

- "Typology is not a matter of arbitrary association, but of the real and historical connection between promise and fulfillment." (Holy Scripture)

## Key Works

- Holy Scripture (De Heilige Schrift)
- The Work of Christ
- The Return of Christ
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- Faith and Revelation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christological Center of Typology**
    - All typological patterns in Scripture find their ultimate meaning in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Typology is not merely literary but is rooted in the **redemptive-historical** movement toward Christ.
    - The Old Testament is not self-contained; its types anticipate and require fulfillment in Christ.
    - Christ is both the fulfillment and the interpreter of all typological structures.
    - "The Christ-event is the decisive fulfillment to which all typology points." (The Work of Christ)

2. **Historical Grounding of Typology**
    - Typology must respect the **historical reality** of both the type and the antitype.
    - Avoids allegorical or speculative readings that detach types from their historical context.
    - Emphasizes the **organic unity** of God's acts in history.
    - Sees typology as a movement within the actual events of **salvation history**.
    - "Typology is rooted in the real history of revelation, not in abstract ideas." (Holy Scripture)

3. **Promise and Fulfillment Structure**
    - The relationship between the Old and New Testaments is structured by the dynamic of **promise and fulfillment**.
    - Typology is a concrete expression of God's faithfulness to His promises.
    - Fulfillment in Christ does not abolish the Old Testament but brings its meaning to completion.
    - The **eschatological horizon** is essential for understanding fulfillment.
    - "Fulfillment does not mean the end of the Old, but its true realization in the New." (The Return of Christ)

4. **Guarding Against Over-Spiritualization**
    - Warns against reading hidden or mystical meanings into biblical texts.
    - Insists that typology must be discerned from the **textual and canonical context**.
    - Theological interpretation must be disciplined by the **self-witness of Scripture**.
    - Typology should not undermine the integrity of the Old Testament witness.
    - "We must not spiritualize away the concrete realities of redemptive history." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Typology is inherently forward-looking, oriented toward the **consummation** of all things in Christ.
    - The fulfillment of types is not exhausted in the first coming of Christ but points to the final **eschatological reality**.
    - The church lives in the tension of the "already" and "not yet" of fulfillment.
    - Typology sustains hope and expectation within the life of faith.
    - "The fulfillment is both present in Christ and still awaits its final consummation." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** has shaped Reformed hermeneutics by emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ. His caution against speculative typology and insistence on historical grounding have provided a corrective to both liberal and overly allegorical readings. Berkouwer’s influence endures in discussions of **biblical theology**, especially regarding the relationship between the Testaments and the nature of fulfillment in Christ.
