# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is foundational for understanding **typology** as an organic, redemptive-historical structure within **biblical theology**. He argued that the Old Testament’s types are divinely intended patterns that find their **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ, integrating **progressive revelation** and the unity of the **covenant of grace**.

- "The type is a prophecy in deed, the prophecy a type in word." ("Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline"
- "The Eschatology of the Old Testament" (Princeton Theological Review)
- Reformed Dogmatics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is rooted in redemptive history**
    - Typology arises from God’s sovereign ordering of history, not mere literary analogy.
    - Types are historical events, persons, or institutions that prefigure greater realities in Christ.
    - The connection between type and antitype is grounded in the unity of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Typology is essential for understanding the movement from promise to fulfillment.
    - "The typical is not accidental, but is woven into the very fabric of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Fulfillment centers in Christ**
    - All Old Testament types reach their climax in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Christ is both the substance and the goal of all typological patterns.
    - Fulfillment is not merely repetition, but escalation and consummation.
    - The New Testament’s use of the Old is governed by this Christocentric fulfillment.
    - "The New Testament is not merely a repetition, but the realization and fulfillment of the Old." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Typology is distinct from allegory**
    - Typology is historical and covenantal, while allegory is subjective and arbitrary.
    - Vos insists on the real, historical connection between type and antitype.
    - Allegory imposes meaning, but typology discovers God’s intended patterns.
    - Proper typology respects the integrity of both testaments.
    - "Typology is the divine prefiguration of realities to come, not a human invention." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Progressive revelation shapes typology**
    - Typological structures unfold as revelation progresses through redemptive history.
    - Later revelation clarifies and fulfills earlier types.
    - The movement from shadow to reality is central to understanding biblical theology.
    - The unity and diversity of Scripture are held together by this progressive pattern.
    - "Revelation is a process, and typology is one of its chief instruments." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Eschatology is intrinsic to typology**
    - Typology anticipates the eschatological fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - The Old Testament types point forward to the final realities inaugurated by Christ.
    - Vos sees the entire history of redemption as moving toward consummation.
    - The eschatological perspective is necessary for interpreting both type and fulfillment.
    - "The eschatological is not an appendix, but the very heart of the typical." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of **typology and fulfillment** has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in its redemptive-historical method. His insistence on the organic unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in all typological fulfillment remains a standard for evangelical and Reformed exegesis. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **covenant theology**, hermeneutics, and the relationship between the testaments.
