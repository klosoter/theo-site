# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached **typology** as a legitimate and divinely intended method of interpreting **Scripture**, especially within the context of **covenant theology**. He emphasized that **types** in the Old Testament are real historical events, persons, or institutions that prefigure and find their **fulfillment** in the person and work of **Christ**, maintaining a strong connection between the **Old and New Covenants**.

- "A type, therefore, is a designed prefiguration of a future person or event." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- Princeton Review articles on biblical interpretation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is grounded in divine intention**
    - Types are not arbitrary but established by God's sovereign design.
    - The connection between type and antitype is rooted in **redemptive history**.
    - Typology reveals the unity of **Scripture** across both Testaments.
    - The fulfillment of types in Christ is part of God's unfolding plan.
    - "The types of the Old Testament were designed by God to prefigure the realities of the New." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Distinction between type and allegory**
    - Types are historical and real, not merely symbolic or imaginative.
    - Allegory imposes meaning, while typology discovers divinely intended correspondences.
    - Proper typology respects the literal sense of the text.
    - Hodge warns against excessive spiritualization that undermines historical reality.
    - "A type is not a mere allegory, but a real prefiguration established by God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of all types**
    - All Old Testament types ultimately point to and are fulfilled in **Christ**.
    - The sacrificial system, priesthood, and kingship find their completion in Him.
    - The unity of **redemptive history** centers on Christ's person and work.
    - Fulfillment in Christ validates the typological structure of Scripture.
    - "The whole system of types finds its end and explanation in the person and work of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Typology supports covenantal continuity**
    - Types illustrate the continuity between the **Old and New Covenants**.
    - The promises and patterns of the Old Testament are realized in the New.
    - Typology affirms the progressive unfolding of **revelation**.
    - The church is seen as the continuation and fulfillment of Israel's typological role.
    - "The types serve to show the organic connection between the two dispensations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Typology safeguards doctrinal orthodoxy**
    - Proper use of typology protects against speculative or heterodox interpretations.
    - It anchors doctrinal development in the historical acts of God.
    - Typology upholds the authority and unity of **Scripture**.
    - Hodge insists on the necessity of scriptural warrant for identifying types.
    - "We are not at liberty to make types at our pleasure; they must be determined by Scripture itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge's approach to **typology and fulfillment** shaped generations of Reformed interpreters, especially in the Princeton tradition. His insistence on the historical reality and divine intention behind types reinforced the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ** in biblical interpretation. Hodge's careful distinction between typology and allegory remains influential in contemporary discussions of **biblical theology** and hermeneutics. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to covenantal continuity and the unity of redemptive history.
