# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray viewed **typology** as a divinely instituted feature of **redemptive history**, essential for understanding the organic unity of the **Old and New Testaments**. He argued that typological patterns are grounded in God’s intention and culminate in the **person and work of Jesus Christ**, all within the framework of **progressive revelation**.

- "The relation of type to antitype is one of divinely instituted correspondence and prefiguration." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Covenant of Grace" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- "The Unity of the Old and New Testaments" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "The Theology of the Sacraments" (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is grounded in divine intention**
    - Typological correspondences are established by God in the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Types are historical realities, not merely literary devices or allegories.
    - The Old Testament contains patterns that intentionally point forward to greater realities in Christ.
    - Typology reveals the unity and coherence of **Scripture**.
    "Typology is not a matter of human ingenuity but of divine ordination." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

2. **Fulfillment centers on Christ**
    - Jesus Christ is the ultimate antitype to which all Old Testament types point.
    - Fulfillment is not merely repetition but escalation and consummation in Christ.
    - The work of Christ brings the realities foreshadowed in the Old Testament to their intended goal.
    - Christological fulfillment validates the authority and reliability of the Old Testament.
    "The Old Testament finds its fulfillment and realization in the person and work of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

3. **Progressive revelation shapes typology**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively throughout **redemptive history**.
    - Later revelation clarifies and expands the significance of earlier types.
    - Typological interpretation must respect the historical context of both type and antitype.
    - The movement from promise to fulfillment is central to understanding **biblical theology**.
    "The progressiveness of revelation is the key to understanding the relation of type and antitype." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

4. **Typology safeguards the unity of Scripture**
    - Typology demonstrates the interconnectedness of the **Old and New Testaments**.
    - It affirms the continuity of God’s redemptive purpose across covenants.
    - The unity of Scripture is both theological and historical, rooted in God’s covenantal dealings.
    - Typology resists fragmentation of the biblical narrative.
    "The unity of the covenant of grace is attested by the typological structure of revelation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

5. **Typology is distinct from allegory**
    - Typology is based on historical events and persons, not abstract symbolism.
    - Allegory imposes meaning, while typology discovers divinely intended patterns.
    - Proper typological interpretation requires careful exegesis and theological discernment.
    - The distinction preserves the historical reliability of **Scripture**.
    "Typology is not to be confused with allegory; it is rooted in the facts of redemptive history." (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of **typology and fulfillment** has shaped Reformed approaches to **biblical theology**, emphasizing the organic unity and historical reliability of Scripture. His insistence on Christ-centered fulfillment and progressive revelation influenced generations of theologians and exegetes, particularly within the Westminster tradition. Murray’s careful distinction between typology and allegory remains a standard for evangelical hermeneutics, reinforcing the coherence of the **covenant of grace** across the canon.
