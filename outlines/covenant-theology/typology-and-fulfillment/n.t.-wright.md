# N. T. Wright (1948– )

N. T. Wright approaches **typology and fulfillment** through the lens of **Second Temple Judaism**, emphasizing the continuity between the **Old and New Testaments**. He contends that Jesus re-enacts and fulfills the story of **Israel** in himself, with the **kingdom of God** and **new exodus** motifs central to his reading of **Scripture’s narrative unity**.

- "Jesus was not simply a teacher of timeless truths, but the one in whom the long story of Israel reached its God-ordained climax." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

## Key Works

- Jesus and the Victory of God (1996)
- The New Testament and the People of God (1992)
- Paul and the Faithfulness of God (2013)
- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- Scripture and the Authority of God (2011)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology as Narrative Fulfillment**
    - Sees typology as rooted in the **overarching biblical narrative** rather than isolated predictions.
    - Argues that Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection **recapitulate Israel’s story**.
    - Emphasizes the **exodus** and **return from exile** as central typological patterns.
    - Maintains that fulfillment is not mere repetition but **eschatological climax**.
    - "Jesus believed himself called to do and be what, according to scripture, only Israel’s God could do and be." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

2. **Second Temple Jewish Context**
    - Insists that typological fulfillment must be understood within **Jewish expectations** of the time.
    - Highlights the importance of **apocalyptic imagery** and **prophetic hopes**.
    - Argues that Jesus’ actions and teachings are **intelligible only within this context**.
    - Sees the **kingdom of God** as the fulfillment of Israel’s story, not its abandonment.
    - "The New Testament writers believed that the long story of Israel had reached its climax in Jesus." (The New Testament and the People of God)

3. **Scripture as a Unified Story**
    - Views the Bible as a **coherent narrative** culminating in Christ.
    - Rejects readings that fragment the **Old and New Testaments**.
    - Argues that typology demonstrates **God’s faithfulness** to his promises.
    - Stresses the **continuity of covenant** across redemptive history.
    - "The early Christians saw themselves as living within the story of Israel, now brought to fulfillment." (Paul and the Faithfulness of God)

4. **Christological Center of Fulfillment**
    - Asserts that Jesus is the **embodiment of Israel’s vocation**.
    - Claims that all typological patterns find their **telos in Christ**.
    - Emphasizes the **incarnation, cross, and resurrection** as the definitive fulfillment.
    - Maintains that Jesus redefines **messianic expectations** through his mission.
    - "In Jesus, Israel’s God has acted climactically to fulfill his promises." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)

5. **Eschatological Realization**
    - Argues that fulfillment is both **already and not yet**.
    - Sees the resurrection as the **inauguration of new creation**.
    - Maintains that typological fulfillment points forward to the **consummation**.
    - Emphasizes the ongoing role of the **church** as the people of fulfillment.
    - "The resurrection is the launching of God’s new creation, the fulfillment of Israel’s hope." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Wright’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** has reshaped contemporary discussions of **biblical theology**, especially regarding the relationship between **Israel and the church**. His insistence on reading the New Testament within its **Jewish narrative context** has influenced both academic and pastoral circles. Wright’s work continues to provoke debate over the nature of **fulfillment** and the unity of Scripture, making him a pivotal figure in modern theological scholarship.
