# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas developed a robust account of **typology** within his broader doctrine of **Scripture** and **salvation history**. He understood Old Testament types as divinely ordained prefigurations, fulfilled in the **person and work of Christ** and the **sacramental life** of the Church, integrating typology with his **doctrine of analogy** and **eschatological fulfillment**.

- "The Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and the New Law itself is a figure of future glory." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially I-II, q.107; III, q.60–65)
- Catena Aurea (commentary on the Gospels)
- Commentary on the Psalms
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology as Divinely Ordained**
    - Types are established by **divine providence** to foreshadow Christ and the New Covenant.
    - The Old Testament contains **figures** (types) that are intentionally fulfilled in the New.
    - Typology is not merely literary but grounded in **God’s unified plan**.
    - The relationship between type and antitype is both **historical** and **theological**.
    - "The whole of the Old Law is a figure of the New Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.2)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of All Types**
    - Christ is the **substance** to which all Old Testament types point.
    - The events, persons, and institutions of the Old Testament prefigure Christ’s **incarnation** and **redemptive work**.
    - Fulfillment in Christ is both **historical** (in his life) and **sacramental** (in the Church).
    - The unity of Scripture is realized in the **mystery of Christ**.
    - "All the figures of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Christ." (Commentary on Hebrews, ch. 10, lect. 4)

3. **Sacraments as Typological Fulfillment**
    - The **sacraments** of the New Law are prefigured by Old Testament rites.
    - Typology explains the continuity and transformation from **Old Covenant signs** to **New Covenant realities**.
    - The sacraments both recall the types and effect what they signify.
    - The Eucharist, for example, is seen as the fulfillment of the **Passover** and **manna**.
    - "The sacraments of the New Law were prefigured in the sacraments of the Old Law." (Summa Theologiae III, q.60, a.3)

4. **Analogical Understanding of Fulfillment**
    - Fulfillment is understood through **analogy**, not mere repetition or identity.
    - Types are **imperfect participations** in the reality of Christ and the New Covenant.
    - The relationship between type and fulfillment respects both **continuity and discontinuity**.
    - This analogical approach safeguards the **transcendence** of the New over the Old.
    - "The New Law is contained in the Old as the reality in a figure." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.3)

5. **Eschatological Dimension of Typology**
    - Typology extends beyond Christ’s first coming to the **final consummation**.
    - The New Covenant itself is a type of the **heavenly glory** to come.
    - Fulfillment is thus **already/not yet**, realized in Christ but awaiting completion.
    - The Church lives in the tension between **fulfillment and hope**.
    - "The New Law itself is a figure of future glory." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **typology and fulfillment** shaped the medieval and post-medieval understanding of **biblical interpretation** in both Catholic and broader Christian traditions. His integration of typology with **sacramental theology** and **eschatology** provided a framework for understanding the unity of **salvation history**. Later Reformed and Catholic theologians alike engaged his approach, and his influence persists in contemporary discussions of **Christological reading** of Scripture.
