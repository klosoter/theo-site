# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **typology** and **fulfillment** emphasizes the organic unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **Christ** as the locus of all scriptural types. He insists that the **Old Testament** finds its true meaning in the **eschatological fulfillment** accomplished in Christ, particularly through his **resurrection** and the inauguration of the **age to come**.

- "The resurrection of Christ is the climactic, once-for-all fulfillment of Old Testament typology." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology" (in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- "The Usefulness of the Cross" (in The Glory of the Atonement)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is Christocentric**
   - All **biblical types** ultimately point to and are fulfilled in the person and work of Christ.
   - Typology is not merely predictive but is grounded in the **organic unity** of the covenant.
   - The **resurrection** is the decisive moment of typological fulfillment.
   - Christ is both the substance and the goal of all Old Testament patterns.
   - "The Old Testament finds its consummation in Christ, who is the antitype of all its types." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Progression**
   - Typology unfolds within the **history of redemption**, not as isolated symbols.
   - The movement from **promise to fulfillment** is central to understanding Scripture.
   - The **epochal events** (e.g., exodus, Davidic kingship) are preparatory for Christ.
   - Fulfillment is not merely repetition but an **eschatological advancement**.
   - "Redemptive history is the arena in which typology is both established and fulfilled." (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

3. **Eschatological Fulfillment in Christ**
   - The **resurrection** inaugurates the **age to come**, fulfilling Old Testament hopes.
   - Christ’s work is the **already/not yet** realization of eschatological promises.
   - Typological fulfillment is both present (in Christ) and future (in consummation).
   - The church participates in this fulfillment through union with Christ.
   - "The resurrection is the turning point of the ages, the beginning of the new creation." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Scripture’s Unity and Coherence**
   - The **Old and New Testaments** form a unified, coherent revelation.
   - Typology demonstrates the **continuity** and **progression** of God’s plan.
   - Fulfillment in Christ validates the **trustworthiness** of Scripture.
   - Theological interpretation must respect the **canonical context**.
   - "The unity of Scripture is grounded in the unity of God’s redemptive purpose." (Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology)

5. **Hermeneutics Governed by Apostolic Pattern**
   - The **apostolic use** of the Old Testament sets the standard for typological interpretation.
   - The New Testament authors interpret the Old Testament in light of Christ’s fulfillment.
   - Typology is not arbitrary but follows the **hermeneutical method** modeled in Scripture.
   - The church’s reading of Scripture must be shaped by this apostolic perspective.
   - "The apostles teach us how to read the Old Testament as fulfilled in Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of **biblical theology**, especially regarding the relationship between **typology** and fulfillment in Christ. His emphasis on the **resurrection** as the center of redemptive history has influenced generations of pastors and scholars. Gaffin’s careful articulation of the unity of Scripture and the apostolic hermeneutic continues to guide evangelical approaches to both exegesis and systematic theology.
