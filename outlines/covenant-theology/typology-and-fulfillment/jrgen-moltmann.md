# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets **typology and fulfillment** through the lens of **eschatology** and the **theology of hope**, emphasizing the dynamic and future-oriented relationship between the Old and New Testaments. For Moltmann, biblical types are not static prefigurations but are oriented toward the **future fulfillment** of God's promises in **Christ** and the coming **kingdom of God**.

- "The Old Testament is promise, and the New Testament is fulfillment, but fulfillment does not mean the end; it means the beginning of the new future." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- History and the Triune God (1991)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eschatological Orientation of Typology**
    - Typology is fundamentally oriented toward the **future** rather than merely the past.
    - The fulfillment of types is not exhausted in the first coming of Christ but points to the **ultimate consummation**.
    - Old Testament types are promises that generate hope for **eschatological realization**.
    - Typology is dynamic, inviting participation in God's unfolding future.
    - "Fulfillment is not the closing of history, but its opening to the future of God." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - All biblical types find their center and meaning in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the fulfillment and the guarantee of God's promises.
    - The resurrection is the decisive moment of typological fulfillment, inaugurating the new creation.
    - Christ's fulfillment is not static but continues to shape the church's hope.
    - "In Christ, the future of God has already begun." (Theology of Hope)

3. **Integration of History and Promise**
    - Typology connects **historical events** with divine promises, interpreting history as open to God's future.
    - The Old Testament is not merely background but an active participant in the drama of **redemption**.
    - Fulfillment is not repetition but transformation of historical reality.
    - The church lives between promise and fulfillment, embodying hope.
    - "History is not closed in itself, but open to the promise of God." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Participatory Hope**
    - Typology invites believers to participate in the movement from promise to fulfillment.
    - The church is called to live as a sign of the coming **kingdom**, embodying typological realities.
    - Hope is not passive waiting but active engagement with God's future.
    - Typology shapes Christian identity as oriented toward transformation.
    - "Hope draws the promised future into the present." (Theology of Hope)

5. **Critique of Supersessionism**
    - Fulfillment in Christ does not negate the ongoing significance of **Israel** and the Old Testament.
    - Moltmann resists any typology that erases the distinctiveness of the Jewish people.
    - The promises to Israel remain open and are part of the eschatological horizon.
    - Typology must respect the integrity of both Testaments in God's redemptive plan.
    - "The church does not replace Israel, but stands with it under the promise." (The Coming of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann's approach to **typology and fulfillment** has significantly influenced contemporary theology by reframing these concepts within an **eschatological** and hope-centered framework. His future orientation challenges static or purely retrospective readings of Scripture. Moltmann's work has encouraged theologians to see typology as an invitation to active hope and participation in God's ongoing redemptive work, while also fostering renewed dialogue between Christian and Jewish interpretations of promise and fulfillment.
