# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** is foundational for Western Christian exegesis. He sees the **Old Testament** as containing **types**—divinely ordained figures, events, and institutions—that are **fulfilled** in the **person and work of Christ** and the **New Covenant**. For Augustine, the unity of **Scripture** is revealed through the correspondence between **promise and fulfillment**, with Christ as the interpretive key.

- "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Enarrationes in Psalmos (Expositions on the Psalms)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Sermons (various, especially on typological readings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture**
    - The **Old and New Testaments** form a single, coherent narrative.
    - **Typology** demonstrates the divine authorship and intentionality of Scripture.
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of all biblical revelation.
    - The **Church** reads both Testaments as one story of redemption.
    - "The two Testaments are not opposed, but the New is hidden in the Old and the Old is made manifest in the New." (De Catechizandis Rudibus)

2. **Christological Fulfillment**
    - All **types** in the Old Testament point ultimately to Christ.
    - The incarnation, passion, and resurrection are the climactic fulfillment of biblical promises.
    - Christ is both the key to interpretation and the substance of fulfillment.
    - The **sacramental life** of the Church is grounded in Christ’s fulfillment of Old Testament types.
    - "Whatever was prophesied in the Old Testament concerning Christ is fulfilled in Him." (City of God, 17.3)

3. **Spiritual Interpretation**
    - Typology is not merely historical but has a **spiritual sense**.
    - The **allegorical** method uncovers deeper meanings intended by the Holy Spirit.
    - The **literal sense** is foundational but not exhaustive.
    - Spiritual interpretation leads to greater love of God and neighbor.
    - "The letter kills, but the spirit gives life." (De Doctrina Christiana 3.5.9)

4. **Ecclesial Application**
    - The **Church** is the continuation and fulfillment of Israel’s story.
    - Old Testament types often prefigure the life and sacraments of the Church.
    - The people of God are shaped by the patterns established in redemptive history.
    - The Church’s liturgy and sacraments are seen as antitypes of Old Testament realities.
    - "The events of the Old Testament were figures of us and were written for our admonition." (Enarrationes in Psalmos 41.12)

5. **Moral and Eschatological Dimensions**
    - Typology instructs believers in **virtue** and points toward the final fulfillment in the **heavenly city**.
    - The journey of Israel is a type of the Christian’s pilgrimage toward God.
    - Fulfillment is both present in Christ and future in the consummation.
    - Typology encourages hope and perseverance in the Christian life.
    - "All these things happened to them as types, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come." (City of God, 17.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s typological method shaped the **Western tradition’s approach to biblical interpretation**, influencing medieval exegesis and Reformation hermeneutics. His emphasis on the **unity of Scripture** and **Christological fulfillment** remains central in both Catholic and Protestant thought. Augustine’s integration of **spiritual interpretation** with ecclesial and moral application continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between the Testaments and the meaning of biblical fulfillment.
