# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** is grounded in his commitment to the unity of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ** as the fulfillment of the **Old Testament**. He interprets biblical types as divinely intended anticipations that find their true meaning in the **person and work of Christ**, while maintaining a clear distinction between **literal sense** and **spiritual application**.

- "For whatever is set forth in the Old Testament as a type or shadow, Christ alone is the substance." (Commentary on Colossians)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, and Isaiah
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew
- Calvin’s Preface to the Psalms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
    - Christ is the ultimate fulfillment of all Old Testament types and promises.
    - The **covenant of grace** is progressively revealed and culminates in Christ.
    - Old Testament ceremonies and figures are shadows pointing to Christ’s substance.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but rooted in God’s unified redemptive plan.
    - "The Law was given, in order to keep alive the hope of salvation in Christ until his coming." (Institutes II.7.2)

2. **Literal and Spiritual Senses**
    - Calvin affirms the primacy of the **literal sense** in biblical interpretation.
    - The spiritual or typological sense must be grounded in the text’s historical reality.
    - He rejects allegorical excesses that detach meaning from the text.
    - Typology is valid only when warranted by the text and the analogy of faith.
    - "Let us know that the true meaning of Scripture is the natural and obvious one." (Commentary on Galatians)

3. **Unity of the Testaments**
    - The Old and New Testaments reveal one **covenant of grace**.
    - Types and shadows in the Old Testament are preparatory for New Testament realities.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - Calvin sees continuity in God’s redemptive purposes across both Testaments.
    - "The Old Testament is a testimony of God’s favor toward the ancient people, as the Gospel is toward us." (Preface to the Psalms)

4. **Divine Intention in Typology**
    - Types are not accidental but established by God’s sovereign design.
    - The Holy Spirit inspired both the type and its fulfillment.
    - Calvin discerns types where the New Testament itself makes the connection explicit.
    - He is cautious about speculative typology not grounded in Scripture.
    - "We must not imagine types at our own pleasure, but follow the guidance of the Spirit." (Commentary on Hebrews)

5. **Pastoral and Ecclesial Application**
    - Typology serves to edify the church by revealing Christ throughout Scripture.
    - The fulfillment in Christ assures believers of God’s faithfulness.
    - Calvin applies typology to strengthen faith and encourage obedience.
    - He connects Old Testament types to the sacraments and worship of the church.
    - "Whatever is promised to us in Christ, was foreshadowed under the Law." (Institutes II.10.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s careful approach to **typology and fulfillment** shaped the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture. His distinction between literal and typological interpretation provided a safeguard against allegorical excess while affirming the richness of biblical symbolism. Calvin’s influence endures in Reformed hermeneutics, covenant theology, and Christ-centered preaching, making his contributions foundational for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
