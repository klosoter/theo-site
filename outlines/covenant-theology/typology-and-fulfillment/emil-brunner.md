# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached **typology and fulfillment** with a strong emphasis on the existential encounter between God and humanity, rather than a strictly historical or predictive schema. For Brunner, **revelation** is always personal and Christocentric, so Old Testament types find their true meaning only in the **event of Christ** and the ongoing **divine-human relationship**. He was critical of mechanical or allegorical readings, insisting that fulfillment is realized in the existential response to God's Word.

- "The revelation of God is always an event, not a system; it is the living God who meets us, not a typological pattern." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Key Works

- The Divine-Human Encounter (1943)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 1: The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Personal Encounter**
   - Revelation is not a static deposit but a dynamic meeting between God and the individual.
   - Typology is meaningful only as it points to the living Christ who encounters humanity.
   - Fulfillment is not merely historical correspondence but existential realization.
   - The Old Testament is preparatory, but its types are fulfilled in the event of Christ’s self-disclosure.
   - "Revelation is not information about God, but God Himself coming to us." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - All Old Testament types find their meaning in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
   - Christ is the center and goal of all biblical revelation.
   - Fulfillment is not a matter of prediction and outcome, but of Christ as the living answer to human need.
   - The unity of Scripture is grounded in Christ, not in typological systems.
   - "Christ is the key to all the Scriptures, the fulfillment of every promise and type." (The Mediator)

3. **Critique of Allegorical and Mechanical Typology**
   - Brunner rejected allegorical interpretations that obscure the existential message.
   - He warned against reducing typology to a set of predictive correspondences.
   - True typology must respect the historical and existential context of both Testaments.
   - Theological meaning arises from the encounter, not from abstract parallels.
   - "The danger lies in turning the living Word into a dead system of types and fulfillments." (Truth as Encounter)

4. **Existential Response as Fulfillment**
   - Fulfillment occurs when the individual responds in faith to God’s self-revelation.
   - Typology is actualized in the believer’s encounter with Christ, not merely in historical events.
   - The meaning of Scripture is realized in the present, not just in the past.
   - The Spirit applies fulfillment existentially, not just doctrinally.
   - "The Word becomes real for us only as we respond to it in faith." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Salvation History**
   - Brunner affirmed a real continuity between Old and New Testaments, centered on God’s initiative.
   - He also stressed discontinuity: the newness of Christ’s coming surpasses all types.
   - The Old Testament prepares, but does not predetermine, the Christ-event.
   - Fulfillment is both rooted in history and transcends it in the existential encounter.
   - "The old is not simply repeated in the new; in Christ, something radically new has come." (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **typology and fulfillment** influenced 20th-century theology by emphasizing the existential and Christocentric dimensions of biblical interpretation. His critique of mechanical typology challenged both liberal and conservative readings, urging a focus on the living encounter with God. While less systematic than some contemporaries, Brunner’s thought remains significant for discussions of **revelation** and the unity of Scripture in modern theology. His insistence on the primacy of the Christ-event continues to shape existential and neo-orthodox approaches to biblical fulfillment.
