# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **typology** within the framework of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the organic unity and progressive unfolding of **redemptive history**. He maintained that Old Testament types were divinely instituted anticipations of **Christ** and the **new covenant**, finding their ultimate **fulfillment** in the person and work of Jesus. Turretin’s approach carefully distinguished between legitimate typological interpretation and allegory, grounding typology in the historical and theological continuity of **Scripture**.

- "Types are certain shadows and images divinely instituted to prefigure Christ and his benefits, and to be fulfilled in him." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 12.12.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), esp. Vol. 2, Topics 12–13
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on the Old Testament and Christology
- Willem van Asselt, "The Federal Theology of Francis Turretin" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology is grounded in divine institution**
    - Types are not arbitrary but are established by God as part of his revelatory economy.
    - Only those types explicitly or implicitly recognized in Scripture are valid.
    - Typology is distinguished from mere allegory by its historical and theological rootedness.
    - The divine intention behind types ensures their certainty and fulfillment in Christ.
    - "Types are not human inventions, but divinely appointed signs of future realities." (Institutes, 12.12.2)

2. **Christ is the center and fulfillment of all types**
    - All legitimate types ultimately point to the person and work of Christ.
    - The Old Testament sacrificial system, offices, and events prefigure aspects of Christ’s ministry.
    - Fulfillment in Christ is both historical (in his incarnation) and eschatological (in his consummation).
    - The unity of the covenants is displayed in the typological correspondence between Old and New Testaments.
    - "All types have their truth and substance in Christ, in whom the shadows are fulfilled." (Institutes, 12.12.4)

3. **Typology is essential to covenant theology**
    - The **covenant of grace** unfolds progressively through typological structures.
    - Types serve as pedagogical tools, preparing God’s people for the coming Redeemer.
    - The continuity of the one covenant of grace is demonstrated through typological fulfillment.
    - The sacraments of the Old Testament are types of the sacraments of the New.
    - "The covenant made with the fathers was the same in substance, differing only in administration and types." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

4. **Typology safeguards the unity of Scripture**
    - Typological interpretation affirms the coherence and divine authorship of the whole Bible.
    - It reveals the interconnectedness of redemptive events across both Testaments.
    - Proper typology resists fragmentation of biblical history and doctrine.
    - The fulfillment of types in Christ validates the reliability of Old Testament revelation.
    - "The harmony of the two Testaments is seen in the correspondence of types and antitypes." (Institutes, 12.12.5)

5. **Typology is regulated by scriptural warrant**
    - Only those types that are identified or implied by Scripture should be recognized.
    - Exegetical discipline is necessary to avoid speculative or fanciful typologies.
    - The analogy of faith and the rule of Scripture guide typological interpretation.
    - The church’s tradition is subordinate to the authority of the biblical text in identifying types.
    - "We must not multiply types beyond what the Holy Spirit has set forth in Scripture." (Institutes, 12.12.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s careful articulation of **typology and fulfillment** shaped the trajectory of Reformed exegesis and **covenant theology** in the post-Reformation era. His insistence on scriptural warrant and Christocentric fulfillment provided a model for later theologians, influencing both confessional standards and biblical theology. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture.
