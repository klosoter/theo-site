# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper approached **typology** as an essential means by which the unity and progression of **redemptive history** is revealed, emphasizing the organic connection between the **Old and New Testaments**. He saw **fulfillment** in Christ as the culmination of God’s sovereign plan, where earlier types find their true meaning within the broader framework of **covenant theology** and the unfolding **kingdom of God**.

- "The Old Testament is not abolished in the New, but fulfilled, and in that fulfillment, its types and shadows find their true light." 

## Key Works

- "Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology" (1898)
- "Lectures on Calvinism" (1898)
- "The Work of the Holy Spirit" (1900)
- "Pro Rege: Living Under Christ’s Kingship" (1911–1912)
- "Our Worship" (1911)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
   - Scripture unfolds as a single, divinely orchestrated narrative.
   - **Typology** demonstrates the continuity between the Old and New Testaments.
   - Types are not arbitrary but organically related to their fulfillment in Christ.
   - The unity of **redemptive history** is essential for understanding biblical revelation.
   - "The Scriptures are not a collection of fragments, but a living organism, growing toward its fulfillment in Christ." ("Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology")

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment**
   - All Old Testament types and promises find their ultimate realization in Christ.
   - Christ is the center and goal of all biblical history.
   - Fulfillment is not mere repetition, but transformation and elevation in Christ.
   - The person and work of Christ illuminate the meaning of all prior types.
   - "In Christ, the shadows become substance, and the promises reach their yes and amen." ("Pro Rege")

3. **Covenantal Structure of Typology**
   - Typology is grounded in the successive administrations of the **covenant of grace**.
   - Each covenant era contains types pointing forward to greater realities.
   - The covenantal framework ensures the reliability and coherence of typological connections.
   - Fulfillment is always covenantal, not merely individual or isolated.
   - "The covenant is the golden thread binding the types to their fulfillment." ("Lectures on Calvinism")

4. **Sovereignty of God in Redemptive History**
   - God sovereignly ordains both types and their fulfillments.
   - Typology is not accidental but part of God’s providential design.
   - The unfolding of types to fulfillment displays God’s wisdom and faithfulness.
   - Human history is directed toward the consummation in Christ’s kingdom.
   - "Nothing in the history of redemption is left to chance; all is governed by the King." ("Pro Rege")

5. **Typology and the Kingdom of God**
   - Types prefigure aspects of the coming **kingdom of God**.
   - Fulfillment in Christ inaugurates the kingdom in a new and decisive way.
   - The church participates in the ongoing realization of typological promises.
   - The kingdom’s fullness awaits the final consummation, anticipated by Old Testament types.
   - "The kingdom is foreshadowed in the old, realized in the new, and perfected at the end." ("Our Worship")

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust articulation of **typology** and fulfillment has shaped Reformed approaches to **biblical theology**, especially in emphasizing the organic unity and Christocentric focus of Scripture. His covenantal and kingdom-oriented framework influenced later theologians such as Herman Bavinck and Geerhardus Vos. Kuyper’s vision continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between the testaments and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
