# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s theology of the **covenant** is foundational for later Christian thought, though he does not articulate a fully developed **federal theology** as seen in later Reformed traditions. His understanding of **divine law**, **redemptive history**, and the distinction between the **city of God** and the **earthly city** provides important groundwork for later discussions of **intrusion ethics** and the unfolding of **God’s justice** in history. Augustine’s approach to the relationship between the **Old and New Covenants** anticipates later debates about the temporary and typological nature of certain Mosaic laws.

- "The law was given that grace might be sought; and grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On the Spirit and the Letter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity and Diversity of the Covenants**
    - Emphasizes the continuity of **God’s redemptive plan** from Adam to Christ.
    - Sees the **Old and New Covenants** as distinct in form but united in purpose.
    - Argues that the **promises** of the Old are fulfilled in the New.
    - Views the **law** as preparatory for the coming of **grace**.
    - "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Questions on the Heptateuch)

2. **Typology and Temporality of Mosaic Law**
    - Interprets many Old Testament laws as **types** pointing to Christ.
    - Recognizes the **temporary** and **provisional** nature of certain Mosaic commands.
    - Affirms that the **moral law** remains binding, while **ceremonial laws** are fulfilled in Christ.
    - Sees the **judicial laws** as specific to Israel’s historical context.
    - "The sacraments of the Old Testament were signs of things to come; ours are signs of things already come." (Letter 138)

3. **Divine Justice and Human Society**
    - Distinguishes between the **justice of God** and the imperfect justice of human societies.
    - Argues that **earthly punishment** sometimes anticipates final judgment.
    - Sees the **city of God** as governed by divine law, in contrast to the **earthly city**.
    - Maintains that ultimate justice is eschatological, not fully realized in history.
    - "True justice is found only in that commonwealth whose founder and ruler is Christ." (The City of God)

4. **Grace and Human Inability**
    - Stresses the necessity of **divine grace** for fulfilling God’s law.
    - Argues that the **law exposes sin** and drives people to seek grace.
    - Maintains that human effort alone is insufficient for righteousness.
    - Sees the **covenant of grace** as the only hope for fallen humanity.
    - "Without the Spirit, the law kills; with the Spirit, the law is written on the heart." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Teaches that the **ultimate realization** of God’s promises is future.
    - Views the present age as a time of **pilgrimage** and anticipation.
    - Holds that the **fullness of justice** and peace will come only at Christ’s return.
    - Interprets Old Testament judgments as **intrusions** of final judgment into history.
    - "The two cities are mingled together until the last judgment separates them." (The City of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **covenant structure** of redemptive history and his distinction between the **city of God** and the **earthly city** profoundly shaped later Christian thought, including Reformed approaches to **covenant theology**. While he does not explicitly develop the concept of **intrusion ethics**, his understanding of typology, divine justice, and the provisional nature of Mosaic law laid groundwork for later formulations. Augustine’s influence is evident in the way subsequent theologians grappled with the relationship between law, grace, and eschatological fulfillment. His legacy endures in discussions of how God’s justice is partially revealed in history and ultimately consummated in the age to come.
