# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not directly engage with **Klinean covenant theology** or the concept of **intrusion ethics** as developed within the Reformed tradition. However, his broader theological framework, especially his views on **revelation**, **history**, and the **relationship between law and grace**, provides a critical contrast to covenantal approaches that emphasize divine administration of history and ethics. Tillich’s existentialist and ontological method reframes the meaning of **covenant** and **ethics** in terms of the human encounter with the **Ground of Being** rather than in terms of redemptive-historical epochs.

- "The question of the meaning of history is the question of the meaning of existence itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Ontology over Redemptive-Historical Structures**
    - Tillich grounds theology in the **being** of God, not in historical covenants or epochs.
    - He interprets biblical symbols existentially, rather than as markers of **intrusion** or typological discontinuity.
    - The **law-gospel** distinction is recast as the existential tension between estrangement and reconciliation.
    - History is meaningful as the arena of existential encounter, not as a sequence of covenantal administrations.
    - "God does not exist. He is being-itself beyond essence and existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Symbolic Interpretation of Covenant**
    - The concept of **covenant** is understood as a symbol of the relationship between God and humanity.
    - Tillich resists literal or juridical readings of biblical covenants.
    - The ethical demands of the covenant are interpreted as existential imperatives.
    - The focus is on the **ultimate concern** rather than on forensic or typological categories.
    - "A symbol participates in that to which it points." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Ethics Rooted in Ontological Estrangement**
    - Human ethical failure is seen as a manifestation of **existential estrangement** from the Ground of Being.
    - There is no place for a temporary "intrusion" of eschatological ethics into history.
    - The **New Being** in Christ is the answer to the universal human predicament, not a redemptive-historical epoch.
    - Ethics is universal and existential, not epochally or covenantally restricted.
    - "Sin is separation. Grace is reunion." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

4. **Revelation as Existential Encounter**
    - Revelation is the self-disclosure of the Ground of Being in existential encounter, not in covenantal administration.
    - The Bible is a classic witness to revelation, not a blueprint for redemptive-historical epochs.
    - The **Christ event** is the decisive moment of revelation, transcending all historical covenants.
    - Ethical transformation comes through participation in the New Being, not through typological intrusion.
    - "Revelation is the manifestation of the ground of being for human existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Universalism over Particularism**
    - Tillich emphasizes the universal scope of salvation and ethics.
    - He rejects the idea of special epochs with unique ethical standards (as in intrusion ethics).
    - The **Kingdom of God** is a symbol of ultimate fulfillment, not a temporary historical reality.
    - All humanity is addressed by the existential call to reunion with the Ground of Being.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the symbol for the fulfillment of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and ontological approach stands in marked contrast to **Klinean covenant theology** and the concept of **intrusion ethics**. His influence shifted theological discourse away from redemptive-historical and covenantal frameworks toward questions of **being**, **meaning**, and **existential estrangement**. While his theology does not directly address the technicalities of Reformed covenant thought, it provides a significant alternative paradigm that continues to shape discussions in systematic theology and philosophical theology.
