# Peter J. Gentry (1952– )

Peter J. Gentry is a leading evangelical Old Testament scholar whose work on **covenant theology** emphasizes the biblical-theological unity and progression of the covenants throughout Scripture. While not a direct proponent of **Klinean intrusion ethics**, Gentry engages with **Meredith Kline’s** framework, especially in relation to the structure and function of **biblical covenants** and the ethical implications of **divine judgment** and **typology**. Gentry’s approach seeks to ground covenant theology in close exegesis of the biblical text, with particular attention to **ancient Near Eastern treaty forms** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The covenants are the backbone of the metanarrative of the Bible, providing the structure by which God’s purposes in creation and redemption are accomplished." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 21)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Stephen J. Wellum)
- "The Biblical Covenants as the Foundation for Biblical Theology" (SBJT 2012)
- "Daniel’s Seventy Weeks and the New Exodus" (JETS 1999)
- "The Covenant of Creation" in God’s Kingdom through God’s Covenants (with Wellum)
- "No One Holy Like the Lord: Composition and Theology of 1–2 Samuel" (Contributions in Old Testament Exegesis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenants as the Structure of Redemptive History**
   - Argues that **covenants** provide the organizing framework for the entire biblical narrative.
   - Emphasizes the progression from **creation**, through **Noahic**, **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, **Davidic**, to the **New Covenant**.
   - Sees each covenant as building upon and clarifying the previous, culminating in Christ.
   - Stresses the importance of **historical context** and **ancient Near Eastern parallels**.
   - "The biblical covenants are the means by which God’s kingdom is established and advanced." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 22)

2. **Typology and the Ethics of Divine Judgment**
   - Recognizes the typological function of Israel as a pattern for later redemptive events.
   - Engages with **Klinean intrusion ethics** by examining the unique role of Israel in prefiguring final judgment.
   - Argues that the **herem** (ban) warfare is a unique, non-repeatable intrusion of eschatological judgment into history.
   - Maintains that ethical norms for the church are not directly derived from Israel’s conquest ethics.
   - "The conquest of Canaan is a unique event in redemptive history, not a model for Christian ethics." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 707)

3. **Covenant and Law: Discontinuity and Fulfillment**
   - Distinguishes between the **Mosaic covenant** and the **New Covenant** in Christ.
   - Argues that the law given at Sinai is fulfilled and transformed in the new covenant era.
   - Emphasizes the movement from **external law** to **internalized obedience** by the Spirit.
   - Rejects a simplistic continuity between Old Testament civil/ceremonial laws and Christian ethics.
   - "The new covenant brings the law to its intended goal in Christ, written on the heart by the Spirit." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 684)

4. **Covenant as Relationship and Representation**
   - Defines covenant as a solemn, binding relationship with representative and legal dimensions.
   - Highlights the representative role of **Adam**, **Israel**, and ultimately **Christ**.
   - Shows how covenants establish both blessings and sanctions, with ethical implications.
   - Stresses the relational and missional aspects of God’s covenant dealings.
   - "Covenant is the means by which God relates to his people and accomplishes his purposes." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 34)

5. **Biblical Theology Grounded in Exegesis**
   - Insists on careful exegesis of the biblical text as the foundation for covenant theology.
   - Utilizes **ancient Near Eastern treaty forms** to illuminate biblical covenants.
   - Integrates **biblical theology** with systematic reflection, avoiding speculative constructs.
   - Engages critically with both Reformed and dispensational traditions.
   - "Sound biblical theology must arise from the careful exegesis of the text in its historical context." (Kingdom through Covenant, p. 25)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter J. Gentry’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** by grounding it in rigorous exegesis and ancient Near Eastern background. His engagement with **Klinean intrusion ethics** has clarified the unique, typological role of Israel’s conquest and its ethical implications for the church. Gentry’s scholarship has influenced both Reformed and Baptist theologians, fostering renewed attention to the unity and progression of the biblical covenants. His emphasis on **biblical-theological method** continues to inform debates on the relationship between Old and New Testaments.
