# Stephen J. Wellum (1966– )

Stephen J. Wellum critically engages **Klinean covenant theology** and its distinctive **intrusion ethics**, especially regarding the relationship between the **old and new covenants**. He affirms the centrality of the **biblical covenants** for understanding redemptive history but challenges the sharp ethical and eschatological distinctions drawn by Kline and his followers, advocating instead for a **progressive covenantalism** centered on the fulfillment found in **Christ**.

- "Kline’s intrusion ethic, while insightful, ultimately fails to account for the organic unity and fulfillment of the covenants in Christ." (Progressive Covenantalism, 2016)

## Key Works

- Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants (with Peter J. Gentry, 2012)
- Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenant Theologies (editor, 2016)
- "Baptism and the Relationship Between the Covenants" in Believer’s Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ (2007)
- "Response to Kline and Horton" in Progressive Covenantalism (2016)
- God the Son Incarnate: The Doctrine of Christ (2016)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Progressive Covenantalism over Klinean Bipartite Structure**
   - Rejects the strict **law/gospel** and **works/grace** dichotomy of Klinean theology.
   - Emphasizes the unfolding unity of the **biblical covenants** culminating in **Christ**.
   - Argues that all covenants progressively reveal God’s redemptive purposes.
   - Sees the Mosaic covenant as typological, not fundamentally opposed to grace.
   "The covenants are organically related and find their telos in Christ, not in a rigid law/grace schema." (Kingdom through Covenant)

2. **Critique of Intrusion Ethics**
   - Questions the legitimacy of applying **intrusion ethics** as a hermeneutical key.
   - Argues that the ethical discontinuity posited by Kline is overstated.
   - Maintains that the Mosaic law’s civil and cultic aspects point forward to **Christ**, not to a suspended eschatological ethic.
   - Sees the ethical demands of the old covenant as transformed, not abrogated, in the new.
   "Intrusion ethics, while highlighting typology, risks fragmenting the unity of biblical ethics." (Progressive Covenantalism)

3. **Christological Fulfillment of the Covenants**
   - Centers the fulfillment of all covenant promises and ethics in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
   - Argues that **Christ** is the true Israel and the ultimate covenant mediator.
   - Sees the ethical life of the church as grounded in union with Christ, not in theocratic Israel.
   - Emphasizes the inaugurated eschatology brought by Christ’s first coming.
   "All the covenants reach their fulfillment in Christ, who is the substance to which the types pointed." (Kingdom through Covenant)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Covenant Ethics**
   - Affirms both continuity and discontinuity between the covenants, but not along Klinean lines.
   - Ethical norms are continuous in their moral core but discontinuous in their covenantal administration.
   - The new covenant brings transformation, not mere repetition, of old covenant ethics.
   - The church is not a theocratic nation but a new covenant community under Christ’s lordship.
   "The new covenant transforms and fulfills the ethical demands of the old, rather than simply suspending them." (Progressive Covenantalism)

5. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Development**
   - Recognizes the importance of **typology** in understanding the Mosaic covenant.
   - Argues that types are fulfilled, not merely set aside, in the new covenant.
   - Sees the land, nation, and law as shadows pointing to **Christ** and the eschatological people of God.
   - Typology serves the unity of Scripture, not its fragmentation.
   "Typology is essential for reading the covenants, but it must be governed by Christ’s fulfillment, not by a dualistic ethic." (Kingdom through Covenant)

## Legacy and Impact

Wellum’s work has significantly shaped contemporary discussions on **covenant theology**, especially among those seeking a mediating position between traditional Reformed and dispensational frameworks. His critique of **Klinean intrusion ethics** has prompted renewed examination of the relationship between the covenants and Christian ethics. By emphasizing the centrality of **Christ** and the organic unity of redemptive history, Wellum has contributed to the development of **progressive covenantalism** as a distinct and influential approach within evangelical theology.
