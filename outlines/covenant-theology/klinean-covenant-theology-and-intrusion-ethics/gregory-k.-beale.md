# Gregory K. Beale (1949–)

Gregory K. Beale is a leading Reformed biblical theologian who has engaged deeply with **Klinean covenant theology** and the concept of **intrusion ethics**. Beale affirms the significance of **typology**, the **eschatological structure of redemptive history**, and the distinction between the **old covenant theocracy** and the **new covenant church**, building on and critically interacting with Meredith Kline’s framework.

- "The Mosaic law is not a mere moral code but a typological pointer to the eschatological realities fulfilled in Christ." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

## Key Works

- "A New Testament Biblical Theology: The Unfolding of the Old Testament in the New"
- "The Temple and the Church's Mission"
- "Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament"
- "The Book of Revelation" (NIGTC)
- "The Erosion of Inerrancy in Evangelicalism" (for broader theological method)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology and Eschatology in Covenant Structure**
   - Emphasizes that **biblical covenants** are structured typologically, pointing forward to Christ.
   - Argues that the **Mosaic covenant** is a temporary, typological administration.
   - Sees the **eschatological fulfillment** of covenant promises in the new creation.
   - Affirms that typology is rooted in **God’s sovereign design** of redemptive history.
   - "Typology is not merely retrospective but is woven into the fabric of redemptive history." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

2. **Intrusion Ethics and the Mosaic Theocracy**
   - Recognizes the Mosaic law as a unique period of **intrusion of final judgment ethics** into history.
   - Distinguishes between the ethics of the **old covenant theocracy** and the **new covenant church**.
   - Argues that the **holy war commands** prefigure final judgment, not normative ethics for the church.
   - Sees the **theocratic judgments** as typological, not prescriptive for Christian ethics.
   - "The conquest of Canaan is a type of the final judgment, not a model for the church’s mission." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
   - Stresses both **continuity and discontinuity** between the covenants.
   - Maintains that the **moral law** is continuous, but civil and ceremonial laws are fulfilled in Christ.
   - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated but not consummated in the church age.
   - The church is not a theocracy; it awaits the consummate kingdom.
   - "The church is the beginning of the new creation, but not its fullness." ("A New Testament Biblical Theology")

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant and Temple**
   - Christ is the true **temple** and the ultimate fulfillment of all covenant promises.
   - The **sacrificial system** and priesthood are shadows pointing to Christ’s work.
   - The church, united to Christ, becomes the eschatological temple.
   - The **presence of God** is now mediated through Christ and the Spirit, not a physical structure.
   - "Jesus is the true temple in whom God’s presence dwells fully." ("The Temple and the Church's Mission")

5. **Hermeneutics: The New Testament’s Use of the Old**
   - Advocates for a **Christocentric, redemptive-historical hermeneutic**.
   - The New Testament interprets the Old Testament in light of **fulfillment in Christ**.
   - Emphasizes the importance of **canonical context** and intertextuality.
   - Sees **Klinean categories** as helpful but subject to biblical-theological refinement.
   - "The New Testament authors interpret the Old Testament in a way that reveals its ultimate meaning in Christ." ("Handbook on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament")

## Legacy and Impact

Beale’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in the areas of **typology**, **covenant structure**, and the relationship between the Testaments. His engagement with **Klinean covenant theology** has helped clarify the role of **intrusion ethics** and the typological nature of the Mosaic law. Beale’s scholarship continues to influence pastors, scholars, and students seeking to understand the unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in redemptive history.
