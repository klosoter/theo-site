# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not articulate a **Klinean covenant theology** or the concept of **intrusion ethics**, but his comprehensive treatment of **law**, **covenant**, and **divine justice** in the context of **natural law** and **divine revelation** laid foundational categories for later theological reflection. Aquinas’s approach to the **Old and New Law** and the **moral order** provides a classical framework for understanding the continuity and discontinuity between different epochs in redemptive history.

- "The Old Law is good, but imperfect; it prepared the way for the New Law, which is the law of grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 107, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, Questions 98–108 (Treatise on Law)
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard
- De Veritate
- Steven A. Long, "Aquinas on the Old Law and the New Law" (in The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Structure of Law and Covenant**
   - Law is divided into **eternal**, **natural**, **human**, and **divine** law.
   - The **Old Law** (Mosaic) is preparatory and fulfilled in the **New Law** (Gospel).
   - The **covenantal relationship** is grounded in God’s governance and human participation in the divine order.
   - The **moral precepts** of the Old Law remain, while ceremonial and judicial precepts are abrogated in Christ.
   "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 106, a.1)

2. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
   - The **Old Law** contains both **perpetual moral principles** and **temporary ceremonial/judicial commands**.
   - The **New Law** perfects and supersedes the Old, especially in its spiritual efficacy.
   - Aquinas sees a typological relationship, not a Klinean "intrusion," between the Testaments.
   - The **natural law** undergirds both covenants, providing continuity.
   "The Old Law was given to men in order to prepare them for the coming of Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 98, a.2)

3. **Divine Justice and Human Law**
   - Human law derives its authority from **natural law** and ultimately from **eternal law**.
   - The **judicial laws** of Israel were contextually appropriate but not universally binding.
   - Divine justice is immutable, but its application may vary across covenants.
   - Aquinas does not posit a special "intrusion" of eschatological justice into history.
   "Human law has the nature of law in so far as it is in accordance with right reason and thus derives from the eternal law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 93, a.3)

4. **Typology and Fulfillment**
   - The **ceremonial laws** of the Old Covenant are types fulfilled in Christ.
   - The **moral law** is reaffirmed and deepened in the New Covenant.
   - Aquinas emphasizes **fulfillment** rather than temporary "intrusion" of final judgment.
   - The **sacramental economy** is a sign of the transition from shadow to reality.
   "The ceremonies of the Old Law were figures of the New Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 101, a.2)

5. **Ethics and the Order of Salvation**
   - Ethics are rooted in **natural law** and elevated by **grace**.
   - The **virtues** are perfected in the context of the New Law.
   - The **order of salvation** is progressive, moving from promise to fulfillment.
   - Aquinas does not frame ethics in terms of "intrusion," but as participation in divine order.
   "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." (Summa Theologiae I, Q. 1, a.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of **law, covenant, and ethics** provided the medieval groundwork for later theological developments, including Reformed discussions of **covenant theology**. While he did not anticipate the Klinean model or the concept of **intrusion ethics**, his distinctions between **moral, ceremonial, and judicial law** and his understanding of typology influenced subsequent debates about the relationship between the Testaments. Aquinas remains a central interlocutor for those seeking to understand the classical roots of covenantal thought, even as later Reformed theologians would significantly modify his framework.
