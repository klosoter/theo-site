# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til did not develop **Klinean covenant theology** or **intrusion ethics** himself, but his **presuppositional apologetics** and **Reformed doctrine of revelation** laid foundational groundwork for later thinkers like Meredith Kline. Van Til emphasized the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **absolute authority of Scripture**, which influenced the way subsequent Reformed theologians approached the structure of **covenant** and the ethical discontinuities between redemptive epochs.

- "The Reformed faith teaches that God’s covenant with man is always and everywhere the presupposition of all revelation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
    - God is ontologically distinct from creation, establishing all knowledge and ethics.
    - Human understanding is always analogical, dependent on divine revelation.
    - This distinction undergirds the structure of all covenants in history.
    - It prevents any confusion between divine and human authority in ethical matters.
    - "There is no point of identity between the divine and the human consciousness." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenant as the Framework of Revelation**
    - All of God’s dealings with humanity are covenantal in nature.
    - The covenant is the context for both special and general revelation.
    - Ethical obligations flow from the covenant relationship.
    - This framework anticipates later developments in Reformed covenant theology.
    - "The covenant idea is basic to all Christian theology." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis and Common Grace**
    - There is a fundamental antithesis between belief and unbelief.
    - Common grace restrains evil and allows for cultural development.
    - The ethical standards of God’s people are distinct from those of the world.
    - This prepares the way for later discussions of intrusion ethics.
    - "The natural man is in principle opposed to the covenantal requirements of God." (Common Grace and the Gospel)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - History unfolds according to God’s sovereign, covenantal plan.
    - Different epochs in redemptive history have distinct ethical and judicial norms.
    - The Old Testament theocracy is not normative for the church age.
    - This progression is foundational for understanding intrusion ethics.
    - "Revelation is always historically mediated and progressively unfolded." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Absolute Authority of Scripture**
    - Scripture is the self-attesting Word of God and the final authority in all matters.
    - All theological and ethical reasoning must be grounded in Scripture.
    - The Bible provides the only proper context for understanding covenant and ethics.
    - This commitment shapes the Reformed approach to both covenant theology and ethics.
    - "The Bible is authoritative because it is the Word of God speaking." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s emphasis on the **covenantal structure of revelation** and the **Creator-creature distinction** profoundly shaped the trajectory of Reformed theology in the twentieth century. His thought provided the philosophical and theological underpinnings for later developments in **Klinean covenant theology** and the articulation of **intrusion ethics** by his students and followers. While Van Til did not formulate these doctrines himself, his influence is evident in the way Reformed theologians have approached the relationship between redemptive history, ethics, and the authority of Scripture.
