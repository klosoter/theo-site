# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame is a Reformed theologian who critically engages with **Klinean covenant theology**, particularly its doctrine of **intrusion ethics**. Frame affirms the centrality of the **covenant** in biblical theology but challenges the sharp distinctions Kline draws between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, as well as the application of **typological ethics** in redemptive history.

- "Kline’s sharp dichotomy between law and grace, and his concept of intrusion, are not, in my view, adequately grounded in Scripture." (The Escondido Theology)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- The Escondido Theology: A Reformed Response to Two Kingdoms Theology
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord
- "Covenant Theology" (in Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief)
- Review of Meredith Kline’s Kingdom Prologue (online article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Structure of Divine-Human Relationship**
    - The **covenant** is the foundational framework for understanding God’s dealings with humanity.
    - Frame emphasizes the unity of the **covenant of grace** throughout Scripture.
    - He critiques overly rigid distinctions between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - The covenant encompasses both law and grace in all administrations.
    "The biblical covenants are not as sharply separated as some theologians, including Kline, have argued." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Critique of Intrusion Ethics**
    - Frame questions the exegetical basis for **intrusion ethics** as articulated by Kline.
    - He argues that ethical norms in the Old Testament are not merely typological or suspended.
    - The continuity of **God’s moral law** is emphasized across redemptive history.
    - Frame warns against using intrusion to justify ethical discontinuities.
    "I do not find the notion of 'intrusion ethics' to be a persuasive explanation of Old Testament ethics." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

3. **Integration of Law and Gospel**
    - Frame resists a strict separation between **law** and **gospel** in covenant history.
    - He maintains that both law and gospel are present in all covenants.
    - The moral demands of God remain binding, even as grace is progressively revealed.
    - This integration challenges Kline’s two-kingdoms and typological approaches.
    "Law and gospel are not two separate dispensations, but two aspects of God’s one covenantal relationship with his people." (The Escondido Theology)

4. **Multiperspectival Ethical Method**
    - Frame applies his **triperspectivalism** to covenant theology and ethics.
    - He evaluates ethical questions from normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
    - This approach critiques the reductionism of Kline’s redemptive-historical scheme.
    - Multiperspectivalism seeks to do justice to the complexity of biblical revelation.
    "Ethics must be understood from the perspectives of the norm, the situation, and the self, not just from redemptive history alone." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Continuity of God’s Moral Standards**
    - Frame upholds the abiding validity of **God’s moral law** for all ages.
    - He resists the idea that Old Testament ethics are suspended or abrogated by typology.
    - The ethical teaching of Scripture is unified and applicable to the church.
    - Frame’s approach seeks to avoid antinomian or legalistic extremes.
    "God’s moral standards are consistent throughout Scripture, even as their application may vary." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s critique of **Klinean covenant theology** and **intrusion ethics** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the unity of the covenant and the application of biblical law. His **multiperspectivalism** offers a nuanced alternative to the sharp dichotomies found in some redemptive-historical models. Frame’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students seeking a more integrated approach to covenant theology and Christian ethics.
