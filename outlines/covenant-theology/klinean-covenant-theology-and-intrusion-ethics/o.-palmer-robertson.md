# O. Palmer Robertson (1937– )

O. Palmer Robertson is a leading proponent of **Reformed covenant theology**, offering a distinctive approach that both affirms and critiques aspects of **Klinean covenant theology** and its use of **intrusion ethics**. Robertson emphasizes the unity and continuity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history, questioning the sharp law-gospel and typological distinctions found in Kline’s framework, especially regarding the ethical application of Old Testament law.

## Legacy and Impact

Robertson’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed covenant theology**, especially in debates over the continuity of the **covenant of grace** and the ethical use of Old Testament law. His critiques of **Klinean intrusion ethics** have influenced many who seek a more unified approach to biblical ethics and redemptive history. Robertson’s writings remain central in seminary curricula and among pastors seeking to understand the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. His emphasis on the unity of God’s people and the abiding relevance of God’s law continues to inform discussions on covenant theology today.
