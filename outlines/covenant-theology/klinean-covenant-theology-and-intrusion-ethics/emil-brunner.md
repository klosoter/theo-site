# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner, a leading figure in **dialectical theology**, approached **covenant theology** from a perspective distinct from the Reformed tradition exemplified by Kline. Brunner emphasized the existential and relational aspects of the **divine-human encounter** rather than the legal or forensic structures of **biblical covenants**. He did not develop a doctrine of **intrusion ethics** as articulated by Kline, instead focusing on the ethical implications of the **divine command** within the context of personal responsibility and revelation.

- "The command of God is not a law which we can learn and possess, but a living voice which we must hear anew in every situation." (The Divine Imperative)

## Key Works

- The Divine Imperative (1932)
- Dogmatics, Vol. 2: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption (1950)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)
- Man in Revolt (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Personal Encounter**
    - Views **covenant** primarily as a dynamic relationship, not a legal contract.
    - Emphasizes the existential meeting between God and humanity.
    - Rejects a static or purely forensic understanding of biblical covenants.
    - Stresses the immediacy of God's address in the covenant relationship.
    - "The covenant is not a thing, but an event, the event of encounter between God and man." (Dogmatics, Vol. 2)

2. **Ethics Rooted in Divine Command**
    - Ethics arise from the direct, situational **command of God**.
    - Moral norms are not abstract or universal but are given in concrete encounters.
    - Rejects natural law as an autonomous source of ethics.
    - Human responsibility is awakened by the living Word of God.
    - "God's command is always a personal address, never a general rule." (The Divine Imperative)

3. **Revelation as Event**
    - Revelation is not a deposit of information but an existential event.
    - The Word of God confronts individuals in history and experience.
    - The authority of revelation is grounded in its personal character.
    - Scripture witnesses to, but does not exhaust, the revelatory event.
    - "Revelation is always an act, never a thing." (Revelation and Reason)

4. **Rejection of Intrusion Ethics**
    - Does not affirm a typological or eschatological "intrusion" of final judgment into history.
    - Sees Old Testament ethics as preparatory, not as direct anticipations of eschatological realities.
    - Emphasizes continuity of ethical responsibility across redemptive history.
    - Focuses on the ongoing call to obedience rather than epochal shifts in ethical norms.
    - "The law of God is always the law for this world, not a foretaste of the world to come." (The Divine Imperative)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Covenant**
    - Christ is the center and fulfillment of the divine-human relationship.
    - The **covenant** finds its meaning in the person and work of Christ.
    - Ethical life is shaped by conformity to Christ, not by typological patterns.
    - The new covenant is realized in the existential encounter with the risen Lord.
    - "In Christ, the covenant is both given and fulfilled." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **covenant theology** influenced 20th-century discussions on the relational and existential dimensions of the divine-human relationship. While he did not engage with **intrusion ethics** or the legal-typological frameworks of Klinean theology, his emphasis on the immediacy of the **divine command** and the event-character of revelation shaped later existential and neo-orthodox thought. Brunner’s legacy persists in debates over the nature of biblical covenants, the grounding of ethics, and the role of Christ in theological anthropology.
