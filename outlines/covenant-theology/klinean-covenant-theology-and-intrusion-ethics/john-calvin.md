# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s theology laid foundational groundwork for later **Reformed covenant theology**, though he did not develop the specific framework of **Klinean covenant theology** or the concept of **intrusion ethics** as articulated by later theologians. Calvin emphasized the unity and continuity of the **covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history, distinguishing it from the **covenant of works** with Adam, but did not explicitly articulate the typological "intrusion" of eschatological judgment into the Mosaic era. His approach to the **law**, **covenant**, and **redemptive history** provided categories that would be developed further by later Reformed thinkers.

- "All the covenants made with the fathers were so many renewals of the covenant made with Abraham, and hence the Old Testament is properly called the covenant of grace." (Institutes 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 9–11)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, and Hebrews
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)
- Calvin and the Federal Theology (ed. J. Mark Beach, for secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Calvin taught that the **covenant of grace** underlies both Old and New Testaments.
    - He saw the Mosaic administration as a continuation, not a fundamentally different covenant.
    - The substance of salvation—**Christ**—is present throughout redemptive history.
    - Differences between the covenants are in administration, not in essence.
    - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same: still the administration differs." (Institutes 2.10.2)

2. **Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
    - Calvin distinguished the **covenant of works** (law) with Adam from the **covenant of grace** (gospel) after the fall.
    - The law reveals sin and drives humanity to Christ, but cannot save.
    - The Mosaic law serves a pedagogical function, preparing for the gospel.
    - The gospel fulfills what the law typified and promised.
    - "The law was given, in order to lead us by the hand to Christ." (Institutes 2.7.2)

3. **Typology and Redemptive History**
    - Calvin recognized typological patterns in the Old Testament pointing to Christ.
    - He saw the ceremonies and sacrifices as shadows fulfilled in the New Covenant.
    - The historical events of Israel prefigure spiritual realities in Christ.
    - He did not, however, develop a formal doctrine of "intrusion ethics."
    - "The ceremonies had their foundation in Christ, and their completion in his advent." (Institutes 2.7.1)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in the Mosaic Covenant**
    - Calvin affirmed both continuity and discontinuity between the Mosaic and New Covenants.
    - The moral law remains binding, while ceremonial and civil laws are abrogated in Christ.
    - He did not frame the Mosaic covenant as a republication of the covenant of works.
    - Calvin’s view lacks the Klinean emphasis on typological intrusion of judgment.
    - "The ancient people had the same covenant of grace as we have, differing only in outward administration." (Commentary on Hebrews 8:6)

5. **God’s Sovereignty and Covenant Administration**
    - Calvin emphasized God’s sovereign initiative in establishing covenants.
    - The covenant is grounded in God’s promise, not human merit.
    - Election and grace are central to the covenant’s efficacy.
    - The covenant is administered through means—Word and sacrament—across the ages.
    - "God, in making a covenant with men, does not bind Himself to them as if He were their equal, but stoops down to them in mercy." (Institutes 2.10.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of the **covenant of grace** provided the essential categories for later Reformed covenant theology, even though he did not develop the distinctive features of **Klinean covenant theology** or **intrusion ethics**. His influence shaped the federal theology of the seventeenth century and provided a framework for understanding the unity of redemptive history. Later theologians, including Meredith Kline, built upon and modified Calvin’s insights, introducing new typological and ethical distinctions. Calvin’s legacy endures as a foundational voice in the development of Reformed theology and its understanding of the covenants.
