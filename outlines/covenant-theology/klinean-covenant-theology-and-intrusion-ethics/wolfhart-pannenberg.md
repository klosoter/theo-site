# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg did not directly engage with **Klinean covenant theology** or the concept of **intrusion ethics** as developed in the Reformed tradition, but his broader approach to **revelation**, **history**, and the **kingdom of God** provides a critical contrast. Pannenberg emphasized the **universal accessibility of revelation** and the unfolding of **God’s self-disclosure** in history, rather than positing sharp epochs or typological intrusions of eschatological judgment into the present. His theology thus challenges the distinctively Klinean use of **covenant structure** and the ethical implications of **intrusion motifs**.

- "Revelation is nothing other than the self-disclosure of God, and it is accessible to all in the history of Jesus." (Revelation as History)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (1969)
- Systematic Theology, Vols. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective (1985)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation in Universal History**
    - Revelation is not confined to special epochs or covenants but is accessible through the totality of history.
    - God’s self-disclosure culminates in the historical event of Jesus Christ.
    - The meaning of history is eschatologically oriented but not typologically intruded.
    - Rejects the notion of isolated, redemptive-historical “intrusions” as found in Klinean thought.
    - "The revelation of God is universally accessible in the history of Jesus." (Revelation as History)

2. **Continuity of Creation and Redemption**
    - Emphasizes the unity of God’s action in creation and redemption.
    - Sees no radical ethical discontinuity between covenant epochs.
    - The kingdom of God is the fulfillment of creation, not a temporary intrusion.
    - Ethics are grounded in the eschatological destiny of humanity, not in typological judgments.
    - "God’s action in history is one, from creation to consummation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Eschatology as the Horizon of Ethics**
    - Ethics are shaped by the future consummation, not by temporary suspensions of common grace.
    - The coming kingdom informs present moral life, rather than exceptional “intrusions.”
    - Human responsibility is oriented toward the universal future, not special epochs.
    - Rejects the use of Old Testament theocracy as a model for present ethics.
    - "The future of God’s kingdom is the horizon for all ethical reflection." (Theology and the Kingdom of God)

4. **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
    - Jesus Christ is the center and climax of revelation and covenant.
    - All previous covenants and ethical norms find fulfillment in Christ.
    - Typology is interpreted through the lens of Christ’s resurrection and lordship.
    - Disavows reading Old Testament law as a direct ethical model for the church.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the key to the meaning of all history." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Openness of History**
    - History is open to God’s future, not predetermined by covenantal epochs.
    - God’s purposes unfold dynamically, not through static typological patterns.
    - The church lives in anticipation, not in a realized or intruded eschaton.
    - Ethical life is lived in hope, not by recapitulating Old Testament judgments.
    - "History remains open to the future of God’s reign." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s theology stands as a significant alternative to **Klinean covenant theology** and its use of **intrusion ethics**, emphasizing the openness and universality of God’s revelation in history. His focus on the **eschatological horizon** and the unity of God’s action in creation and redemption has influenced both systematic and biblical theology. While not engaging directly with Kline, Pannenberg’s work challenges the sharp epochal distinctions and typological ethics characteristic of Klinean thought, offering a more integrated and Christocentric vision of history and ethics.
