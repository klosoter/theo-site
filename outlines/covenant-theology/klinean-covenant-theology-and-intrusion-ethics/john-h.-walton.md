# John H. Walton (1952– )

John H. Walton approaches **covenant theology** and the concept of **intrusion ethics** from the perspective of **ancient Near Eastern backgrounds** and **biblical theology**. While not a Klinean, Walton's work critically engages with the frameworks of **divine-human covenants** and the ethical discontinuities between **Israel's theocracy** and the church, emphasizing the importance of **contextual interpretation** and the **functional ontology** of biblical texts.

- "We must read the Old Testament in light of its ancient context, not impose modern categories upon it." ("The Lost World of Scripture")

## Key Works

- The Lost World of Genesis One (2009)
- The Lost World of Scripture (2013, with D. Brent Sandy)
- Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament (2006)
- Covenant: God’s Purpose, God’s Plan (2018)
- The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest (2017, with J. Harvey Walton)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenants as Ancient Near Eastern Constructs**
    - Emphasizes that biblical **covenants** must be understood in light of ancient Near Eastern treaty forms.
    - Argues that covenant language reflects **functional relationships** rather than abstract legal categories.
    - Sees the **structure of biblical covenants** as rooted in historical context, not systematic theology.
    - Suggests that divine covenants are primarily about **order and purpose** in creation and society.
    - "The biblical covenants are embedded in the cultural river of the ancient world." (Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament)

2. **Intrusion Ethics as Contextual Phenomenon**
    - Views the ethical commands in Israel’s conquest as **unique to the theocratic context**.
    - Argues that such ethics are not normative for the church but are tied to **God’s purposes in redemptive history**.
    - Emphasizes the **non-repeatability** of Israel’s conquest ethics due to their covenantal setting.
    - Interprets these commands through the lens of **divine accommodation** to ancient cultures.
    - "The conquest is not a model for Christian behavior but a unique event in God’s plan." (The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest)

3. **Functional Ontology over Material Ontology**
    - Proposes that biblical texts focus on **function and purpose** rather than material substance.
    - Applies this to covenantal language, arguing for a **relational and vocational** understanding.
    - Suggests that **ethics and law** in the Old Testament are about maintaining order, not universal moral codes.
    - Sees the **role of Israel** as a priestly nation with a unique function in God’s plan.
    - "The Bible is more interested in how things function in God’s purposes than in what they are made of." (The Lost World of Genesis One)

4. **Progressive Revelation and Ethical Discontinuity**
    - Argues that **God’s revelation unfolds** progressively, with ethical expectations shifting across covenants.
    - Sees the **Mosaic law** as temporary and preparatory for the coming of Christ.
    - Emphasizes that **intrusion ethics** are not binding on the new covenant community.
    - Highlights the **eschatological fulfillment** of God’s purposes in Christ, superseding earlier covenantal ethics.
    - "The ethics of the conquest are not the ethics of the kingdom." (The Lost World of the Israelite Conquest)

5. **Scripture as Ancient Text**
    - Insists on interpreting Scripture as an **ancient document** with its own genres and conventions.
    - Warns against reading modern systematic categories into the biblical text.
    - Advocates for **historical and literary sensitivity** in understanding covenants and ethics.
    - Sees the Bible’s authority as rooted in its **original context and communicative intent**.
    - "We must honor the Bible for what it is, not what we wish it to be." (The Lost World of Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Walton’s work has significantly shaped evangelical engagement with **ancient Near Eastern backgrounds** and the interpretation of **covenant theology**. His emphasis on **contextual and functional readings** has challenged traditional systematic approaches, especially regarding the ethical discontinuities between Old and New Covenant communities. While not a Klinean, Walton’s analysis of **intrusion ethics** and covenantal frameworks has influenced both biblical scholars and theologians seeking to bridge exegesis and theology. His contributions continue to provoke discussion on how best to understand the relationship between **biblical ethics** and redemptive history.
