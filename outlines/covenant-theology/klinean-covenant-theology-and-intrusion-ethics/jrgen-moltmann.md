# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann does not directly address **Klinean covenant theology** or **intrusion ethics**, but his broader theological vision offers a distinct perspective on the **covenant**, **eschatology**, and the relationship between **law and grace**. Moltmann’s theology emphasizes the **future-oriented nature of God’s promises** and the **liberative character of the covenant**, standing in contrast to the forensic and typological emphases found in Klinean thought.

- "The history of God’s covenant with humanity is open to the future of God’s kingdom." (Theology of Hope)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- The Crucified God (1972)
- God in Creation (1985)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Eschatological Promise**
    - Views the **covenant** as fundamentally oriented toward the **future fulfillment** in the kingdom of God.
    - Emphasizes the **dynamic and open-ended nature** of God’s promises.
    - Rejects static or purely legalistic understandings of covenant.
    - Sees the covenant as a vehicle for **hope and liberation** rather than typological judgment.
    - "The covenant is not a closed contract but an open promise." (Theology of Hope)

2. **Critique of Forensic and Retributive Ethics**
    - Challenges the notion of **intrusion ethics** that foregrounds typological judgment.
    - Argues for an ethic rooted in **solidarity with the oppressed** and the **suffering of God**.
    - Sees divine justice as restorative rather than retributive.
    - Prioritizes the **transformative power of hope** over typological intrusion of final judgment.
    - "God’s righteousness is creative, not merely retributive." (The Crucified God)

3. **Eschatology Shapes Ethics**
    - Ethics are shaped by the **coming kingdom** rather than by typological anticipation of judgment.
    - The future of God’s reign determines present action and moral responsibility.
    - Rejects the idea that Old Testament law serves as a direct intrusion of eschatological judgment.
    - Emphasizes **anticipatory participation** in God’s future as the basis for Christian ethics.
    - "Christian ethics is lived in the horizon of hope." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
    - Stresses the **inclusive and cosmic dimensions** of God’s covenant.
    - Rejects narrow or nationalistic readings of covenant history.
    - Sees the covenant as embracing all creation, not just a typological remnant.
    - The covenant’s fulfillment is universal reconciliation, not selective intrusion.
    - "God’s covenant embraces the whole creation." (God in Creation)

5. **The Cross as the Center of Covenant and Ethics**
    - The **crucifixion** is the decisive act of God’s covenant faithfulness.
    - Ethics flow from participation in the suffering and hope of the crucified Christ.
    - The cross subverts notions of divine violence or typological intrusion.
    - The cross points to **solidarity, reconciliation, and hope** rather than judgment.
    - "The cross is the beginning of the new creation." (The Crucified God)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s theology has profoundly shaped contemporary discussions of **covenant**, **eschatology**, and the ethical implications of Christian hope. While he does not engage directly with **Klinean intrusion ethics**, his emphasis on the liberative and future-oriented aspects of the covenant offers a significant alternative to typological and forensic approaches. Moltmann’s work continues to inspire theologians seeking a more inclusive and transformative vision of God’s promises and their ethical outworking.
