# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading interpreter of **Klinean covenant theology** and its distinctive **intrusion ethics** within the Reformed tradition. He affirms the significance of **redemptive-historical interpretation**, emphasizing the unique, unrepeatable character of Old Testament theocracy as a typological anticipation of final judgment, and the ethical discontinuity between the Mosaic covenant and the new covenant era.

- "The theocracy, as a unique redemptive-historical episode, is not a model for the church’s present relation to the state." (Gaffin, "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism," in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

## Key Works

- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique, 1990)
- "Westminster and the Theonomy Movement" (WTJ, 1982)
- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation" (2006)
- "Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation" (ed., 1980)
- "Perspectives on Pentecost" (1979)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics**
    - Emphasizes the unfolding of **God’s covenantal plan** through distinct epochs.
    - Views Old Testament theocracy as a unique, non-repeatable phase in redemptive history.
    - Stresses the typological function of Israel’s civil laws and penalties.
    - Argues for the necessity of situating ethical application within the progress of revelation.
    - "Biblical ethics must be grounded in the redemptive-historical context in which they are given." (Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

2. **Intrusion Ethics Defined**
    - Affirms that Mosaic civil law represents an "intrusion" of **eschatological judgment** into history.
    - Maintains that the death penalties and civil sanctions typify the final judgment.
    - Denies the ongoing applicability of these sanctions in the new covenant era.
    - Sees the theocracy as a temporary, typological anticipation of Christ’s consummate kingdom.
    - "The penal sanctions of the Mosaic law are not a pattern for the church or state today." (WTJ, 1982)

3. **Discontinuity Between Old and New Covenants**
    - Highlights the **discontinuity** in the application of law between the Mosaic and new covenant eras.
    - Argues that Christ’s coming fulfills and transforms the covenantal structure.
    - Insists that the church is not a theocratic community.
    - Rejects the direct transfer of Mosaic civil law to modern states.
    - "The church is not a theocracy and should not seek to become one." (Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)

4. **Critique of Theonomy**
    - Critically engages with the **theonomic** movement’s call for civil enforcement of Mosaic law.
    - Argues that theonomy misunderstands the typological and redemptive-historical nature of the Mosaic code.
    - Warns against conflating Israel’s unique role with the church’s mission.
    - Emphasizes the ethical implications of Christ’s fulfillment of the law.
    - "Theonomy fails to reckon adequately with the redemptive-historical uniqueness of the Mosaic economy." (WTJ, 1982)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Ethics**
    - Grounds Christian ethics in the **already/not yet** tension of inaugurated eschatology.
    - Sees the church as a pilgrim people awaiting the consummation.
    - Maintains that ethical norms must reflect the present age, not the typological theocracy.
    - Encourages a Christ-centered, kingdom-oriented approach to law and ethics.
    - "Our ethical calling is shaped by the eschatological reality inaugurated in Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of **intrusion ethics** and his redemptive-historical approach have profoundly influenced Reformed debates over law, ethics, and the church’s relation to the state. His critique of theonomy has shaped the Westminster tradition’s understanding of the discontinuity between the Mosaic and new covenant eras. Gaffin’s work continues to inform contemporary discussions on biblical theology, covenant, and the proper use of Old Testament law in Christian ethics.
