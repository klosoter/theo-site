# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—form the backbone of classic **Reformed confessional theology**, especially in articulating a robust **covenant theology**. While they do not explicitly develop later concepts like **intrusion ethics**, their clear teaching on the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** provides the essential framework for understanding the structure of redemptive history and the law-gospel distinction.

- "God made man good, and after His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise Him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 14)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–17, 22–24, 34
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 6, 12, 15–21, 60, 74
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Head I, Art. 7; Head II, Art. 8–9
- Lyle D. Bierma, The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism
- Cornelis P. Venema, The Promise of the Future

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Original Arrangement**
    - Humanity was created in a state of **original righteousness** under a covenantal arrangement with God.
    - The **covenant of works** required perfect obedience for life and threatened death for disobedience.
    - This covenant is foundational for understanding the need for redemption and the coming of Christ.
    - The Three Forms affirm Adam’s federal headship and the imputation of guilt.
    "God gave him [man] a commandment of life, by the obedience whereof he should have attained to eternal life, but threatened death upon the breach thereof." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 9)

2. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Structure**
    - After the Fall, God established the **covenant of grace** to restore sinners through Christ.
    - The covenant of grace is administered through promises, sacraments, and the preaching of the gospel.
    - Christ fulfills the law’s demands and bears its curse on behalf of the elect.
    - The unity of the covenant of grace is maintained across Old and New Testaments.
    "God Himself gave His Son to be our Surety, to make satisfaction for us." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 12)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The law reveals God’s righteous standard and convicts of sin.
    - The gospel proclaims deliverance from sin through Christ’s work.
    - The distinction preserves the gracious character of salvation.
    - The law continues to guide believers in gratitude, not as a means of justification.
    "Out of the gospel, God Himself gives by faith that which He commands by the law." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 115)

4. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Progression**
    - Old Testament institutions and events serve as **types** pointing to Christ and the new covenant.
    - The sacraments of the Old and New Testaments signify the same spiritual realities.
    - The confessions recognize a progression from shadow to fulfillment in redemptive history.
    - This typological understanding anticipates later developments like **intrusion ethics**.
    "The sacraments are visible holy signs and seals appointed by God for this end, that by the use thereof He may the more fully declare and seal to us the promise of the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 66)

5. **Divine Justice and Mercy in Covenant Administration**
    - God’s justice is upheld in the curse of the law and the necessity of satisfaction for sin.
    - His mercy is displayed in providing a Mediator and the promise of forgiveness.
    - The confessions stress the seriousness of sin and the reality of judgment.
    - The ethical implications of God’s justice and mercy shape the believer’s life and hope.
    "God is indeed merciful, but He is also just; therefore His justice requires that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of God be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting punishment of body and soul." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 11)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of **covenant theology**, providing the doctrinal framework upon which later theologians—such as Meredith Kline—would build. Their articulation of the **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and the law-gospel distinction set the stage for subsequent reflection on typology and the ethical implications of redemptive history. While not explicitly formulating **intrusion ethics**, their categories have enabled later Reformed thinkers to develop these concepts in continuity with confessional standards. The enduring influence of these documents ensures their continued relevance in debates over covenant structure and biblical ethics.
