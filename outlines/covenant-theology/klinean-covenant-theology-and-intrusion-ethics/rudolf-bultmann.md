# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not directly engage with **Klinean covenant theology** or the concept of **intrusion ethics**, but his work on **demythologization** and **New Testament theology** significantly shaped modern discussions of **covenant**, **law**, and **eschatology**. Bultmann’s existential approach to Scripture emphasized the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with God, rather than the historical or covenantal structures emphasized by later Reformed theologians like Meredith Kline.

- "The Old Testament is not a book of edification for the Christian, but a witness to the history of Israel." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Scripture must be interpreted existentially, not through ancient mythological frameworks.
    - The message (kerygma) is distinct from its cultural-historical form.
    - Theological meaning is found in the existential call to decision, not in covenantal or legal structures.
    - The Old Testament’s value is primarily as background to the New Testament proclamation.
    - "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Covenant**
    - The concept of **covenant** is reinterpreted as the individual's encounter with God’s call.
    - Historical covenants are less significant than the existential response of faith.
    - The law serves to reveal human need, not as a binding covenantal structure.
    - The focus is on the present encounter, not on typological or redemptive-historical patterns.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept the divine judgment." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Eschatology as Existential Event**
    - Eschatology is not a future historical event but a present existential reality.
    - The "intrusion" of the end is realized in the proclamation of the Word.
    - The apocalyptic framework is demythologized into existential decision.
    - The ethical implications are immediate and personal, not tied to redemptive epochs.
    - "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe, but the coming of the Word to man." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Critique of Legalism and Objective Ethics**
    - Biblical law is not a binding ethical code but a pointer to the need for grace.
    - Ethics are grounded in authentic existence, not in covenantal stipulations.
    - The Old Testament law is relativized by the Christ-event.
    - Intrusion ethics, as later developed, would be foreign to Bultmann’s existential focus.
    - "The demand of the law is absolute, but it is fulfilled only in the act of faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Priority of Kerygma over Redemptive-Historical Structures**
    - The proclamation of Christ is central, not the unfolding of covenantal epochs.
    - Typology and redemptive history are secondary to the existential message.
    - Theological meaning is not found in historical progression but in the present call to faith.
    - The church’s task is proclamation, not the maintenance of covenantal continuity.
    - "The real content of the New Testament is the kerygma, the proclamation of the event of Christ." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Scripture** and **covenant** challenged traditional Reformed categories, paving the way for existential and post-liberal readings of the Bible. While his demythologization project stands in sharp contrast to Klinean covenant theology and the concept of **intrusion ethics**, his influence forced later theologians to clarify the biblical and theological basis for covenantal and redemptive-historical frameworks. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in twentieth-century theology, especially for those wrestling with the relationship between **history**, **faith**, and **hermeneutics**.
