# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer engaged **covenant theology** with a critical and constructive approach, emphasizing the dynamic and relational character of the **covenant of grace** while expressing reservations about speculative or overly schematic formulations. While not directly addressing **Klinean intrusion ethics**, Berkouwer’s theology provides a framework for evaluating the relationship between **law and gospel**, the unfolding of **redemptive history**, and the ethical implications of **typology** within the covenant. He consistently stressed the importance of Christocentric interpretation and cautioned against reading Old Testament ethics as directly normative for the church.

- "The covenant is not a static concept, but a dynamic reality in the history of redemption." (The Covenant of Grace)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (1954)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Justification (1954)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Sin (1971)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Holy Scripture (1966)
- Studies in Dogmatics: The Work of Christ (1965)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Dynamic Relationship**
   - Views the **covenant** as a living, unfolding relationship rather than a fixed legal arrangement.
   - Emphasizes the historical progression of **redemptive revelation**.
   - Rejects rigid distinctions between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as speculative.
   - Sees the covenant as centered on God’s faithfulness and promise in Christ.
   - "The covenant is not a static concept, but a dynamic reality in the history of redemption." (The Covenant of Grace)

2. **Christocentric Fulfillment of the Covenant**
   - Insists that all covenantal promises and structures find their fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Warns against typological readings that obscure the centrality of Christ.
   - Argues that ethical demands in the Old Testament must be interpreted through the lens of Christ’s work.
   - Maintains that the new covenant transforms the application of Old Testament law.
   - "The covenant finds its meaning and fulfillment in Christ, who is both the Mediator and the content of the promise." (The Covenant of Grace)

3. **Critical Engagement with Law and Gospel**
   - Stresses the unity of **law and gospel** within the covenant, while recognizing their distinct functions.
   - Opposes any ethical system that reintroduces a legalistic framework for the church.
   - Sees the law as pedagogical, leading to Christ and fulfilled in Him.
   - Cautions against direct application of Old Testament judicial laws to the new covenant community.
   - "The law, in its pedagogical function, drives us to Christ and is fulfilled in Him." (Faith and Justification)

4. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Ethics**
   - Affirms the legitimacy of **typology** but insists it must be governed by the Christ event.
   - Rejects the idea that Old Testament ethics can be directly normative for the church without transformation in Christ.
   - Views the Old Testament as preparatory and anticipatory, not paradigmatic for Christian ethics.
   - Emphasizes the eschatological movement from promise to fulfillment.
   - "Typology must be controlled by the reality of Christ, lest we absolutize the provisional." (The Work of Christ)

5. **Rejection of Speculative Covenant Schematization**
   - Critiques overly systematic or speculative covenant models, including some forms of **intrusion ethics**.
   - Argues that ethical application must be sensitive to the unfolding of redemptive history.
   - Warns against reading theocratic or judicial elements of Israel as normative for the church.
   - Prioritizes the unity and diversity of Scripture in ethical reflection.
   - "We must beware of constructing a covenant theology that loses sight of the living God who acts in history." (The Covenant of Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced approach to **covenant theology** has shaped Reformed discussions by emphasizing the dynamic, Christ-centered, and redemptive-historical character of the covenant. His caution against speculative schematization and his insistence on the transformation of Old Testament ethics in light of Christ have provided a critical lens for evaluating developments such as **Klinean intrusion ethics**. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his call for theological humility and attentiveness to the unfolding drama of redemption.
