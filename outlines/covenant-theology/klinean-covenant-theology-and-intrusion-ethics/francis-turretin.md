# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin, a leading figure in **Reformed scholasticism**, provided a rigorous account of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** that became foundational for later Reformed covenant theology. While Turretin did not explicitly develop the concept of **intrusion ethics**, his distinctions regarding the **law/gospel distinction**, the **typological function** of Old Testament law, and the **eschatological purposes** of the Mosaic covenant laid essential groundwork for subsequent Reformed reflection on these issues.

- "The covenant of works is that by which God, having created man after his own image, entered into a covenant with him, promising eternal life upon condition of perfect obedience." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 12.1.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos
- Selected writings in Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (ed. Richard Muller)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
   - The **covenant of works** is established with Adam as federal head before the fall.
   - It promises **eternal life** on the condition of perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience.
   - The **law/gospel distinction** is rooted in the difference between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace.
   - The covenant of works is fulfilled in Christ, who meets its demands for the elect.
   "The law, as a covenant, demands perfect obedience and promises life; the gospel offers life freely in Christ." (Institutes, 12.3.6)

2. **Typology and Mosaic Covenant**
   - The **Mosaic covenant** is an administration of the covenant of grace, yet contains typological elements.
   - Ceremonial and civil laws serve as **types and shadows** pointing to Christ and the coming kingdom.
   - The Mosaic law includes a **republication** of the covenant of works in a typological sense, not as a means of justification.
   - The temporal sanctions in Israel prefigure final judgment, anticipating later **intrusion ethics** categories.
   "The law given on Sinai was not a new covenant of works, but a republication for pedagogical purposes." (Institutes, 12.6.7)

3. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
   - Turretin maintains a sharp distinction between **law** (as covenant of works) and **gospel** (as covenant of grace).
   - The law reveals sin and drives sinners to Christ, while the gospel offers grace and forgiveness.
   - The Mosaic administration, though containing law, is fundamentally gracious in its redemptive purpose.
   - This distinction undergirds later Reformed approaches to **intrusion ethics** and typological judgment.
   "The law commands and condemns; the gospel promises and saves." (Institutes, 12.4.9)

4. **Temporal and Eschatological Sanctions**
   - The civil and ceremonial sanctions in Israel are temporary, typological, and not normative for the church.
   - These sanctions serve as **intrusions** of eschatological judgment into redemptive history.
   - Turretin affirms that such judgments prefigure the final judgment, a concept developed further by Kline.
   - The abrogation of these laws in Christ marks the transition from type to fulfillment.
   "The punishments inflicted under the Mosaic economy were shadows of the final judgment to come." (Institutes, 11.24.15)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
   - There is substantial **continuity** in the unity of the covenant of grace across redemptive history.
   - Discontinuity is seen in the administration and outward forms, especially between Old and New Covenants.
   - The typological and judicial aspects of the Mosaic covenant are fulfilled and surpassed in Christ.
   - This framework anticipates later discussions of **intrusion ethics** and the temporary nature of theocratic sanctions.
   "The substance of the covenant is one, though the mode of administration differs." (Institutes, 12.1.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s precise articulation of the **covenant of works**, typology, and the law/gospel distinction profoundly shaped later Reformed theology, providing categories essential for the development of **Klinean covenant theology** and the concept of **intrusion ethics**. His influence is evident in the way Reformed theologians distinguish between the temporary, typological judgments of Old Testament Israel and the eschatological realities they foreshadow. Turretin’s work remains foundational for understanding the continuity and discontinuity within redemptive history, and his legacy endures in contemporary debates on covenant theology.
