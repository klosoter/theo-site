# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s theology stands in marked contrast to **Klinean covenant theology** and its concept of **intrusion ethics**. Barth rejected the traditional Reformed **covenant of works/covenant of grace** framework, instead emphasizing the singular, Christ-centered **covenant of grace** as the foundation of God’s relationship with humanity. He did not develop or endorse the notion of **intrusion ethics**, focusing rather on the radical discontinuity between divine command and human ethical systems.

- "The covenant is the goal and meaning of all the ways and works of God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics, esp. IV/1–IV/2
- The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology (1922)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- Karl Barth and Covenant Theology (ed. J.B. Torrance)
- Barth’s Ethics of Reconciliation (John Webster)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of the Covenant of Works**
    - Barth denies a pre-fall **covenant of works** as a separate legal arrangement.
    - He sees all divine-human relations as grounded in **grace** from the beginning.
    - The law is always given within the context of God’s gracious covenant.
    - This undermines the dualism central to **Klinean covenant theology**.
    "The so-called covenant of works is not a biblical concept." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

2. **Christocentric Covenant**
    - The covenant is realized and revealed in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**.
    - Christ is both the subject and object of the covenant, fulfilling all its conditions.
    - There is no room for a legalistic or merit-based phase in redemptive history.
    - The unity of the covenant opposes the Klinean distinction between typological and eschatological ethics.
    "In Jesus Christ, God has bound Himself to man and man to Himself." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

3. **Ethics Rooted in Divine Command**
    - Ethics is not deduced from natural law or typological arrangements but from God’s free command.
    - Human ethics are always responsive to God’s self-revelation in Christ.
    - There is no special epoch of “intrusion” where different ethical norms apply.
    - Barth’s ethics are dynamic, relational, and Christ-centered.
    "The command of God is the concrete form of the divine covenant." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

4. **Rejection of Intrusion Ethics**
    - Barth does not recognize a temporary suspension of ordinary ethical norms in redemptive history.
    - He sees Old Testament judgments as revelatory of God’s holiness, not as models for Christian ethics.
    - Divine judgment is always interpreted through the lens of Christ’s atonement.
    - The ethical life is shaped by participation in Christ, not by typological intrusion.
    "The Old Testament is promise, not pattern." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

5. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
    - Barth emphasizes the universal intent of God’s covenant in Christ.
    - Election and covenant are inseparable and centered in **Jesus Christ** as the electing God and elected man.
    - There is no narrowing of covenant privilege to a typological nation or epoch.
    - The covenant’s ethical implications are for all humanity, not just a covenant community.
    "Jesus Christ is the covenant in person." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s rejection of the **covenant of works** and his insistence on a **Christocentric covenant** have profoundly shaped modern Reformed and ecumenical theology, challenging traditional distinctions foundational to **Klinean covenant theology** and **intrusion ethics**. His approach has encouraged theologians to rethink the relationship between law, grace, and ethics in light of Christ’s person and work. While Barth’s views remain controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, his influence endures in ongoing debates about the nature of the covenant and the shape of Christian ethics.
