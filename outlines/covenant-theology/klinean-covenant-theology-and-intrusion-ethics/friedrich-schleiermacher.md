# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher did not directly address **Klinean covenant theology** or **intrusion ethics**, as these are later developments within the Reformed tradition. However, his approach to **covenant** was shaped by his emphasis on **religious experience** and the **feeling of absolute dependence**, rather than on legal or forensic categories. Schleiermacher’s theology reinterpreted traditional doctrines, including the covenant, through the lens of **subjective consciousness** and the **community of faith**.

- "The essence of religion consists in the feeling of an absolute dependence." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Schleiermacher: Life and Thought (ed. Richard Crouter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Experience**
    - Emphasizes the **feeling of absolute dependence** as the core of religion.
    - Views doctrine as a reflection of communal religious consciousness.
    - Downplays external, legal, or forensic categories in favor of inward experience.
    - Sees the covenant as a lived relationship, not a legal contract.
    - "Religion’s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling." (On Religion)

2. **Redefinition of Covenant**
    - Interprets covenant in terms of the community’s shared consciousness of God.
    - Rejects strict legal or federal frameworks for understanding God’s relationship with humanity.
    - Sees the church as the locus of covenantal life, centered on Christ.
    - Views covenant as dynamic and evolving with religious consciousness.
    - "The church is the fellowship of those who share in the same God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ as the Exemplar of God-Consciousness**
    - Christ embodies the highest realization of God-consciousness.
    - The covenant is fulfilled in the person and work of Christ, not in legal arrangements.
    - Christ’s role is to awaken and sustain God-consciousness in the community.
    - The ethical implications of Christ’s life shape the community’s covenantal existence.
    - "In Christ, the divine essence is fully revealed to human consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Ethics Rooted in Community, Not Intrusion**
    - Ethics arise from the communal experience of God, not from temporary or typological suspensions of moral norms.
    - Rejects the notion of **intrusion ethics** as found in later Reformed thought.
    - Moral life is shaped by the ongoing development of the community’s consciousness.
    - The ethical task is to embody the spirit of Christ within the covenant community.
    - "Christian ethics is the science of the laws of the Christian life." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Doctrine as Expression of Faith, Not Legal Structure**
    - Doctrines articulate the faith experience of the community, not legal stipulations.
    - Theological formulations are secondary to the lived reality of faith.
    - The covenant is understood through the lens of faith, not through forensic categories.
    - Emphasizes the historical and evolving nature of doctrine.
    - "Dogmatics is the science which presents the Christian faith in its essence." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **covenant** and his focus on **religious experience** profoundly influenced modern theology, shifting the discussion away from legal and forensic categories. While his views stand in contrast to later developments such as **Klinean covenant theology** and **intrusion ethics**, his emphasis on the communal and experiential aspects of faith continues to shape contemporary discussions. Schleiermacher’s legacy is seen in the ongoing dialogue between classical Reformed thought and modern theological approaches.
