# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is foundational for understanding the development of **Reformed covenant theology** and the conceptual roots of **intrusion ethics** later articulated by Meredith Kline. Vos emphasized the unfolding of **redemptive history** and the distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, providing the biblical-theological framework that undergirds Kline’s approach to **typology** and the temporary intrusion of eschatological judgment into history.

- "The history of redemption is organically connected with the history of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Eschatology of the Old Testament
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Scripture reveals a unified, progressive history centered on **God’s covenants**.
    - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are foundational epochs.
    - Typology is rooted in the organic relationship between Old and New Testaments.
    - The unfolding of redemption is inseparable from the unfolding of revelation.
    - "Revelation is not an isolated thing, but is bound up with the process of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Covenant of Works as Eschatological Prototype**
    - The **covenant of works** sets the pattern for later covenantal arrangements.
    - Adam’s probation and the threat of judgment prefigure later redemptive events.
    - The principle of obedience and judgment is central to understanding intrusion.
    - The eschatological goal is held before humanity from the beginning.
    - "The probationary arrangement with Adam was not an end in itself, but pointed to a higher destiny." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Typology and Intrusion of Judgment**
    - Old Testament events serve as types that anticipate eschatological realities.
    - Temporary intrusions of judgment (e.g., the conquest) foreshadow final judgment.
    - These intrusions are not normative for the present age but point forward.
    - Typological acts reveal the inbreaking of the age to come into history.
    - "The typical is the historical cast into the mold of the eschatological." (Eschatology of the Old Testament)

4. **Distinction Between Law and Grace in Covenant Administration**
    - The **covenant of grace** is fundamentally distinct from the **covenant of works**.
    - Mosaic law includes both typological (intrusive) and gracious elements.
    - The intrusion of judgment under Moses is temporary and pedagogical.
    - The ultimate fulfillment is found in Christ, not in the typological order.
    - "The law was given as a pedagogue to lead us to Christ." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Biblical Theology**
    - All of redemptive history is oriented toward the **eschaton**.
    - The intrusion of judgment is a foretaste of final consummation.
    - The movement from promise to fulfillment structures biblical revelation.
    - The church lives in the tension of the already and not yet.
    - "The eschatological is the backbone of the Pauline system." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s biblical-theological method provided the essential categories for later developments in **Klinean covenant theology** and the articulation of **intrusion ethics**. His emphasis on the organic unity of redemptive history and typology shaped the way Reformed theologians understand the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of **covenant structure**, typology, and the eschatological dimensions of biblical revelation, profoundly influencing twentieth-century Reformed thought.
