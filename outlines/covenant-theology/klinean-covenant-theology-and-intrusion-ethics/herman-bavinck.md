# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck’s approach to **covenant theology** is foundational for later Reformed developments, including the Klinean tradition, though he does not explicitly articulate **intrusion ethics** as later formulated by Meredith Kline. Bavinck emphasizes the organic unity of **redemptive history**, the distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, and the typological function of Old Testament law, which anticipates the coming of Christ. His theological framework provides resources for understanding the temporary and typological aspects of Mosaic law, which are central to Klinean intrusion ethics.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - Views **covenant theology** as the backbone of biblical revelation.
    - Emphasizes the progressive unfolding of God’s plan through history.
    - Sees typology as a legitimate hermeneutical approach to Old Testament law.
    - Affirms the continuity and discontinuity between the old and new covenants.
    "Revelation is the history of the covenant of grace." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Maintains a real, historical **covenant of works** with Adam, foundational for understanding law and grace.
    - The **covenant of grace** is God’s response to human sin, centering on Christ as Mediator.
    - The Mosaic covenant contains both legal and gracious elements, serving a typological function.
    - This distinction undergirds later Reformed discussions of intrusion and typology.
    "The covenant of works and the covenant of grace are not two ways of salvation, but two dispensations of the one covenantal relationship." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Typology and Temporality of Mosaic Law**
    - Mosaic law is temporary and typological, pointing forward to Christ.
    - The ceremonial and civil laws are fulfilled and abrogated in the new covenant.
    - The moral law retains abiding significance, but its administration changes.
    - This framework anticipates the Klinean idea of **intrusion ethics**—the temporary intrusion of eschatological judgment into history.
    "The law was given as a tutor to lead us to Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **God’s Justice and Mercy in Covenant Administration**
    - God’s justice is displayed in the administration of the **covenant of works** and in the typological judgments of the Old Testament.
    - God’s mercy is revealed supremely in the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Old Testament contains anticipations of final judgment, but these are provisional.
    - The full realization of justice and mercy comes in Christ and the new creation.
    "In the Old Testament, God’s justice and mercy are revealed in shadow and promise." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment of the Covenants**
    - Christ is the fulfillment of all covenantal types and promises.
    - The temporary and typological aspects of the Mosaic economy find their end in Him.
    - The ethical demands of the law are transformed in union with Christ.
    - This Christocentric focus is foundational for understanding the transition from Old Testament intrusion to New Testament fulfillment.
    "All the promises of God are yes and amen in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust **covenant theology** shaped twentieth-century Reformed thought and provided the theological groundwork for later developments such as Klinean intrusion ethics. While he did not use the terminology of "intrusion," his emphasis on typology, the temporary nature of Mosaic law, and the organic unity of redemptive history deeply influenced the way Reformed theologians understand the relationship between law, gospel, and eschatology. His work continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the structure and ethics of the biblical covenants.
