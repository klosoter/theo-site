# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s theology of the **covenant** is not systematically developed in the manner of later Reformed thinkers, but his distinction between **Law and Gospel** laid groundwork for subsequent covenantal formulations. Luther emphasized the unilateral nature of God’s promise in the **Gospel**, contrasting it with the conditional demands of the **Law**, and he did not articulate a doctrine of **intrusion ethics** as later developed by Klinean theology. Nevertheless, his approach to the relationship between the Old and New Testaments and his understanding of **divine justice** and **mercy** influenced later covenantal thought.

- "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 26)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Commentary on Genesis (1535–1545)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
   - The **Law** reveals God’s righteous demands and exposes human sinfulness.
   - The **Gospel** proclaims God’s unconditional promise of grace through Christ.
   - The Law is preparatory, driving sinners to seek mercy in the Gospel.
   - The distinction is foundational for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
   - "Distinguishing the law from the gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Unilateral Divine Promise**
   - God’s covenant with humanity is grounded in His sovereign grace, not human merit.
   - The promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and received by faith alone.
   - Human works cannot secure or maintain the covenant relationship.
   - The Gospel is a testament, not a contract, emphasizing God’s initiative.
   - "The promise of the New Testament is nothing else but the legacy bequeathed by Christ to us." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
   - The Old Testament Law serves a temporary, pedagogical function.
   - The New Covenant fulfills and supersedes the old, centering on Christ.
   - The ceremonial and civil laws are abrogated in the Gospel era.
   - The moral law continues to convict and guide, but not to justify.
   - "The law was given, not to justify, but to show sin and to drive us to Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Divine Justice and Mercy**
   - God’s justice is satisfied in Christ’s atoning work.
   - Mercy is extended freely to believers apart from works.
   - The tension between justice and mercy is resolved in the cross.
   - The believer lives in the paradox of being both sinner and justified.
   - "Simul iustus et peccator." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Absence of Intrusion Ethics**
   - Luther did not develop a doctrine of **intrusion ethics** as later seen in Klinean theology.
   - He viewed Old Testament judgments as historical and typological, not paradigmatic for the church.
   - The church’s calling is to suffer, not to execute judgment.
   - The ethics of the Christian life are shaped by the cross, not by Israel’s theocracy.
   - "The church is to bear the cross, not wield the sword." (Commentary on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s sharp **Law-Gospel distinction** profoundly shaped Protestant understandings of the **covenant** and the nature of redemptive history. While he did not articulate a formal doctrine of **intrusion ethics**, his views on the discontinuity between the Mosaic economy and the New Covenant influenced later Reformed developments. Luther’s emphasis on the unilateral promise of the Gospel and the abrogation of the Old Testament civil and ceremonial laws provided a foundation for subsequent covenant theologians, even as later figures like Meredith Kline would systematize these themes in new directions.
