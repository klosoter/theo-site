# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray articulated a robust **covenant theology** rooted in the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the historical unfolding of **redemptive revelation**. While he did not develop the distinctive **intrusion ethics** later advanced by Meredith Kline, Murray emphasized the continuity of **law and gospel** and the organic relationship between **Old and New Covenants**.

- "The covenant of grace is one in substance throughout, though it is administered in various ways." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- Principles of Conduct
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- The Theology of the Westminster Confession of Faith
- The Covenant of the Promise (Westminster Theological Journal, 1953)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of grace** is a single, unfolding reality throughout Scripture.
   - Both Old and New Testaments administer the same covenant in different forms.
   - Emphasizes the organic continuity between Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New Covenants.
   - Rejects sharp discontinuities between Israel and the church.
   - "The unity of the covenant of grace is not to be construed as identity of administration." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Organic Relationship of Law and Gospel**
   - The **moral law** remains binding and is fulfilled in Christ.
   - The Mosaic law serves both redemptive and pedagogical purposes.
   - Law and gospel are not antithetical but mutually interpretive.
   - The ethical demands of the law are realized in the life of the believer by the Spirit.
   - "Law and grace are not antithetical; law is the handmaid of grace." (Principles of Conduct)

3. **Historical Progression of Revelation**
   - God’s covenants unfold progressively in redemptive history.
   - Each covenant administration reveals more of God’s redemptive purpose.
   - The new covenant fulfills and consummates previous administrations.
   - The historical context is essential for understanding covenantal obligations.
   - "The progress of revelation is the progress of the covenant." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Intrusion Ethics**
   - Murray did not adopt the concept of **intrusion ethics** as later articulated by Kline.
   - He viewed Old Testament judgments as historically situated, not as eschatological intrusions.
   - Emphasized the continuity of ethical norms across redemptive history.
   - Saw the Mosaic law as a guide for Christian conduct, not as a temporary intrusion.
   - "The law given through Moses was not an intrusion but an administration of grace." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Covenant and Eschatology**
   - The covenants point forward to their consummation in Christ.
   - Eschatological hope is grounded in the fulfillment of covenant promises.
   - The church is the heir of the promises made to Abraham.
   - The ethical life of believers anticipates the final realization of the covenant.
   - "The eschatology of the covenant is realized in Christ and his people." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s covenant theology provided a foundation for later Reformed discussions, emphasizing the **unity of redemptive history** and the abiding significance of the **covenant of grace**. His careful exegesis and rejection of **intrusion ethics** set him apart from later Klinean developments, shaping the trajectory of Westminster Seminary’s approach to covenant theology. Murray’s influence endures in contemporary Reformed thought, particularly in debates over the relationship between law, gospel, and the continuity of the covenants.
