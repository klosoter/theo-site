# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure of **Old Princeton Theology**, articulated a **covenant theology** rooted in classic Reformed categories, emphasizing the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** as foundational to biblical history. While Hodge did not develop a doctrine of **intrusion ethics** as later seen in Klinean thought, he provided a robust framework for understanding the continuity and discontinuity between the **Old and New Covenants**, focusing on the unity of God's redemptive plan rather than epochal ethical discontinuities.

- "The covenant of works was the arrangement under which Adam was placed, and the covenant of grace is that under which we are now living." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on covenant theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Covenant of Works**
    - Adam was constituted as the federal head of humanity under a probationary covenant.
    - The **Covenant of Works** established the principle of life upon perfect obedience.
    - The fall resulted in the forfeiture of life and the imputation of guilt to Adam’s posterity.
    - This covenant sets the backdrop for understanding redemption in Christ.
    - "The covenant of works is the foundation of all God’s subsequent dealings with men." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Unity and Distinction of the Covenants**
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
    - There are different administrations (Old and New) but a single way of salvation.
    - The Mosaic economy is seen as an administration of the Covenant of Grace, not a republication of the Covenant of Works.
    - Hodge resists sharp ethical or soteriological discontinuities between the covenants.
    - "The plan of salvation has always been the same, and the conditions of salvation have always been the same." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Typology and Continuity**
    - Old Testament types and shadows point forward to Christ and the New Covenant.
    - The ethical demands of the Mosaic law are continuous with the moral law.
    - Hodge does not posit a temporary suspension of grace or a unique intrusion of final judgment ethics in the Mosaic period.
    - The ceremonial law is abrogated, but the moral law remains binding.
    - "The law given at Sinai was not a covenant of works, but a new form of the covenant of grace." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam and Christ serve as federal heads in their respective covenants.
    - Guilt and righteousness are imputed on the basis of covenantal representation.
    - The structure of the covenants undergirds the doctrines of original sin and justification.
    - Hodge’s federalism shapes his understanding of both anthropology and soteriology.
    - "The imputation of Adam’s sin and of Christ’s righteousness rests on the same principle." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Rejection of Intrusion Ethics**
    - Hodge does not articulate a doctrine of **intrusion ethics** as later developed by Kline.
    - He maintains the ongoing validity of the moral law across redemptive history.
    - The Mosaic law is not seen as a temporary reintroduction of eschatological judgment.
    - Ethical norms are grounded in the character of God and the unity of the covenants.
    - "The law is the revelation of the will of God, and therefore immutable." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Charles Hodge’s **covenant theology** became a standard for American Presbyterianism and shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially at Princeton Seminary. His rejection of a Mosaic "intrusion" of final judgment ethics stands in contrast to later Klinean developments, emphasizing instead the unity and continuity of God’s redemptive dealings. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of **federal theology**, the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, and the abiding validity of the moral law. His work remains a touchstone for those defending classic Reformed covenantal categories.
