# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a **covenant theology** that distinguishes between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing the historical administration of God’s covenants with humanity. While the Standards do not explicitly develop the later concept of **intrusion ethics** as seen in Klinean theology, they lay foundational principles regarding the **moral law**, **typology**, and the unique role of **Israel** in redemptive history that Kline and others would later expand upon.

- "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 20–36)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 12–20)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Directory for Public Worship (for covenantal liturgical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
    - Adam was placed under a covenant requiring perfect obedience.
    - The promise of life was conditioned on obedience; death was threatened for disobedience.
    - This covenant serves as the basis for understanding law and justice in redemptive history.
    - The distinction between law and gospel is rooted in this original arrangement.
    - "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works..." (WCF 7.2)

2. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Structure**
    - After the Fall, God established a covenant to redeem the elect through Christ.
    - This covenant is administered through various dispensations, but is one in substance.
    - The covenant of grace is central to the unity of Scripture and salvation history.
    - The visible church is the community of the covenant of grace.
    - "Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second..." (WCF 7.3)

3. **Typology and the Mosaic Economy**
    - The Mosaic covenant contains typological elements pointing to Christ.
    - Ceremonial laws prefigured the work of the Redeemer.
    - The civil laws were particular to Israel as a theocratic nation.
    - The moral law remains binding, but ceremonial and civil laws are abrogated.
    - "All which ceremonial laws are now abrogated under the new testament." (WCF 19.3)

4. **Moral Law’s Perpetual Authority**
    - The moral law, summarized in the Ten Commandments, binds all people at all times.
    - It was given to Adam and republished at Sinai.
    - The law continues to guide Christian conduct, even under grace.
    - The law is distinct from the ceremonial and civil aspects of the Mosaic covenant.
    - "The moral law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others..." (WCF 19.5)

5. **Israel’s Unique Theocratic Role**
    - Israel’s civil polity was uniquely ordained for a time.
    - The judicial laws expired with the state of that people.
    - The theocracy served as a type of God’s final judgment and kingdom.
    - The church now exists under the administration of the covenant of grace, not a national theocracy.
    - "To them also, as a body politic, he gave sundry judicial laws, which expired together with the state of that people..." (WCF 19.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards established the classic **Reformed covenant theology** that undergirds much of Presbyterian and confessional Reformed thought. Their careful distinctions between the **Covenant of Works**, **Covenant of Grace**, and the typological function of the Mosaic economy provided the categories later developed by Klinean theology, including the concept of **intrusion ethics**. While the Standards do not use the terminology of "intrusion," their framework for understanding Israel’s unique role in redemptive history laid the groundwork for subsequent theological reflection on the temporary intrusion of eschatological judgment into history. Their influence remains foundational for discussions of law, gospel, and covenant in the Reformed tradition.
