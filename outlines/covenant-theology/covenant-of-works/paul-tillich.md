# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not affirm a traditional **Covenant of Works** as found in Reformed theology, but he engaged deeply with the existential meaning of **law**, **creation**, and **human responsibility**. For Tillich, the relationship between God and humanity is rooted in the **structure of being** and the **estrangement** that marks the human condition, rather than in a historical covenantal arrangement. He reinterpreted covenantal themes through the lens of **symbolic theology** and **existential analysis**.

- "The concept of law is not a matter of a legalistic relationship between God and man, but of the structure of being itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Literal Covenant of Works**
   - Tillich does not affirm a historical **Covenant of Works** as a pre-fall arrangement.
   - He views biblical covenants as **symbols** expressing the existential relationship between God and humanity.
   - The idea of a legal contract between God and Adam is seen as mythological, not ontological.
   - Human destiny is interpreted through **estrangement** and **reconciliation**, not covenantal merit.
   - "The myth of paradise is not a historical report but a symbol of the essential unity of man with God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Law as Ontological Structure**
   - Law is understood as the **structure of being**, not as external command.
   - The "law" expresses the order and limits of created existence.
   - Human violation of law is existential, resulting in **estrangement**.
   - The law points to the need for **grace**, not to a works-based righteousness.
   - "Law is the expression of the structure of being and the demand to actualize it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Sin as Existential Estrangement**
   - Sin is not merely the breaking of a covenantal law but a state of **alienation** from God.
   - The fall is interpreted as the universal human condition, not a discrete historical event.
   - All humans participate in **estrangement**, not just Adam as a federal head.
   - The need for salvation arises from existential brokenness, not covenantal failure.
   - "Sin is separation, and separation is the root of sin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Symbolic Interpretation of Biblical Narratives**
   - Biblical accounts of Adam, law, and covenant are **symbols** of deeper realities.
   - The "Covenant of Works" is a mythic expression of the human quest for autonomy.
   - Tillich emphasizes the **depth dimension** of scriptural language.
   - Theological truth is conveyed through symbols, not literal contracts.
   - "Symbols participate in the reality to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

5. **Primacy of Grace over Works**
   - Human fulfillment cannot be achieved through works or legal obedience.
   - **Grace** is the ultimate answer to human estrangement and inability.
   - The "new being" in Christ transcends any legalistic framework.
   - Salvation is a matter of **ontological transformation**, not covenantal reward.
   - "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness." (The Shaking of the Foundations)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **covenant** and **law** challenged traditional Reformed categories, shifting the focus from historical covenants to existential realities. His symbolic and ontological approach influenced 20th-century theology, especially in discussions of **sin**, **grace**, and the human condition. While his views stand in contrast to confessional Reformed theology, Tillich’s work remains a significant resource for those exploring the existential and philosophical dimensions of Christian doctrine.
