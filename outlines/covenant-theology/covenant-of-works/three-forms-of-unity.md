# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed doctrine of the Covenant of Works**. They affirm that God entered into a covenant with Adam, requiring **perfect obedience** as a condition for **eternal life**, and that Adam’s failure brought **sin and death** upon all humanity. This foundational covenant sets the stage for the necessity and structure of the **Covenant of Grace**.

- "God created man good and after His own image... that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness, to glorify and praise Him." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 14–15, 17
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q/A 6, 9, 12, 18–21
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads of Doctrine I–III
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Covenant Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism*
- J. Mark Beach, *The Faithful Scribe: Philipp Melanchthon and the Making of the Heidelberg Catechism*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam as Federal Head**
   - Adam was created in **original righteousness** and stood as the representative of all humanity.
   - His obedience or disobedience would affect the entire human race.
   - The covenant required perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience.
   - Adam’s fall resulted in the **imputation of guilt** and corruption to all his descendants.
   - "By the disobedience of Adam, original sin is extended to all mankind." (Belgic Confession, Art. 15)

2. **Conditional Promise of Life**
   - The covenant offered **eternal life** as a reward for obedience.
   - This promise was not based on Adam’s merit, but on God’s goodness and condescension.
   - Failure to obey would bring death and alienation from God.
   - The **law** was written on Adam’s heart, guiding him in his duty.
   - "God created man good... that he might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with Him in eternal happiness." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 6)

3. **Transgression and Its Consequences**
   - Adam’s breach of the covenant brought **sin and death** into the world.
   - All people are now conceived and born in sin, subject to God’s wrath.
   - Humanity is rendered unable to fulfill the law’s demands after the fall.
   - The need for redemption arises directly from this broken covenant.
   - "We are all conceived and born in sin." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 7)

4. **Preparation for the Covenant of Grace**
   - The Covenant of Works provides the legal framework for understanding the work of Christ.
   - Christ is presented as the **second Adam**, fulfilling the law’s demands.
   - The **Covenant of Grace** is necessary because of Adam’s failure.
   - The unity and distinction between the covenants are maintained throughout the confessions.
   - "God... immediately manifested Himself to be merciful by promising and giving His only begotten Son." (Belgic Confession, Art. 17)

5. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
   - The law, rooted in the Covenant of Works, reveals humanity’s inability and need for grace.
   - The gospel proclaims the fulfillment of the law in Christ.
   - The confessions maintain a sharp distinction between law (demand) and gospel (promise).
   - Assurance of salvation rests on Christ’s obedience, not Adam’s or our own.
   - "Out of the gospel, God Himself gives by grace what He demands in the law." (Heidelberg Catechism Q/A 36)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the **Reformed understanding of covenant theology**, especially the distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. Their articulation of Adam’s federal headship and the conditional promise of life has influenced confessional Reformed churches worldwide. The framework they provide continues to inform debates on law, gospel, and the work of Christ as the second Adam. Their legacy endures in catechetical instruction, doctrinal standards, and ecumenical dialogue within the Reformed tradition.
