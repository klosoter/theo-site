# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer critically engaged the **Covenant of Works** as a traditional Reformed doctrine, questioning its exegetical foundation and theological necessity. He argued that the concept risks imposing a **legalistic framework** on the relationship between God and humanity, and preferred to emphasize the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the dynamic character of **divine-human fellowship**.

- "The idea of a covenant of works is not a self-evident biblical datum, but rather a construction that raises serious questions." (Sin, Studies in Dogmatics)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Critical Reassessment of the Covenant of Works**
    - Challenges the **exegetical basis** for a pre-fall covenant distinct from the covenant of grace.
    - Argues that the **Scriptures** do not explicitly teach a formal covenant with Adam.
    - Sees the doctrine as a later theological development rather than a biblical given.
    - Warns against reading systematic categories into the biblical text.
    - "The covenant of works is not a biblical concept, but a theological construction." (Sin)

2. **Emphasis on the Unity of the Covenant**
    - Stresses the continuity between God's dealings with Adam and with later humanity.
    - Views the **covenant of grace** as the primary biblical framework.
    - Argues that dividing covenants risks fragmenting the biblical narrative.
    - Sees the unity of the covenant as essential for understanding redemption.
    - "The unity of the covenant is a central motif in Scripture." (The Covenant of Grace)

3. **Rejection of Legalism in Covenant Theology**
    - Critiques the covenant of works for introducing a **legalistic** relationship between God and man.
    - Emphasizes the relational and gracious character of God's dealings from the beginning.
    - Warns that a legal framework can obscure the nature of **divine grace**.
    - Advocates for a more dynamic, personal understanding of the covenant.
    - "A legalistic interpretation of the covenant distorts the biblical message." (Sin)

4. **Theological Caution Against Speculation**
    - Urges restraint in constructing doctrines not clearly grounded in Scripture.
    - Warns against speculative reconstructions of pre-fall conditions.
    - Prefers to focus on what is revealed rather than hypothetical covenants.
    - Sees the risk of dogmatic overreach in the traditional formulation.
    - "Theological speculation must not replace biblical testimony." (Sin)

5. **Christocentric Focus in Covenant Understanding**
    - Centers the meaning and fulfillment of the covenant in **Jesus Christ**.
    - Argues that Christ is the true mediator and fulfiller of God's covenant purposes.
    - Sees the work of Christ as uniting all of God's dealings with humanity.
    - Emphasizes that the covenant finds its telos in redemption through Christ.
    - "The covenant finds its fulfillment and meaning in Christ alone." (Faith and Justification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s critique of the **Covenant of Works** prompted significant re-examination within Reformed theology, especially among those wary of speculative or overly systematic approaches. His emphasis on the unity of the covenant and the centrality of **grace** influenced later theologians to reconsider the structure and purpose of covenant theology. While some traditionalists resisted his conclusions, Berkouwer’s careful biblical focus and Christocentric orientation continue to shape contemporary discussions of Reformed dogmatics.
