# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann did not affirm a traditional **Covenant of Works** as found in Reformed theology. Instead, he approached biblical covenants through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**, focusing on the individual's encounter with God in **faith** rather than on historical or legal frameworks. For Bultmann, the biblical narrative is primarily a call to authentic existence rather than a record of divine legal arrangements.

- "The Old Testament is not a book of law but a witness to the history of God’s dealings with man." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament
- New Testament and Mythology
- Jesus Christ and Mythology
- Faith and Understanding
- History and Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Interprets biblical texts by removing mythological elements to uncover existential meaning.
    - Rejects literal readings of **covenantal narratives** as historical or legal contracts.
    - Sees the **Covenant of Works** as a mythological construct, not a binding theological reality.
    - Emphasizes the existential call to decision over adherence to a prelapsarian covenant.
    - "Myth speaks of the unworldly in worldly images." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Faith**
    - Focuses on the individual's response to God's word rather than on legal or forensic categories.
    - Views **obedience** as an existential act, not fulfillment of a covenantal law.
    - Downplays the role of Adam as a federal head in a **Covenant of Works**.
    - Interprets biblical commands as invitations to authentic existence.
    - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Salvation by Works**
    - Argues that salvation is not achieved by fulfilling a set of divine requirements.
    - Critiques the notion that humanity could ever merit life through obedience.
    - Sees the **law** as revealing human incapacity, not as a means to life.
    - Emphasizes grace and the existential encounter with Christ.
    - "Man cannot secure himself by his own works." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant**
    - Interprets Christ not as the second Adam fulfilling a broken covenant, but as the decisive revelation of God.
    - Sees the significance of Christ in the existential transformation he brings, not in legal substitution.
    - Downplays typological connections between Adam and Christ found in traditional **Covenant Theology**.
    - Focuses on the newness of life in Christ, rather than restoration of a lost covenantal status.
    - "In Christ, the eschatological event has already taken place." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Historical Skepticism Toward Covenant Structures**
    - Questions the historical basis of a prelapsarian **Covenant of Works** in Genesis.
    - Regards covenant language as later theological reflection, not original historical fact.
    - Prioritizes the kerygma and existential proclamation over covenantal frameworks.
    - Sees the **Covenant of Works** as a theological construct without existential import.
    - "The task of theology is not to reconstruct a system but to interpret the kerygma." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann's approach to the **Covenant of Works** has profoundly influenced modern biblical scholarship by shifting focus from legal and historical frameworks to existential interpretation. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional Reformed categories and encouraged theologians to reconsider the function of covenant language in Scripture. While his views have been controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in twentieth-century theology, especially in discussions of biblical hermeneutics and the nature of faith.
