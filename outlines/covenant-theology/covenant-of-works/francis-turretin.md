# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** as foundational to **Reformed federal theology**. He maintained that God established this covenant with Adam as the representative head of humanity, promising **eternal life** upon perfect obedience and threatening **death** upon transgression. Turretin’s formulation underscores the **distinction between law and gospel** and the necessity of **imputed righteousness** in the order of salvation.

- "The covenant of works is that by which God, having created man after his own image, entered into a covenant with him, promising eternal life upon condition of perfect obedience, and threatening death in case of disobedience." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 8.3.3)

- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- The Covenant of Works: Theological and Exegetical Essays (secondary: J.V. Fesko, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Covenant of Works**
    - Asserts that the **Covenant of Works** was a real, historical arrangement between God and Adam.
    - Argues that Adam served as the **federal head** for all humanity.
    - Maintains that the terms were clearly revealed to Adam in creation.
    - Emphasizes the covenant’s basis in God’s **justice and goodness**.
    - "That there was a covenant made with Adam, we prove…from the express testimony of Scripture and the analogy of faith." (Institutes, 8.3.4)

2. **Conditionality Based on Perfect Obedience**
    - Eternal life was promised to Adam on the strict condition of **perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience**.
    - Disobedience would result in **death** and condemnation for Adam and his posterity.
    - The law written on Adam’s heart was sufficient for covenantal obedience.
    - The **probationary command** (tree of knowledge) served as a test of obedience.
    - "The condition of the covenant was perfect obedience, both as to the matter and as to the duration." (Institutes, 8.3.6)

3. **Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
    - The **Covenant of Works** is fundamentally distinct from the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Law operates on the principle of “do this and live”; gospel on “believe and live.”
    - The failure of the first covenant necessitated the second, rooted in Christ’s obedience.
    - This distinction safeguards the **gratuitousness of salvation** in Christ.
    - "The law is opposed to the gospel, as the covenant of works to the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 8.3.9)

4. **Imputation and Federal Representation**
    - Adam’s disobedience is **imputed** to all his descendants.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the law and secures righteousness for believers.
    - The federal principle undergirds both condemnation in Adam and justification in Christ.
    - This structure preserves the coherence of **original sin** and **justification**.
    - "As Adam was the federal head of the covenant of works, so Christ is of the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 8.3.10)

5. **Perpetual Theological Significance**
    - The **Covenant of Works** remains essential for understanding the gospel.
    - It reveals the depth of human sin and the necessity of a mediator.
    - The doctrine upholds the integrity of God’s justice and mercy.
    - It provides the framework for the **Reformed ordo salutis**.
    - "The knowledge of the covenant of works is necessary to understand the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 8.3.11)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s formulation of the **Covenant of Works** became a touchstone for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional standards and systematic theology. His careful distinctions and federal framework influenced theologians such as Herman Witsius and Charles Hodge. The clarity and rigor of Turretin’s exposition continue to inform contemporary debates on **law, gospel, and justification** within Reformed circles.
