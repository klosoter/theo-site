# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly articulate a **Covenant of Works**, but his theology of **Adam’s original righteousness**, **probation**, and the consequences of **disobedience** laid essential groundwork for later covenantal formulations. He viewed Adam as created in a state of **innocence** with the possibility of eternal life contingent upon obedience, shaping the theological foundation for the Reformed understanding of humanity’s original state.

- "God gave a command, in order to prove whether he would obey or not, and threatened death if he did not obey." (City of God, XIII.13)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and on the Baptism of Infants
- On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Adam’s Original Righteousness**
    - Adam was created in a state of **innocence** and uprightness.
    - He possessed the ability not to sin (**posse non peccare**).
    - This state was mutable; Adam could fall from it.
    - Adam’s righteousness was a gift, not intrinsic to his nature.
    "He was made upright, but he was not made immutable." (City of God, XIV.10)

2. **Probationary Command and Testing**
    - God gave Adam a clear command as a test of obedience.
    - The command revealed God’s sovereign authority.
    - Obedience would have led to greater blessedness.
    - Disobedience resulted in the loss of original righteousness.
    "The prohibition was imposed in order that obedience might be tested." (City of God, XIII.13)

3. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acted as the representative of all humanity.
    - His sin resulted in the transmission of **original sin** to his descendants.
    - All humanity is implicated in Adam’s disobedience.
    - The consequences of Adam’s fall include both spiritual and physical death.
    "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin." (City of God, XIII.14)

4. **Conditional Immortality**
    - Adam was created mortal but could have attained immortality through obedience.
    - The tree of life symbolized the promise of eternal life.
    - Death entered the world as a direct result of Adam’s transgression.
    - Immortality is now only possible through **Christ’s redemption**.
    "If he had kept the commandment, he would have been delivered from the condition of mortality." (City of God, XIII.20)

5. **Necessity of Grace after the Fall**
    - After Adam’s sin, humanity is utterly dependent on **divine grace** for salvation.
    - Human will is bound and cannot choose good apart from grace.
    - The **law** now exposes sin but cannot restore righteousness.
    - Only through **Christ** can the effects of Adam’s fall be overcome.
    "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 29)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **Adam’s original state**, the nature of the fall, and the transmission of **original sin** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought and provided the conceptual foundation for the later Reformed doctrine of the **Covenant of Works**. His emphasis on **federal headship** and the necessity of grace influenced both medieval and Reformation theology. While Augustine did not use covenantal terminology, his insights remain essential for understanding the development of covenant theology.
