# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** as foundational to **Reformed federal theology**. He emphasized its role in establishing the original relationship between God and Adam, grounding the necessity of **obedience**, **probation**, and the promise of **eschatological life**. For Vos, the Covenant of Works is essential for understanding the structure of **redemptive history** and the subsequent **Covenant of Grace**.

- "The covenant with Adam was a covenant of works, not of grace; it was a probationary arrangement, not a redemptive one." ("Reformed Dogmatics: Anthropology")

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: Anthropology
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology (article)
- The Eschatology of the Old Testament

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Covenant of Works**
    - The Covenant of Works was an actual, historical arrangement between God and Adam.
    - Adam served as the **federal head** representing all humanity.
    - The covenant was established prior to the Fall and distinct from the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Vos rejected any notion that the covenant was merely hypothetical or symbolic.
    - "The Reformed view regards the covenant with Adam as a real, historical transaction." (Reformed Dogmatics: Anthropology)

2. **Probation and Eschatological Promise**
    - Adam was placed under a period of probation to secure a higher, **eschatological life**.
    - The promise was not mere continuation of earthly existence, but advancement to **confirmed righteousness**.
    - The **tree of life** symbolized the reward for obedience.
    - Failure would result in **death** and loss of fellowship with God.
    - "The probation had as its issue the attainment of a higher, permanent state of life." (Reformed Dogmatics: Anthropology)

3. **Works Principle Distinct from Grace**
    - The principle of **works** governed the original covenant, not grace or redemptive mercy.
    - Obedience was required for the reward; no provision for forgiveness was built into the covenant.
    - This distinction undergirds the necessity and uniqueness of the **Covenant of Grace** after the Fall.
    - Vos emphasized that grace only enters after the breach of the first covenant.
    - "The two covenants are mutually exclusive in principle: works and grace cannot be mixed." (Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology)

4. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam acted as the **representative head** for all his descendants.
    - His obedience or disobedience would be **imputed** to the entire human race.
    - This federal structure explains the universality of sin and death.
    - It also sets the pattern for Christ’s role as the second Adam in the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - "Adam’s act was reckoned as the act of all, because he stood as the federal head." (Reformed Dogmatics: Anthropology)

5. **Covenant as the Structure of Redemptive History**
    - The Covenant of Works provides the framework for understanding all of **redemptive history**.
    - The failure of the first covenant necessitates the **Covenant of Grace** and the work of Christ.
    - Vos saw the covenants as the backbone of biblical revelation and theological development.
    - This structure highlights the unity and progression of God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "The entire history of redemption unfolds as the outworking of the covenantal structure established in Eden." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **Covenant of Works** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in its understanding of **federal headship** and the relationship between law and gospel. His biblical-theological method reinforced the covenant’s centrality in the drama of redemption. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of covenant theology, providing a framework for interpreting both the unity and diversity of Scripture.
