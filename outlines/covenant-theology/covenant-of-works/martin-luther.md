# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not explicitly formulate a **Covenant of Works** doctrine as later Reformed theologians did, but his writings on **law and gospel**, **original righteousness**, and the **prelapsarian state** address similar themes. Luther understood Adam's original relationship with God as one of obedience and trust, disrupted by the Fall, but he did not frame this in terms of a formal covenant. His emphasis remained on the inability of humans to achieve righteousness by works after the Fall, highlighting the necessity of **justification by faith**.

- "For before sin Adam was righteous by nature, pleasing to God by his created state, not by the Law." (Lectures on Genesis)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (1535–1545)
- Commentary on Galatians (1535)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Disputation Against Scholastic Theology (1517)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Luther sharply distinguished the **law** (commands, demands) from the **gospel** (promise, grace).
    - The law reveals sin and the impossibility of attaining righteousness by works.
    - The gospel offers forgiveness and righteousness through faith in Christ alone.
    - This distinction shapes his understanding of Adam’s state before and after the Fall.
    - "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

2. **Original Righteousness and Its Loss**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness** and harmony with God.
    - This righteousness was not merited but a gift of creation.
    - The Fall resulted in the total loss of this righteousness and the corruption of human nature.
    - After the Fall, humans cannot regain righteousness through their own efforts.
    - "Adam was created righteous and upright, but he lost this righteousness through disobedience." (Lectures on Genesis)

3. **Absence of a Formal Covenant of Works**
    - Luther did not articulate a **Covenant of Works** as a distinct theological category.
    - He described Adam’s relationship with God in terms of obedience and trust, not covenantal merit.
    - Later Reformed distinctions between **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** are absent in his system.
    - His focus remained on the relational and existential aspects of Adam’s obedience.
    - "Scripture does not speak of a covenant with Adam, but of a command and promise." (Lectures on Genesis)

4. **Impossibility of Post-Fall Justification by Works**
    - After the Fall, the law cannot justify; it only condemns.
    - Human works are insufficient for regaining favor with God.
    - Justification is possible only through **faith in Christ**.
    - The law’s function is pedagogical, driving sinners to the gospel.
    - "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight." (Commentary on Galatians)

5. **Christ as the True Fulfillment**
    - Christ alone fulfills the law’s demands perfectly.
    - The righteousness lost in Adam is restored only in Christ.
    - Believers are justified by Christ’s obedience, not their own.
    - The focus is on union with Christ rather than covenantal merit.
    - "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes." (Commentary on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to **law and gospel** profoundly shaped Protestant soteriology, even though he did not develop a formal **Covenant of Works** doctrine. His emphasis on the inability of fallen humanity to achieve righteousness by works paved the way for later Reformed distinctions between covenants. While Reformed theologians systematized the **Covenant of Works**, Luther’s insights into original righteousness and the necessity of grace remain foundational for Protestant theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing centrality of **justification by faith** and the law-gospel distinction.
