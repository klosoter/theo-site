# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** as foundational to the relationship between God and humanity before the Fall. They teach that God entered into a **covenant** with Adam, representing all humanity, promising **life upon perfect obedience** and threatening death upon disobedience. This framework undergirds the Standards’ understanding of **federal theology** and the necessity of Christ’s redemptive work.

- "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 20, 30, 97)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 12, 16)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Westminster Assembly’s Minutes and Papers (for historical context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam as Federal Head**
   - Adam is regarded as the representative of all humanity in the **Covenant of Works**.
   - His actions have direct consequences for all his descendants.
   - The imputation of guilt and corruption is rooted in Adam’s federal headship.
   - This headship establishes the need for a second Adam, Christ.
   - "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in that first transgression." (WSC 16)

2. **Promise of Life upon Perfect Obedience**
   - God promised eternal life to Adam and his posterity on the condition of perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience.
   - The **Covenant of Works** is distinct from the **Covenant of Grace** in its requirement of works, not faith.
   - Failure to obey results in death and alienation from God.
   - This promise highlights the justice and goodness of God in his dealings with humanity.
   - "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience." (WCF 19.1)

3. **Law as Covenant**
   - The moral law given to Adam was not merely a rule but constituted a covenant relationship.
   - The **law** is both a rule of righteousness and the stipulation of the covenant.
   - The **Covenant of Works** is the original context for understanding the law’s demands.
   - The law’s function as a covenant continues to inform the Standards’ doctrine of justification and sanctification.
   - "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works..." (WCF 19.1)

4. **Universality of the Covenant’s Consequences**
   - The breach of the **Covenant of Works** brought sin and death to all humanity.
   - All people are born under the guilt and corruption resulting from Adam’s failure.
   - The universality of condemnation under the first covenant sets the stage for the necessity of redemption.
   - This universal impact is foundational for the doctrine of **original sin**.
   - "By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and body." (WCF 6.2)

5. **Contrast with the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **Covenant of Works** is contrasted with the **Covenant of Grace**, which offers salvation through faith in Christ.
   - The inability of fallen humanity to fulfill the law’s demands highlights the sufficiency of Christ’s obedience.
   - The two covenants structure the Standards’ understanding of redemptive history.
   - Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the requirements of the first covenant on behalf of the elect.
   - "Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, providing a clear articulation of the **Covenant of Works** that has influenced confessional documents and theological education for centuries. Their federal framework underlies much of later Presbyterian and Reformed thought, distinguishing their approach to law, gospel, and the work of Christ. The Standards’ teaching on the **Covenant of Works** remains a touchstone for debates on original sin, justification, and the unity of redemptive history.
