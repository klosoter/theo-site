- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: conditionality vs graciousness of the covenant of works; republication in the Mosaic economy; relation to **divine justice**, **imputation**, and **merit**.
  - External: Lutheran suspicion of a prelapsarian covenant; Arminian denial of strict federal imputation; modern biblical-theological objections that the doctrine lacks exegetical basis.
  - Contemporary: debates in conservative Presbyterian circles over republication and typology; retrieval of classic **natural law** and **creation order**; pressures from anti-covenantal or biblicist evangelicalism.
- Defended position: The covenant of works, understood as a divinely initiated prelapsarian covenant of life with Adam as federal head requiring perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience for eschatological advancement, is exegetically warranted, historically Reformed, theologically necessary for a coherent **law–gospel** structure, and should be retained and carefully nuanced, including a qualified republication in the Mosaic covenant.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the **covenant of works** concerns whether God entered into a prelapsarian covenant with Adam as federal head of humanity, promising eschatological life upon the condition of perfect obedience and threatening death upon disobedience. Properly understood, this doctrine does not merely offer a historical curiosity in seventeenth century **federal theology** but provides an architectonic for the entire Reformed system, structuring the relation of creation and redemption, law and gospel, Adam and Christ, and ultimately clarifying the meaning of justification by the **imputed righteousness** of Christ. To defend it under rigorous examination, one must show its exegetical basis, trace its development in key Reformed figures, respond to internal disputes about its structure and language of merit, and answer external challenges that it is speculative or unbiblical.

A Westminster examiner will often begin by pressing whether Scripture itself uses the term “covenant” for the prelapsarian arrangement. Here the answer must start with conceptual definition rather than vocabulary counting. A covenant, in classic Reformed usage, is a divinely initiated, morally ordered relationship with sanctions and promises, in which God voluntarily binds himself by oath. Genesis 2 presents God placing Adam in a **probationary order**: he is commanded positively concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, given a sanction of death upon disobedience, and by implication offered confirmed life consummated in access to the tree of life. Though the term “covenant” is not used in Genesis 2, Hosea 6:7 speaks of transgression of a covenant “like Adam,” which, read as a reference to the first man in Eden rather than to a place, provides textual warrant that Reformed theologians from Ursinus onward leveraged to speak of a real, divinely imposed **covenant of life**. The absence of the word “covenant” makes no more difference here than it does for the doctrine of the Trinity. The conceptual data of command, sanction, representative headship, and eschatological promise ground the inference.

Zacharias Ursinus (1534–1583) stands early in the development of the doctrine and already exhibits its central lines. As principal author of the Heidelberg Catechism and its Commentary, Ursinus reads the prelapsarian relation of God and Adam through the lens of law and promise. For Ursinus, God created man “in the image of God, in true righteousness and holiness,” placing Adam under a law written on the heart and supplemented by the positive command concerning the tree. Significantly, he speaks of a “covenant of nature” by which life was promised to Adam on condition of obedience. Ursinus is not yet using the precise later terminology “covenant of works,” but he clearly affirms a prelapsarian **covenantal order** in which law, not evangelical grace, structured Adam’s relation to eschatological life. That law, Ursinus insists, is good and righteous; the problem is not with the prelapsarian covenant but with Adam’s breach. Further, Ursinus already links Adam’s failure with the necessity of a second Adam whose obedience fulfills the law-based demands first imposed in creation. Thus, in Ursinus, we see the conceptual seed of what later Reformed orthodoxy would sharpen: an original covenantal arrangement grounded in creation, not redemptive grace, that sets the stage for Christ’s **active obedience**.

Where Ursinus plants seeds, Francis Turretin (1623–1687) provides the classic scholastic elaboration. Turretin’s Institutes of Elenctic Theology shows how the covenant of works became systematized within high Reformed orthodoxy. Turretin explicitly argues that the prelapsarian arrangement merits the name “covenant” because it exhibits a mutual engagement between God and man, a condition, a promise of life, and a threat of death. His method is analytic and polemical, carefully distinguishing **natural law** from positive command and defending the voluntariness, not necessity, of God’s covenantal condescension. According to Turretin, the covenant of works is grounded in creation but is still an act of divine goodness, yet it is not gracious in the same sense as the **covenant of grace**. Here he introduces distinctions that become crucial in later debates. On the one hand, God owed the creature nothing; the very establishment of a rewardable order is a kind of condescension. On the other hand, once God freely established the covenant, there is a strict justice according to which obedience merits life and disobedience merits death. Turretin thus sustains both the gratuity of the order as a whole and the strict legal character of its internal workings. This allows him to argue that Christ, as second Adam, satisfies that same legal order by his obedience unto death, which is then imputed to believers in justification. In Turretin, then, the covenant of works is not a detachable prologue; it is structurally necessary for the logic of substitution, satisfaction, and imputation.

An examiner might challenge whether this language of “merit” compromises **divine simplicity** or makes God a debtor to the creature. Turretin forestalls this by rooting merit not in any intrinsic power of the creature to bind God, but in God’s free ordination of a covenantal order. The creature’s obedience has true merit only in respect of the covenant promise. This is a crucial distinction to defend the creator–creature distinction. Without it, critics claim, one either collapses the covenant of works into a relation of pure nature without eschatological elevation or, alternately, makes divine generosity evaporate. The Reformed scholastic solution is that God freely wills to relate to humanity in covenant and then deals with humanity in unbending justice according to that covenant. The rigidness of justice flows from the freedom of the initial covenantal establishment.

Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669) represents another decisive trajectory in the history of the covenant of works. Often contrasted with Turretin in the classic Cocceian–Voetian disputes, Cocceius was a biblical theologian avant la lettre, developing a history-of-covenants schema. For Cocceius, the covenant of works is a real historical administration given in Adam, broken through sin, and in some form “re-enacted” in the Mosaic administration to expose sin and drive to Christ. Cocceius thus is pivotal for the later debate over “republication” of the covenant of works in the Mosaic covenant. He held that the law given at Sinai, particularly in its threatening form, republishes the works principle, not to offer Israel a genuine way of life by law but to expose their sinfulness and make them long for the promised Messiah. Internal Reformed debates later revolved around whether this republication is in the so-called “material” sense a genuine covenant of works for temporal life in Canaan or only in an “administrative” sense as a pedagogical use of the law within the covenant of grace. Cocceius’s biblical-historical method allowed him to map the unfolding of law and gospel in redemptive history, but also provoked resistance among those who feared confusion between the covenants.

This internal Reformed debate surfaces sharply in Herman Bavinck (1854–1921), who, though appreciative of Cocceius’s biblical-theological instincts, sides more with a Turretinian stability in the doctrine. Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics shows a mature confessional Reformed appropriation of the covenant of works. He argues that the covenant of works is a necessary explication of the relation between creation and redemption. For Bavinck, humans were created not in a state of consummated glory but in a state of mutable righteousness, with eschatological advancement held out under the condition of obedience. The tree of life symbolizes the promise of higher, immutable fellowship with God. This eschatological openness is covenantal. Bavinck insists that maintaining a covenant of works protects the distinction between nature and grace, creation and redemption, while simultaneously binding them in a single divine counsel. If there is no covenant of works, then either humanity is created already in its highest end, rendering history opaque, or human elevation to glory becomes sheerly arbitrary. Bavinck also emphasizes that the form of the covenant of works is strictly legal, in contrast to the covenant of grace which presupposes sin and introduces forgiveness through satisfaction. Without this prelapsarian legal covenant, Bavinck argues, the forensic character of justification by the righteousness of another becomes unintelligible. Christ recapitulates and fulfills Adam’s failed task, and that recapitulation only has coherence if there is a covenantal structure which Christ assumes.

At this point contemporary examiners will likely ask whether the covenant of works is not simply an abstract metaphysical overlay laid upon Scripture by later scholastics, lacking solid exegetical footing. Here one must engage both classic exegetical arguments and modern Reformed defenders such as Meredith G Kline (1922–2007). Kline, working as a biblical theologian with an acute interest in ancient Near Eastern covenants, argued that the structure of Genesis 1–2 bears the character of a royal grant and suzerainty treaty. He emphasized the parallels between Eden and later sanctuary structures and between Adam’s probation and Israel’s Mosaic covenant. In his works such as Treaty of the Great King and Kingdom Prologue, Kline contended that the presence of a command with death sanction, set in a garden-temple context with sacramental trees, displays the pattern of a divinely imposed **probationary covenant**. Kline was especially influential in defending the works principle by analogy with the Mosaic economy, arguing for a typological republication of the covenant of works at Sinai, particularly in relation to Israel’s tenure in the land. For Kline, the land-promise operates under a works principle reflective of Adam’s original probation, though the underlying salvation of the remnant is always by grace alone through faith alone. This Klinean republication thesis has become a lightning rod in contemporary Presbyterian debates, because some fear that it compromises the unity of the covenant of grace or aligns too closely with Lutheran law–gospel two-covenant models.

This brings us to significant internal Reformed debates about the covenant of works. First is the question of its “graciousness.” Some contemporary Reformed theologians, uneasy with any notion of strict creaturely merit, speak of the covenant of works as a “covenant of favor” or as “gracious” in some robust sense, sometimes suggesting a flattening between that and the covenant of grace. In response, one must maintain the classic distinctions seen in Turretin and Bavinck. The covenant of works is “gracious” only with respect to its origin in divine condescension; as an order, it is not evangelical grace but strict law. If one shifts the axis and makes the covenant of works itself properly gracious in the same sense as the covenant of grace, then the forensic contrast between works and faith, as articulated in Romans and Galatians, is blurred. The Reformed tradition has always insisted that the law principle, “do this and live,” and the gospel principle, “believe and you shall be saved,” are antithetical as methods of justification, though law still plays a vital role in the ordo salutis as a third use. The covenant of works provides the prelapsarian foothold for that law principle.

The second internal debate concerns republication. Kline and, before him, Cocceius and various Puritans, argued that in some sense the covenant of works is republished at Sinai. Others, wary of undermining the unity of the covenant of grace, have rejected republication as misleading. A careful answer must distinguish levels. In terms of ultimate soteriology, the Mosaic covenant is an administration of the covenant of grace, as the Westminster Standards teach. Yet in its typological, national dimension related to Israel’s tenure in the land, there is a works principle that mirrors the original covenant of works. Leviticus 18:5 and Deuteronomy 28 set forth a principle of reward and curse tied to covenant obedience, with exile as a kind of covenantal death. This is not a second way of eternal life by works, but a typological re-enactment of Adam’s probation within redemptive history. Affirming this kind of qualified republication allows one to integrate Paul’s polemics about the law’s condemning function with the history of Israel, while preserving that salvation is always by grace alone in Christ alone.

The third internal debate is whether the covenant of works should be abandoned because of the imprecision of the term “merit.” Some modern Reformed theologians, influenced by Barthian critiques, object that any concept of human merit before God is theologically disastrous. Here again Turretin’s careful account is essential. Prelapsarian merit is not condign in the sense of placing God in real debt independent of his will; it is merit only in a covenantal framework. Moreover, after the fall, no mere human could merit anything from God; only the God-man, in whom the dignity of the divine person elevates the worth of his obedience, can render a satisfaction of infinite value. Denying all prelapsarian merit risks collapsing the distinction between creation and redemption and obscures the legal framework that Christ fulfills. The Westminster doctrine that man by his fall “lost the ability of will to any spiritual good” presupposes that Adam originally possessed an ability to obey in such a way that life could be promised. That promise was real, and its fulfillment in Christ is real.

Turning to external debates, we must first face Lutheran concerns. Classic Lutheran law–gospel theology certainly recognizes Adam’s original righteousness and his command to obey, but it has been generally reluctant to speak of a formal prelapsarian covenant of works. Some fear that such a covenant makes law and creation too central and pushes the gospel to a remedial role. Lutheran dogmatics tends to see the law as God’s alien work and the gospel as his proper work, whereas classic Reformed theology, with the covenant of works, sees law as integral to creation and therefore intrinsic to God’s wise and righteous ordering. In response, the Reformed must insist that law as such is not an alien intrusion but a revelation of God’s holy will; it is sin that makes law become an instrument of death. The covenant of works is not a cold legalism but an expression of God’s good purpose to bring humanity to glory through ordered obedience, fulfilled at last in Christ. Moreover, the sharp Lutheran disjunction between law and gospel can, in practice, undermine the positive third use of the law and the goodness of creation ordinances. The covenant of works doctrine, when rightly taught, safeguards creation’s goodness while not confusing law and gospel as methods of justification.

Arminian and Remonstrant theologians, on the other hand, have tended to deny strict federal imputation of Adam’s guilt and Christ’s righteousness, preferring a more individualistic account of sin and grace. From their vantage point, the covenant of works seems to unjustly expose all humanity to condemnation on the basis of one man’s failure. A Reformed response must show that federal representation is not an arbitrary external imposition but is woven into the very constitution of humanity. Romans 5 makes clear that death reigned through the trespass of the one man and that likewise many are made righteous through the obedience of the one. The covenant of works is simply the doctrinal crystallization of this Pauline federalism at the level of creation. Denying the covenant of works does not remove the Pauline corporate solidarity; it simply makes it inexplicable. Christ’s work as second Adam presupposes an original Adamic covenant he comes to fulfill. The Reformed appeal here to **federal headship** rooted in both exegesis and theologically in **divine wisdom**, by which God ordains a history in which many are bound up in one for both ruin and redemption.

Modern biblical-theological critics often argue that the covenant of works is a later scholastic construct lacking explicit scriptural attestation. They stress that Scripture calls the Mosaic and new covenants “covenants” but is silent about such a designation for Eden. Against this, one must reiterate that biblical theology itself, properly conducted, supports the pattern. The canonical shape of Scripture presents Adam as first son of God, priest-king in the garden sanctuary, given a command with sanctions, placed in a story that moves toward consummation symbolized by the tree of life. Later biblical covenants recapitulate this pattern, especially in Israel as corporate Adam in the land, governed by law, driven into exile by disobedience, and awaiting a faithful Adam in whom all God’s promises are yes and amen. The lack of explicit nomenclature is hermeneutically trivial when the narrative, typological, and legal markers are so strong. The Reformed do not deduce the covenant of works from natural theology but from close attention to the biblical text in its canonical fullness.

Contemporary debates have intensified particularly around the republication thesis and around so-called “mono-covenantal” or “grace from the beginning” approaches that balk at any prelapsarian works principle. Some voices in conservative Presbyterianism have suggested that any talk of a works principle, even before the fall, is incompatible with a robust doctrine of grace. Yet to dissolve every works principle into grace is to obscure both the order of creation and the work of Christ. Scripture itself contrasts the righteousness based on law, “the person who does the commandments shall live by them,” with the righteousness based on faith, which receives a gift. That contrast must be grounded somewhere. The covenant of works provides precisely that ground in a way fully compatible with confessing that all God’s dealings, including the very existence of creatures under law, are gifts of his goodness.

The doctrine of the covenant of works also interfaces with adjacent loci. In anthropology, it clarifies that humanity is created for eschatological communion beyond Eden, such that history has a teleological thrust. In Christology, it sharpens the meaning of Christ’s obedience. Christ does not merely die to pay for guilt; he also lives under law to fulfill the original terms of the covenant of works, securing not merely forgiveness but title to eternal life for his people. This is why confessional Reformed theology stresses both the active and passive obedience of Christ as the ground of justification. In soteriology, the covenant of works undergirds **imputation**. Believers are counted righteous not by infusion but by the legal transfer of Christ’s covenant-keeping obedience to their account, within the framework established at creation. Finally, in ethics and natural law, the covenant of works testifies that God’s moral law is not an arbitrary appendage of redemption but woven into creation itself, with enduring normativity for all human societies.

In defending the covenant of works today, one must avoid two opposite errors. On the one hand, an arid scholasticism that treats it as a detachable piece of speculative architecture, capable of being dropped without consequence. On the other hand, a biblicist flattening that refuses any conceptual synthesis beyond bare textual repetition. The way forward is exemplified, in different ways, by Turretin’s analytic precision, Bavinck’s organic dogmatics, and Kline’s canonical exegesis. The covenant of works is not a free-floating legalism; it is the creator’s wise ordering of humanity toward glory, the precondition for understanding both the depth of the fall and the grandeur of redemption in Christ.

Therefore, the position to be defended is that classic Reformed **federal theology** was right to posit a prelapsarian covenant of works with Adam as federal head, offering eschatological life on condition of perfect obedience. This covenant is conceptually and exegetically warranted, firmly rooted in the canonical narrative, and indispensable for preserving the law–gospel distinction, the integrity of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ, and the coherence of Christ’s work as second Adam. While terminology such as “merit” and formulations of republication need careful nuancing, the core doctrine must be retained as a non-negotiable structural pillar of a confessional Reformed system.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: A divinely instituted prelapsarian **covenant of works** or life with Adam as federal head, requiring perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience for eschatological life and threatening death upon disobedience, forming the legal framework that Christ fulfills as second Adam.
- Decisive figures:
  - Ursinus: early **covenant of nature**, law-structured prelapsarian order linked to Christ’s obedience.
  - Turretin: classic scholastic elaboration, strict law principle with covenantal merit, safeguards creator–creature distinction and imputation.
  - Cocceius: history-of-covenants and republication, Mosaic law as reenactment of works principle.
  - Bavinck: integrates covenant of works into creation–redemption unity, emphasizes eschatological elevation and legal–evangelical contrast.
  - Kline: ANE treaty background, Eden as probationary grant, typological republication in Mosaic economy.
- Debates:
  - Internal: graciousness vs strictness of covenant of works, nature and extent of republication in Moses, legitimacy of prelapsarian “merit.”
  - External: Lutheran reluctance about a formal prelapsarian covenant, Arminian denial of strict federal imputation, modern claims of thin exegetical basis.
  - Contemporary: disputes over republication in Presbyterian circles, mono-covenantal “grace from the beginning” models, pressures from biblicist and Barthian critiques.
- Defended position: The covenant of works is exegetically grounded, historically confessional, and theologically necessary for a coherent **federal theology**, properly distinguishing law and gospel and grounding Christ’s active obedience and imputed righteousness; it should be retained with nuanced language about merit and typological republication.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - If Genesis 2 never says “covenant,” why call it one?  
    Because the elements of a covenant are present: divine initiation, command, sanction, promise of life, and federal headship, confirmed by texts like Hosea 6:7 and the canonical pattern.
  - How is the covenant of works different from the covenant of grace?  
    The former is a legal order promising life on condition of perfect obedience before sin; the latter is a redemptive order granting life by Christ’s obedience imputed to believers.
  - Does speaking of Adamic merit make God a debtor?  
    No, because merit arises only within a freely ordained covenant; God’s justice in keeping his promise flows from his prior sovereign condescension.
  - In what sense is the covenant of works “republished” in Moses?  
    Not as a second way of eternal life, but typologically and nationally, governing Israel’s tenure in the land and exposing sin, within an overarching covenant of grace.
  - Why is the covenant of works necessary for justification by faith alone?  
    Because Christ justifies by fulfilling the original legal demands placed on Adam; without a prior works covenant, the imputation of Christ’s obedience lacks a defined covenantal norm.
