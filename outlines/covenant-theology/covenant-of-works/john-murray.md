# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a nuanced account of the **Covenant of Works**, affirming its theological necessity while critiquing certain traditional formulations. He emphasized the **Adam-Christ parallel**, the role of **federal headship**, and the importance of **law and obedience** in the prelapsarian arrangement, but preferred the term "Adamic Administration" to avoid misunderstandings about the nature of the relationship between God and Adam. Murray’s approach sought to uphold the integrity of **Reformed federal theology** while refining its categories in light of biblical exegesis.

- "The term ‘covenant of works’ is not itself found in Scripture, and there are features of the Adamic administration which are not covered by the term ‘works’." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- The Adamic Administration (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- The Imputation of Adam’s Sin
- Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Scriptural Basis for the Adamic Administration**
    - Murray affirms the biblical foundation for a pre-Fall arrangement between God and Adam.
    - He argues that **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** establish Adam as a representative head.
    - The arrangement included positive law (the prohibition concerning the tree).
    - Murray insists that the structure is covenantal, even if the term "covenant" is not explicit in Genesis.
    - "There is abundant evidence that the relationship between God and Adam was covenantal in character." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Terminological Caution: "Covenant of Works" vs. "Adamic Administration"**
    - Murray critiques the traditional label "Covenant of Works" as potentially misleading.
    - He prefers "Adamic Administration" to avoid reducing the relationship to a mere works principle.
    - The term "works" may obscure the elements of grace and benevolence present in the arrangement.
    - He maintains that the essential features of covenant theology are preserved without the terminology.
    - "The term ‘covenant of works’ is not a felicitous designation." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam acted as the **federal head** of humanity, with his obedience or disobedience affecting all.
    - This federal principle is foundational for understanding both the fall and redemption in Christ.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to Murray’s theology.
    - Imputation of Adam’s sin is grounded in this representative relationship.
    - "The parallel between Adam and Christ is the hinge of Paul’s teaching in Romans 5:12–21." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

4. **Law, Obedience, and Promise**
    - The Adamic arrangement involved a clear command and a promise of life upon obedience.
    - Murray affirms the **law principle**: life as the reward for perfect obedience.
    - He recognizes the probationary nature of Adam’s task.
    - The threat of death for disobedience underscores the seriousness of the covenantal arrangement.
    - "The promise of life was annexed to obedience, and the penalty of death to disobedience." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity with Later Covenants**
    - Murray sees both continuity and discontinuity between the Adamic administration and the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - The principle of representation persists, but the mode of administration changes after the Fall.
    - The Adamic arrangement sets the stage for understanding redemption in Christ.
    - He stresses that the **Covenant of Grace** is not a mere restoration of the Covenant of Works, but a new redemptive act.
    - "The covenant of grace is not simply the continuation of the Adamic administration under different conditions." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful analysis of the **Covenant of Works** has significantly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in its exegetical rigor and terminological precision. His preference for "Adamic Administration" has influenced contemporary discussions on covenant theology, prompting theologians to reconsider traditional formulations. Murray’s work remains a touchstone for debates on **federal headship** and the structure of redemptive history, ensuring his ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
