# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has contributed significantly to the understanding of the **Covenant of Works** within the broader framework of **Reformed federal theology**. He emphasizes the foundational role of the **Covenant of Works** in establishing the categories of **law and gospel**, and its typological significance for the work of Christ as the second Adam. Gaffin’s approach is marked by careful exegesis and a strong commitment to the unity of **redemptive history**.

- "The covenant of works is not simply a theological construct but is grounded in the exegesis of key biblical passages, especially Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul's Soteriology
- "The Usefulness of the Fourfold State" (in The Law is Not of Faith, ed. Barrett, et al.)
- "Adam and Israel: The Covenant of Works in Paul" (in Covenant, Justification, and Pastoral Ministry, ed. Waters)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Adam and Federal Headship**
    - Adam is a real, historical figure who represents all humanity in the **Covenant of Works**.
    - The failure of Adam results in the imputation of guilt to all his descendants.
    - The federal relationship is foundational for understanding **justification** and **imputation**.
    - Gaffin insists on the exegetical basis for Adam’s headship, especially in Romans 5.
    - "Paul’s argument in Romans 5 depends on the parallel between Adam and Christ as covenant heads." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Law-Gospel Distinction Rooted in Covenant**
    - The **Covenant of Works** establishes the principle of law: “Do this and live.”
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is grounded in promise and fulfillment in Christ.
    - Gaffin maintains that the law-gospel distinction is not artificial but rooted in redemptive history.
    - He warns against collapsing the two covenants into one undifferentiated covenant.
    - "The distinction between law and gospel is not merely pedagogical but covenantal." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards)

3. **Typology and Christ’s Obedience**
    - Adam’s probation and failure prefigure Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - The **Covenant of Works** sets the stage for Christ as the second Adam to fulfill all righteousness.
    - Christ’s obedience is both representative and vicarious, securing the blessings forfeited by Adam.
    - The typological connection is essential for understanding the structure of redemption.
    - "The obedience of Christ is the fulfillment of the original covenantal demand placed on Adam." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Continuity with the Westminster Standards**
    - Gaffin affirms the confessional teaching of the **Westminster Standards** regarding the **Covenant of Works**.
    - He argues that the doctrine is not a later scholastic addition but integral to Reformed theology.
    - The Standards’ formulation is exegetically and theologically defensible.
    - He defends the necessity of the doctrine for a coherent doctrine of justification.
    - "The Westminster Confession’s teaching on the covenant of works is a faithful summary of biblical teaching." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

5. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Gaffin interprets the **Covenant of Works** within the unfolding drama of **redemptive history**.
    - He stresses the movement from creation, fall, and redemption as a unified biblical narrative.
    - The doctrine is not isolated but integrally related to eschatology and soteriology.
    - This approach guards against moralism and legalism by situating law within God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The covenant of works is best understood in the context of the entire history of redemption." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has reinforced the centrality of the **Covenant of Works** in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in relation to **Pauline soteriology** and the doctrine of justification. His careful exegesis and confessional fidelity have shaped generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By situating the doctrine within the broader sweep of **redemptive history**, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for understanding the unity and diversity of God’s covenants. His influence endures in ongoing debates over federal theology and the law-gospel distinction.
