# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen developed a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** as foundational to his understanding of **federal theology** and the **covenant of grace**. He emphasized the original arrangement between God and Adam as a real, binding covenant, the breach of which necessitated the redemptive work of Christ as the second Adam. Owen’s articulation of the **law-gospel distinction** and the **imputation of righteousness** is deeply rooted in his covenantal framework.

- "The covenant made with Adam was a covenant of works, and not of grace." ("The Works of John Owen," Vol. 11)

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of the Saints’ Perseverance Explained and Confirmed" (1654)
- "An Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews" (especially Vol. 1)
- "Vindiciae Evangelicae" (The Mystery of the Gospel Vindicated, 1655)
- "The Works of John Owen," Vol. 11: "Of the Death of Christ, and of Justification"
- "A Display of Arminianism" (1643)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Covenant of Works**
    - Asserts that God entered into a real, historical covenant with Adam before the Fall.
    - Views Adam as the **federal head** representing all humanity.
    - The covenant was based on **law**, not grace, requiring perfect obedience.
    - The promise was **eternal life** upon obedience, with death as the penalty for disobedience.
    - "God made a covenant with Adam, and in him with all mankind, upon condition of perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience." (Works, Vol. 11)

2. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - Distinguishes sharply between the **covenant of works** (law) and the **covenant of grace** (gospel).
    - The law demands perfect obedience; the gospel offers salvation through Christ’s obedience.
    - The failure of the first covenant necessitated the establishment of the second.
    - This distinction undergirds Owen’s polemic against **Arminianism** and **Socinianism**.
    - "The law and the gospel, or the covenant of works and that of grace, are in their own nature distinct." (Vindiciae Evangelicae)

3. **Imputation and Representation**
    - Adam’s disobedience is imputed to all his descendants due to his federal headship.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the covenant of works on behalf of the elect.
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, securing their justification.
    - This federal structure is essential for understanding **original sin** and **justification**.
    - "The imputation of the sin of Adam unto his posterity, and of the righteousness of Christ unto his seed, are the two hinges on which the covenant turns." (Works, Vol. 11)

4. **Perpetuity of the Moral Law**
    - The moral law given in the covenant of works remains binding as a rule of righteousness.
    - The law’s demands are fulfilled in Christ for believers, but its standard is not abrogated.
    - The law continues to reveal sin and drive sinners to Christ.
    - The perpetuity of the law supports Owen’s doctrine of sanctification.
    - "The law, as to the substance of it, is the same under both covenants." (Exposition of Hebrews)

5. **Necessity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The failure of the covenant of works makes the covenant of grace absolutely necessary for salvation.
    - The covenant of grace is grounded in the work of Christ, not human merit.
    - Owen sees the two covenants as mutually interpretive, highlighting the sufficiency of Christ.
    - The covenant of grace restores what was lost in Adam, but on a new basis.
    - "There was no way for the restoration of man but by a new covenant, founded in grace and established in the blood of Christ." (Works, Vol. 11)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s formulation of the **Covenant of Works** became a touchstone for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional standards and subsequent covenant theology. His rigorous distinction between law and gospel influenced the development of **federal theology** in both British and continental Reformed traditions. Owen’s writings continue to be studied for their clarity on the relationship between Adam, Christ, and the structure of redemption, making him a pivotal figure in the history of Reformed thought.
