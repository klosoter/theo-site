# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **covenant** motif within a framework shaped by **religious consciousness** and **God-consciousness**, rather than traditional Reformed categories like the **Covenant of Works**. He critiqued the classical doctrine, arguing that the relationship between God and humanity is grounded in the immediate feeling of absolute dependence, not in legal or forensic arrangements. Thus, Schleiermacher displaced the **Covenant of Works** in favor of a more existential and relational understanding of humanity's standing before God.

- "The doctrine of the covenant is not to be regarded as a legal transaction, but as the expression of the religious consciousness in its relation to God." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Religious Consciousness**
    - Human relationship to God is rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence.
    - Rejects legalistic or contractual frameworks for understanding divine-human relations.
    - The **Covenant of Works** is seen as a secondary, dogmatic construct.
    - Emphasizes the immediacy of religious experience over historical covenants.
    - "Religion is to be regarded neither as a knowing nor a doing but as a distinct feeling." (On Religion)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Covenant Structures**
    - Critiques the notion of a prelapsarian legal covenant between God and Adam.
    - Views the **Covenant of Works** as a product of later theological reflection, not biblical revelation.
    - Argues that divine-human relationship is not fundamentally juridical.
    - Sees the law as subordinate to the living relationship with God.
    - "The idea of a legal covenant is foreign to the essence of religion." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Christ as the True Covenant Mediator**
    - Christ embodies the perfect God-consciousness, not the fulfillment of a broken legal covenant.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted in terms of communication of divine life, not satisfaction of a covenantal probation.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is recast as the historical realization of God-consciousness in the community.
    - The focus shifts from Adamic probation to Christ’s unique religious consciousness.
    - "In Christ, the divine and human are united in a new way, not by law but by life." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Historical Development of Doctrine**
    - Theological concepts like the **Covenant of Works** are seen as historically conditioned.
    - Emphasizes the evolution of doctrine in response to the church’s experience.
    - Dogmatic formulations are provisional and subject to revision.
    - The covenant motif is interpreted through the lens of the church’s ongoing consciousness.
    - "Dogmas are only the historical expressions of the religious feeling of the community." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical and Communal Emphasis**
    - The covenant is realized in the ethical life of the Christian community.
    - Downplays individual probation in favor of communal participation in Christ.
    - The church is the locus of the new covenantal relationship.
    - Ethics flow from the shared God-consciousness, not from legal stipulations.
    - "The church is the fellowship of those who share in the divine life through Christ." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **covenant** motif marked a decisive shift away from the **Covenant of Works** as a foundational theological category. His emphasis on **religious consciousness** and the existential dimension of faith profoundly influenced modern theology, especially in liberal and neo-orthodox traditions. While his views were sharply criticized by confessional Reformed theologians, Schleiermacher’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of **covenant theology** and the relationship between doctrine and religious experience.
