# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner, a leading twentieth-century Roman Catholic theologian, did not explicitly affirm the **Covenant of Works** as articulated in classic Reformed theology. Instead, Rahner’s theology centers on the **supernatural existential**, emphasizing humanity’s orientation toward **God’s self-communication** and the universal offer of **grace**. While he addresses the relationship between **nature and grace**, he reframes the discussion away from the legal-covenantal categories of Reformed thought.

- "Man is always already the subject of a supernatural existential." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- Foundations of Christian Faith (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church
- Theological Investigations (multiple volumes)
- Hearer of the Word
- Grace in Freedom

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of a Literal Covenant of Works**
    - Rahner does not affirm a historical **pre-fall covenant** between God and Adam as a legal arrangement.
    - He views the human relationship with God as grounded in **grace** from the beginning, not in a contract of merit.
    - The concept of **original justice** is interpreted within the broader context of humanity’s existential openness to God.
    - Rahner’s anthropology resists sharp distinctions between **nature** and **supernature**.
    - "The supernatural existential is always already present in man." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

2. **Supernatural Existential**
    - Every human being is constituted by a **transcendental orientation** toward God.
    - This orientation is not a result of a covenantal arrangement but is intrinsic to human existence.
    - The **offer of grace** is universal and precedes any human action or merit.
    - The supernatural existential replaces the need for a separate **Covenant of Works**.
    - "Grace is not something added to human nature from outside." (Nature and Grace)

3. **Unity of Nature and Grace**
    - Rahner opposes a dualistic separation between **nature** and **grace**.
    - He argues that human nature is always already graced, not neutral or autonomous.
    - The **order of salvation** is not a movement from a natural to a supernatural state via a covenant of merit.
    - The human person is always addressed by God’s **self-communication**.
    - "There is no purely natural man." (Theological Investigations, Vol. 1)

4. **Christocentric Anthropology**
    - Christ is the definitive revelation of what it means to be truly human.
    - The fulfillment of humanity’s orientation toward God is realized in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **Incarnation** is not a response to a broken covenant, but the climax of God’s self-gift.
    - Human destiny is understood in light of **Christ’s salvific work**, not Adam’s probation.
    - "The event of Jesus Christ is the absolute self-communication of God." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

5. **Historical Revelation over Legal Frameworks**
    - Rahner prioritizes the unfolding of **salvation history** over legal-covenantal categories.
    - Divine-human relationship is dynamic, rooted in **revelation** and existential encounter.
    - The biblical narrative is seen as the progressive realization of God’s **self-communication**.
    - The legal notion of a **Covenant of Works** is replaced by a theology of history and grace.
    - "Revelation is God’s self-communication in history." (Hearer of the Word)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s reinterpretation of the **nature-grace relationship** has profoundly influenced modern Catholic theology, moving it away from the categories of the **Covenant of Works** found in Reformed thought. His concept of the **supernatural existential** has shaped discussions on anthropology, grace, and salvation, emphasizing the universality of God’s self-gift. While his framework diverges sharply from Reformed covenantal theology, Rahner’s work remains pivotal for ecumenical dialogue and contemporary understandings of grace and human destiny.
