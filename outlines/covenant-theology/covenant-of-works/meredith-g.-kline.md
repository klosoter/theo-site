# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a leading Reformed biblical theologian who advanced a robust doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** as foundational to the structure of **redemptive history**. He emphasized the **legal-judicial character** of the original covenant with Adam, interpreting it through the lens of **ancient Near Eastern suzerainty treaties** and highlighting its role in establishing the principle of **merit** and the necessity of **obedience** for eschatological blessing.

- "The probationary arrangement with Adam was a covenant of works, a law covenant, in which the inheritance was to be earned by obedience." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Images of the Spirit

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as a Law Covenant**
    - The Adamic covenant is fundamentally a legal arrangement, not gracious in its principle.
    - Adam was required to render **perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience** to God’s command.
    - The promise of **eschatological life** was conditioned on Adam’s obedience.
    - The curse of death was threatened for disobedience, establishing a works principle.
    - "The original covenant with Adam was a law covenant, not a covenant of grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Suzerainty Treaty Paradigm**
    - Kline interprets the Covenant of Works using the structure of ancient Near Eastern suzerainty treaties.
    - These treaties clarify the relationship between the sovereign (God) and the vassal (Adam).
    - The stipulations, sanctions, and blessings/curses in Genesis mirror treaty forms.
    - This paradigm highlights the legal and judicial nature of the covenant.
    - "The form of the covenant with Adam corresponds to the suzerainty treaties of the ancient world." (By Oath Consigned)

3. **Merit and Eschatological Reward**
    - Adam’s obedience would have merited advancement to a higher, glorified state.
    - The tree of life symbolized the **eschatological reward** held out to Adam.
    - The principle of works is distinct from grace and necessary for understanding Christ’s work.
    - Christ, as the second Adam, fulfills the works principle on behalf of the elect.
    - "The principle of works is essential for understanding both Adam’s probation and Christ’s obedience." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Covenant Theology and Redemptive History**
    - The Covenant of Works is foundational for the unfolding of **covenant theology**.
    - It sets the stage for the **Covenant of Grace** after the Fall.
    - The contrast between works and grace is crucial for biblical theology.
    - The failure of the first Adam necessitates the redemptive work of the second Adam.
    - "The law covenant with Adam is the necessary prelude to the gospel covenant of grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Symbolism**
    - Kline emphasizes the typological significance of Eden and its elements.
    - The garden, tree of life, and probation serve as types pointing to later redemptive realities.
    - The **Covenant of Works** provides the pattern for subsequent biblical covenants.
    - Typology underscores the unity and progression of God’s redemptive plan.
    - "The probation in Eden is the archetype of all subsequent covenantal probation." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s articulation of the **Covenant of Works** has profoundly shaped contemporary Reformed covenant theology, especially in its biblical-theological method and emphasis on the works principle. His use of ancient Near Eastern treaty forms has influenced both exegetical and systematic approaches to the doctrine. Kline’s legacy endures in debates over the relationship between law and gospel, the structure of redemptive history, and the theological coherence of the Reformed tradition.
