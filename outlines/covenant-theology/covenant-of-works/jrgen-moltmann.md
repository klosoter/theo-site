# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann does not affirm a traditional **Covenant of Works** as articulated in classic Reformed theology. Instead, he centers his theology on **eschatological hope**, the **covenant of grace**, and the relational and future-oriented nature of God’s covenants, emphasizing promise and fellowship over legal or merit-based arrangements.

- "The history of God with humanity is not a contract but a promise, not a legal relationship but a fellowship of hope." (The Coming of God)

## Key Works

- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology (1995)
- God in Creation (1985)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of a Legalistic Covenant of Works**
    - Argues that biblical covenants are fundamentally relational, not contractual or legal.
    - Views the Reformed **Covenant of Works** as a later theological construct, not rooted in biblical revelation.
    - Emphasizes that God’s dealings with humanity are grounded in **promise** and **hope**, not merit.
    - Critiques the notion of a prelapsarian probationary arrangement.
    - "The covenant is not a legal relationship but a fellowship of hope." (The Coming of God)

2. **Primacy of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Stresses that God’s covenant is always gracious, even before the fall.
    - Interprets the history of salvation as a single, unfolding **covenant of grace**.
    - Rejects a sharp distinction between pre- and post-fall covenants.
    - Sees Christ as the fulfillment and center of all covenantal promises.
    - "God’s covenant is always a covenant of grace, not of works." (The Coming of God)

3. **Eschatological Orientation of Covenant**
    - Frames covenant in terms of **future hope** and the coming kingdom.
    - Believes that God’s promises are oriented toward the **new creation**.
    - Sees the covenant as dynamic, open to the future, and not static or closed.
    - Emphasizes the forward movement of God’s relationship with humanity.
    - "The covenant is directed toward the future, toward the fulfillment of God’s promises." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Creation as the Context for Covenant**
    - Argues that God’s relationship with humanity is rooted in the act of **creation**.
    - Sees the whole creation as included in God’s covenantal purposes.
    - Rejects anthropocentric or exclusively legal readings of the covenant.
    - Emphasizes the cosmic scope of **redemption** and reconciliation.
    - "God’s covenant embraces all creation, not just humanity." (God in Creation)

5. **Trinitarian and Relational Emphasis**
    - Frames covenant in terms of the **Trinitarian** life of God.
    - Emphasizes mutuality, fellowship, and participation over legal obligation.
    - Sees the covenant as an invitation into the **life of God**.
    - Critiques any view that abstracts covenant from the person and work of Christ.
    - "The covenant is participation in the life of the triune God." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s rejection of the **Covenant of Works** has influenced modern theology to reconsider the nature of God’s relationship with humanity, shifting the focus from legal arrangements to **eschatological promise** and relational fellowship. His work has challenged traditional Reformed categories, encouraging dialogue on the meaning of covenant in light of **creation, redemption, and hope**. Moltmann’s emphasis on the cosmic and future-oriented dimensions of covenant continues to shape contemporary discussions in systematic theology.
