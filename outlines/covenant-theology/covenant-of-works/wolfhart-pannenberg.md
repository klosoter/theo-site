# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg did not affirm a traditional **Covenant of Works** as found in classic Reformed theology, but he engaged deeply with the biblical and historical development of **covenant** and **humanity’s vocation** before God. Pannenberg emphasized the dynamic unfolding of **revelation** in history and saw the human relationship with God as oriented toward **eschatological fulfillment** rather than a legal probation. For Pannenberg, the structure of God’s dealings with humanity is best understood through the lens of **universal history** and the anticipation of **God’s kingdom**.

- "The biblical concept of covenant is not primarily a legal contract but a dynamic relationship in the history of God with humanity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Revelation as History (with R. Rendtorff, U. Wilckens, T. Rendtorff)
- Jesus—God and Man
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 2

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation unfolds in universal history**
    - God’s self-disclosure is not static but develops through historical events.
    - The meaning of human existence is clarified as history progresses toward its goal.
    - The biblical narrative is interpreted as a unity moving toward **eschatological consummation**.
    - The idea of covenant is subsumed under the broader theme of God’s historical action.
    - "Revelation is not a deposit from the past but an event in the history of the world." (Revelation as History)

2. **Human vocation centers on eschatological destiny**
    - Humanity’s purpose is oriented toward participation in God’s future kingdom.
    - The original human calling is not framed as a probation under a legal covenant.
    - Sin is understood as a failure to realize the destiny intended by God.
    - The fulfillment of human existence is tied to the resurrection and final revelation.
    - "Man’s destiny is not fulfilled in the beginning but in the end, in the consummation of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Covenant as relational, not contractual**
    - The biblical covenants are fundamentally about relationship, not legal arrangement.
    - The notion of a pre-fall legal covenant is not central to Pannenberg’s theology.
    - God’s faithfulness is expressed in the ongoing engagement with humanity.
    - The law is interpreted within the context of God’s historical purposes.
    - "Covenant in the Old Testament is not a contract but a relationship of promise and fulfillment." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Sin and fall as historical realities**
    - The fall is interpreted as a historical event with universal significance.
    - Sin disrupts the intended relationship between God and humanity.
    - The consequences of sin are worked out in the unfolding of history.
    - Redemption is seen as the restoration of the original vocation in Christ.
    - "The fall is not merely a myth but a reality that shapes the course of human history." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

5. **Christ as the fulfillment of human destiny**
    - Jesus is the representative human who realizes God’s intention for humanity.
    - Christ’s obedience and resurrection inaugurate the new humanity.
    - The work of Christ is the basis for the restoration of the relationship with God.
    - The eschatological hope is grounded in the person and work of Christ.
    - "In Jesus the destiny of man is fulfilled and the covenant relationship is restored." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **covenant** and human history challenged traditional Reformed categories such as the **Covenant of Works**, shifting the focus to the dynamic, relational, and eschatological dimensions of God’s dealings with humanity. His emphasis on **universal history** and the centrality of Christ’s resurrection influenced ecumenical and systematic theology, encouraging a broader engagement with biblical and historical themes. While not adopting the classic Reformed framework, Pannenberg’s theology remains significant for discussions on the nature of **revelation**, human vocation, and the meaning of covenant in Christian doctrine.
