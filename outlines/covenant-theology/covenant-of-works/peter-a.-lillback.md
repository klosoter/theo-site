# Peter A. Lillback (1951–)

Peter A. Lillback is a contemporary Reformed theologian who argues for the centrality of the **Covenant of Works** within the framework of **federal theology**. He maintains that the prelapsarian covenant between God and Adam is foundational for understanding **justification**, the **covenant of grace**, and the coherence of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**. Lillback’s scholarship underscores the confessional and historical necessity of this doctrine for systematic theology.

- "The covenant of works is not a peripheral doctrine, but a central pillar in the architecture of Reformed federal theology." (The Binding of God)

## Key Works

- The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology
- “The Continuing Importance of the Covenant of Works” (in The Law is Not of Faith)
- “The Covenant of Works in Reformed Theology” (various essays and lectures)
- Contributions to Reformed Confessions and Catechisms: The Westminster Confession and Catechisms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Reality of the Covenant of Works**
    - Asserts that the covenant of works is a genuine historical arrangement between God and Adam.
    - Views it as foundational for the narrative of **creation, fall, and redemption**.
    - Argues that denying its historicity undermines the coherence of **federal theology**.
    - Grounds his position in the testimony of **Reformed confessions**.
    "The Reformed tradition’s insistence on the historicity of the covenant of works is not optional, but essential." (The Binding of God)

2. **Legal Character of the Covenant**
    - Emphasizes the **law-based** nature of the covenant of works, with clear stipulations and consequences.
    - Highlights the promise of **life for obedience** and **death for disobedience**.
    - Connects the legal structure to the later doctrine of **justification by faith**.
    - Distinguishes the covenant of works from the **covenant of grace** on this legal basis.
    "The law principle—do this and live—stands at the heart of the covenant of works." (The Law is Not of Faith)

3. **Typological Function in Redemptive History**
    - Sees the covenant of works as typological, prefiguring Christ’s work as the second Adam.
    - Argues that Christ’s active obedience fulfills the requirements of the first covenant.
    - Identifies Adam as a **federal head**, whose failure necessitates a new representative.
    - Connects this typology to the structure of **redemptive history**.
    "The covenant of works sets the stage for Christ’s redemptive obedience as the last Adam." (The Binding of God)

4. **Confessional Centrality**
    - Stresses the presence of the covenant of works in the **Westminster Standards** and other Reformed confessions.
    - Argues that confessional fidelity requires affirmation of this doctrine.
    - Warns against revisionist readings that minimize or reject the covenant of works.
    - Uses confessional documents as theological boundaries for **Reformed identity**.
    "The Westminster Confession’s doctrine of the covenant of works is not an historical accident, but a theological necessity." (The Binding of God)

5. **Hermeneutical Significance**
    - Advocates for a **covenantal hermeneutic** that recognizes the covenant of works as key to interpreting Scripture.
    - Sees the structure of law and gospel as rooted in the distinction between the two covenants.
    - Argues that biblical theology must account for the covenant of works to avoid antinomianism or legalism.
    - Emphasizes the unity and diversity of God’s covenants throughout **redemptive history**.
    "A covenantal reading of Scripture demands that we reckon with the covenant of works as foundational." (The Binding of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Lillback’s work has reinforced the **centrality of the covenant of works** in contemporary Reformed theology, especially among confessional Presbyterians. His scholarship has shaped debates on the doctrine’s historical development, confessional status, and theological necessity. By defending the covenant of works against revisionist trends, Lillback has contributed to the preservation of classic **federal theology** and its ongoing relevance for systematic theology and biblical interpretation.
