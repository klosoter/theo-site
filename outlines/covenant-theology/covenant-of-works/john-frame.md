# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the traditional **Reformed doctrine of the Covenant of Works** while offering nuanced critiques and clarifications. He maintains that God established a **covenantal relationship** with Adam, requiring perfect obedience as a condition for **eschatological life**, but Frame is cautious about speculative details and emphasizes the **sovereignty of God** and the **unity of God’s covenants** throughout redemptive history.

- "The covenant of works is not a contract between equals, but a sovereign administration of God’s lordship over Adam." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "Covenant and the Kingdom of God" (in "The Collected Shorter Writings of John Frame, Vol. 1")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Covenant of Works**
    - God established a real covenant with Adam before the Fall.
    - The covenant required **perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience**.
    - Disobedience would result in **death**, while obedience promised **life**.
    - The covenant is foundational for understanding **federal headship** and **original sin**.
    - "Adam was indeed in a covenantal relationship with God, and that relationship had stipulations and consequences." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Covenant as Divine Sovereignty**
    - The covenant is not a mutual contract but a sovereign arrangement by God.
    - God’s lordship defines the terms and conditions of the covenant.
    - The relationship is rooted in **God’s authority**, not human initiative.
    - The structure of the covenant reflects God’s **tri-perspectival lordship**.
    - "The covenant of works is not a contract between equals, but a sovereign administration of God’s lordship over Adam." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Cautious Use of Terminology**
    - Frame notes that the term "Covenant of Works" is not explicitly biblical.
    - He prefers to focus on the biblical data rather than speculative reconstructions.
    - The concept is valid if understood as a summary of scriptural teaching.
    - He warns against over-systematizing or reading later theology back into Genesis.
    - "We should not insist on the terminology, but we must affirm the reality the term describes." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Unity and Diversity in God’s Covenants**
    - The **Covenant of Works** is distinct from, but related to, the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Both covenants reveal God’s consistent character and purposes.
    - The failure of Adam sets the stage for Christ as the second Adam.
    - The unity of God’s covenants underscores the coherence of redemptive history.
    - "The covenant of works and the covenant of grace are not two separate plans, but two administrations of God’s one purpose." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Ethical and Eschatological Significance**
    - The covenant provides the basis for **moral obligation** in humanity.
    - Adam’s failure under the covenant necessitates redemption in Christ.
    - The eschatological promise of life is fulfilled in the **work of Christ**.
    - The **law-gospel distinction** is rooted in the structure of the covenants.
    - "The covenant of works sets the stage for the gospel, for only in Christ can the promise of life be fulfilled." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **Covenant of Works** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing both biblical fidelity and theological caution. His insistence on the **sovereignty of God** and the unity of the covenantal structure has shaped discussions on **federal theology** and the relationship between law and gospel. Frame’s nuanced approach encourages theologians to uphold the doctrine’s essentials while avoiding speculative excesses, ensuring its ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
