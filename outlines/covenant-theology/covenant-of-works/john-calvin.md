# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s doctrine of the **Covenant of Works** is not fully systematized, but he lays foundational concepts for later Reformed development. Calvin affirms that God entered into a **covenantal relationship** with Adam, promising **eternal life** upon the condition of perfect obedience, thus establishing the principle of **federal headship** and the legal framework for **original sin** and **justification**. While Calvin does not use the precise term "Covenant of Works," his exegesis of Genesis and Romans provides the theological groundwork for this doctrine.

- "God made a covenant with Adam, that if he kept the commandments, he should obtain by his own works eternal life." (Institutes 2.1.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 1–2)
- Commentary on Genesis (esp. Genesis 2–3)
- Commentary on Romans (esp. Romans 5)
- Sermons on Genesis
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition, secondary analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God’s Sovereign Initiative in Covenant**
    - God freely establishes a **covenantal relationship** with Adam.
    - The covenant is an expression of divine **condescension** and goodness.
    - The terms of the covenant are set by God alone, not negotiated.
    - The covenant demonstrates God’s **sovereignty** over creation and humanity.
    - "God was pleased to embrace him [Adam] in grace, and to promise him eternal life." (Institutes 2.1.1)

2. **Conditional Promise of Eternal Life**
    - Adam is promised **eternal life** upon the condition of perfect obedience.
    - The reward is not due to Adam’s merit, but to God’s gracious promise.
    - The **law** given in the covenant is clear and attainable before the Fall.
    - Disobedience results in **death** and loss of communion with God.
    - "He promised life to him, and in the event of disobedience, threatened death." (Institutes 2.1.3)

3. **Federal Headship of Adam**
    - Adam acts as the **representative head** of all humanity.
    - His obedience or disobedience affects the entire human race.
    - The consequences of Adam’s breach are imputed to his descendants.
    - This headship establishes the basis for **original sin**.
    - "Adam was not created for himself alone, but for his posterity." (Institutes 2.1.6)

4. **Law and Works in Pre-Fall State**
    - The **law** is written on Adam’s heart and externally revealed.
    - Adam possesses the ability to obey prior to the Fall.
    - The principle of **works** is distinct from post-Fall **grace**.
    - The law’s function is to test Adam’s loyalty and love for God.
    - "The Lord gave him a law by which he might prove his obedience." (Institutes 2.1.4)

5. **Foundation for the Covenant of Grace**
    - The failure of the first covenant sets the stage for the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Christ fulfills the law that Adam failed to keep.
    - The structure of promise and fulfillment is rooted in the original covenant.
    - The contrast between **law and gospel** is grounded in Adam’s probation.
    - "What Adam lost by sin, Christ has recovered for us by his obedience." (Institutes 2.1.6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **covenantal relationship** with Adam profoundly shaped later Reformed theology, providing the exegetical and conceptual basis for the **Covenant of Works** as developed by his successors. Though he did not use the later terminology, his insights on **federal headship**, law, and promise became central to Reformed confessions and systematic theology. Calvin’s influence endures in discussions of **original sin**, justification, and the structure of redemptive history.
