# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not explicitly articulate a **Covenant of Works** as later developed in Reformed theology, but his doctrine of **original justice**, **law**, and the **state of innocence** addresses similar themes. Aquinas taught that Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness**, with the possibility of eternal life contingent upon obedience to God's command, thus providing a foundation for later covenantal formulations.

- "Man was so created that he was ordered by his reason to God as to his end, and this ordering is called original justice." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 109, a. 2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, Questions 94–100 (Treatise on Law and the State of Innocence)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book II
- De Malo (On Evil)
- Secondary: Steven J. Duby, "Aquinas and the Covenant of Works" (in Reformed Scholasticism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Original Justice as the State of Innocence**
    - Adam was created in a state of **original righteousness** and harmony with God.
    - This state included the rectitude of all faculties and subjection to God’s law.
    - Loss of original justice resulted in the disordering of human nature.
    - The state of innocence was not merited but given by divine grace.
    - "Original justice is nothing else than man's will subject to God." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 95, a. 1)

2. **Law as the Rule of Reason and Divine Command**
    - The **natural law** was written on Adam’s heart, guiding him toward his supernatural end.
    - Adam also received a **positive law** (the prohibition regarding the tree).
    - Obedience to both natural and positive law was required for the maintenance of original justice.
    - Disobedience constituted sin and resulted in the loss of grace.
    - "The first man was given a command as a test of obedience." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 94, a. 4)

3. **Conditional Immortality and the Promise of Life**
    - Adam was created mortal but had the potential for **immortality** through obedience.
    - The gift of immortality was contingent, not intrinsic to human nature.
    - Death entered the world as a consequence of Adam’s transgression.
    - The promise of life was implicit in the state of innocence.
    - "Man was created in such a way that he could avoid death, but he could also die." (Summa Theologiae I, Q. 97, a. 1)

4. **Merit and the Limits of Human Nature**
    - Adam could not merit supernatural life by his own powers alone.
    - The ability to obey and persevere was itself a gift of **prevenient grace**.
    - Human acts in the state of innocence were ordered toward God but not strictly meritorious of eternal life.
    - The distinction between **nature** and **grace** is fundamental in Aquinas’s anthropology.
    - "No created nature is sufficient to obtain eternal life without the help of divine grace." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 109, a. 5)

5. **Transmission of Sin and Loss of Original Justice**
    - Adam’s sin resulted in the loss of original justice for himself and his posterity.
    - The transmission of **original sin** is both a privation of justice and an inherited guilt.
    - All humanity is now born lacking the original righteousness Adam possessed.
    - Restoration requires the **grace of Christ** and not merely human effort.
    - "By the sin of the first parent, original justice was lost for himself and for us." (Summa Theologiae I-II, Q. 81, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **original justice** and the state of innocence provided crucial categories for later discussions of the **Covenant of Works** in Reformed theology, even though he did not use covenantal terminology. His careful distinction between **nature** and **grace**, and his analysis of law and obedience, influenced both Catholic and Protestant thought on the relationship between Adam, law, and the possibility of eternal life. Reformed theologians adapted and modified Aquinas’s framework to articulate their own covenantal doctrines, making his anthropology a significant precursor to later developments.
