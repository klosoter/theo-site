# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til viewed the **Covenant of Works** as a foundational principle in **Reformed theology**, crucial for understanding the original relationship between God and Adam. He interpreted this covenant through his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**, emphasizing the **Creator-creature distinction** and the antithesis between obedience and autonomy as central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The covenant of works is not to be understood as a contract between equals but as the sovereign disposition of God toward his creature." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Theological Presupposition**
   - The **Covenant of Works** is foundational for understanding the pre-Fall relationship between God and humanity.
   - It establishes the principle of **federal headship** with Adam as representative of all humanity.
   - The covenant is a sovereign arrangement initiated by God, not a mutual contract.
   - It sets the stage for the necessity and nature of the **Covenant of Grace** after the Fall.
   "The Reformed doctrine of the covenant is the presupposition of all true theology." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction**
   - The covenant highlights the absolute distinction between God as Creator and man as creature.
   - Human obligation to obey is grounded in God’s sovereign authority, not merely in natural law.
   - The **Covenant of Works** expresses God’s lordship and man’s dependence.
   - Viewing the covenant as a contract among equals undermines biblical theism.
   "The very idea of covenant presupposes the Creator-creature relationship." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Antithesis Between Obedience and Autonomy**
   - The covenantal arrangement frames the antithesis between obedience to God and human autonomy.
   - Adam’s failure was a rejection of God’s covenantal lordship, not just an ethical lapse.
   - The **Covenant of Works** defines the Fall as a covenantal breach.
   - This antithesis shapes Van Til’s apologetic method throughout **redemptive history**.
   "The question is always: Will man interpret himself and his world in terms of the covenant or in terms of autonomy?" (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Significance**
   - The **Covenant of Works** is essential for understanding the flow of **redemptive history**.
   - It provides the backdrop for Christ’s work as the second Adam.
   - Law and grace are structured covenantally, not as abstract opposites.
   - The failure of the first covenant necessitates the **Covenant of Grace** and redemption in Christ.
   "Without the covenant of works, the meaning of the covenant of grace is lost." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Apologetic Implications**
   - The **Covenant of Works** shapes Van Til’s **presuppositional apologetics**.
   - Unbelievers suppress the truth of God’s covenant claims, seeking autonomy.
   - Apologetics must confront covenantal rebellion at the root of unbelief.
   - The covenant structure explains the epistemological divide between belief and unbelief.
   "All men are covenant-breakers by nature and must be confronted with the claims of the covenant God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **Covenant of Works** reinforced its centrality in Reformed dogmatics and shaped how later theologians integrated covenant theology with apologetics. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the antithesis between obedience and autonomy has influenced generations of Reformed thinkers, especially in defending the faith. Van Til’s covenantal framework remains a hallmark of Westminster Seminary’s theological identity and continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between law, grace, and **redemptive history**.
