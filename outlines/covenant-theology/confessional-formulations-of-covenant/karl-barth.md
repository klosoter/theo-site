# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth reinterpreted **covenant theology** by centering the concept of **covenant** in the doctrine of **revelation** and **election**, rather than in traditional confessional formulations. For Barth, the **covenant of grace** is not a secondary arrangement after the fall but the very basis of God's relationship with humanity, culminating in Jesus Christ as both the electing God and elected man.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation, and creation is the way to the covenant." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election)
- Church Dogmatics III/1 (Doctrine of Creation)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- The Göttingen Dogmatics
- Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology (Clifford Green)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Basis of Creation**
    - The **covenant** is not a remedial measure but the purpose for which God created the world.
    - Creation is oriented toward fellowship between God and humanity.
    - The **covenant of grace** is not subsequent to the **covenant of works** but precedes and grounds all of God's dealings.
    - The relationship between God and humanity is fundamentally covenantal from the outset.
    - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant, and the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (CD III/1)

2. **Christocentric Covenant**
    - Jesus Christ is the center and fulfillment of the covenant.
    - Christ is both the subject and object of election, embodying the covenant in his person.
    - The covenant is realized and revealed fully in the incarnation and atonement.
    - All humanity is represented in Christ, the true covenant partner.
    - "In Jesus Christ God has bound Himself to man and man to Himself." (CD IV/1)

3. **Rejection of Traditional Bifurcation**
    - Barth rejects the classic Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - He sees this division as artificial and not grounded in biblical revelation.
    - The unity of God's purpose is emphasized over legal or contractual frameworks.
    - The covenant is a single, gracious movement from God to humanity.
    - "There is only one covenant, the covenant of grace." (CD IV/1)

4. **Election as Covenant**
    - Election is understood as God's self-determination to be God for humanity in covenant.
    - The doctrine of election is inseparable from the doctrine of the covenant.
    - Election is not about individuals but about God's purpose in Christ for all.
    - The covenant is the historical and relational outworking of election.
    - "Election means covenant, and covenant means election." (CD II/2)

5. **Revelation and Covenant**
    - God's self-revelation is always covenantal in character.
    - Revelation is not merely the communication of information but the establishment of relationship.
    - The Word of God is the medium and content of the covenant.
    - The covenant is the framework for understanding all divine revelation.
    - "God reveals Himself as the Lord of the covenant." (CD I/2)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth's reconfiguration of **covenant theology** profoundly influenced 20th-century dogmatics, challenging traditional Reformed distinctions and emphasizing the unity of God's gracious purpose in Christ. His approach redirected theological focus from legal formulations to the relational and Christocentric dimensions of the covenant. Barth’s legacy continues to provoke debate over the nature of **election**, the structure of redemptive history, and the meaning of confessional formulations in contemporary theology.
