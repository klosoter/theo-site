# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches **confessional formulations of covenant** with a focus on the dynamic, relational, and lordship-centered nature of **covenant theology**. He emphasizes the importance of **biblical authority**, the **tri-perspectival** approach to doctrine, and the necessity of understanding **covenant** as central to both **systematic theology** and the life of the church.

- "Covenant is the central biblical category for understanding God’s relationship with his people." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- "Covenant and the Unity of Scripture" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Lordship Relationship**
    - Frames the covenant as God’s sovereign relationship with his people, marked by authority, control, and presence.
    - Emphasizes the suzerainty structure found in biblical covenants.
    - Sees the covenant as the primary means by which God reveals himself and relates to humanity.
    - Argues that all of theology is best understood through the lens of God’s lordship in covenant.
    - "The covenant is the relationship in which God is Lord and we are his servants." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Covenant**
    - Applies his normative, situational, and existential perspectives to the doctrine of covenant.
    - Stresses that confessional formulations must account for biblical norms, historical context, and personal appropriation.
    - Argues that no single perspective exhausts the richness of covenant theology.
    - Uses this approach to critique and enrich traditional Reformed confessional statements.
    - "We must look at the covenant from the perspectives of God’s commands, the historical situation, and our personal response." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Biblical Authority and Confessional Formulation**
    - Insists that confessional statements about covenant must be grounded in Scripture.
    - Warns against allowing tradition to overshadow biblical teaching.
    - Encourages continual re-examination of confessional language in light of biblical exegesis.
    - Affirms the value of historic confessions but subjects them to the authority of God’s Word.
    - "Confessions are valuable, but only as they faithfully summarize the teaching of Scripture." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Covenant History**
    - Recognizes both continuity and discontinuity between the old and new covenants.
    - Affirms the unity of God’s redemptive plan across the covenants.
    - Highlights the fulfillment of the old covenant in Christ and the church.
    - Engages with confessional debates on the relationship between law, gospel, and covenant.
    - "The new covenant fulfills, rather than abolishes, the old." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenant and the Christian Life**
    - Connects covenant theology directly to ethics and Christian living.
    - Argues that the covenant shapes the believer’s identity and obligations.
    - Sees the sacraments as covenant signs and seals, rooted in confessional formulations.
    - Emphasizes the church as a covenant community, called to faithful obedience.
    - "Our life in Christ is a covenantal life, shaped by God’s promises and commands." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s work has significantly influenced contemporary **Reformed theology** by integrating a robust doctrine of covenant with his tri-perspectival method. His insistence on the primacy of **biblical authority** in confessional formulations has encouraged ongoing reformation and self-examination within confessional traditions. Frame’s writings continue to shape discussions on the relationship between doctrine, worship, and the Christian life, ensuring that covenant remains central in both theology and practice.
