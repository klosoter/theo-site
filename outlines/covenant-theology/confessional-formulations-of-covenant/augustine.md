# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s approach to **covenant** is foundational for later **confessional formulations**, though he does not articulate a fully developed covenant theology as seen in the Reformed tradition. He interprets the relationship between **Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **divine promise and fulfillment**, emphasizing the unity of **God’s redemptive plan**. Augustine’s thought on **law and grace**, as well as his understanding of the **church** as the community of the covenant, profoundly shaped medieval and Reformation-era confessional statements.

- "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Enarrationes in Psalmos (Expositions on the Psalms)
- Quaestiones in Heptateuchum
- Contra Faustum Manichaeum

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Two Testaments**
    - The **Old and New Testaments** are two phases of one divine covenant.
    - The **promises** made to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - The **types and shadows** of the Old are realized in the New.
    - The **covenant people** are defined by faith, not ethnicity.
    - "The New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

2. **Primacy of Grace in the Covenant**
    - Human beings cannot fulfill the covenant apart from **divine grace**.
    - The law exposes sin and points to the need for **redemption**.
    - **Faith** is the means by which one participates in the covenant.
    - The **Spirit** enables obedience to God’s commands.
    - "For what else does the law show but our weakness, and what else does grace give but help to our weakness?" (De Spiritu et Littera 29)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity of the Covenants**
    - There is **continuity** in God’s purpose across the covenants.
    - The **ceremonial laws** are abrogated in Christ, but the **moral law** endures.
    - The **signs** of the covenant change (circumcision to baptism).
    - The **substance** of salvation remains the same: Christ.
    - "The sacraments of the old people signified Christ to come; ours signify Christ as having come." (Contra Faustum Manichaeum 19.13)

4. **Ecclesial Character of the Covenant**
    - The **church** is the community of the covenant, spanning both Testaments.
    - Membership is defined by **faith and the Spirit**, not merely external rites.
    - The church is both **visible and invisible**.
    - The **means of grace** (Word and sacrament) are central to covenant life.
    - "The same church existed in the saints of old, as now exists in us." (Enarrationes in Psalmos 77.2)

5. **Covenant and Redemptive History**
    - History unfolds according to God’s **covenantal plan**.
    - The **covenant with Adam** is contrasted with the covenant in Christ.
    - The **progress of revelation** moves from promise to fulfillment.
    - All of history is oriented toward the **city of God**.
    - "Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love of self, the heavenly by the love of God." (De Civitate Dei 14.28)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **unity of redemptive history** and his emphasis on **grace** provided the groundwork for later confessional formulations of covenant, especially in the **Reformed tradition**. His influence is evident in the way medieval and Protestant theologians approached the relationship between the Testaments and the nature of the church as the covenant community. While not a systematic covenant theologian, Augustine’s categories and insights remain foundational for understanding the development of **covenant theology** in the Western church.
