# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos was a foundational figure in the development of **Reformed biblical theology**, emphasizing the organic unity of **covenant theology** within the history of redemption. He articulated the **confessional formulations of covenant** as central to understanding the structure of **Scripture**, especially the relationship between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace** in Reformed confessions.

- "The covenant idea is not an appendage to the Reformed system; it is, on the contrary, the point of view from which the whole of the system must be construed and understood." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

## Key Works

- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (1891)
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- Reformed Dogmatics
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit"
- "The Mosaic Covenant" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Covenant in Reformed Theology**
   - The **covenant** is the organizing principle of Reformed confessional theology.
   - Vos sees the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** as foundational to the confessions.
   - He argues that the confessions reflect the unity and progression of redemptive history through covenant.
   - The confessional documents are not innovations but faithful expositions of biblical covenants.
   - "The Reformed confessions have made the covenant the basis of their soteriology and anthropology." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

2. **Covenant of Works as Confessional Foundation**
   - Vos affirms the **Covenant of Works** as essential to Reformed confessional identity.
   - He maintains that the Westminster Standards and other confessions rightly begin with Adam’s probation.
   - The **Covenant of Works** provides the legal and moral framework for understanding the fall and redemption.
   - Its confessional formulation guards the doctrines of original righteousness and federal headship.
   - "The Reformed confessions have given the covenant of works a fixed place in their system." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

3. **Covenant of Grace and Redemptive Unity**
   - The **Covenant of Grace** is the confessional expression of God’s redemptive purpose after the fall.
   - Vos highlights the continuity of the **Covenant of Grace** from Genesis to Christ in the confessions.
   - He stresses that the confessions present the covenant as the means by which salvation is administered.
   - The unity of the covenant is a hallmark of Reformed confessional theology.
   - "The Reformed confessions have always emphasized the unity of the covenant of grace." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

4. **Organic and Historical Development**
   - Vos insists that confessional formulations must reflect the organic, historical unfolding of the covenant.
   - He opposes static or merely systematic presentations detached from biblical history.
   - The confessions, for Vos, are valuable insofar as they capture the dynamic movement of redemptive history.
   - This approach safeguards the living character of the covenant in the life of the church.
   - "The covenant is not a static arrangement, but a living relationship unfolding in history." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Scripture as the Source and Norm**
   - Vos grounds confessional covenant formulations in the exegesis of **Scripture**.
   - He maintains that confessions must be subordinate to the biblical witness.
   - The authority of confessional statements derives from their fidelity to the covenantal structure of Scripture.
   - Vos’s method is to test confessional formulations by their correspondence to biblical theology.
   - "The confessions are valuable only as they reproduce the teaching of Scripture." ("The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **confessional formulations of covenant** shaped the trajectory of twentieth-century Reformed theology, especially in the areas of biblical theology and covenantal hermeneutics. His insistence on the organic unity of the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** in the confessions influenced generations of theologians at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Vos’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate confessional fidelity with biblical-theological method, ensuring that the covenant remains central in both doctrine and practice.
