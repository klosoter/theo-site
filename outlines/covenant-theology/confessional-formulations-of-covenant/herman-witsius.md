# Herman Witsius (1636–1708)

Herman Witsius was a leading figure in the development of **Reformed covenant theology**, offering a systematic and mediating approach to the **confessional formulations of covenant**. He articulated the distinctions between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, emphasizing their biblical foundations and confessional significance within the Reformed tradition. Witsius’s synthesis became a standard reference for understanding the doctrinal contours and theological coherence of covenantal thought in the post-Reformation era.

- "The covenant of God with man is a compact or agreement between God and man, in which God promises man eternal happiness, and man binds himself to God in faith and obedience." (The Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man)

## Key Works

- The Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man (1677)
- Sacred Dissertations on the Apostles’ Creed
- Essays on the Assurance of Faith
- The Practice of True Christianity
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bipartite Structure: Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Asserts a historical and theological distinction between the **Covenant of Works** (pre-Fall) and the **Covenant of Grace** (post-Fall).
    - The **Covenant of Works** is grounded in Adam’s original relationship with God, requiring perfect obedience for life.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is established after the Fall, promising salvation through faith in Christ.
    - Both covenants are foundational for understanding the unity and progression of redemptive history.
    - "The whole of religion, as it regards man, is contained in these two covenants." (The Economy of the Covenants)

2. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam and Christ serve as federal heads in their respective covenants.
    - Adam’s disobedience brings condemnation to his posterity under the **Covenant of Works**.
    - Christ’s obedience secures the blessings of the **Covenant of Grace** for believers.
    - This federal structure upholds the confessional doctrine of imputation.
    - "Adam was the representative of all his posterity, as Christ is of all the elect." (The Economy of the Covenants)

3. **Confessional Alignment with Reformed Orthodoxy**
    - Witsius’s covenant theology aligns with the **Three Forms of Unity** and the **Westminster Standards**.
    - He emphasizes the necessity of confessional clarity for ecclesial unity and doctrinal purity.
    - His formulations seek to mediate between differing Reformed perspectives, especially on the law-gospel relationship.
    - The confessional articulation of the covenants serves as a safeguard against antinomianism and legalism.
    - "The doctrine of the covenants is the key to the whole of theology, and the bond of union in the system of religion." (The Economy of the Covenants)

4. **Conditionality and Unconditionality in the Covenants**
    - The **Covenant of Works** is strictly conditional upon human obedience.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is unconditional in its establishment but conditional in its administration (requiring faith).
    - Witsius distinguishes between the internal efficacy and external administration of the covenant.
    - This nuanced approach preserves both divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - "The covenant of grace, though absolute in its origin, is administered with conditions to be performed by man." (The Economy of the Covenants)

5. **Sacramental Administration of the Covenant**
    - Sacraments are visible signs and seals of the covenant promises.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper function as means of grace within the covenant community.
    - The administration of sacraments is tied to the visible church and its confessional boundaries.
    - Witsius underscores the continuity of covenant signs from the Old to the New Testament.
    - "The sacraments are seals of the covenant, confirming the promises of God to believers." (The Economy of the Covenants)

## Legacy and Impact

Witsius’s articulation of **confessional covenant theology** became a touchstone for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping both academic theology and ecclesial practice. His careful distinctions and mediating approach influenced subsequent generations, especially in the Dutch and English Reformed traditions. The clarity and comprehensiveness of his covenant formulations continue to serve as a standard reference for understanding the theological and confessional dimensions of the Reformed faith.
