# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann understands **covenant** as a dynamic, relational reality rooted in **God’s self-giving** and oriented toward the **eschatological renewal** of creation. He critiques traditional **confessional formulations** for their static and juridical tendencies, advocating instead for a participatory, future-oriented vision of covenant that centers on the **kingdom of God** and the liberation of all creation.

- "The covenant of God is the fellowship of the divine with the world, and its aim is the liberation and renewal of creation." ("The Coming of God")

## Key Works

- "Theology of Hope" (1964)
- "The Church in the Power of the Spirit" (1975)
- "The Coming of God: Christian Eschatology" (1995)
- "God in Creation" (1985)
- "The Crucified God" (1972)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Eschatological Promise**
    - Emphasizes the forward-looking, hope-filled nature of covenant.
    - Sees covenant as God’s promise to renew creation, not merely a legal pact.
    - Links covenant to the coming **kingdom of God** and the fulfillment of history.
    - Critiques static, past-oriented confessional definitions.
    - "God’s covenant is the promise of the future in which all things will be made new." ("Theology of Hope")

2. **Relational and Participatory Covenant**
    - Views covenant as a living relationship, not just a contract.
    - Stresses mutuality between God and humanity within the covenant.
    - Argues that covenant involves participation in God’s mission and suffering.
    - Rejects purely forensic or individualistic interpretations.
    - "Covenant means participation in the history and suffering of God." ("The Crucified God")

3. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
    - Expands covenant beyond Israel and the church to include all creation.
    - Sees ecological and cosmic dimensions in God’s covenantal purposes.
    - Argues that confessional formulations often neglect this universalism.
    - Connects covenant to liberation and justice for all peoples.
    - "The covenant of God embraces the whole creation, not just the elect." ("God in Creation")

4. **Critique of Traditional Confessionalism**
    - Questions the adequacy of **Reformed** and Lutheran covenantal categories.
    - Argues that confessional statements often reduce covenant to doctrine.
    - Calls for a more dynamic, historically conscious approach.
    - Sees confessionalism as potentially exclusionary and static.
    - "Confessional theology must be opened to the future and the world, not closed in the past." ("The Church in the Power of the Spirit")

5. **Covenant and the Cross**
    - Centers the meaning of covenant in the event of the **crucifixion**.
    - Interprets the cross as the ultimate act of God’s covenantal solidarity.
    - Sees suffering and hope as essential to covenant life.
    - Argues that the cross redefines the boundaries and content of covenant.
    - "The cross is the foundation and the crisis of every covenant." ("The Crucified God")

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reimagining of **covenant** has challenged confessional traditions to reconsider the scope and dynamism of their formulations. His emphasis on **eschatology**, relationality, and the cosmic dimensions of God’s promise has influenced ecumenical dialogues and contemporary theology. While his critiques of traditional confessionalism have sparked debate, his vision of covenant as participatory and future-oriented continues to shape discussions on the church’s mission and the renewal of creation.
