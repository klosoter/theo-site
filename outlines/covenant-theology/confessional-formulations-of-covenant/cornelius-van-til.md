# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **confessional formulations of covenant** through the lens of **Reformed orthodoxy**, emphasizing the centrality of the **covenant of grace** and the **covenant of works** in the structure of **systematic theology**. He insisted that confessional statements, such as the **Westminster Standards**, must be interpreted within a robustly **Trinitarian** and **presuppositional** framework, safeguarding the Creator-creature distinction and the self-attesting authority of Scripture.

- "The Reformed faith is, in its essence, a truly consistently covenantal faith." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Framework of Revelation**
    - The **covenant** is the basic structure by which God relates to humanity.
    - Both the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are essential for understanding redemptive history.
    - Confessional formulations must reflect the unity and diversity within the covenantal administration.
    - The covenant concept guards against both rationalism and irrationalism in theology.
    - "The whole of history is the outworking of the covenantal relationship between God and man." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Trinitarian Foundation of the Covenant**
    - The **Trinity** is the ontological basis for all covenantal relations.
    - Confessional statements must be interpreted in light of the triune God's self-revelation.
    - The intra-Trinitarian relationship is the archetype for the covenant.
    - Denial of the Trinity undermines the coherence of covenant theology.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the heart of the covenant idea." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Creator-Creature Distinction and Covenant**
    - The **Creator-creature distinction** is fundamental to covenantal theology.
    - Confessional formulations must avoid any confusion between God's transcendence and immanence.
    - The covenant is always a sovereignly imposed relationship, not a contract between equals.
    - Human knowledge of God is always analogical, shaped by the covenant structure.
    - "God’s covenant with man is always that of the sovereign Lord with his creature." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Self-Attesting Scripture and Confessional Authority**
    - The authority of **confessional standards** is subordinate to the self-attesting authority of Scripture.
    - Confessions must be evaluated and interpreted by the Word of God.
    - The covenantal context of revelation ensures the reliability of Scripture.
    - Presuppositional apologetics defends the necessity of confessional fidelity to Scripture.
    - "Scripture is self-attesting and the final standard for all confessional formulations." (The Defense of the Faith)

5. **Antithesis and Covenant Community**
    - The **antithesis** between belief and unbelief is rooted in covenantal categories.
    - Confessional identity marks the boundaries of the covenant community.
    - The church’s confessions articulate the faithfulness of the covenant people.
    - The covenant community is called to maintain doctrinal purity through confessional adherence.
    - "The antithesis is covenantal: it is the difference between those in Adam and those in Christ." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s covenantal approach to **confessional theology** has profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, especially in the areas of **presuppositional apologetics** and the interpretation of the **Westminster Standards**. His insistence on the **Trinitarian** and **covenantal** foundations of doctrine has influenced generations of theologians and confessional bodies. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing debates over the nature of confessional subscription and the role of covenant in systematic theology.
