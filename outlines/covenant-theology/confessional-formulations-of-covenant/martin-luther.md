# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s approach to **covenant** was shaped by his emphasis on the **law-gospel distinction** and the centrality of **justification by faith**. While not developing a systematic covenant theology like later Reformed thinkers, Luther interpreted biblical covenants primarily through the lens of **promise** and **grace**, contrasting the old and new covenants as law and gospel. His confessional formulations stress the unilateral action of God in establishing relationship with sinners.

- "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Key Works

- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (1520)
- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- Commentary on Genesis (1535–1545)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law-Gospel Distinction as Hermeneutical Key**
    - Interprets **covenant** history through the opposition of law (demand) and gospel (promise).
    - Old covenant is associated with the law, exposing sin and driving to Christ.
    - New covenant is the proclamation of forgiveness and grace in Christ.
    - Confessional documents emphasize the necessity of distinguishing these two words of God.
    - "All the promises of God are comprehended in the gospel." (Large Catechism)

2. **Covenant as Divine Promise**
    - Views biblical covenants primarily as unilateral divine promises rather than mutual contracts.
    - Stresses God’s initiative and faithfulness in establishing relationship with humanity.
    - Human response is faith, not meritorious obedience.
    - The sacraments are signs and seals of the divine promise.
    - "A testament is nothing else than a promise, made by one who is about to die." (Babylonian Captivity)

3. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - The new covenant centers on the gift of **justification** apart from works.
    - Faith receives the benefits of Christ’s atoning work, fulfilling the covenant promise.
    - The confessions reject any notion of human merit in attaining covenant blessings.
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers as the heart of the new covenant.
    - "By faith alone we are justified, for faith receives the promise." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the fulfillment and mediator of all biblical covenants.
    - The old covenant types and shadows point to Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The new covenant is established in Christ’s blood, as celebrated in the Lord’s Supper.
    - The confessions identify Christ as the center of all God’s dealings with humanity.
    - "This cup is the new testament in my blood." (Large Catechism)

5. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are instituted as visible words of the covenant promise.
    - The sacraments convey grace by confirming faith in God’s promise.
    - Rejects the medieval view of sacraments as works performed for merit.
    - The confessions teach that sacraments are to be received in faith, not as mere rituals.
    - "The sacraments are signs of the promises." (Babylonian Captivity)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s confessional formulations of **covenant** laid the groundwork for later Protestant understandings, especially in distinguishing **law and gospel**. His emphasis on the unilateral nature of God’s promise and the centrality of **justification by faith** influenced both Lutheran and Reformed traditions, even as later Reformed theologians developed more systematic covenant theologies. Luther’s approach continues to shape discussions of **covenant** in relation to the sacraments, the person of Christ, and the doctrine of salvation.
