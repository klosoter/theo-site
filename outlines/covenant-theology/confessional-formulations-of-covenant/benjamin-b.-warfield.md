# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield approached **confessional formulations of covenant** as a central aspect of Reformed theology, emphasizing their role in articulating the unity and structure of **redemptive history**. He upheld the **Westminster Standards** as the mature expression of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, seeing these formulations as essential for maintaining doctrinal clarity and fidelity to **Scripture**.

- "The Westminster Confession is the ripest fruit of Reformed creedal development, especially in its doctrine of the covenants." (Selected Shorter Writings)

## Key Works

- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work"
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Significance of the Westminster Standards as a Creed"
- Selected Shorter Writings (esp. essays on covenant theology)
