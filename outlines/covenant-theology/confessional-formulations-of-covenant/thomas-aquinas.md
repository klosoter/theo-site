# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not develop a formal **covenant theology** as later Reformed thinkers did, but his doctrines of **divine law**, **sacrament**, and the **divine economy** provided essential groundwork for later covenantal reflection. Aquinas viewed God's relationship with humanity as structured by **divine promises** and **law**, especially in the transition from the **Old Law** to the **New Law** in Christ.

- "The Old Law was given that it might lead to the New Law, which is the law of the Spirit." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a.1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–108 (on Law and the Old/New Law)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book IV (on sacraments and divine promises)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (on salvation history and divine governance)
- Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy and Daniel A. Keating)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law as Divine Economy**
   - God's governance of humanity is structured through **divine law**.
   - The **Old Law** and **New Law** represent distinct phases in salvation history.
   - Law is both instructive and preparatory, leading to fulfillment in Christ.
   - The law mediates God's promises and commands to His people.
   "The Old Law was given as a preparation for the Gospel." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a.3)

2. **Sacraments as Signs of Divine Promise**
   - Sacraments are outward signs instituted by God to confer grace.
   - They function as means by which God communicates His promises to the faithful.
   - The sacraments of the Old Law prefigured those of the New Law.
   - The New Law sacraments effect what they signify, fulfilling divine promises.
   "The sacraments of the New Law cause grace, whereas those of the Old Law only signified it." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 62, a.6)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Salvation History**
   - There is a real continuity between the Old and New Testaments.
   - The **Old Covenant** is preparatory and typological, fulfilled in the New.
   - Christ is the mediator who brings the promises of the Old to completion.
   - The unity of God's plan is maintained through successive dispensations.
   "The Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and the New Law is the fulfillment of the Old." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a.2)

4. **Divine Promises and Human Response**
   - God initiates relationship through promises, calling for human faith and obedience.
   - The law and sacraments require a response of faith for their efficacy.
   - Human cooperation with grace is essential in the divine economy.
   - The fulfillment of God's promises is ultimately realized in Christ and His Church.
   "The promise was made to Abraham and to his seed, which is Christ." (Commentary on Galatians, ch. 3)

5. **Christ as Fulfillment of the Covenantal Structure**
   - Christ embodies and fulfills all previous divine promises and laws.
   - The New Law is internal, written on the heart by the Spirit.
   - The Church is constituted as the community of the New Covenant.
   - Participation in Christ through faith and sacraments is entry into the New Covenant.
   "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s theology provided foundational categories—**law**, **promise**, and **sacrament**—that shaped later Christian understandings of **covenant** even though he did not articulate a formal covenant theology. His distinctions between the Old and New Law, and his emphasis on Christ as the fulfillment of divine promises, influenced both Catholic and Protestant developments. Later Reformed theologians would draw upon and adapt Aquinas’s insights as they formulated their own confessional statements on the **covenant of grace** and **covenant of works**.
