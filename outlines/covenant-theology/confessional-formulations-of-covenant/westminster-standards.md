# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards provide a foundational **confessional formulation of covenant theology**, articulating the structure of **God’s relationship with humanity** through the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace**. These documents emphasize the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **federal representation** in both **Adam** and **Christ**, shaping Reformed understanding of **Scripture** and **salvation**.

- "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and to him, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (1647)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine Expounding the Westminster Confession (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bipartite Structure: Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Affirms a historical **Covenant of Works** with Adam as federal head.
    - Teaches the **Covenant of Grace** as God’s means of redeeming the elect after the Fall.
    - Stresses the contrast between **law** (works) and **gospel** (grace).
    - Maintains the unity of God’s purpose across both covenants.
    - "Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace." (WCF 7.3)

2. **Federal Representation**
    - Adam acts as **representative head** for all humanity in the Covenant of Works.
    - Christ serves as the **second Adam**, representing the elect in the Covenant of Grace.
    - The guilt and righteousness of the respective heads are **imputed** to their people.
    - This structure undergirds the doctrines of **original sin** and **justification**.
    - "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for his posterity, all mankind... sinned in him, and fell with him." (WSC 16)

3. **Unity and Diversity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The Covenant of Grace is one in substance throughout **redemptive history**.
    - Its administration differs under the **Old Testament** (promises, sacrifices, types) and **New Testament** (Christ revealed).
    - Both administrations offer the same **salvation in Christ**.
    - The visible church is the covenant community in every age.
    - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

4. **Means and Membership of the Covenant**
    - The **visible church** is the outward administration of the Covenant of Grace.
    - **Sacraments** (baptism and the Lord’s Supper) are signs and seals of the covenant.
    - Covenant membership includes believers and their children.
    - The covenant is outwardly administered but inwardly realized only by the elect.
    - "The visible Church... consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion; and of their children." (WCF 25.2)

5. **Scriptural Foundation and Hermeneutics**
    - The covenant structure is derived from the **whole counsel of God** in Scripture.
    - Emphasizes the unity of **biblical revelation** and the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Uses **typology** and **promise-fulfillment** to interpret the Old and New Testaments.
    - The Standards serve as a guide for reading Scripture covenantally.
    - "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant." (WCF 7.1)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional identity**, providing the definitive articulation of **covenant theology** for Presbyterian and many broader Reformed traditions. Their careful distinctions between the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** continue to inform theological education, ecclesial practice, and biblical interpretation. The Standards’ covenantal framework remains central to debates on law, gospel, and the nature of the church, ensuring their ongoing relevance in systematic theology.
