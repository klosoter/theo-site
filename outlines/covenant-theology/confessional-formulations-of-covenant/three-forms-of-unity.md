# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust **covenant theology** that shapes Reformed confessional identity. These documents emphasize the unity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history, the centrality of **Christ as Mediator**, and the necessity of **faith** for covenant participation. Their formulations provide a confessional standard for understanding the relationship between God and his people in both Old and New Testaments.

- "God made a covenant of grace with us, in which He promised us forgiveness of sins and eternal life for the sake of the one sacrifice of Christ accomplished on the cross." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 20)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14, 16, 17, 22, 34, 35
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), notably Q&A 19–21, 26–27, 65–74
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–III
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard English editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Affirms one **covenant of grace** throughout both Old and New Testaments.
    - Stresses that salvation is always by **faith in Christ**, not by works.
    - Old Testament believers participated in the same covenant realities as New Testament saints.
    - The external administration differs, but the substance remains the same.
    - "We believe that all the descendants of Adam, having thus fallen into perdition and ruin by the sin of the first man, God then manifested Himself to them in these things: namely, in promising to give His Son, born of a woman, to bruise the head of the serpent, and to make them blessed." (Belgic Confession, Art. 17)

2. **Christ as the Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the only **Mediator** and fulfillment of the covenant promises.
    - All covenant blessings are received through union with Christ.
    - The sacraments signify and seal Christ’s benefits to believers.
    - The covenant is realized in Christ’s atoning work and resurrection.
    - "We believe that we have no access to God except through the only Mediator and Advocate Jesus Christ the righteous." (Belgic Confession, Art. 26)

3. **Necessity of Faith for Covenant Participation**
    - Faith is the sole means of receiving the benefits of the covenant.
    - The covenant promises are not automatically applied to all, but to those who believe.
    - The sacraments call for a response of faith, not mere external observance.
    - True faith is worked by the Holy Spirit through the gospel.
    - "True faith is not only a sure knowledge... it is also a wholehearted trust, which the Holy Spirit creates in me by the gospel." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 21)

4. **Covenant and the Sacraments**
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are signs and seals of the covenant of grace.
    - The sacraments confirm God’s promises and strengthen faith.
    - They are not empty rituals but effectual means of grace for believers.
    - The sacraments are to be administered within the covenant community.
    - "As surely as water washes away the dirt from the body, so certainly does Christ’s blood and Spirit wash away my soul’s impurity." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 69)

5. **Covenant Community and Children**
    - The children of believers are included in the covenant and church.
    - Baptism is administered to infants as a sign of their covenant status.
    - The covenant community is called to nurture children in the faith.
    - Inclusion in the covenant does not guarantee salvation apart from faith.
    - "By baptism, as sign and seal, we are received into God’s church and set apart from all other people and false religions." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed identity, providing a confessional anchor for covenant theology in continental Reformed churches. Their articulation of the **covenant of grace** has influenced later Reformed confessions and theological systems, fostering a robust understanding of redemptive history and the church’s sacramental life. These documents continue to serve as a standard for doctrinal fidelity and catechetical instruction in Reformed communities worldwide.
