# Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669)

Johannes Cocceius was a pioneering figure in the development of **Reformed covenant theology**, emphasizing the centrality of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as the backbone of redemptive history. His confessional formulations stressed the progressive unfolding of **God’s covenants** in Scripture, shaping the doctrinal identity of the Reformed tradition and influencing later confessional standards.

- "The whole of theology is concerned with covenants." (Summa Doctrinae de Foedere et Testamento Dei)

## Key Works

- Summa Doctrinae de Foedere et Testamento Dei (1648)
- Commentarius in Epistolam ad Hebraeos (1665)
- The Doctrine of the Covenant and Testament of God (English translation selections)
- Scholarly analysis: Willem J. van Asselt, The Federal Theology of Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Covenant in Theology**
   - Theology is fundamentally structured by the concept of **covenant**.
   - All of God’s dealings with humanity are mediated through covenants.
   - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are the two principal covenants in redemptive history.
   - Confessional formulations must reflect the centrality of covenant in doctrine and practice.
   - "All theology is a doctrine of the covenant and testament of God." (Summa Doctrinae)

2. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
   - The **covenant of works** was established with Adam before the Fall.
   - It promised life upon perfect obedience and threatened death upon disobedience.
   - Adam’s failure necessitated the introduction of the **covenant of grace**.
   - Confessional documents must clearly distinguish between these two covenants.
   - "God made a covenant with Adam, in which eternal life was promised on condition of obedience." (Summa Doctrinae)

3. **Progressive Unfolding of the Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of grace** is revealed progressively throughout Scripture.
   - Its administration varies across redemptive history but its substance remains the same.
   - Christ is the mediator and fulfillment of the covenant of grace.
   - Confessional formulations should trace this unfolding from promise to fulfillment.
   - "The covenant of grace is the same in substance, though different in administration." (Summa Doctrinae)

4. **Scriptural Basis for Confessional Formulations**
   - All covenantal formulations must be grounded in the exegesis of Scripture.
   - The unity and diversity of the covenants are derived from biblical revelation.
   - Confessions should articulate covenant theology in language faithful to Scripture.
   - The **Old and New Testaments** are seen as administrations of the one covenant of grace.
   - "The Old and New Testaments are not two covenants, but two administrations of the same covenant." (Summa Doctrinae)

5. **Covenant Theology as Confessional Identity**
   - Covenant theology is essential to Reformed confessional identity.
   - Confessions must articulate the federal structure of salvation and history.
   - The church’s doctrine, worship, and sacraments are shaped by covenantal understanding.
   - The **Heidelberg Catechism** and other confessions reflect Cocceian influence.
   - "The doctrine of the covenant is the foundation of the whole of religion." (Summa Doctrinae)

## Legacy and Impact

Cocceius’s confessional formulations of **covenant theology** profoundly shaped the Reformed tradition, influencing later confessions and catechisms. His emphasis on the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** provided a framework for understanding redemptive history and the unity of Scripture. Cocceius’s legacy endures in the federal theology of the Reformed churches and continues to inform contemporary systematic theology.
