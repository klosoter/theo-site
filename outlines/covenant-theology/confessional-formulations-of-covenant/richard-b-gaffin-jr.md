# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose work on **covenant theology** emphasizes the centrality of **redemptive history** and the organic unity of **Scripture**. He upholds the **Westminster Standards** as faithful confessional formulations, stressing the importance of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** in articulating the structure of God’s dealings with humanity. Gaffin’s approach is marked by a careful exegetical method and a commitment to the confessional heritage of the Reformed tradition.

- "The confessional formulations of covenant theology are not speculative constructions but are grounded in the exegesis of Scripture." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ"
- "God’s Word in Servant Form: Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck on the Doctrine of Scripture"
- "The Westminster Confession and the Covenants" (in "The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century," ed. Ligon Duncan)

- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (WTJ 65:2, 2003)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Redemptive-Historical Exegesis**
   - Emphasizes that **covenant theology** must arise from the unfolding of **redemptive history** in Scripture.
   - Rejects speculative or purely systematic approaches detached from biblical revelation.
   - Sees the **covenant of grace** as progressively revealed from Genesis to Revelation.
   - Affirms that confessional formulations are valid insofar as they are biblically grounded.
   - "Covenant theology is not a system imposed on Scripture but the structure that emerges from the biblical narrative." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

2. **Centrality of the Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
   - Upholds the **Westminster Confession’s** distinction between the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as essential to Reformed orthodoxy.
   - Argues that these categories clarify the relationship between Adam, Christ, and the believer.
   - Maintains that the **covenant of works** is foundational for understanding the necessity of Christ’s obedience.
   - Views the **covenant of grace** as the unifying thread of salvation history.
   - "The distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is not optional but fundamental to the Reformed confessional system." ("The Westminster Confession and the Covenants")

3. **Organic Unity of Scripture and Covenant**
   - Insists that the **unity of Scripture** is best understood through the lens of the covenants.
   - Sees the **covenant of grace** as unfolding in multiple administrations but retaining a single substance.
   - Argues that the confessions rightly capture this organic unity in their formulations.
   - Emphasizes that the Old and New Testaments are not in opposition but in continuity.
   - "The unity of the covenant of grace is the backbone of the Reformed understanding of the Bible." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

4. **Confessional Fidelity and Theological Development**
   - Stresses the ongoing relevance of the **Westminster Standards** for covenant theology.
   - Encourages critical engagement with the confessions, always subject to Scripture.
   - Warns against both confessional rigidity and unwarranted innovation.
   - Advocates for a living tradition that is both faithful and reforming.
   - "Our confessional standards must be continually tested and refined by the Word of God." ("The Westminster Confession and the Covenants")

5. **Eschatological Orientation of the Covenants**
   - Highlights the forward-looking, **eschatological** dimension of the biblical covenants.
   - Argues that the **covenant of grace** finds its consummation in Christ’s resurrection and the new creation.
   - Sees the confessional formulations as pointing beyond themselves to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ.
   - Connects the believer’s union with Christ to the eschatological realities inaugurated by the new covenant.
   - "The eschatological fulfillment of the covenant is inseparable from the resurrection of Christ." ("Redemption and Resurrection")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **covenant theology**, especially regarding the relationship between **confessional standards** and biblical exegesis. His insistence on the primacy of redemptive history and the organic unity of Scripture has influenced a generation of pastors, scholars, and students at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Gaffin’s careful articulation of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** continues to serve as a touchstone for confessional fidelity and theological clarity in the Reformed tradition.
