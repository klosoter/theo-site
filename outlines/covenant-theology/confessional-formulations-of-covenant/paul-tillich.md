# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **covenant** not as a fixed doctrinal formula but as a symbol within the broader framework of **systematic theology** and **religious symbolism**. He reinterpreted traditional **confessional formulations** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the existential and ontological dimensions of humanity’s relationship with the divine rather than strict adherence to historical Reformed or Lutheran covenantal categories.

- "The content of faith is the meaning of the symbols in which faith expresses itself." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Protestant Era
- Dynamics of Faith
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic Expression**
    - Views **covenant** as a symbol pointing to the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - Rejects literal or juridical interpretations in favor of symbolic and existential meanings.
    - Sees confessional language as historically conditioned, requiring reinterpretation for contemporary relevance.
    - Emphasizes the dynamic, living character of covenant rather than static formulations.
    - "A symbol participates in the reality to which it points." (Dynamics of Faith)

2. **Method of Correlation**
    - Employs the method of correlation to relate **Christian symbols** (including covenant) to existential human questions.
    - Argues that confessional formulations must address the ultimate concerns of the present age.
    - Sees the covenant as a response to the human condition of estrangement and longing for reunion with the divine.
    - Prioritizes theological engagement with culture over strict confessional boundaries.
    - "Theology formulates the questions implied in human existence and the answers implied in the divine self-manifestation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Ontological Ground of Covenant**
    - Grounds the idea of covenant in the **ontology of being**, not merely in historical acts or legal arrangements.
    - Interprets covenant as the manifestation of the divine-human encounter at the level of being-itself.
    - Stresses that the covenant is rooted in the structure of reality, not just in biblical or confessional texts.
    - Connects covenant to the universal human experience of ultimate concern.
    - "God is the ground of being: that is, the power of being in everything and above everything." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Critique of Confessionalism**
    - Critiques rigid **confessional formulations** for their tendency to become empty formalism.
    - Warns that confessions can lose their power if detached from existential meaning.
    - Advocates for continual reinterpretation of confessional symbols to maintain their vitality.
    - Sees the danger of idolatry in treating confessional statements as ultimate rather than as pointers to the ultimate.
    - "The Protestant principle is the constant judgment of the church by the criterion of its own ultimate concern." (The Protestant Era)

5. **Universalizing the Covenant Concept**
    - Expands the covenant concept beyond its biblical and confessional roots to a universal religious symbol.
    - Argues that the covenant expresses the universal structure of the divine-human relationship.
    - Sees parallels between the Christian covenant and other religious traditions’ expressions of ultimate concern.
    - Emphasizes the inclusivity and adaptability of the covenant symbol for global theology.
    - "Symbols of faith are not unique to Christianity but are found wherever ultimate concern is expressed." (Dynamics of Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **covenant** challenged traditional confessional boundaries, urging theologians to see such formulations as living symbols rather than static doctrines. His existential and ontological approach influenced later **systematic theology** and interfaith dialogue, encouraging broader, more inclusive understandings of religious symbols. While his views diverged sharply from classic Reformed and Lutheran covenantal theology, Tillich’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to relate ancient confessions to contemporary existential questions.
