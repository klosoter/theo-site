### TITLE
Covenant in the Confessions: From Biblical Economy to Federal Dogmatics

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: how Reformed confessional standards give dogmatic form to the biblical covenants, especially the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, and thereby norm later covenant theology.
- Decisive figures: Heinrich Bullinger, John Calvin, Johannes Cocceius, Francis Turretin, Herman Witsius.
- Relevant traditions: classic Reformed confessionalism and **federal theology** in the Swiss, Dutch, English, and Scottish streams; Lutheran and Anabaptist alternatives as external contrasts; later Presbyterian debates about confessional subscription.
- Debates: internal Reformed disputes about the **covenant of works**, conditions in the covenant of grace, and the relation of covenant to election; external debates with Lutheran law–gospel, Anabaptist ecclesiology, and later Barthian and baptistic critiques; contemporary controversies over republication, monocovenantalism, and confessional revision.
- Defended position: the classic Reformed confessional formulations of a prelapsarian **covenant of works** and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace**, as codified in the Westminster Standards and cognate confessions, give the most coherent, biblically faithful, and ecclesially responsible articulation of biblical covenant theology and ought to be maintained with careful, historically sensitive exegesis.

### ESSAY
To speak of “confessional formulations of covenant” is to attend not merely to the presence of covenant language in Reformed symbols but to the way those symbols dogmatically stabilize a comprehensive **federal theology**. The confessions do not simply summarize exegesis of Genesis or Hebrews; they codify a particular construal of the entire history of special revelation and redemption as administered through distinct but organically related covenants. A candidate must therefore be able to show how covenant moved from a biblical term of redemptive economy to a structuring principle of Reformed theology, and how that move is crystallized in specific confessional formulations which then delimit legitimate doctrinal development.

At the conceptual center stands the distinction between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, together with the derivative notion of a **covenant of redemption**. Reformed confessions articulate these ideas in order to secure several doctrinal goods simultaneously: the integrity of prelapsarian law and human responsibility; the unity of the way of salvation in Christ across the testaments; the objectivity of the visible church and its administration of the means of grace; and the overarching trinitarian design of redemption. To defend the confessional formulations is to argue that these goods are best held together in precisely this federal shape.

Historically, the path from biblical covenant to confessional covenant runs through a small set of decisive figures. Heinrich Bullinger gives early programmatic emphasis to “one eternal covenant of grace” in his Decades and in the Second Helvetic Confession, stressing the unity of God’s saving dealing with his people. John Calvin, while not fully systematizing a two-covenant schema, nevertheless provides the exegetical and theological matrix out of which later federalism arises. Johannes Cocceius and Francis Turretin represent, in different idioms, the mature development of **federal theology** in the Dutch Reformed world, with Cocceius accenting historical progression of covenants and Turretin insisting on precise dogmatic definitions embedded in a scholastic system. Herman Witsius then functions as the synthesizer, consciously mediating between approaches and explicitly coordinating classic federal distinctions with confessional boundaries.

Bullinger must be treated first because he shows covenant entering Reformed confessional language in a way that is strongly unitive yet still relatively simple. In Zurich’s context of defending infant baptism and a robust view of the continuity of the church from Israel to the New Testament, he argues that there is fundamentally one **covenant of grace** under diverse economies. The Second Helvetic Confession states that all the faithful, from Abraham to the present, are under the one covenant, with Christ as the substance, and directly links this to the legitimacy of including children in the covenant community. Bullinger’s use of covenant is anti-Anabaptist and anti-Roman: against Rome, he insists on the sufficiency and finality of Christ as the only mediator of the one covenant; against Anabaptists, he grounds infant baptism and a mixed church in God’s covenant dealings with households in both testaments. Yet Bullinger does not sharply articulate a **covenant of works** distinct from the **covenant of grace**. For him, the accent falls overwhelmingly on soteriological and ecclesiological continuity. This sets up one of the central internal Reformed debates: whether the introduction of a prelapsarian covenant of works later is an enrichment of Bullinger’s impulse or a deviation from his more monocovenantal orientation.

Calvin occupies a more complex position. In the Institutes and commentaries, he firmly teaches the substantial unity of the covenant across the testaments, again with Christ as the center. Yet he also stresses that Adam, as created, owed God obedience unto life by virtue of the **law written on the heart** and by a positive probationary command. Calvin rarely calls this a covenant of works as later federal theologians would, but the structural elements are present: a divinely imposed arrangement with a condition of perfect obedience and a promise of eschatological confirmation. In this sense Calvin supplies the raw materials for later confessional articulation. Calvin’s insistence that the Mosaic law, read properly, is an administration of the **covenant of grace**, not a republication of a different covenant of works, will later be invoked against certain forms of “republication” exegesis. At the same time, his clear distinction between the law as covenant of life for the unfallen and the law as rule of gratitude for the redeemed will be harnessed by those who defend some kind of covenant-of-works category in the Mosaic economy.

Calvin’s confessional impact is indirect but decisive. The French and Genevan confessions reflect his focus on the unity of the covenant and his reading of the sacraments as covenantal seals. They do not, however, formally define a two-covenant schema with labels. That systematizing move belongs to the later, high Reformed confessionalism embodied in the Westminster Standards and related symbols. Examiners will press at this point: is the full **covenant of works / covenant of grace** schema “Calvin’s theology,” or is it later Protestant scholastic accretion? The best answer is to concede the historical development of terminology and precision, while arguing that the confessional formulations capture the deeper Calvinian commitments regarding prelapsarian obedience, federal headship, and the unity of salvation in Christ.

The decisive leap to explicitly confessionalized **federal theology** occurs in the seventeenth-century Reformed world, particularly in the Dutch and British contexts. Here Cocceius and Turretin, though never writing confessions themselves, supply the conceptual architecture later codified synodically.

Cocceius, operating in the context of Dutch debates over Sabbath, law, and redemptive history, develops a strongly historical and progressive account of covenant. In his major work, Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Dei, he depicts God’s relation to humanity as unfolding through successive covenants: first a **covenant of works** with Adam, then multiple administrations of the **covenant of grace** culminating in the new covenant. For Cocceius, the covenants correspond to real shifts in redemptive history, not merely different external forms of one underlying gracious covenant. He combines this with a supralapsarian ordering of the divine decrees and a strong emphasis on the eschatological movement from law to gospel. Internally, Cocceius’s views provoked opposition from those who feared he compromised the abiding moral law and shaded toward antinomianism. The Cocceian–Voetian controversy in the Netherlands thus embodies an internal Reformed debate about whether covenant formulations can emphasize historical progression without undermining the abiding validity of the Decalogue and the parity of salvation in all ages.

Turretin, by contrast, exemplifies the scholastic side of **federal theology**. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he devotes entire topics to the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace** and explicitly defends a distinct prelapsarian covenant made with Adam, with a condition of perfect obedience and a promise of life. He insists that this is not a covenant of grace but of law, though always under the overarching benevolence of God. The **covenant of grace**, in his account, is strictly postlapsarian, grounded in Christ as mediator, and administered through the means of grace in the church. Turretin’s method is elenctic and systematic: define precisely, distinguish conditions and properties, answer specific objections. Against the Socinians and Arminians he uses the **covenant of works** to secure the forensic nature of justification and the necessity of Christ’s active obedience. Against antinomians, he uses the same covenant to underscore the immutability of God’s moral law and the fact that Christ’s obedience does not annihilate but fulfills that original demand. Turretin does allow for the Mosaic economy to include a typological republication of the **covenant of works** in a subordinate sense, but he insists that, in substance, the Mosaic covenant is an administration of the **covenant of grace**. This balance will prove crucial to later debates over republication and legalism.

The Westminster Confession of Faith represents the most influential confessional crystallization of these developments. Chapter 7 begins from the distance between the infinite Creator and finite creatures and states that God’s voluntary condescension is expressed through **covenant**. It then immediately posits that the first covenant with man was a **covenant of works**, with life promised upon condition of perfect obedience. After the fall, God made a **covenant of grace**, wherein he freely offers sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring faith in him, and promising to give the Holy Spirit to the elect. This covenant is said to be one in substance but diversely administered under the law and under the gospel. The confession’s language about substance and administration reflects Bullinger’s and Calvin’s emphasis on unity, while its explicit two-covenant structure reflects Turretin’s and Cocceius’s mature **federal theology**. By lodging this schema in the church’s subordinate standards, Westminster makes these distinctions ecclesially normative.

Herman Witsius, writing slightly later in The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man, is self-conscious about the confessional boundaries. His project aims to harmonize the positions of Cocceius and Voetius and to demonstrate that a robust **covenant of works** and a carefully articulated **covenant of grace** are not mere scholastic curiosities but the very grammar of the gospel. Witsius devotes extensive discussion to the reality and nature of the prelapsarian covenant, defending it from the charge that it introduces merit into God’s relation with Adam. He carefully distinguishes between **condign merit**, which a creature can never have before God, and **covenant merit**, whereby God freely promises a reward to obedience in a sovereignly instituted covenant. In this sense, the “merit” of Adam and the “merit” of Christ are both covenantal, yet utterly distinct in value and ground. This careful conceptuality is often summoned in contemporary debates about “merit” and “works” language in the covenantal context.

Moreover, Witsius elaborates the notion of the **covenant of redemption** as an intra-trinitarian pact between the Father and the Son, in the Spirit, underlying the **covenant of grace** in history. Although not foregrounded in Westminster itself, this notion had permeated Reformed thought. Witsius argues that the **covenant of grace** in history is “the execution of the **covenant of redemption**,” thereby binding federal theology to **divine decree** and **trinitarian economy**. This linkage is crucial when examiners test whether your covenant theology is properly trinitarian and not merely a bilateral arrangement between God in general and man.

The internal debates within classic Reformed confessionalism revolve around how these covenants are related and how their conditions are formulated. One recurring question is whether the **covenant of grace** is unconditional in its essence or conditional in its administration. Westminster says that in it God freely offers salvation, requiring faith as the condition, and promising to give the Holy Spirit to all those who are ordained unto life, to make them willing and able to believe. The doctrine of election thus guarantees the infallible efficacy of the covenant promises, while the doctrine of the visible church insists on a mixed community in which some are externally in covenant but not elect. This produces an internal tension: are some truly in the **covenant of grace** yet finally lost, or are they only in an external administration? Turretin and Witsius both argue for a distinction between the internal, saving participation in the covenant and the external relation that nonetheless confers real, though non-saving, benefits. In defending the confessional formulations, it is key to affirm the real, objective inclusion of covenant children in the visible church and their genuine engagement with covenant promises and threats, while refusing to say that the decretally reprobate ever come into the **covenant of grace** in the same sense as the elect.

Another internal debate concerns the relation of covenant to election. Some, following Klaas Schilder and later Dutch streams, speak as though covenant is the primary framework and election is only one covenantal reality. Others, following Bavinck and the mainstream of Westminsterian theology, argue that election is logically prior and grounds the efficacy of the covenant. The confessional texts themselves, particularly Westminster, clearly integrate covenant under the broader decree: the **covenant of grace** is made with Christ as second Adam and in him with all the elect as his seed. My defended position is that this priority of election is not optional but is demanded by the coherence of the system and the texts’ own logic. It safeguards **divine sovereignty**, assures the efficacy of the means of grace, and underwrites assurance, while leaving fully intact the real covenant offers and obligations addressed to all in the visible church.

Externally, Reformed confessional formulations of covenant defined themselves over against Lutheran, Anabaptist, Roman Catholic and, in the twentieth century, Barthian and baptistic alternatives. Lutheran orthodoxy, with its strong **law–gospel** antithesis, generally resisted casting the prelapsarian arrangement as a covenant of works with a positive promise of eschatological life. Many Lutherans preferred to see the law as eternal and in some sense always accusing, while the gospel comes as a sheer promise apart from any covenantal structure of conditions and rewards. The Reformed insistence that Adam stood in a positive **covenant of works**, with a reward beyond mere natural life, allows them to articulate Christ’s active obedience as the fulfillment of precisely that covenant, something less prominent in Lutheran confessionalism. Against Reformed critics who allege that this introduces merit into prelapsarian Eden, one must again appeal to Witsius’s category of **covenant merit** and to Westminster’s own language that God “freely” entered into covenant, underscoring divine initiative and condescension.

Anabaptist and later baptistic traditions challenge the Reformed confessional link between covenant and a mixed, visible church. By insisting that only professing believers may be baptized and that the church should be as pure as possible, they reject the Reformed claim that covenant children are truly, though not savingly, in covenant. Here the confessional formulations of covenant do significant ecclesiological work. Westminster’s teaching that the **covenant of grace** was administered by promises, sacrifices, circumcision, and other ordinances under the law, and by the preaching of the word and sacraments under the gospel, directly grounds infant baptism in continuity with Abrahamic circumcision. The Reformed confessional stance is that to deny covenantal inclusion of children is to contradict the structural unity of the **covenant of grace** and to destabilize Christian nurture and assurance. Examiners will press whether this makes membership formalistic; the answer is that the confessions simultaneously stress the inward necessity of regeneration and faith, thus preserving the distinction between external administration and internal saving participation.

In the twentieth century, Karl Barth’s rejection of the **covenant of works** and reconfiguration of all covenant in Christ introduces a fresh external challenge. Barth insists that the God–man relation is from eternity a covenant of grace in Christ, rendering any prelapsarian covenant of works conceptually and theologically suspect. Modern “monocovenantal” Reformed voices sometimes echo this move, claiming that speaking of a covenant of works is inherently legalistic and undermines sola gratia. My defended position, following Turretin and Witsius and reading Westminster historically, is that removing the **covenant of works** obscures the legal ground of Christ’s obedience and satisfaction, blurs the antithesis between Adam and Christ in Romans 5, and tends toward a flattening of law and gospel in a way that the confessional standards explicitly avoid. The confessional two-covenant schema, rightly understood, actually protects grace by showing that the gospel does not relax the law’s demand but satisfies it in the obedient second Adam.

Contemporary internal debates, especially in conservative Presbyterian circles, have centered on “republication” and “merit” in the Mosaic covenant. Some argue that Westminster’s language allows, or even requires, seeing the Mosaic economy as a partial republication of the **covenant of works** for Israel as a typological son, particularly in relation to land tenure and national blessing. Others insist this endangers the unity of the **covenant of grace** and reintroduces works-righteousness. The confessional text states that the **covenant of grace** was “differently administered” under the law and under the gospel, and that under the law it was administered by promises, sacrifices and other ceremonies, all fore-signifying Christ. It does not explicitly call the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works. Under pressure, one should affirm that any use of “republication” must be subordinated to the clear confessional teaching that, as to substance, the Mosaic administration is of the **covenant of grace**. Within that framework, it is legitimate, following Turretin, to speak of a typological, national-layer “works principle” that governs Israel’s tenure in the land, provided one never confuses this with the way of personal justification before God. The confessional formulations, when read in their seventeenth-century context, comfortably allow this layered reading without betraying their core commitments.

Another contemporary debate concerns confessional subscription and development. Some argue that the specific formulations of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** in the Westminster Standards are historically conditioned and may be revised or minimized so long as one retains a general notion of covenant. I would argue the opposite: because the confessions consciously integrated **federal theology** into the very architecture of their soteriology, sacramentology, and ecclesiology, to abandon the two-covenant structure or the central features of its conditions is tantamount to revising the system of doctrine. There is room for further nuance in the details, especially regarding the Mosaic administration and the precise formulation of conditions, but the basic architecture of prelapsarian **covenant of works** and postlapsarian **covenant of grace**, undergirded by the **covenant of redemption**, must stand.

Finally, confessional formulations of covenant are not an isolated locus; they are integrally connected to adjacent doctrines. The **covenant of works** is logically tied to **anthropology** and **original righteousness**: Adam must be created in true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness for such a covenant to be meaningful. The **covenant of grace** is bound to **Christology** and **atonement**: Christ’s mediatorial offices and his active and passive obedience are intelligible as covenantal fulfillment of Adamic failure. The **covenant of redemption** reaches into **trinitarian theology** and **divine decree**, demanding that we think of intra-trinitarian relations and the pactum salutis in a manner consistent with **divine simplicity** and immutability. Examiners may object that covenant language introduced contingency or change into God; the reply must be that in classic Reformed thought, covenants are temporal expressions of the eternal decree, not new determinations in God. In this way, robust confessional formulations of covenant, far from threatening classical theism, exemplify how **analogical knowledge** allows us to speak truly of God’s covenant dealings without ascribing composition or change to the divine essence.

In sum, confessional formulations of covenant in the classic Reformed standards are not ad hoc add-ons but the ecclesially endorsed grammar of God’s relation to man, before and after the fall, in Christ, and through the church. Figures such as Bullinger, Calvin, Cocceius, Turretin, and Witsius show a trajectory from a simple emphasis on covenantal unity to a fully elaborated **federal theology** that is deeply integrated with Scripture and systematic loci. The internal debates refine rather than overthrow this structure; the external critiques, when evaluated carefully, tend to confirm the necessity of precisely the distinctions the confessions draw. To defend these formulations is to defend the Reformed system as a coherent whole: a God who, in sovereign freedom, stoops to enter into **covenant** with his image bearer; a first Adam who fails under a **covenant of works**; a second Adam who fulfills that covenant in a **covenant of redemption**; and a church that lives and worships under the **covenant of grace**, administered in word and sacrament until the consummation of the kingdom.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Confessional formulations of covenant are the ecclesially codified expressions of Reformed **federal theology**, especially the distinction and relation between the **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and often the **covenant of redemption**, structuring God’s dealings with humanity before and after the fall.
- Decisive figures: Bullinger stresses one **covenant of grace** and ecclesial continuity; Calvin supplies the exegetical and theological matrix for later federalism; Cocceius emphasizes redemptive-historical progression and multiple covenants; Turretin dogmatically defines distinct **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** within scholastic Reformed orthodoxy; Witsius synthesizes, clarifies merit and the **covenant of redemption**, and aligns covenant theology with confessional boundaries.
- Debates: Internally, disputes over the reality and nature of the **covenant of works**, conditions in the **covenant of grace**, relation of covenant to election, and the status of Mosaic “republication”; externally, contrasts with Lutheran law–gospel, Anabaptist and baptistic ecclesiology, Roman sacramentalism, and Barthian monocovenantalism; contemporarily, controversies about merit, republication, monocovenantal proposals, and the extent of allowed variation under confessional subscription.
- Defended position: The classic two-covenant structure, as codified especially in the Westminster Standards and related Reformed symbols, best preserves biblical teaching, doctrinal coherence, and ecclesial practice, and should be maintained with nuanced attention to historical intent and adjacent loci.
- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is the **covenant of works** a necessary doctrine or an optional model? It is necessary to the confessional system, grounding Adam–Christ parallelism, law–gospel distinction, and Christ’s active obedience.
  - How do you avoid making covenantal “merit” compromise sola gratia? By distinguishing **covenant merit** from condign merit and emphasizing that both Adam’s and Christ’s rewards are grounded in God’s free institution of covenant.
  - Does calling the Mosaic covenant an administration of the **covenant of grace** forbid any “republication” language? No, provided any works principle is typological and national, not soteriological, and subordinated to the gracious substance.
  - Are election or covenant structurally prior? Election is logically prior, grounding the efficacy of the **covenant of grace**, though covenant is the historical form in which election is realized.
  - How does the **covenant of redemption** fit with **divine simplicity**? It names the economic expression of the one, simple decree of the triune God, not a new contract between distinct wills in God.
