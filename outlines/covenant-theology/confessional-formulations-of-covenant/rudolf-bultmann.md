# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **covenant theology** through the lens of his existential and demythologizing project, emphasizing the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with God rather than traditional **confessional formulations**. He was critical of static doctrinal systems, viewing the **biblical covenant** not as a fixed legal arrangement but as an existential event in which the individual is called into authentic relationship with God through **faith**.

- "The Old Testament covenant is not a legal contract but a summons to decision." (History and Eschatology)

## Key Works

- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth, 1941)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologizing the Covenant**
   - The language of **covenant** in Scripture is mythological and must be interpreted existentially.
   - Traditional confessional categories obscure the existential call of the gospel.
   - The covenant is not a historical or legal arrangement but a summons to authentic existence.
   - The meaning of covenant is realized in the individual's response to the kerygma.
   - "Mythological conceptions must be interpreted so as to disclose their existential meaning." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Primacy of Kerygma over Confession**
   - The **kerygma** is the proclamation that confronts the hearer, not a doctrinal formula.
   - Confessional statements about the covenant are secondary to the existential encounter.
   - The church's task is to proclaim, not to systematize, the covenantal message.
   - Faith arises from hearing, not from assent to confessional formulations.
   - "The word of proclamation is the event in which God encounters man." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Faith**
   - Faith is a personal, existential response, not adherence to a covenantal system.
   - The covenant is fulfilled in the individual's decision for authentic existence before God.
   - The existential moment is more decisive than any confessional articulation.
   - The New Testament redefines covenant as a call to radical self-understanding.
   - "Faith is not assent to doctrines but an existential self-understanding." (Faith and Understanding)

4. **Critique of Legalistic and Historical Approaches**
   - Bultmann rejects the notion of covenant as a binding legal contract.
   - He is skeptical of attempts to anchor covenant theology in salvation history.
   - The focus is on the present encounter, not on past confessional developments.
   - Legal and historical categories are inadequate for expressing the gospel's existential claim.
   - "The real meaning of the covenant is not in the past but in the present encounter." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Covenant**
   - Christ is the decisive event in which the covenant is reinterpreted.
   - The New Testament presents Christ not as a new lawgiver but as the call to authentic existence.
   - Confessional formulations about Christ and covenant must be demythologized.
   - The covenant is realized where Christ is proclaimed and received in faith.
   - "In Christ, the promise of the covenant becomes the existential possibility for man." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of the **covenant** challenged traditional confessional approaches, shifting the focus from doctrinal formulations to the individual's encounter with the divine call. His work provoked significant debate within both Protestant and Reformed circles, especially regarding the authority of **confessional theology**. While often criticized by confessional theologians, Bultmann’s emphasis on the **kerygma** and existential decision continues to influence contemporary discussions on the nature of biblical covenants and the role of doctrine in the church.
