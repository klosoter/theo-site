# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s approach to **covenant theology** laid foundational groundwork for later **Reformed confessional formulations**. While Calvin did not systematize the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** in the manner of later confessions, he articulated a robust understanding of God’s relationship with humanity through **covenantal structure**, emphasizing the unity and continuity of the **Old and New Testaments** in the administration of grace.

- "All the covenants made with the patriarchs were so many renewals of the covenant made with Adam." (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 9–11)
- Commentary on Genesis
- Commentary on Romans
- Commentary on Hebrews
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, tr. Ford Lewis Battles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Calvin taught that the **substance** of the covenant is the same in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Emphasized that salvation has always been by **faith in Christ**, even before his incarnation.
    - Saw the differences between the covenants as matters of **administration**, not substance.
    - Asserted that the promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same: still the administration differs." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

2. **Covenant as the Framework for Redemptive History**
    - Viewed the covenant as the organizing principle of God’s dealings with humanity.
    - Interpreted biblical history through the lens of **covenantal progression**.
    - Understood the law and gospel as distinct yet related within the covenant.
    - Emphasized God’s faithfulness to his promises throughout redemptive history.
    - "The Lord has always covenanted with his servants in the same way, and by the same law." (Commentary on Genesis 17:7)

3. **Conditional and Unconditional Aspects**
    - Recognized both **unconditional** (God’s promise) and **conditional** (human response) elements in the covenant.
    - Stressed that the covenant is grounded in God’s sovereign grace, not human merit.
    - Saw obedience as the fruit, not the basis, of covenant participation.
    - Affirmed the necessity of faith and repentance as covenant responses.
    - "God, in making a covenant with us, does not bind us to himself by our own strength, but by his own grace." (Institutes, 2.5.15)

4. **Infant Inclusion in the Covenant**
    - Defended the inclusion of believers’ children in the covenant community.
    - Argued for **infant baptism** as the sign and seal of covenant membership.
    - Paralleled circumcision and baptism as covenant signs across the testaments.
    - Saw the church as the continuation of Israel in the covenant of grace.
    - "Children are baptized for this reason, that they may be engrafted into the body of the Church." (Institutes, 4.16.24)

5. **Christ as the Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Identified Christ as the fulfillment and mediator of all covenant promises.
    - Taught that all covenant blessings flow through union with Christ.
    - Emphasized Christ’s priestly and sacrificial work as central to the covenant.
    - Saw the sacraments as means by which Christ communicates covenant grace.
    - "Christ, therefore, is the pledge and foundation of the covenant." (Commentary on Hebrews 8:6)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **covenant theology** profoundly shaped later **Reformed confessions**, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism. His emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** provided a theological framework for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. While later Reformed theologians would develop more detailed distinctions (such as the **covenant of works**), Calvin’s insights remain foundational for confessional formulations of covenant in the Reformed tradition.
