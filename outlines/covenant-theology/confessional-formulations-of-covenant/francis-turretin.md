# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin provided a classic **Reformed scholastic** articulation of **covenant theology**, distinguishing sharply between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**. He emphasized the confessional necessity of these categories for understanding **federal headship**, the **imputation of righteousness**, and the structure of **redemptive history**. Turretin’s formulations became foundational for later **Reformed confessions** and systematic theology.

- "The covenant of grace is not a simple renewal of the covenant of works, but a new covenant, differing in substance as well as in mode." ("Institutes of Elenctic Theology")

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Synopsis of Purer Theology (as contributor)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as interpreter and defender)
- Selected Questions on the Covenant (various disputations within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Bicovenantal Structure: Works and Grace**
    - Asserts a real distinction between the **Covenant of Works** (pre-Fall) and the **Covenant of Grace** (post-Fall).
    - The **Covenant of Works** is based on law and perfect obedience, with Adam as federal head.
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is grounded in Christ’s mediation and received by faith.
    - This structure is essential for maintaining the integrity of **justification by faith alone**.
    - "The covenant of works was made with Adam and in him with all his posterity; the covenant of grace with Christ and in him with all the elect." (Institutes)

2. **Confessional Necessity of Covenant Theology**
    - Argues that **covenant theology** is not a speculative doctrine but essential to Reformed confessional identity.
    - The **Westminster Standards** and other confessions presuppose the bicovenantal framework.
    - Denies that the doctrine is a late innovation; roots it in Scripture and early Reformed tradition.
    - Insists that the church’s teaching office must uphold these distinctions for doctrinal clarity.
    - "The distinction of the covenants is not a mere scholastic subtlety, but a necessary truth for the church." (Institutes)

3. **Federal Headship and Imputation**
    - Adam and Christ serve as federal heads in their respective covenants.
    - Adam’s disobedience is imputed to his posterity; Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers.
    - This federal structure undergirds the doctrines of **original sin** and **justification**.
    - Rejects any confusion or mingling of the two covenants’ principles.
    - "As Adam’s sin is imputed to us in the covenant of works, so Christ’s righteousness is imputed in the covenant of grace." (Institutes)

4. **Unilateral and Conditional Aspects of the Covenants**
    - The **Covenant of Works** is strictly conditional: “do this and live.”
    - The **Covenant of Grace** is unconditional in its foundation (God’s promise) but conditional in its administration (faith as the instrument).
    - Emphasizes the monergistic character of grace while maintaining the necessity of faith.
    - This distinction preserves both divine sovereignty and human responsibility.
    - "The covenant of grace is unconditional as to its origin, but conditional as to its application." (Institutes)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
    - Affirms substantial continuity of the **Covenant of Grace** across Old and New Testaments.
    - Recognizes differences in administration (types, shadows vs. fulfillment in Christ).
    - Rejects the idea that the Mosaic covenant is a republication of the covenant of works in substance.
    - Stresses the unity of the people of God throughout redemptive history.
    - "The covenant of grace is one in substance, though various in its external administration." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous **covenant theology** shaped the confessional identity of later Reformed orthodoxy and provided a systematic foundation for the **Westminster Standards**. His careful distinctions between the **Covenant of Works** and **Covenant of Grace** became a touchstone for subsequent Reformed theologians and confessional documents. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of federal theology, justification, and the structure of redemptive history.
