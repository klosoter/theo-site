### ESSAY
Confessional formulations of the covenant are not loose summaries but doctrinal load-bearing joints that secure the unity of Scripture, the coherence of **federal headship**, and the ordered place of church and sacraments in the ordo and historia salutis. To say covenant in the Reformed confessions is to name a divine mode of condescension and communion in which God, without compromising **divine simplicity** or immutability, binds himself by promise and oath to communicate life to his image-bearers through a representative order. In the Westminster Standards, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the broader confessional family, covenant furnishes the grammar for creation and redemption, for Adam and Christ, for law and gospel, and for visible and invisible church. The issue is whether these confessions truly cohere around a stable **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** with a substantive unity under diverse administrations, and how they handle the Mosaic law. I will argue that the confessional core is resilient, that its bi-covenantal structure is exegetically and theologically necessary, and that later attempts to dissolve it either misread the confessions or smuggle in alternative anthropologies that unsettle the gospel.

Heinrich Bullinger set the trajectory. In De testamento seu foedere Dei unico et aeterno and the Second Helvetic Confession, Bullinger framed the biblical canon as the unfolding of one eternal covenant, emphasizing the unity of divine promise to the patriarchs and its fulfillment in Christ. His method was humanist, textually driven, and covenantally integrative, reading the whole Bible as a single economy of promise with Christ as its heart. He did not articulate a fully formed prelapsarian **covenant of works**, but he did supply the central intuitions that later became confessional: that covenant denotes God’s self-obligating condescension to give life, that Abrahamic promises regulate the people of God, and that sacraments are covenantal signs and seals. In Second Helvetic, baptism and the Lord’s Supper are construed through covenantal union and promise, which grounds a robust though not automatic **sacramental efficacy**. Bullinger thus reframed soteriology and ecclesiology around covenant rather than the medieval ordo of infused habits, preparing the ground for federal categories in public confession.

Caspar Olevianus gave those categories their evangelical precision. Situated in the crucible of Reformation consolidation in the Palatinate and co-architect of the Heidelberg Catechism, Olevianus’s De substantia foederis gratiae inter Deum et electos supplied the distinction between the substance of the **covenant of grace** and its historical administration. The substance is union with Christ and the promise of God to be our God in Christ; the administrations are the diverse rites and economies through which that one substance is conveyed before and after Christ. This is the confessional key to avoiding both antinomian discontinuity and legalistic conflation. Heidelberg’s pastoral catechesis breathes this air. The comfort of belonging to Christ, justification by faith alone, and the place of the law in gratitude presuppose **federal headship** and a covenantal frame in which the moral law is a stable expression of God’s righteous will, tied to creation and renewed in Christ, while the ceremonial and judicial laws are typological administrations. Olevianus’s method is both biblical-theological and dogmatic, holding a real ontological unity in Christ while discerning historical diversity. He shaped the confessional idiom that would later be expanded by the Westminster divines: substance and administration, promissory core and pedagogical or typological scaffolding. Without Olevianus’s conceptual articulation, the classic confessional claim that the covenant of grace was “differently administered” before and after Christ would lack clarity.

The Westminster Assembly pressed these lines into normative form, and among its covenant theologians, Anthony Burgess is a decisive witness. A commissioner at Westminster and author of Vindiciae foederis, Burgess labored to define the **covenant of works** with Adam, the **covenant of grace** postlapsum, and the covenantal shape of justification and sanctification. His historical context was ecclesio-political crisis and a confessional mandate to settle Church of England doctrine. Burgess’s method was scholastic-cum-exegetical, a close handling of Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 to ground **federal headship** and imputation, and a detailed engagement with the Mosaic economy’s place under grace. The Westminster Confession of Faith codifies this in chapter 7: a prelapsarian covenant of life upon condition of perfect obedience, and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** freely offered through Christ, administered under law and gospel with the same substance but different administration. WCF 19 expounds the threefold division of law, tying the moral law to creation and the civil and ceremonial to the typological administration of Israel. Together, these statements place covenant at the center of Reformed dogmatics, grounding justification in the active and passive obedience of Christ as the second Adam and ordering ecclesiology through the doctrine of the covenants. Burgess’s own role in debates about conditions, assurance, and sacramental sealing reinforced the confessional teaching that faith is the alone instrument of justification and that sacraments are seals of the covenant, not conferrals of grace ex opere operato. When Westminster asserts that the sacraments “exhibit” what they signify to believers, it means to tie **sacramental efficacy** to the **covenant of grace** and the Spirit’s sovereign use of appointed means, guarding both divine freedom and ecclesial concreteness. Burgess helped calibrate that language.

Johannes Cocceius disrupted the field and forced clarifications. In Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Dei, Cocceius placed covenant at the center of dogmatics with a maximalist biblical-theological impulse. He affirmed a prelapsarian covenant, a **pactum salutis**, and divine condescension, yet innovated by reading the Mosaic economy as a distinct covenant marked by a pronounced legal character, with temporal sabbath and other commands as covenantal stipulations that expired in the new covenant. His temporalization of covenant history and his controversial handling of the Decalogue rejuvenated debates about law, gospel, and sabbath. Though not a confessional drafter, Cocceius’s alternative construal pressed the confessional world to define how the Mosaic relates to the **covenant of grace** without collapsing into legalism or novelty. Lutheran critics had long resisted a prelapsarian covenant and read Mosaic law simply as law, but Cocceius’s version threatened the Reformed internal balance by making elements of the moral law seem covenantally temporary. His presence in the story is decisive because he catalyzed the internal debate over **republication**, Sabbath, and the unity of the moral law, a debate that Westminster had implicitly settled by its threefold division and by identifying the Mosaic as an administration of the covenant of grace while allowing a pedagogical use of law.

Herman Witsius mediated and consolidated. In De oeconomia foederum Dei cum hominibus, Witsius explicitly sought to reconcile the Cocceian and Voetian parties by returning to Scripture and early Reformed consensus. His historical context was a fracturing Dutch Reformed church and a need for a catholic Reformed synthesis. Methodologically, Witsius is archetypal Reformed scholasticism in service of biblical unity. He affirms the **pactum salutis** as the eternal ground of the **covenant of grace**, the **covenant of works** with Adam as the creational foundation for **federal headship**, and the substance-administration structure that Olevianus gave the tradition. On the Mosaic economy, Witsius acknowledges a kind of **republication** of the covenant of works, not as a dialectical rival covenant running alongside grace, but as a pedagogical restatement of the original demand for perfect righteousness, given to drive Israel to Christ and to frame the typological national life. He insists that morally the Decalogue is perpetual because it expresses the Creator’s will, and that covenantally Israel was under grace through promises and sacrifices that prefigured the Lamb. Witsius thereby secures the integrity of Westminster’s WCF 7 and 19 and clarifies how the Decalogue’s covenantal inscription does not relativize its moral universality. His mediating role created a durable grammar that allowed confessional churches to embrace biblical theologies of promise and fulfillment without surrendering the dogmatic anchors of the Standards.

Francis Turretin provides the elenctic backbone for this entire confessional complex. In the Institutio theologiae elencticae, Turretin argues polemically for the **covenant of works** as a creational arrangement promising eschatological life upon perfect obedience, proven by Adamic federal representation in Romans 5 and by the covenantal language of Hosea 6.7. He defends the **pactum salutis** as the trinitarian ground for redemption, locating Christ’s obedience in the economy of the intratrinitarian counsel, all without jeopardizing **divine simplicity** by insisting on the distinction between immanent and economic acts according to **analogical knowledge**. He articulates the instrumentality of faith and resolves the conditionality language of the **covenant of grace** by distinguishing between the stipulations that define covenantal form and the meritorious ground that lies exclusively in Christ. Hence Turretin can say the covenant is gratuitous in cause and conditional in mode, with Spirit-wrought faith and repentance as appointed means, thereby upholding both sovereign grace and real human response. On the Mosaic economy, Turretin aligns with WCF 19, insisting the moral law is natural and perpetual, that the ceremonial and civil laws expired, and that any **republication** is pedagogical, not soteriological.

With these figures, the confessional trajectory becomes visible. Its core is the bi-covenantal structure, Adam under **covenant of works**, Christ under the **pactum salutis** fulfilling the covenant of works for the elect, and believers gathered into the **covenant of grace** by faith. The visible church is the covenant community under promise and command, its sacraments covenantal means, and its discipline a covenantal guard. This structure orders the loci. Anthropology is covenantal because man is created for communion and probation under a divine promise. Christology is federal because Christ’s priestly obedience and penal satisfaction are covenantal fulfillments. Soteriology is covenantal because justification, adoption, and sanctification are entries into and fruits of the covenant. Ecclesiology and sacraments are covenantal because the church is the house of the covenant and the signs and seals exhibit covenant benefits to believers. Even theology proper is implicated, since divine condescension is not a change in God but an economic determination of the simple triune God to bind himself by oath according to his freely willed counsel.

The internal debates inside this tradition revolve around three pressure points. First, the status of the **pactum salutis**. Some seventeenth-century authors feared reifying intra-trinitarian relations or multiplying covenants. Yet the confessional logic depends on it to ground the mediator’s suretyship and to account for the unity of divine will in the work of redemption. The right answer, following Turretin and Witsius, is to confess the **pactum salutis** as an economic designation of the eternal counsel, preserving **divine simplicity** while securing the covenantal texture of Christ’s mission. Examiner’s challenge: does this not threaten tritheism? Response: no, because we speak analogically of a counsel and covenant in the one will of God determined according to personal modes of subsistence, not as a contract between separate centers of will.

Second, the Mosaic economy and **republication**. Some fear that admitting any republication introduces a legal principle into the **covenant of grace**. The confessional solution, already embedded in WCF 7 and 19 and made explicit by Witsius and Turretin, is a duplex reality. The Mosaic administration is an administration of the covenant of grace in substance, because Christ is promised and offered in types and shadows. Yet the Decalogue also republishes the creational demand for perfect righteousness, both to expose sin and to norm civil society under Israel’s theocracy. This is not a co-principle of life competing with Christ but the pedagogy that makes the promise necessary and sweet. Examiner’s challenge: prove this from the Standards. Response: WCF 19.1 ties the moral law to creation, and 19.6 explains its uses to regenerate and unregenerate alike, while WCF 7.5 affirms that the covenant of grace was administered under the law, demonstrating both unity of substance and distinct administrative form.

Third, conditionality language within the **covenant of grace**. Reformed confessions sometimes speak conditionally about faith and perseverance. The internal debate is whether this undermines sola gratia. The confessional way again is to distinguish merit from means, ground from mode. Faith is an instrument given by the Spirit and thus not a meritorious condition but an appointed way to receive Christ. Perseverance is promised in the covenant and secured by Christ’s priestly intercession. Covenant threats function as real means to preserve the saints within the covenant. Examiner’s challenge: how does this differ from Arminian conditional election? Response: in the confessional covenant, the condition is itself graciously given and infallibly wrought by the Spirit according to unconditional election, and the covenant’s efficacy is monergistic in cause though synergistic in expression, keeping grace as the sole ground.

External debates sharpen the confessional distinctives. Lutheran theology generally rejects a prelapsarian **covenant of works** and reads Romans 5 as dealing with law only after the fall. The confessional Reformed reply is exegetical and structural. Romans 5 links condemnation and life to representation in Adam and Christ, not to the postlapsarian giving of law alone. The covenant with Adam need not be explicitly named in Genesis to be present conceptually, as Hosea 6.7 and the promise of life contingent on obedience imply. Moreover, the **federal headship** necessary for imputation requires a prelapsarian probation. Roman Catholic sacramentalism also presses the confessional account, especially on **sacramental efficacy** and the relation of nature and grace. Trent’s framework makes sacraments causes of grace proportionate to infused habits. Reformed confessions instead tie efficacy to the covenant promise and to the Spirit’s sovereign action through signs as instruments. This guards both ecclesial concreteness and divine freedom, and it forestalls sacramental ex opere operato while avoiding empty memorialism. Socinian and Arminian theologies question both the **covenant of works** and penal substitution. The confessional answer, again with Turretin’s elenctic rigor, is that without a creational covenant of life there is no conceptual or exegetical place for Christ’s active obedience, and without penal satisfaction the covenant promise cannot be justly secured. Barth’s twentieth-century recasting of covenant as the inner being of God and election in Christ as the determination of all humanity threatens to dissolve the **substance-administration distinction** and to flatten redemptive history. The confessional response is to preserve the Creator-creature distinction and to insist that biblical covenants are divine acts in history grounded in eternal counsel, not eternalized as God’s essence. Otherwise we lose the historicity of Christ and the concrete economy of promise and fulfillment.

Contemporary debates often return to seventeenth-century questions with new labels. Federal Vision asserts covenant objectivity in a way that confuses the **visible-invisible church** distinction and sometimes collapses justifying faith into covenantal faithfulness. Confessional formulations protect the gospel by distinguishing external covenant membership, which confers real privileges, from internal saving union with Christ, which is the fruit of election and effectual calling. The confessions’ precise handling of faith as instrument and their articulation of perseverance and assurance safeguard both covenant seriousness and justification by faith alone. New Covenant Theology and progressive covenantalism reject infant inclusion and the law’s threefold division, and some adopt a monocovenantal scheme where the new covenant is radically discontinuous with Abrahamic and Mosaic economies. The classic confessional answer points to the **substance-administration distinction**, to Paul’s argument that Gentile believers are grafted into Abraham’s tree, and to the moral law as creational. The inclusion of children in the covenant and thus in baptism is not an inference from continuity alone but an implication of the one covenant substance across administrations, as Heidelberg 74 and WCF 28 make clear. 1689 Federalism, a Baptist retrieval, argues that the new covenant alone is the covenant of grace, while Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants typify it without conferring covenant membership of the same order. While coherent for their ecclesiology, this departs from the confessional Reformed claim that the covenant of grace was truly administered before Christ, with real salvific participation in Christ before the new covenant, though under shadows. The confessional position preserves the continuity of salvation and the public character of the covenantal people without denying the real newness of the new covenant, namely, a clearer administration with greater effusion of the Spirit and the removal of shadows.

Objections that the **covenant of works** is a scholastic imposition on Scripture misread both exegesis and confession. Genesis 2 gives a probationary command under a life-death sanction, Romans 5 treats Adam and Christ as covenant representatives, and Hosea 6.7 names Adam’s transgression in covenantal terms. Confessions use this not to invent a legalistic backdrop but to honor the Creator’s goodness in offering eschatological life to Adam by means of obedience suited to his created righteousness. The fear that this threatens grace is misplaced. Grace in Scripture is redemptive favor to the undeserving, and it presupposes the goodness of prelapsarian nature. Confessional federalism honors both. Another objection targets the **substance-administration distinction** as an artificial tool to paper over differences in biblical covenants. Yet this distinction is simply a way to say what Hebrews says, that the new covenant brings a better hope, better promises, and a better priest, while Abraham believed in Christ before he saw him and received righteousness by faith. The confessions secure both unity and progress without about-face contradictions.

Tie these confessional formulations to adjacent loci and the power of the architecture becomes evident. In theology proper, covenant is an economic determination of the one simple God to relate to creatures by oath. This is not a partition in God but a free decision of the triune Lord. In Christology, **pactum salutis** underwrites the office of the mediator as surety who fulfills the **covenant of works** on behalf of his people and seals the **covenant of grace** in his blood. In soteriology, **federal headship** grounds imputation, and **law-gospel** clarity guards justification while the third use of the law orders sanctification. In ecclesiology, the church is a covenant people with real boundaries, where the **visible-invisible church** distinction sustains both catholic openness and evangelical seriousness. In sacramentology, baptism and the Supper are covenant signs and seals that exhibit and confer Christ by the Spirit to believers according to the promise. Even ethics is colored by covenant, since moral normativity is rooted in creation and renewed in Christ as covenant Lord.

The position, then, is clear. The classic confessional bi-covenantal schema is not an optional school but the doctrinal backbone of Reformed catholicity. Figures like Bullinger, Olevianus, Burgess, Witsius, and Turretin established and defended this architecture, while Cocceius’s provocation helped sharpen it. Internal debates about **republication**, conditionality, and the **pactum salutis** are resolved by the confessional equilibrium of substance and administration, of moral law’s permanence, and of faith’s instrumentality. External alternatives from Lutheranism, Roman Catholicism, Socinianism, Arminianism, and Barthian recastings either flatten covenant history or confuse grace and nature. Contemporary proposals that deny infant inclusion or the law’s abiding norm misread the confessions and erode the fabric that guards the gospel and the church’s life. Examiners should press candidates on precise confessional texts and their biblical warrants. The Standards teach a **covenant of works** with Adam, a **covenant of grace** administered under law and gospel, a perpetual moral law, and sacraments as covenantal means. These are not antiquarian formulas but the grammar of the gospel’s economy. To confess them is to confess how the triune God has bound himself to us in Christ and how he binds us to himself by promise, sign, and Spirit.

- Likely examiner questions:
  - Where do the Standards teach a covenant of works? WCF 7.2, WLC on Adam’s probation, supported by Romans 5 and Hosea 6.7.
  - How is Mosaic republication compatible with grace? It is pedagogical and typological, not a parallel principle of life; WCF 19.1–7.
  - Does the pactum salutis divide the divine will? No, it names the one simple will’s economic determination ad extra according to personal modes.
  - Why baptize infants under the covenant of grace? One substance across administrations with children included, Heidelberg 74, WCF 28.
  - Is faith a condition that compromises grace? Faith is an instrument given by the Spirit, not meritorious; WCF 11, Turretin’s cause-mode distinction.
