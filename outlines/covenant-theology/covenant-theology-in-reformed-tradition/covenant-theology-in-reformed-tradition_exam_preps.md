### TITLE
Covenant as the Architectonic Principle of Reformed Theology: Unity of the One Covenant of Grace in a Dispensational Age

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether **covenant** is merely one soteriological motif or the architectonic framework that orders Reformed doctrine of God, Christ, law–gospel, church, and sacraments.
- Decisive figures: Heinrich Bullinger, Johannes Cocceius, Herman Witsius, Geerhardus Vos, Louis Berkhof, Meredith G. Kline.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed confessional and scholastic **federal theology**, post-Reformation developments in continental and British Reformed thought, modern Reformed biblical theology, and the external foil of classic and progressive dispensationalism.
- Debates: Internal Reformed debates about **covenant of works**, republication, conditionality, monocovenantalism, and the status of infants; external debates with dispensationalism, Lutheran law–gospel formulations, and Roman Catholic sacramental systems; contemporary disputes over biblical theology, new covenant theology, and cultural–political applications of covenant.
- Defended position: Classic confessional **covenant theology** of the Westminster Standards and Three Forms of Unity, with a real prelapsarian covenant of works, a single, historically multiform covenant of grace administered through Old and New Testaments, and a properly eschatological, Christocentric structure that preserves both forensic justification and the organic unity of Scripture.

### ESSAY
Covenant theology in the Reformed tradition is not a detachable piece of soteriology but the architectonic framework by which Scripture’s redemptive history is ordered under Christ as federal head. At its core, Reformed **federal theology** claims that the triune God administers his one decree through covenants, that Adam and Christ stand as representative heads under distinct covenants, and that the unity of Scripture is the unity of the **covenant of grace** in diverse administrations. An examiner will press whether this is simply a system imposed on Scripture or the grammar Scripture itself supplies. The defensible position is that classic Reformed **covenant theology**, as codified in the Westminster Standards and elaborated by key figures like Witsius, Vos, Berkhof, and Kline, is exegetically warranted, dogmatically coherent with **divine simplicity** and **God’s decree**, and superior to its rivals in handling both continuity and discontinuity across the canon.

Historically, covenant theology did not begin as a highly technical schema but as a biblical-pastoral insight. Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich supplies the early conceptual pivot. In his De testamento seu foedere Dei unico et aeterno (1534), Bullinger argues for one eternal testament or covenant, focusing on the unity of God’s gracious dealing with his people. His context is early Reformation polemic against Anabaptists and Roman Catholic sacramentalism. Where Rome multiplies mediating structures of grace and Anabaptists fracture visible continuity, Bullinger insists that God’s **covenant of grace** undergirds both the unity of faith and the legitimacy of the visible church across the ages. Methodologically, Bullinger is not yet a scholastic federalist; he reasons from broad biblical patterns and covenant terminology rather than from a fully worked-out prelapsarian **covenant of works**. Yet he decisively centers the notion of a singular, eternal covenant fulfilled in Christ and manifested in history through successive administrations, stressing that the church of the Old Testament and the New share the same **federal head** and the same righteousness of faith, though under different outward forms.

Bullinger’s contribution raises an examiner’s first objection: If there is one eternal covenant, does that risk flattening redemptive history into a monotone, or even collapsing the distinction between law and gospel? Bullinger’s own formulations are at times more unitive than later Reformed precision would allow, but his insistence on one **covenant of grace** does not eliminate historical progress. Instead, it provides a polemical backbone against both radical discontinuity and sacramental re-sacrificing. Later developments will refine this unitive impulse by distinguishing covenants without surrendering the overarching unity Bullinger saw.

The decisive crystallization of a prelapsarian **covenant of works** and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** occurs in the high orthodox period. Here we must turn to Johannes Cocceius, who, though controversial, is unavoidable. Cocceius, working in the seventeenth century Dutch context, synthesizes humanist philology, Reformed scholasticism, and a high view of biblical history. His Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Dei (1648) arranges theology explicitly along the lines of the covenants. He sharply distinguishes the **covenant of works** made with Adam before the fall, characterized by promise of life upon perfect, personal, perpetual obedience, from the **covenant of grace** administered after the fall through Christ. Cocceius is methodologically historical; he treats theology as a history of God’s covenants rather than a purely topical system. This emphasis anticipates later biblical theology and makes him seminal for Vos.

However, Cocceius’ historical method leads some contemporaries to accuse him of undermining the immutability of God’s law and diminishing the place of the moral law in the life of the believer. Internal Reformed debate flares between Cocceians and Voetians, especially over the abrogation of the covenant of works and the Sabbath. A Westminster-style examiner will press: does Cocceius’ approach threaten the **law–gospel** distinction or the abiding validity of the moral law? A careful appropriation answers no, so long as one preserves the trans-covenantal character of the moral law as an expression of **God’s immutable character**, while recognizing that the formal covenantal situation under which that law confronts man changes from Adam under the **covenant of works** to sinners under the **covenant of grace** where Christ fulfills the works principle.

If Cocceius represents the dynamic, history-oriented trajectory, Herman Witsius embodies synthetic balance. His Economy of the Covenants between God and Man (1677) remains the most comprehensive classical statement of **federal theology**. Witsius combines exegesis, dogmatics, and polemics against both Arminianism and Socinianism. His context is post-Synod of Dort Reformed orthodoxy, and his method is to mediate between the Cocceian and Voetian parties. Witsius carefully defines the **covenant of works**, grounding it in passages like Hosea 6:7, Romans 5, and 1 Corinthians 15, and stresses that Adam’s probation under a legal covenant is not contrary to grace understood as unmerited condescension but distinct from the redemptive grace of Christ. He likewise elaborates the **covenant of grace** as one in substance and diverse in administration, arguing that the Old and New Testament churches share Christ as mediator and the same saving benefits, while differing in clarity, outward ordinances, and degree of spiritual liberty.

A likely objection arises here: is the **covenant of works** a speculative construct lacking explicit biblical terminology, and does speaking of “merit” or “reward” for Adam compromise the Creator–creature distinction? Witsius answers that the term may be extra-biblical but the concept is biblical and necessary to do justice to Paul’s two-Adam theology in Romans 5. The merit is not condign but covenantal: God in gracious condescension promises eschatological life to Adam upon perfect obedience. This is not God paying a debt to Adam’s autonomous worth, but God binding himself by **covenant** to reward the obedience he both commands and enables in an unfallen image-bearer. Properly qualified, this preserves **divine aseity** and the Creator–creature distinction while explaining how Christ, as second Adam, merits life for his people by fulfilling the same works principle under the **covenant of grace** in its redemptive-historical form.

Witsius also addresses the internal Reformed debate concerning conditionality. Is the **covenant of grace** conditional or unconditional? Against antinomian tendencies, he affirms a real conditionality with respect to the reception of benefits, yet maintains an absolute, unilateral divine foundation. Faith is a condition in the sense of an instrument, not a contribution. The condition is itself a gift of the covenant. This balances the forensic clarity of justification by faith alone with the robust doctrine of **union with Christ** and the necessity of sanctification, guarding against both legalism and cheap grace.

Moving into the modern period, Geerhardus Vos reframes covenant theology within the emerging discipline of biblical theology, while remaining fully confessional. Teaching at Princeton and then Westminster from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, Vos contends that **covenant** is the structural form of God’s self-revelation in history. In works like Biblical Theology and his Reformed Dogmatics, he presents the **covenant of works** not as an arbitrary Reformed invention but as the eschatological horizon of created humanity. Eschatology, for Vos, is not an afterthought but embedded in protology: Adam is created in a state of “posse non peccare” with the possibility of advancement to confirmed life through covenantal obedience. The loss of this original covenant context distorts not only soteriology but anthropology and Christology. Christ’s active obedience must be seen as fulfilling the broken **covenant of works**, securing the consummate kingdom promised to Adam.

Vos also recalibrates the unity and diversity of the **covenant of grace** by embedding it in an unfolding **history of special revelation**. Rather than reading covenant simply as a static legal arrangement, he emphasizes its organic development from promise to fulfillment, with key epochs at Abraham, Sinai, David, and the new covenant in Christ. This strengthens classic Reformed affirmation that the church of all ages is one, while allowing for real redemptive-historical progression. It places Vos in direct conflict with dispensationalism, which insists on multiple divine economies with relatively sharp discontinuities in law, people of God, and kingdom program.

Examining the external debate with dispensationalism is vital, because it is here that the architectonic claims of Reformed **covenant theology** are most tested. Classic dispensationalism divides history into successive dispensations with differing tests of obedience, often relativizes the moral law to the Mosaic economy, and posits a basic distinction between Israel and the church, with Israel’s promises earthly and the church’s heavenly. From a covenantal standpoint, this fractures Paul’s one olive tree, undercuts the unity of the **covenant of grace**, and endangers the doctrine of justification by implying varied saving arrangements. Moreover, it tends to treat covenants as discrete administrative blueprints rather than as organically related administrations of one gospel in Christ. Vos’s eschatological reading of the Abrahamic covenant, promise of land as type of consummate new creation, and identification of Christ as the seed in whom all nations are blessed, offers a more coherent synthesis of Old and New Testaments. It preserves both the concrete historical particularity of Israel’s role and the universal scope of the gospel.

Louis Berkhof stands as a systematic consolidator of the Reformed covenant tradition in the twentieth century. His Systematic Theology is often the first sustained encounter seminarians have with **federal theology**. Berkhof defines **covenant** as a legal agreement established by God with man, distinguishing sharply between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, and connecting them to the pactum salutis, the **covenant of redemption** within the Trinity’s decree, wherein the Father gives the Son a people and the Son undertakes to redeem them. Berkhof’s value is his clarity: Adam is under a **works principle**, Christ recapitulates and fulfills it, and believers receive the reward of Christ’s obedience in justification.

Critics today sometimes charge Berkhof with overly static categories and insufficient attention to redemptive history. This raises an internal question: can a classical federal schema, represented by Berkhof, coexist with the dynamic emphases of Vos and Kline, or must one choose between “systematic” and “biblical” theology? A defensible Reformed position refuses this forced choice. The eschatological-dynamic insights of Vos refine, rather than overthrow, the older confessional structure codified in Berkhof. The **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and **covenant of redemption** remain the dogmatic skeleton; biblical theology traces the living musculature of their historical outworking.

Meredith G. Kline, building self-consciously on Vos, represents perhaps the most creative and controversial modern development of Reformed covenant theology. Trained in the ancient Near Eastern backgrounds of Scripture and teaching at Westminster and elsewhere in the mid to late twentieth century, Kline argues that divine covenants are “suzerain-vassal treaties” with oath, sanctions, and often a **works principle** embedded in their very structure. In By Oath Consigned, Treaty of the Great King, and Kingdom Prologue, Kline insists that the prelapsarian **covenant of works** is foundational, and he identifies a republication of that works principle in the Mosaic covenant at Sinai. Not that Israel’s covenant is a pure legal covenant of works for eternal life, but that at the typological level of land tenure and theocracy, Israel’s enjoyment of the promised land is conditioned upon national obedience. This republication serves a pedagogical function, recapitulating Adam’s probation in a typological theater, driving Israel to Christ and prefiguring the exile of the second Adam on the cross.

Kline thus intensifies both the works-character of Adam’s covenant and the typological-works character of the Mosaic economy, provoking a major internal Reformed debate over republication. Critics fear that such an emphasis risks bifurcating the law and gospel at Sinai or undermining the unity of the **covenant of grace**. A Westminster examiner will likely probe: is the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works or of grace? How does one maintain the one **covenant of grace** while speaking of a republished works principle?

A coherent response, drawing on Kline rightly, is that Sinai is an administration of the **covenant of grace** in its soteriological essence, because Christ is the ultimate mediator of its saving benefits, accessed by faith alone. Yet, within that gracious administration, there is a layered structure: at the typological level of Israel as a theocratic nation, the land promises operate according to a works principle mirroring Adam’s probation; at the personal salvific level, believing Israelites are saved by grace through faith in the coming Christ. Kline’s insight helps explain the conditional land sanctions, exile, and restoration without collapsing justification into a works covenant. It clarifies Romans 5 and Galatians 3–4, where Paul can speak both of Sinai as giving the law that condemns and of Abraham as the paradigm of faith under the **covenant of grace**.

These historical and conceptual developments set the stage for three categories of debate.

Internally, Reformed theology wrestles with monocovenantalism versus bicovenantalism, with the status of the **covenant of works**, and with how conditions relate to grace. Some today, reacting against perceived legalism, deny the **covenant of works**, speaking instead of a single gracious covenantal relationship before and after the fall. This threatens to dull the Adam–Christ parallel of Romans 5 and to obscure the imputation of Christ’s active obedience. If Adam was under grace in the same redemptive sense as fallen sinners, then Christ’s work becomes something less than the decisive fulfillment of a broken covenant. Defending the classic bicovenantal distinction safeguards both the gratuity of postlapsarian grace and the objective, federal nature of Christ’s obedience. The **covenant of works** is not a rival to grace but the backdrop that makes saving grace what it is: God’s favor shown to the ill-deserving on the basis of another’s obedience.

Another internal debate concerns the status of children in the **covenant of grace** and the nature of covenant membership. Reformed confessions, influenced by Bullinger and Witsius, maintain that the visible church contains both elect and non-elect members, that baptism signifies and seals union with Christ to believers and their children, and that covenant promises are real though not automatically saving. Contemporary pressures, especially from baptistic and “new covenant theology” perspectives, have pushed some Reformed voices to flatten visible–invisible distinctions and to treat covenant membership as coextensive with regeneration. This muddies assurance and destabilizes ecclesiology. The classic Reformed position, that the **covenant of grace** is administered in a mixed community where covenant can be broken externally though God’s decree remains infallible, better reflects both Old Testament Israel and New Testament warnings. It preserves the reality of apostasy at the level of administration without contradicting **perseverance of the saints** at the level of decree and effectual calling.

Externally, as noted, dispensationalism contests Reformed claims about the unity and structure of the covenant. Progressive dispensationalists have moved closer to Reformed insights, affirming more continuity and seeing Christ as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises, yet many still maintain a permanent distinction between Israel and the church and a future nationalistic fulfillment of land promises. A covenantal response insists that all covenant promises are yes and amen in Christ, that the land functions as type of new creation, and that the church, Jew and Gentile united in one body, is the eschatological Israel of God. This is not supersessionism in a crude sense but Christocentric fulfillment: ethnic Israel is not discarded but invited into its own Messiah, and future ingathering of Jews occurs by incorporation into the same **covenant of grace**.

Roman Catholic theology offers another external contrast. Though it speaks of “covenant” more in the wake of Vatican II, the underlying structure remains sacramental and ecclesiocentric in a different way. Grace is mediated ex opere operato by the church’s sacramental system, and the line between law and gospel is less sharply drawn. The Reformed insistence that covenants are historically unfolding, promissory–legal structures centering on Christ’s federal obedience provides a more adequate account of why sacraments are signs and seals of a prior **covenant of grace**, not channels that create grace de novo. It also preserves the uniquely forensic character of justification over against any intrinsicist blurring of faith and charity.

Contemporary debates include not only the republication controversy but also questions about political theology and cultural engagement. Some seek to wield “covenant” to ground a neo-Christendom or Christian nationalism, appealing to biblical covenants with nations as models for modern states. A confessional Reformed response must distinguish clearly between the unique, unrepeatable theocratic covenant with Israel and the Noahic covenant that structures common grace for all nations. The church as covenant community under the **new covenant** is holy, catholic, and transnational; no modern nation stands in Israel’s typological role. The moral law addresses magistrates as part of the created order, but no state enters a redemptive **covenant of grace** as a political entity. Kline’s work on the intrusion ethic and the typological nature of Israel’s theocracy is particularly helpful in avoiding a sacralization of contemporary politics.

Finally, examiners will test how covenant theology connects to adjacent loci. With respect to the doctrine of God, one must affirm that all historical covenants are temporal revelations of the one eternal decree. There is no real change in God, only new relations on the side of creation. The **covenant of redemption** is not an added pact to the decree but a way of speaking of the ordered relations of the Trinity’s work ad extra, in which the Son willingly undertakes to be **federal head** of the elect. With respect to Christology, covenant theology insists that Christ’s obedience is vicarious covenant keeping; his active and passive obedience together fulfill the conditions of the broken **covenant of works** and secure the blessings of the **covenant of grace**. With respect to ecclesiology and sacraments, the church is the visible covenant community; Word and sacrament are covenantal means, and discipline is the guardian of covenant holiness.

In defending classic Reformed covenant theology, one must therefore affirm: a real though graciously condescending prelapsarian **covenant of works** with Adam, whose breach necessitates Christ’s federal obedience; a single **covenant of grace**, revealed progressively from Genesis 3:15 onward, administered through various epochs yet one in substance; a **covenant of redemption** as intra-trinitarian foundation; the unity of Old and New Testament churches under one Mediator; a robust distinction yet inseparable connection between law and gospel; and a nuanced understanding of Mosaic republication that preserves both works typology and gracious soteriology. Over against monocovenantalism, this preserves the sharpness of grace. Over against dispensationalism, it preserves the unity of redemptive history. Over against sacramental or political distortions, it keeps Christ as the covenantal center and head.

### RECAP NOTES

- Likely examiner questions and one-line answers:
  - Is the covenant of works biblical if the term is not?  
    The concept is required by Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15’s Adam–Christ parallel, even if the label is extra-biblical.
  - How do you avoid making God indebted to Adam’s obedience?  
    By framing Adam’s “merit” as covenantal and rooted in divine condescension, not as condign merit that compromises **divine aseity**.
  - Is the Mosaic covenant a covenant of works or of grace?  
    Soteriologically it is an administration of the one **covenant of grace**, yet it republished a works principle at the typological level of Israel’s tenure in the land.
  - How does covenant theology answer dispensationalism on Israel and the church?  
    By affirming one **covenant of grace** in Christ, in whom all covenant promises, including land, are fulfilled as new creation, with Jew and Gentile united in one body.
  - How do covenant and decree relate in God?  
    The decree is eternal and simple, while covenants are temporal revelations and executions of that decree without change in God, only in the created relation.
