# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann, though not a proponent of **covenant theology** in the traditional **Reformed** sense, critically engaged with biblical concepts such as **revelation**, **salvation history**, and the **relationship between Old and New Testaments**. Bultmann’s existential and demythologizing approach led him to reinterpret covenantal motifs, emphasizing the individual's encounter with the **kerygma** rather than the historical unfolding of redemptive covenants. His work stands in contrast to classic Reformed covenantal frameworks, challenging their historical and theological presuppositions.

- "The Old Testament is not revelation for us; it witnesses to revelation." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- History and Eschatology (1957)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
   - Sought to reinterpret biblical narratives, including covenant motifs, in existential terms.
   - Rejected the literal-historical reading of **covenant** as a binding legal arrangement.
   - Emphasized the existential decision of faith over participation in a historical covenant community.
   - Saw mythic language as pointing to authentic human existence before God.
   - "What matters is not the objective content of the myth, but the existential understanding it mediates." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter over Historical Continuity**
   - Prioritized the individual's present encounter with the **kerygma** over the continuity of redemptive covenants.
   - Downplayed the theological significance of the **covenant of grace** and **works** as historical realities.
   - Interpreted Old Testament covenants as prefiguring existential openness to God, not as binding legal arrangements.
   - Focused on the call to authentic existence in response to the proclamation of Christ.
   - "Faith is not assent to doctrines but decision in the present." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Critique of Salvation History (Heilsgeschichte)**
   - Questioned the Reformed emphasis on a unified, historical **salvation history** structured by covenants.
   - Argued that the New Testament does not present a continuous covenantal narrative.
   - Emphasized the discontinuity between Old and New Testaments, with Christ as the decisive event.
   - Saw salvation as an existential reality, not a process unfolding through historical covenants.
   - "The Christ event is not a link in a chain of historical events, but the eschatological event." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Revelation as Event, Not Structure**
   - Treated **revelation** as an existential event rather than a covenantal structure.
   - Denied that God’s self-disclosure is mediated through a series of covenants.
   - Emphasized the immediacy of the Word proclaimed in the present.
   - Saw the covenant as a metaphor for the individual's relationship to God, not a theological framework.
   - "Revelation occurs only in the act of faith." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Redefinition of Law and Promise**
   - Interpreted **law** and **promise** not as covenantal categories but as existential realities.
   - The law confronts the individual with the demand for authentic existence.
   - The promise is realized in the proclamation of the gospel, not in covenantal continuity.
   - Undermined the Reformed distinction between **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - "The law is not a system of statutes but the demand for decision." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **covenant theology** profoundly challenged the Reformed tradition by rejecting the historical and legal framework of biblical covenants in favor of existential interpretation. His demythologizing project forced later theologians to clarify and defend the coherence of **redemptive history** and the theological significance of the covenants. While his views are largely at odds with classic Reformed theology, Bultmann’s work remains influential in debates over the nature of **revelation**, the relationship between the Testaments, and the existential dimension of faith.
