# John Ball (1585–1640)

John Ball was a leading Puritan theologian whose work on **covenant theology** helped clarify and systematize the **federal structure** of Reformed doctrine in the seventeenth century. He emphasized the distinction between the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**, arguing for their centrality in understanding **redemptive history** and the believer’s relationship to God.

- "The Covenant of Grace is that free, gracious, and unchangeable contract of God with man, wherein he promiseth eternal life upon condition of faith in Christ." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

## Key Works

- A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace (1645, posthumous)
- A Short Catechism (1640)
- The Power of Godliness (1657, posthumous)
- The Life of Faith (1631)
- Secondary: Ligon Duncan, "The Covenant Idea in Early Reformed Theology" (for context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction Between Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Clearly separates the **Covenant of Works** made with Adam from the **Covenant of Grace** established after the Fall.
    - Argues that the Covenant of Works required perfect obedience for life.
    - Teaches that the Covenant of Grace offers salvation through faith in Christ alone.
    - Maintains that both covenants are foundational for understanding Scripture’s unity.
    - "The first Covenant was of works, the second of grace." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace Across Testaments**
    - Asserts that the **Covenant of Grace** is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
    - Emphasizes continuity between Old and New Testaments in the administration of the covenant.
    - Argues that the promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and the church.
    - Sees the sacraments as covenant signs in both eras.
    - "The Covenant of Grace is the same for substance under both Testaments." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

3. **Conditionality and Unconditionality in the Covenant**
    - Holds that the **Covenant of Grace** is unconditional in its establishment by God’s promise.
    - Teaches that faith is the condition for receiving the benefits, but even faith is a gift of grace.
    - Warns against confusing the covenant’s gracious character with legalism.
    - Stresses the necessity of perseverance in faith as evidence of covenant membership.
    - "God requireth faith, not as a work, but as an instrument to receive Christ." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

4. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Affirms Adam as the federal head of humanity in the Covenant of Works.
    - Teaches that Christ is the federal head of the elect in the Covenant of Grace.
    - Explains imputation of sin through Adam and righteousness through Christ.
    - Uses federal categories to clarify justification and original sin.
    - "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

5. **Practical Piety Rooted in Covenant Theology**
    - Connects assurance and obedience to the believer’s covenant relationship with God.
    - Encourages self-examination and faithfulness as covenant responses.
    - Grounds the Christian life in the promises and obligations of the covenant.
    - Sees the church as the visible community of the covenant.
    - "The Covenant of Grace teacheth us to walk before God in holiness and righteousness." (A Treatise of the Covenant of Grace)

## Legacy and Impact

John Ball’s articulation of **covenant theology** shaped later Puritan and Reformed thought, especially in England and New England. His careful distinctions and biblical arguments influenced the Westminster Confession and catechisms. Ball’s work provided a foundation for later federal theologians, helping to solidify the centrality of the **Covenant of Grace** in Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology. His legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the unity and structure of God’s redemptive dealings with humanity.
