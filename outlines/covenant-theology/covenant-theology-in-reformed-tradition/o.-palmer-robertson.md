# O. Palmer Robertson (1937–)

O. Palmer Robertson is a leading contemporary voice in **covenant theology** within the **Reformed tradition**, emphasizing the unity and progression of God’s redemptive plan through covenants. He is known for defining the **covenant** as a “bond in blood, sovereignly administered,” and for his insistence on the centrality of the **covenant of grace** throughout Scripture. Robertson’s approach stresses the organic continuity between the **Old and New Testaments** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
