# Peter A. Lillback (1956– )

Peter A. Lillback is a leading contemporary scholar of **covenant theology** in the **Reformed tradition**, focusing on the development and articulation of **federal theology** from the Reformation through the post-Reformation era. He emphasizes the centrality of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as organizing principles for understanding **Scripture**, **redemptive history**, and the structure of **Reformed confessions**. Lillback’s work highlights both the continuity and diversity within Reformed covenant thought, especially as seen in figures like the **Westminster divines** and **Johannes Cocceius**.

- "Covenant theology is the architectural blueprint by which Reformed theology understands the unity and diversity of God’s redemptive work."

## Key Works

- The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology
- The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century (editor, multi-volume)
- "The Continuing Conundrum: Calvin and the Conditionality of the Covenant" (in Calvin Theological Journal)
- "Ursinus’ Development of the Covenant of Creation: A Debt to Melanchthon or Calvin?" (in Protestant Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment)
- Contributions to Reformed Forum and Westminster Theological Journal on covenant themes

1. **Covenant as the Framework of Redemptive History**
   - Asserts that **covenant** is the primary structure for interpreting the unity and progression of **biblical revelation**.
   - Emphasizes the historical development of **covenant theology** from Calvin through the Westminster Assembly.
   - Argues that both **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are essential for understanding the gospel.
   - Highlights the role of covenants in connecting **Old and New Testaments**.
   "Covenant is the thread that weaves together the fabric of God’s dealings with humanity." (The Binding of God)

2. **The Covenant of Works and Its Enduring Significance**
   - Maintains that the **covenant of works** is foundational for understanding **law, obedience, and the fall**.
   - Traces the doctrine’s development and its role in **Reformed confessions**.
   - Defends the covenant of works against modern critiques and misunderstandings.
   - Connects the covenant of works to the necessity of **Christ’s active obedience**.
   "The covenant of works is not a peripheral doctrine, but a central pillar of Reformed soteriology." (The Binding of God)

3. **Conditionality and Unconditionality in the Covenant of Grace**
   - Explores the tension between **divine sovereignty** and **human responsibility** within the covenant of grace.
   - Analyzes how Reformed theologians, especially Calvin, navigated conditions and promises.
   - Argues that faith is the instrument, not the ground, of covenant blessings.
   - Shows how conditionality serves to uphold assurance without undermining grace.
   "The conditionality of the covenant does not negate grace, but rather expresses the dynamic of faith’s reception of God’s promises." ("The Continuing Conundrum")

4. **The Role of Covenant in Reformed Confessions**
   - Demonstrates how **covenant theology** shapes the structure and content of the **Westminster Confession** and catechisms.
   - Highlights the confessional commitment to both the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
   - Shows the influence of covenant thought on **Reformed ecclesiology** and sacraments.
   - Argues that confessional Reformed identity is inseparable from covenantal categories.
   "The Westminster Confession’s theology is covenantal from start to finish." (The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century)

5. **Historical Development and Diversity within Reformed Covenant Theology**
   - Examines the variety of covenant formulations among Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin, Ursinus, Cocceius).
   - Argues for a nuanced understanding of the evolution of covenant thought.
   - Highlights both continuity and legitimate diversity within the tradition.
   - Stresses the importance of historical context for interpreting Reformed sources.
   "Reformed covenant theology is not monolithic, but a rich tapestry woven from many threads." (The Binding of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Peter Lillback has played a significant role in the modern recovery and clarification of **covenant theology** within the Reformed tradition, especially through his historical and confessional scholarship. His work has influenced pastors, theologians, and students by providing a robust framework for understanding the unity of Scripture and the distinctives of **Reformed identity**. Lillback’s emphasis on the **covenant of works** and the confessional heritage of the Westminster standards continues to shape contemporary discussions on law, gospel, and assurance. His scholarship ensures that covenant theology remains a living and vital aspect of Reformed theological reflection.
