# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not develop **covenant theology** in the mature form later seen in the Reformed tradition, but his writings laid crucial groundwork for later concepts of the **covenant of grace** and **redemptive history**. He emphasized the unity of **God’s dealings with humanity** across the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the continuity of **divine promise**, **law**, and **grace**.

- "For the two Testaments are not adverse to each other, as if the one were opposed to the other, but the later is the fulfilling of the former." (Contra Faustum, 19.31)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- The City of God
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- Contra Faustum (Against Faustus the Manichaean)
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Testaments**
    - Affirmed that the **Old and New Testaments** reveal one unfolding plan of salvation.
    - Saw **Christ** as the center and fulfillment of both covenants.
    - Emphasized the typological relationship between **Israel** and the **Church**.
    - Interpreted Old Testament promises as spiritually realized in the New.
    - "The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed." (Questions on the Heptateuch, 2.73)

2. **Covenant as Divine Promise**
    - Understood God’s relationship with humanity as grounded in **divine promise**.
    - Saw the **Abrahamic covenant** as foundational for the coming of Christ.
    - Emphasized the faithfulness of God to His promises despite human unfaithfulness.
    - Linked the **covenant** to the administration of **grace** through Christ.
    - "God’s promise was given to Abraham, and in him to all nations." (City of God, 16.26)

3. **Law and Grace**
    - Distinguished between the **law** given through Moses and the **grace** given through Christ.
    - Taught that the law exposes sin, but only grace enables obedience.
    - Saw the **covenant of law** as preparatory for the **covenant of grace**.
    - Emphasized the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** for covenant faithfulness.
    - "The law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter, 19)

4. **Original Sin and Covenant Solidarity**

    - Taught that all humanity is implicated in Adam’s fall.
    - Saw Christ as the new covenant head who brings redemption.
    - Linked **federal representation** to the structure of salvation history.
    - "All men were in that one man, since all men were that one man who fell into sin." (City of God, 13.14)

5. **Ecclesiology and the People of God**
    - Identified the **Church** as the true heir of the Old Testament promises.
    - Emphasized the continuity of the **people of God** across the covenants.
    - Saw the sacraments as covenant signs uniting believers to Christ.
    - Interpreted the visible and invisible church distinction within the covenant community.
    - "The same people of God has been in both Testaments, though under different sacraments." (Contra Faustum, 19.27)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theological synthesis of **promise, law, and grace** profoundly shaped the later development of covenant theology in the Reformed tradition. His emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the continuity of the **people of God** provided a foundation for the Reformation’s doctrines of the **covenant of grace** and federal headship. While not a covenant theologian in the technical sense, Augustine’s insights remain indispensable for understanding the roots of Reformed covenant thought.
