# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Though not a Reformed theologian, Thomas Aquinas developed a sophisticated doctrine of **divine covenants** that influenced later Christian thought, including the **Reformed tradition**. Aquinas understood the **covenant** primarily in terms of God's gracious initiative in history, especially as it relates to the **Old and New Law**, and the unfolding of **salvation history**. While his framework differs from later Reformed **federal theology**, his distinctions between **law and grace** and his understanding of **God’s promises** provided important groundwork for subsequent covenantal developments.

- "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, qq. 98–108 (Treatise on Law)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- Summa Contra Gentiles
- De Veritate
- Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Divine Initiative**
   - God initiates relationship with humanity through **divine promises** and commands.
   - The **Old Law** (Mosaic covenant) is preparatory, pointing toward fulfillment in Christ.
   - The **New Law** is characterized by the internal work of the **Holy Spirit**.
   - Covenants are means by which God orders salvation history.
   - "The Old Law was given to men that they might be led to Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

2. **Law and Grace Distinction**
   - The **Old Law** is external, consisting of precepts and ceremonies.
   - The **New Law** is primarily internal, consisting of grace imparted by the Spirit.
   - Grace enables fulfillment of the law’s demands, which the Old Law could not accomplish.
   - The transition from Old to New Law marks the movement from shadow to substance.
   - "The New Law is called a law, not because it imposes new works, but because it directs the affections." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

3. **Unity and Progression of Salvation History**
   - There is a fundamental unity in God’s plan across the covenants.
   - The Old and New covenants are distinct but ordered toward the same ultimate end.
   - The New Covenant fulfills and perfects the Old.
   - Typology is central: Old Testament realities prefigure New Testament fulfillment.
   - "The Old Law is a figure of the New Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

4. **Role of Christ in the Covenants**
   - Christ is the mediator and fulfillment of all divine covenants.
   - The promises of the Old Covenant find their realization in Christ’s person and work.
   - The New Covenant is established in Christ’s blood and mediated by Him.
   - Participation in Christ is the means of entering the New Covenant.
   - "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given through faith in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

5. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs**
   - Sacraments are visible signs of the invisible grace of the covenant.
   - Old Covenant sacraments prefigure those of the New.
   - The sacraments of the New Covenant actually confer the grace they signify.
   - Baptism and the Eucharist are central as means of participation in the New Covenant.
   - "The sacraments of the New Law effect what they signify." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 62, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s treatment of **covenant** laid important conceptual groundwork for later developments in **Reformed covenant theology**, especially in his distinctions between **law and grace** and his understanding of salvation history. While the Reformed tradition would systematize the doctrine of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** in ways Aquinas did not, his influence is evident in the broader Christian understanding of God’s dealings with humanity. His theological synthesis continues to inform ecumenical dialogue and the study of biblical covenants.
