# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth radically reinterpreted **covenant theology** within the **Reformed tradition**, centering it on the person and work of **Jesus Christ** rather than on traditional federal or bi-covenantal frameworks. For Barth, the **covenant of grace** is not a secondary arrangement after the fall but the very basis and goal of all **divine-human relations**, with **election** and **reconciliation** as its core.

- "The covenant is the goal of creation, and creation is the way to the covenant." (Church Dogmatics III/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics II/2 (Doctrine of Election)
- Church Dogmatics III/1 (Doctrine of Creation)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- The Theology of Karl Barth: Exposition and Interpretation (ed. H. Hartwell)
- Karl Barth and the Making of Evangelical Theology (Clifford Green)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Covenant**
   - The covenant is realized and revealed supremely in **Jesus Christ**.
   - Christ is both the **electing God** and the **elected man**.
   - All humanity is included in Christ’s covenantal relationship with God.
   - The covenant is not a contract but a relationship grounded in divine initiative.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God has bound Himself to man and man to Himself." (CD II/2)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Bi-covenantalism**
   - Barth rejects the classic distinction between a **covenant of works** and a **covenant of grace**.
   - He sees the entire history of God’s dealings with humanity as one covenant of grace.
   - The so-called covenant of works is subsumed under the broader reality of grace.
   - This move challenges the federal theology of post-Reformation orthodoxy.
   - "There is only one covenant, the covenant of grace." (CD IV/1)

3. **Election as Covenant**
   - Election is the foundation and form of the covenant.
   - God’s election is not arbitrary but is fulfilled in Christ for all.
   - The covenant is the external form of election; election is the internal basis of the covenant.
   - This redefines **predestination** as fundamentally relational and Christ-centered.
   - "Election means covenant, and covenant means election." (CD II/2)

4. **Covenant and Creation**
   - Creation exists for the sake of the covenant.
   - The purpose of the world is to be the sphere of God’s covenantal fellowship with humanity.
   - The covenant is not an afterthought but the telos of creation itself.
   - This integrates **creation** and **redemption** within a single divine purpose.
   - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant; the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (CD III/1)

5. **Universal Scope of the Covenant**
   - The covenant in Christ has implications for all humanity, not just the elect in a narrow sense.
   - Barth’s view moves toward a **universalism** of grace, though he stops short of dogmatic universal salvation.
   - The covenant is the context for understanding reconciliation and atonement.
   - This broadens the Reformed understanding of the people of God.
   - "In Christ, all are included in the covenant relationship." (CD IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of **covenant theology** profoundly influenced twentieth-century Reformed thought, challenging the traditional federal schema and refocusing the doctrine on **Christology** and **election**. His approach provoked both admiration and critique, especially among confessional Reformed theologians committed to classic bi-covenantalism. Barth’s legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of the **covenant of grace**, the relationship between **creation and redemption**, and the universal scope of God’s saving purposes.
