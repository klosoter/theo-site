# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin’s approach to **covenant theology** laid foundational groundwork for later Reformed developments, though he did not systematize the doctrine as fully as his successors. He emphasized the unity of the **covenant of grace** across both Old and New Testaments, seeing Christ as the fulfillment of God’s redemptive promises to His people. Calvin’s understanding of **law and gospel**, the **continuity of the church**, and the centrality of **God’s sovereign initiative** shaped the Reformed tradition’s covenantal framework.

- "All the covenants made with the patriarchs were so many renewals of the covenant of free adoption." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 9–11)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, and Hebrews
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (McNeill/Battles edition)
- Calvin and the Federal Vision (Peter Lillback)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Calvin taught that God’s saving relationship with humanity is fundamentally one covenant, progressively revealed.
    - He saw the **Old and New Testaments** as differing in administration but not in substance.
    - The promises to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - The covenant is always grounded in God’s mercy, not human merit.
    - "The covenant made with all the patriarchs is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

2. **Christ-Centered Fulfillment**
    - Christ is the mediator and substance of the covenant in both testaments.
    - All covenant promises find their fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus.
    - The sacraments, both old and new, point to the same spiritual realities in Christ.
    - Calvin’s reading of Scripture is consistently **Christocentric**.
    - "For the covenant which God made of old with the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
    - Calvin distinguished between the substance and the outward administration of the covenant.
    - The **ceremonial law** was temporary, pointing forward to Christ.
    - The moral law remains binding as a guide for Christian living.
    - The visible church includes both believers and their children, reflecting covenant continuity.
    - "The Lord has always covenanted with his servants in the same way, and the difference of administration does not destroy the unity of the covenant." (Institutes, 2.10.1)

4. **Covenant and Sacraments**
    - Sacraments are signs and seals of the covenant, not empty rituals.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper correspond to circumcision and Passover as covenant signs.
    - The efficacy of the sacraments depends on God’s promise, not the recipient’s worthiness.
    - Calvin emphasized the spiritual presence of Christ in the sacraments.
    - "The sacraments are testimonies of grace and seals of the promise, by which God assures us of the goodwill he has toward us." (Institutes, 4.14.1)

5. **Divine Sovereignty and Human Response**
    - God’s sovereign initiative establishes and maintains the covenant relationship.
    - Human response is required, but always as a result of God’s prior grace.
    - The covenant includes both promises and obligations, but grace precedes obedience.
    - Election and covenant are closely related, but not identical in Calvin’s thought.
    - "God, in freely adopting us, binds us to himself by this sacred bond, that he may keep us under his protection and government." (Institutes, 2.10.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **covenant theology** provided a crucial foundation for later Reformed theologians, influencing the development of the **Westminster Standards** and the broader federal tradition. His emphasis on the unity of the covenant of grace shaped Reformed views on the sacraments, the church, and the continuity of God’s redemptive plan. While later theologians would further systematize covenant categories, Calvin’s biblical-theological insights remain central to Reformed identity and practice.
