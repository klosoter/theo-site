# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich did not develop a traditional **covenant theology** as found in the **Reformed tradition**; instead, he reinterpreted biblical and theological categories through his method of **correlation** and existential analysis. While he acknowledged the importance of **divine-human relationship** and the biblical motif of covenant, Tillich subsumed these under broader existential and ontological concerns, rather than the federal theology of classic Reformed thought.

- "The biblical concept of covenant is a symbol for the relationship between God and man in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Protestant Era
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality
- Theology of Culture

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as Symbolic Expression**
    - Tillich viewed **covenant** not as a legal or historical arrangement, but as a symbol for the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - He emphasized the **mythical and symbolic** nature of biblical language, including covenant terminology.
    - The covenant points to the **depth dimension** of human existence and the encounter with the **Ground of Being**.
    - He rejected literalist or forensic readings of covenant in favor of existential interpretation.
    - "The covenant is a symbol for the existential unity of God and man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Rejection of Federal Theology**
    - Tillich did not affirm the classic Reformed **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** schema.
    - He critiqued the legalistic and contractual aspects of traditional covenant theology.
    - His theology focused on **being** and **existence** rather than on redemptive-historical covenants.
    - He saw the Reformed approach as too bound to historical and juridical categories.
    - "The legalistic interpretation of the covenant misses its existential significance." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Method of Correlation**
    - Tillich’s method sought to correlate existential human questions with theological answers, including the covenant motif.
    - He interpreted covenant as addressing the **ultimate concern** of human beings.
    - The method allowed for reinterpretation of biblical symbols in light of contemporary existential issues.
    - This approach moved away from confessional or dogmatic formulations of covenant.
    - "The method of correlation enables us to reinterpret the symbols of faith for our time." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Universal Scope of Divine-Human Relationship**
    - Tillich saw the divine-human relationship, symbolized by covenant, as universal rather than limited to particular historical covenants.
    - He emphasized the **universality** of revelation and the presence of the divine in all cultures.
    - The covenant motif was thus expanded to include all of humanity’s encounter with the divine.
    - He downplayed the particularism of biblical covenants with Israel or the church.
    - "The covenant is a universal symbol of the divine-human encounter." (Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality)

5. **Existential Interpretation of Law and Grace**
    - Tillich reinterpreted **law** and **grace** as existential realities rather than covenantal administrations.
    - Law represents the structure of existence, while grace is the acceptance of the individual by the **Ground of Being**.
    - He rejected the forensic contrast between law and grace typical of Reformed covenant theology.
    - The existential acceptance by God transcends legal categories.
    - "Grace is the acceptance of that which is rejected according to the law of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of **covenant theology** challenged traditional Reformed categories and broadened the conversation about the divine-human relationship. His influence led many 20th-century theologians to reconsider the symbolic and existential dimensions of biblical motifs. While his approach stands in contrast to confessional Reformed theology, Tillich’s work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of **systematic theology** and existential philosophy. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the meaning and function of covenant in modern theology.
