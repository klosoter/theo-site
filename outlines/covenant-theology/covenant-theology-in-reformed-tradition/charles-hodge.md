# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge was a leading figure in the **Princeton Theology** and a major proponent of **covenant theology** within the **Reformed tradition**. He emphasized the centrality of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as foundational to understanding the relationship between God and humanity, interpreting Scripture through the lens of these covenants. Hodge’s approach sought to uphold the unity of **redemptive history** and the continuity of the **church** across the Old and New Testaments.

- "The covenant of grace is the plan which God has adopted for the salvation of fallen man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Review articles on covenant theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of the Covenant of Works**
    - The **covenant of works** was established with Adam as the federal head of humanity.
    - Adam’s obedience or disobedience determined the fate of all his descendants.
    - The covenant of works is foundational for understanding **original sin** and **imputed guilt**.
    - Its failure necessitated the introduction of the **covenant of grace**.
    - "The covenant of works was a real transaction, the terms of which were clearly revealed to Adam." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Centrality of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is God’s means of redeeming fallen humanity through Christ.
    - It is one in substance throughout redemptive history, though administered differently before and after Christ.
    - The promises of salvation are given to all who have faith in Christ, both before and after His incarnation.
    - The covenant of grace unites all believers as the true **people of God**.
    - "The plan of salvation has always been the same, and the covenant of grace is the same under all dispensations." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of the Church Across the Covenants**
    - The **church** is one body, existing under both the old and new covenants.
    - The visible church includes believers and their children, reflecting the covenant structure.
    - The sacraments of the Old Testament (circumcision, Passover) correspond to those of the New (baptism, Lord’s Supper).
    - The continuity of the church supports infant baptism and covenant succession.
    - "The church is the same under both dispensations, and the children of believers are members of it." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

4. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam and Christ serve as federal heads in the covenants of works and grace, respectively.
    - Adam’s sin is imputed to his descendants; Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers.
    - This federal representation grounds doctrines of **justification** and **original sin**.
    - The structure of the covenants explains the transmission of guilt and righteousness.
    - "The principle of representation pervades the whole Scriptures and underlies the plan of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Basis for Covenant Theology**
    - Hodge grounds covenant theology in the exegesis of both Old and New Testament texts.
    - He sees the covenants as the organizing principle of biblical revelation.
    - The promises to Abraham and their fulfillment in Christ are central to his argument.
    - Covenant theology safeguards the unity and coherence of **biblical theology**.
    - "The doctrine of the covenants is not a human invention, but is taught in the Scriptures from Genesis to Revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **covenant theology** became a standard within American Presbyterianism and the broader Reformed tradition. His work at Princeton shaped generations of pastors and theologians, reinforcing the centrality of the **covenant of grace** and the unity of the church. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed confessions and systematic theologies, ensuring that covenantal categories remain foundational for understanding **redemptive history** and the doctrine of salvation.
