# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **covenant theology** as a central organizing principle of **Reformed theology**, emphasizing the unity of God's dealings with humanity throughout **redemptive history**. He integrates the concept of **covenant** with his broader framework of **tri-perspectivalism**, highlighting the relational, ethical, and authoritative dimensions of God's covenants. Frame sees the covenants as foundational for understanding **Scripture**, **salvation**, and the Christian life.

- "Covenant is the means by which God administers his lordship to his people." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2010)

    - "The biblical covenants are the backbone of the history of redemption." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Covenant**
    - Applies his normative, situational, and existential perspectives to covenant theology.
    - Stresses that covenants reveal God's authority (normative), shape the believer's context (situational), and demand personal response (existential).
    - Uses tri-perspectivalism to interpret the meaning and application of covenants.
    - Argues this approach clarifies the ethical and relational aspects of covenant life.
    - "Covenant is a relationship under God’s lordship, defined by his authoritative word." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Continuity and Discontinuity in the Covenants**
    - Affirms substantial continuity between the covenants, especially regarding salvation by grace.
    - Recognizes important discontinuities, particularly in the administration of the covenants.
    - Maintains that the New Covenant fulfills and transforms previous covenants.
    - Stresses that Christ is the mediator and fulfillment of all covenants.
    - "The new covenant is not a break with the old, but its fulfillment in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenant and the Authority of Scripture**
    - Argues that the Bible itself is a covenant document, binding God and his people.
    - Sees the authority of Scripture as rooted in its covenantal character.
    - Emphasizes the role of divine speech in establishing and maintaining covenants.
    - Connects the inspiration and sufficiency of Scripture to its function as a covenantal constitution.
    - "Scripture is the written form of God’s covenant lordship." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Covenant and Christian Ethics**
    - Grounds Christian ethical obligations in the covenant relationship with God.
    - Views the law as covenant stipulation, fulfilled and transformed in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the communal and personal dimensions of covenant obedience.
    - Argues that ethics flows from the believer’s identity as a covenant partner with God.
    - "Our ethical life is covenantal, rooted in God’s gracious relationship with us." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed theology** by integrating **covenant theology** with his tri-perspectival method, offering a fresh and accessible approach to classic doctrines. His work has influenced pastors, theologians, and students, especially within conservative Presbyterian and Reformed circles. Frame’s emphasis on the covenantal structure of Scripture and the ethical implications of covenant life continues to inform discussions on biblical authority, redemptive history, and Christian living.
