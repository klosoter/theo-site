- Decisive figures: Heinrich Bullinger; Johannes Cocceius; Herman Witsius; Francis Turretin; Meredith G. Kline; John Murray.
- Relevant traditions: early Reformed covenantalism; Reformed scholasticism and classic **federal theology**; Westminster Standards; twentieth-century Reformed biblical-theological developments.
- Debates:
  - Internal: validity and content of the **covenant of works**; the **pactum salutis** and **divine simplicity**; Mosaic **republication** and the substance–administration distinction; conditions in the covenant of grace and assurance.

### ESSAY
Covenant theology in the Reformed tradition claims not merely that Scripture contains covenants, but that covenant is the architectonic form by which God orders creation and redemption and the grammar by which the gospel is declared. A covenant is a divinely sanctioned bond with oaths and sanctions, ordered by God’s **condescension** to relate himself to man. Classic **federal theology** organizes this material around three nodes: an eternal **pactum salutis** among the Trinity ordering Christ’s mediatorial mission; a prelapsarian **covenant of works** with Adam promising life upon perfect, personal, exact obedience; and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** in which God freely bestows salvation through a mediator to sinners, received by faith alone. The coherence of the system is not a scholastic contrivance but the infrastructure of Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15, in which two humanities are constituted by two public persons, Adam and Christ, and by which the **imputation** of guilt and righteousness is explicable. The question is whether this architecture is biblically warranted, historically responsible, theologically coherent under **divine simplicity**, and pastorally sane.

Heinrich Bullinger marks the first decisive turn. In De testamento seu foedere Dei unico et aeterno, Bullinger forged a covenantal account of the unity of Scripture, pressing that God’s dealings with Abraham and Israel reveal a single divine **substance** of saving promise administered diversely through history. His context was Reformation polemics against both Rome and the Radical Reformation. Against Rome he opposed the sacramental system as a means of condign merit, insisting that sacraments are federal signs and seals annexed to the Word, not automatic conveyors of grace. Against Anabaptist rupture he defended the continuity of the people of God and thus the propriety of the children of believers as members of the covenant community. Bullinger did not supply a fully articulated **covenant of works**, but he shifted Protestantism away from a mere ordo salutis toward a canonical backbone in which promise, law, and sacrament find their place as modes of covenant administration. This move decisively reframed the exegetical center of gravity and provided the seedbed from which the later federal schema emerged, culminating confessionally in the Westminster Standards’ **substance–administration distinction**.

Johannes Cocceius then radicalized the historical dimension. Writing in the Dutch Republic’s post-synod environment, he opposed a static scholasticism with a program of redemptive-historical exegesis. In Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento Dei, he argued for progressive covenants, each a further specification of the one **covenant of grace** in time, and he provided an explicit formulation of the **covenant of works** with Adam, reading Hosea 6:7 as a transgression of covenant like Adam. He tied the Decalogue to covenantal administrations, reading the “do this and live” motif of Leviticus 18:5 and Deuteronomy as covenant law with sanctions. Cocceius also advanced a provocative doctrine of the Sabbath that mirrored redemptive epochs, stoking the Cocceian–Voetian conflict over law and piety. Conceptually, Cocceius is decisive for introducing a comprehensive **typology** governed by covenants, training later Reformed exegesis to read Scripture as an unfolding series of divine oaths rather than a flat catalogue of doctrines. He also crystalized the tension every examiner will press: how to affirm one **substance** of grace while taking seriously the real legalities and conditions embedded in specific administrations.

Herman Witsius supplied the system’s classic articulation and its confessional poise. In De oeconomia foederum Dei cum hominibus, he mediated between Cocceian dynamism and Voetian rigor, defending a threefold federal architecture and calibrating doctrines across loci. Historically rooted in the Dutch Nadere Reformatie yet conversant with the broader scholastic tradition, Witsius methodically defined the **pactum salutis** as the eternal counsel whereby the Father appoints the Son to mediate, the Son willingly undertakes obedience and atonement for the elect, and the Spirit applies the benefits. He guarded this against tritheism by insisting, in line with **divine simplicity**, that the pact is not a contract between separate wills but an eternal theandric ordering of missions by the one simple will according to personal relations. This is not a creaturely agreement projected into God, but a mode of speaking grounded in Scripture’s differentiated missions and promises. Anticipating the examiner’s challenge, Witsius would reply that this is **analogical knowledge**: God speaks to us in covenantal terms to reveal the ordered harmony of decree and redemption without multiplying parts in God.

Witsius also anchored the **covenant of works** exegetically. He indexed Genesis 2’s probation, the threatened death, the implied promise of life, and the apostolic two-Adam structure of Romans 5. He rejected Pelagian merit while maintaining pactum merit: God by **condescension** attached the reward of immutable life to Adam’s obedience. The issue is not legalism but federal representation. As to the Mosaic economy, Witsius preserved the **substance–administration distinction**: the Mosaic covenant as to its substance is the **covenant of grace**, prominently exhibiting Christ in types and sacrificial shadows; as to its form, it includes a covenantal republication of the law with temporal sanctions for Israel’s land tenure, echoing the principle of Leviticus 18:5 under a typological kingdom. Thus “do this and live” does not undermine sola fide in justification; it structures Israel’s theocratic life and drives sinners to the mediator revealed in the same economy. On conditions within the covenant of grace, Witsius spoke precisely: faith is the instrumental condition, divinely given, not a co-meritorious contribution; evangelical obedience is a consequent condition for communion and assurance, not the ground of right standing. Here he guards justification by the imputed active and passive obedience of Christ, which presupposes a real **covenant of works** to be fulfilled by the Second Adam.

Francis Turretin, operating in Geneva’s academical disputations, supplied the polemical rigor. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology, he identifies the **covenant of works** as a true covenant, not a bare command, because it has a federal promise annexed, a sanction threatened, and a representative head. He deploys scholastic distinctions to disarm objections. Against the claim that Adam could not merit, he denies condign merit while affirming covenantal or pactum merit grounded in God’s promise. Against the antithesis between covenant and nature, he argues that covenant perfects nature by elevating it toward a supernatural end proportioned by divine promise. Against the charge that the Mosaic economy is itself a covenant of works for salvation, he differentiates the pedagogical use of the law and Israel’s political economy from the order of justification. Turretin is decisive for his careful placement of **federal headship** within broader loci: Adamic imputation explains original sin; Christ’s active obedience presupposes a broken probation that only a Second Adam can satisfy; the moral law persists as the rule of life under the **covenant of grace** because it expresses God’s unchanging righteousness. His method displays how **federal theology** integrates with classical theism and soteriology without collapsing into moralism.

Meredith G. Kline catalyzed twentieth-century renewal by re-grounding covenant in ancient Near Eastern suzerainty and grant treaties. In Treaty of the Great King and Kingdom Prologue, he traced Deuteronomy’s literary structure to international treaty forms, arguing that covenant is a juridical oath-sanction bond administered by a divine king. This sharpened the forensic character of covenant and the role of oath and curse, illuminating the cross as the sacrificial curse-bearing of the covenant breaker Vicar and baptism as covenantal ordeal in By Oath Consigned. Kline’s decisive contribution to Reformed intra-mural debate was his account of Mosaic **republication**: the Sinaitic economy recapitulates the works principle at the typological level, offering tenure in the land upon corporate fidelity while simultaneously administering the **covenant of grace** through sacrificial types. He coined intrusion ethics to explain the anomolous severity of holy war and theocratic sanctions as intrusions of eschatological judgment into the typological kingdom. Critics worry that this jeopardizes sola fide. Kline raises the bar: justification before God is always through faith in the mediator; but God covenanted a typal kingdom under a distinct works principle for national blessing. This two-tiered economy supports Paul’s reading of Deuteronomy and Leviticus in Galatians 3 without making Moses an alternative way of salvation. Kline thus defends the classic law–gospel dialectic by rooting it in textual and historical form and provides tools for reading prophetic litigation and covenant lawsuit with greater precision.

John Murray represents a counter-pull within conservative Reformed theology. In essays gathered in Collected Writings and in The Covenant of Grace, he questioned whether Scripture warrants the label **covenant of works** for the creation order. Affirming a real Adamic probation, he preferred the “Adamic administration,” wary that the language of merit compromises grace’s ultimacy. He also resisted Mosaic **republication** beyond pedagogical law, arguing that to call Sinai a works covenant risks dualism in God’s way of salvation and undermines the unity of redemptive history. On assurance, Murray pressed the organic relation between union with Christ, faith, and obedience, sometimes departing from stricter distinctions between justification and sanctification rhetoric. Murray is decisive because he demonstrates that federal theology is not monolithic and because his cautions force defenders of classic tri-covenantalism to sharpen terms. In practice, many of his substantive affirmations align with orthodoxy: he affirmes the reality of Adam’s probation, Christ’s active obedience, and one **covenant of grace** administered through the ages. But his terminological reticence about the **covenant of works** and his resistance to the Klinean reading of Sinai have shaped major internal debates in American Presbyterianism.

The internal debates circle three questions. First, the status of the **covenant of works**. Exegetically, does Scripture teach a prelapsarian covenant? Examiners will ask for more than inference. The response: covenant in Scripture is not a magical word but a concept. Genesis 2 supplies the elements of covenant without naming it: parties specified, a sovereign arrangement, a positive command as probation, a sanction in death, and by good and necessary consequence a promise of life. Hosea 6:7 confirms humanity’s Adamic transgression as covenantal. Paul’s two-Adam construction in Romans 5 requires an original public person whose obedience or disobedience is legally imputable. Leviticus 18:5 and the “do this and live” formula indicate a works principle that, considered in relation to the original head, implies a real covenantal order of life for obedience. Theologically, the **covenant of works** does not entail Pelagian merit but a covenantal pact in which God, by **condescension**, attached eschatological life to perfect obedience. The charge that grace would be evacuated is answered by distinguishing grace as unmerited favor to sinners from divine goodness to an upright creature. A confessional Reformed position should retain the **covenant of works** both for exegesis and to preserve Christ’s active obedience as vicarious fulfillment of a real legal probation.

Second, the Mosaic economy and **republication**. There are three classic positions within orthodoxy. The Westminster line, represented by Witsius and Turretin, treats the Mosaic as one in **substance** with the **covenant of grace**, while recognizing a distinctive legal administration with pedogogical and political functions. The subservient covenant thesis, associated with some British federalists, sees Sinai as neither works unto eschatological life nor grace unto salvation, but a distinct covenant serving the covenant of grace by exposing sin and ordering a polity. The Klinean republication thesis reads Sinai as a typological reintroduction of the works principle for Israel’s land tenure. The examiner’s worry is whether any works principle compromises justification by faith. The answer is that justification before God is always and only by faith in the mediator promised within the same economy. The legal layer at Sinai neither offers eternal life by obedience nor supplies an alternate way but structures Israel’s national life and intensifies the pedagogical work of the law. Galatians 3’s opposition between the law as promise-annex and the law as faith-opposed resolves when we distinguish the law’s covenantal function from the promise’s soteriological function. Properly parsed, **republication** fortifies law–gospel discrimination without dualizing God’s salvific will.

Third, the **pactum salutis** under **divine simplicity**. Critics allege that speaking of an eternal covenant among divine persons implies three centers of willing. The classic reply, already anticipated by Witsius and later by Bavinck, is that the pact names the eternal ordering of missions according to personal properties in the one simple will. There is no composition in God. The Father wills to send, the Son wills to be sent, and the Spirit wills to apply, but these are not three willed acts added to the divine essence. They are the one undivided act of God considered according to relations of origin. Our **analogical knowledge** employs covenantal idiom because Scripture does. To refuse the idiom would blunt the clarity of the Son’s mediatorship as the ground of the **covenant of grace**. Moreover, the **pactum salutis** secures the certainty of redemption and unifies decree and history without collapsing person and nature. The examiner should press whether this is necessary. It is necessary for doctrinal coherence across loci: to relate election in Christ, Christology’s mediatorial offices, and the efficacy of atonement to the covenantal frame that governs Scripture.

External debates clarify what is at stake. The Lutheran law–gospel framework insists the law always accuses and thus denies a **covenant of works** as a creation covenant. The Reformed reply is twofold. Creation includes law as the expression of God’s righteousness, and in the prelapsarian state law was the order of life and joy under **divine condescension**. The law’s accusing function is consequent upon sin. Further, Lutheran construals of the Mosaic law can flatten canonical development and destabilize the forensic basis of Christ’s active obedience. The Reformed insistence on an original works order framed by covenant supports the federal logic of Romans 5 and thus the non-redundant necessity of Christ’s obedience unto life.

Dispensationalism and progressive covenantalism reject the single **substance** of the **covenant of grace**, dividing Israel and the church or revising the place of law and sacraments. Classic federal theology answers with the **substance–administration distinction**: there is one saving promise fulfilled in Christ, administered through types and shadows to the patriarchs and Mosaic Israel, and through clearer, spiritual ordinances to the church. The church does not replace Israel as a different people but is Israel fulfilled in and under the mediator. This secures continuity for paedobaptism as a federal sign and ensures that Old Testament saints were justified the same way as New Testament believers. Barth’s revision recasts covenant as the form of election and in effect overwhelms law by gospel, pressing universalism and dissolving a real order of legal fulfillment. The Reformed resist by maintaining a concrete **covenant of works** that Christ fulfills and a concrete **covenant of grace** that God administers through faith, thereby avoiding the abstraction of covenant into a meta-concept and preserving the forensic gospel.

Contemporary debates stress-test the system. The Federal Vision controversy mounted a monocovenant proposal in which baptismal union confers an “objective” covenant status with conditional election and justification retained by covenant faithfulness. This eviscerates forensic imputation and collapses the instrumental role of faith into a faith-and-faithfulness scheme. Classic federal theology responds by doubling down on the forensic and federal. Covenant membership as visible grace does not equate to decretal election; baptism is a **sacramental efficacy** sign and seal annexed to the Word, not a conveyor of a new ontological status that competes with justification by faith alone. The distinction between the visible administration and the invisible **substance** of grace is decisive here. New Covenant Theology rejects the moral law’s abiding third use, claims the Mosaic law is abrogated as a unit, and denies paedobaptism by dissolving continuity. The Reformed answer that the moral law reflects God’s character and persists as rule of life under the **covenant of grace**; that the new covenant internalizes what the old promised rather than inventing a new ethic; and that the inclusion of children in the visible administration follows from the Abrahamic pattern subsisting in the new administration. Finally, debates over Christ’s active obedience and imputation recur in academic and ecclesial contexts. Without a real **covenant of works**, the imputation of a positive righteousness to believers lacks a covenantal basis; without imputation, justification collapses into infusion. The tri-covenantal frame safeguards the gospel.

The defended position thus takes shape. Covenant is the canonical form of God’s triune work. The **pactum salutis** is the eternal ground of the **covenant of grace**, speaking analogically under **divine simplicity** of the ordered missions by which the one God saves. The **covenant of works** is a true covenant with Adam, with a promise of life annexed to perfect obedience by divine **condescension**; it grounds Adam’s **federal headship**, original sin by imputation, and the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s active and passive obedience. The **covenant of grace** is one in **substance** from Genesis 3:15 to the consummation, administered diversely through promissory words, sacrificial types, and sacraments. The Mosaic economy is a gracious administration of that covenant, but it republishes the works principle in a typological, national form for Israel’s land tenure and pedagogy, heightening the law–gospel dialectic that drives to Christ. Faith alone is the sole instrument of justification, while evangelical obedience functions as the necessary fruit for communion and assurance, never the ground of acceptance. The church is the visible administration of this covenant, marked by Word and sacrament, inclusive of believers and their children under a federal head, and ordered by the abiding moral law. This position receives depth from Bullinger’s unity, is energized by Cocceius’s redemptive-historical instinct, stabilized by Witsius’s doctrinal alignment and Turretin’s distinctions, and sharpened by Kline’s juridical and typological work against the cautions of Murray.

Examiners will probe the coherence of this frame across loci. Does the pactum imperil the Trinity? The answer refracts classical theism: the pact is the eternal counsel of redemption by the one simple God considered personally; it names relations of mission without positing parts in God. Does **republication** erode justification by faith? Not if one distinguishes soteriological justification from typological kingdom tenure; the latter is real but provisional and never the basis of eternal life. Does a covenant of works imply that prelapsarian life depends on human achievement rather than divine goodness? No. The promise itself is pure condescension, and the attached reward is by covenantal arrangement. The holiness of the Creator–creature distinction is preserved precisely because the Creator freely binds himself by oath to his image-bearer. Does the unity of the covenant of grace reduce differences between old and new? No. The new surpasses the old in clarity, efficacy, and breadth, as the Spirit writes the law on the heart, the shadows vanish, and Gentile inclusion expands. But the one **substance** of promise ensures a single way of salvation and underwrites the Reformed understanding of **sacramental efficacy** as confirmatory rather than automatic.

In sum, Reformed **federal theology** offers a coherent, biblically controlled, and confessionally anchored way of reading Scripture’s whole. It provides the only framework that makes explicit sense of the two-Adams structure of salvation, the forensic nature of the gospel, the canonical shape of law and promise, the place of Israel in the story of redemption, and the continuity of the church and her sacraments. Bullinger supplied the intuition of unity; Cocceius taught us to read the Bible as unfolding covenants; Witsius articulated the dogmatic center and showed its inter-loci coherence; Turretin guarded its forensic exactness; Kline re-anchored covenant in oath and sanction and offered a defensible **republication**; and Murray’s critiques help us avoid overstatement and press back into exegesis. The defended position, indexed to the Westminster Standards, secures doctrinal coherence across loci, exegetical fidelity, and pastoral clarity. It answers the natural set of objections and brings the candidate into a stance that can sustain rigorous oral examination: firm where confessional clarity demands firmness and nuanced where Scripture’s own differentiated administrations require careful discriminations under the lordship of Christ, the true head of the everlasting covenant.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Covenant is a divinely sanctioned oath-bond under **divine condescension**; Reformed **federal theology** frames Scripture with the **pactum salutis**, a prelapsarian **covenant of works**, and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** that is one in **substance** and diverse in administration.
- Decisive figures:
  - Bullinger: early unity of the testaments and sacramental federalism.
  - Cocceius: progressive, redemptive-historical covenants; explicit covenant of works; law–gospel tension.
  - Witsius: classic tri-covenantal synthesis; defense of **pactum salutis**; Mosaic grace with legal form.
  - Turretin: scholastic precision on merit, imputation, and Mosaic law; threefold use.
  - Kline: suzerainty structure; oath, curse, and typological **republication**.
  - Murray: questioned covenant of works terminology; resisted republication; affirmed Adamic probation and Christ’s active obedience.
- Debates:
  - Internal: reality and nature of the **covenant of works**; **pactum salutis** under **divine simplicity**; Mosaic **republication** and the **substance–administration distinction**; conditions and assurance in the covenant of grace.
  - External: Lutheran law–gospel without a creation covenant; dispensational and progressive covenantal denials of one **substance**; Barth’s conflation of covenant and election.
  - Contemporary: Federal Vision’s monocovenant and objectivity; New Covenant Theology on law and baptism; justification and active obedience.
- Defended position: Classic tri-covenantalism with Adam under real probation, Christ fulfilling the broken **covenant of works**, one **covenant of grace** administered diversely, and a typological Mosaic **republication** that safeguards sola fide and canonical **typology**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Where is the covenant of works in Scripture? Genesis 2 with Hosea 6:7, Romans 5, and Leviticus 18:5 establish its elements by good and necessary consequence.
  - Does the pactum violate simplicity? No; it names the one will’s ordered missions according to personal relations, an instance of **analogical knowledge**.
  - Does republication compromise justification by faith? No; it governs typological land tenure and pedagogy, not eternal life.
  - Why not dispense with “merit”? Condign merit is denied, but covenantal merit by promise is required to ground Christ’s active obedience and imputation.
  - How do sacraments function? As federal signs and seals of the one **substance** of grace, confirming faith without automatic efficacy.
