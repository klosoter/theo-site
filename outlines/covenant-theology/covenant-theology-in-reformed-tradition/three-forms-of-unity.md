# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust **covenant theology** that shapes the Reformed understanding of **redemption**, **law and gospel**, and the structure of **God’s relationship with humanity**. These confessional documents emphasize the unity of the **covenant of grace** across redemptive history, the continuity of the **church**, and the centrality of **Christ** as Mediator of the covenant.

- "God has made a covenant of grace with us in Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 14, 16, 17, 22, 34
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 19, 20, 26–27, 65–74
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–II
- Lyle D. Bierma, *The Theology of the Heidelberg Catechism*
- J. Mark Beach, *The Faithful Scribe: Philipp Melanchthon and the Making of the Heidelberg Catechism*

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The covenant of grace is one in substance throughout Scripture, though administered differently before and after Christ.
    - Both Old and New Testament believers are included in the same covenant community.
    - The promises made to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all believers.
    - Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are signs and seals of the same covenant reality.
    - "For the sake of Christ’s merits, God grants us forgiveness of sins and eternal life by grace." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 21)

2. **Christ as Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Christ is the only Mediator who fulfills the covenant’s demands and secures its blessings.
    - All covenant promises find their “Yes” and “Amen” in Him.
    - The covenant relationship is grounded in Christ’s atoning work.
    - Faith in Christ is the means by which individuals are incorporated into the covenant.
    - "We believe that we have no access to God except through the one and only Mediator and Intercessor: Jesus Christ the righteous." (Belgic Confession Art. 26)

3. **Inclusion of Believers and Their Children**
    - The children of believers are included in the covenant and thus receive the sign of baptism.
    - This inclusion is grounded in God’s promise, not in human merit or understanding.
    - Baptism replaces circumcision as the covenant sign, signifying the washing away of sins.
    - The church is called to nurture covenant children in the faith.
    - "Infants as well as adults are included in God’s covenant and people." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 74)

4. **Law and Gospel in Covenant Context**
    - The law reveals sin and drives believers to Christ, while the gospel proclaims forgiveness and new life.
    - The covenant frames the proper use of law and gospel in the life of the church.
    - Obedience flows from gratitude for redemption, not as a means of earning favor.
    - The moral law remains a guide for covenant living.
    - "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." (Canons of Dort II.8)

5. **Perseverance and Assurance in the Covenant**
    - God sovereignly preserves His covenant people to the end.
    - Assurance of salvation is rooted in God’s unchanging covenant promises.
    - The sacraments strengthen faith by visibly confirming God’s grace.
    - The elect will not finally fall away, as God’s covenant faithfulness is sure.
    - "Whom God has called according to His purpose, He will never forsake in the course of their pilgrimage." (Canons of Dort V.8)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the confessional identity and theological framework of the continental Reformed tradition, especially regarding **covenant theology**. Their articulation of the unity of the **covenant of grace**, the centrality of Christ, and the inclusion of believers’ children has influenced Reformed churches worldwide. These documents continue to serve as doctrinal standards, fostering both ecclesial unity and theological clarity on the nature of God’s redemptive dealings with His people.
