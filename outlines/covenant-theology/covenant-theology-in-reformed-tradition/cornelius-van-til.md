# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til developed **covenant theology** within the **Reformed tradition** by emphasizing the foundational role of the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **covenantal structure of all human knowledge and existence**. He argued that the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are not merely historical arrangements but reflect the basic relationship between God and humanity, shaping epistemology, ethics, and redemption.

- "The Reformed faith teaches that God’s relation to man is always covenantal." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

- The Defense of the Faith
- An Introduction to Systematic Theology
- Christian Theistic Ethics
- The Theology of James Daane (relevant for Van Til’s critique and clarification of covenant concepts)
- Essays on Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Framework for All Theology**
   - The **covenant** is not a secondary theme but the organizing principle of all theology.
   - All divine-human relations, including revelation and redemption, are covenantal in nature.
   - The **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** are foundational for understanding Scripture.
   - The covenant shapes the structure of **systematic theology** and apologetics.
   - "All of man’s relations to God are covenantal." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction in Covenant**
   - The **Creator-creature distinction** is essential for understanding the covenant.
   - Human knowledge and obedience are always dependent on God’s sovereign initiative.
   - The covenant does not erase the ontological difference between God and humanity.
   - The covenant relationship is analogical, not univocal or equivocal.
   - "The covenant idea is the expression of the Reformed emphasis upon the absolute difference between the Creator and the creature." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Covenantal Epistemology**
   - All human knowledge is covenantally conditioned.
   - There is no neutrality; all thought is either in obedience or disobedience to the covenant.
   - **Revelation** is always covenantal, binding humanity to respond in faith or rebellion.
   - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is rooted in covenantal categories.
   - "Man’s knowledge is analogical and covenantal, never autonomous." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of works** established Adam’s original relationship with God.
   - The **covenant of grace** is God’s redemptive response after the Fall.
   - Both covenants reveal God’s unchanging purpose and faithfulness.
   - The unity and distinction of these covenants are crucial for understanding salvation history.
   - "The covenant of works and the covenant of grace are the two main lines along which God’s relation to man is to be understood." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Covenantal Apologetics**
   - Apologetics must be grounded in the reality of the covenant.
   - Unbelievers suppress the truth of God’s covenant in unrighteousness.
   - The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought is covenantal.
   - The defense of the faith is itself a covenantal activity, presupposing God’s revelation.
   - "Apologetics is possible only on the presupposition of the truth of the covenantal revelation of God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s covenantal approach reshaped **Reformed theology** by integrating the **covenant** into epistemology, apologetics, and systematic theology. His emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief influenced generations of theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s work remains foundational for contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** and its implications for Christian worldview and defense of the faith.
