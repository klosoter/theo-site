# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin was a leading figure in the development of **Reformed covenant theology**, articulating a sophisticated and scholastic account of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. He emphasized the federal structure of God’s dealings with humanity, grounding the unity of **redemptive history** in the dual covenants and defending their doctrinal necessity against both Roman Catholic and Socinian critiques.

- "The covenant of grace is nothing else than a gratuitous pact entered into in Christ between God offended and man the offender." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of the Covenants in Turretin’s Institutes (various sections, esp. Vol. 2, Topics 6–12)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- Francis Turretin and the Reformed Tradition (secondary: R. Scott Clark, ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant of Works as Foundational**
    - God established a **covenant of works** with Adam as the representative head of humanity.
    - The promise was **eternal life** upon perfect obedience; the threat was death for disobedience.
    - This covenant is distinct from the **covenant of grace** and necessary for understanding the fall.
    - Turretin defends the historicity and theological necessity of this covenant against critics.
    - "The covenant of works is not a legal fiction, but a real and historical arrangement." (Institutes, 8.5.1)

2. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Structure**
    - The **covenant of grace** is God’s gracious response to the fall, offering salvation through Christ.
    - It is administered differently in the Old and New Testaments but is essentially one in substance.
    - Christ is the mediator and fulfiller of the covenant, securing its promises for the elect.
    - The covenant of grace is unconditional in its foundation but conditional in its administration.
    - "The covenant of grace is one in substance, though various in its administration." (Institutes, 12.1.7)

3. **Federal Headship and Representation**
    - Adam and Christ serve as **federal heads** in their respective covenants.
    - Adam’s disobedience brings condemnation; Christ’s obedience brings justification.
    - This federal structure undergirds the doctrines of **original sin** and **imputed righteousness**.
    - Turretin insists on the necessity of representation for the coherence of salvation.
    - "As Adam was the head of the covenant of works, so Christ is the head of the covenant of grace." (Institutes, 8.6.5)

4. **Unity and Diversity in the Administration of the Covenant**
    - The **substance** of the covenant of grace remains the same throughout redemptive history.
    - The **administrations** differ: typological and shadowy in the Old Testament, fulfilled in the New.
    - Turretin affirms the continuity of the people of God across both testaments.
    - He rejects dispensational separations, emphasizing the unity of the church.
    - "The covenant of grace is the same in substance under both testaments, though different in mode." (Institutes, 12.1.7)

5. **Polemic Against Roman Catholic and Socinian Views**
    - Turretin critiques the Roman Catholic conflation of law and gospel within the covenant.
    - He opposes Socinian denials of the covenant of works and the necessity of satisfaction.
    - His polemics defend the **forensic** and **federal** character of Reformed soteriology.
    - He insists on the biblical basis for the two-covenant structure.
    - "The distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is the foundation of the whole doctrine of salvation." (Institutes, 8.6.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous articulation of **covenant theology** became a standard for later Reformed orthodoxy, shaping confessional documents and theological education in the tradition. His defense of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** provided a durable framework for understanding **redemptive history** and the work of Christ. Turretin’s influence persists in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of federal headship and the unity of the church across the testaments.
