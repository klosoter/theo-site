# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted **covenant theology** within the Reformed tradition by shifting its focus from federal structures to the **inner experience of faith** and the communal life of the church. While he acknowledged the historical importance of **covenant** in Reformed thought, Schleiermacher emphasized the **God-consciousness** and the dynamic relationship between God and humanity over traditional federal schemes.

- "The covenant is not a contract but the living fellowship of God with the community." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers

   - Interprets covenant as the ongoing self-revelation of God in the community.
   - Focuses on the unity of divine-human relationship rather than legal arrangements.
   - Argues that the covenant is realized in the historical life of the church.
   - "The essence of the church is the fellowship of faith, not the legal bond." (The Christian Faith)

   - Christ mediates the covenant by embodying the ideal relationship with God.
   - The church participates in the covenant through union with Christ.
   - The work of Christ is understood primarily in terms of communication of divine life.
   - "In Christ, the covenant reaches its highest fulfillment." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Community and Covenant**

   - The sacraments are signs of the ongoing covenantal fellowship.
   - "The church is the true subject of the covenant." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Historical Development of Covenant**

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **covenant theology** marked a decisive shift from juridical and federal models to a focus on **religious experience** and the communal life of faith. His approach influenced later liberal Protestant thought and challenged traditional Reformed categories, prompting renewed reflection on the nature of the **church** and its relationship to God. While his views diverged from classical Reformed orthodoxy, they contributed to ongoing debates about the meaning and function of covenant in Christian theology.
