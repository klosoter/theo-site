# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not develop a systematic **covenant theology** as later found in the Reformed tradition, but his writings laid important groundwork for understanding the relationship between **Law and Gospel**, the continuity of **God’s promises**, and the centrality of **justification by faith**. While Luther did not articulate a formal **covenant of works** or **covenant of grace**, his emphasis on the unilateral nature of God’s saving action influenced subsequent Reformed formulations of covenantal thought.

- "The promise of God is the cause of faith, and faith is the effect of the promise." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Bondage of the Will
- Commentary on Genesis
- The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
- Luther’s Small and Large Catechisms

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of Promise Over Law**
    - God’s relationship with humanity is grounded in His gracious promises, not human achievement.
    - The Law reveals sin and drives people to seek God’s mercy.
    - The Gospel is the fulfillment of God’s promise, not a new law.
    - Faith clings to God’s promise, which is always prior to human response.
    - "The Law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The Gospel says, 'Believe this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

2. **Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - The Law commands and condemns, while the Gospel offers grace and forgiveness.
    - This distinction is foundational for understanding Scripture and salvation.
    - The Law prepares the way for the Gospel by exposing human inability.
    - The Gospel alone brings life and righteousness through Christ.
    - "Distinguishing between Law and Gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Unilateral Divine Initiative**
    - Salvation is entirely the work of God’s sovereign grace.
    - Human beings contribute nothing to their justification.
    - God’s promises are effective because of His faithfulness, not human merit.
    - The covenant is rooted in God’s action, not mutual agreement.
    - "God does not deal with us according to our works or our worthiness, but according to His mercy and promise." (Commentary on Genesis)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Promise**
    - All Old Testament promises find their fulfillment in Christ.
    - Christ is the mediator who secures the benefits of God’s covenant for believers.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The sacraments are signs of God’s promise, centered in Christ.
    - "All the promises of God find their Yes in Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Redemptive History**
    - There is continuity in God’s saving purpose from Abraham to Christ.
    - The Old Testament covenants point forward to the Gospel.
    - The ceremonial law is fulfilled and abrogated in Christ.
    - The moral law continues to convict and guide believers.
    - "The covenant with Abraham is the promise of Christ, and in Him it is fulfilled." (Commentary on Genesis)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s approach to **Law and Gospel** and his focus on the unilateral nature of God’s promise profoundly shaped later Protestant theology, including the development of **covenant theology** in the Reformed tradition. While he did not construct a formal covenantal framework, his insights into the nature of God’s promises and the centrality of Christ influenced figures like Melanchthon and, indirectly, Reformed theologians such as Olevianus and Ursinus. Luther’s legacy endures in the ongoing Protestant emphasis on the priority of grace and the necessity of distinguishing Law from Gospel in preaching and teaching.
