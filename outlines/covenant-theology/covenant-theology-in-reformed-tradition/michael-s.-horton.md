# Michael Horton (1964– )

Michael Horton is a prominent contemporary Reformed theologian whose work on **covenant theology** underscores the centrality of the **covenant of grace** and the distinction between **law and gospel**. He frames **covenant** as the organizing structure of **redemptive history**, shaping both biblical interpretation and systematic theology.

- "The covenant is the architectural structure of the biblical drama, from creation to consummation." ("God of Promise")

## Key Works

- God of Promise: Introducing Covenant Theology
- Covenant and Salvation: Union with Christ
- The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way
- Introducing Covenant Theology
- People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenant as the Framework of Redemptive History**
    - Argues that **covenant** provides the organizing principle for understanding Scripture.
    - Sees the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as foundational to biblical revelation.
    - Emphasizes the continuity and unity of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Interprets biblical covenants as progressive administrations of the one covenant of grace.
    "Covenant is not merely a theme among others but the very structure of God’s relationship with humanity." ("God of Promise")

2. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - Maintains a sharp distinction between the demands of the **law** and the promises of the **gospel**.
    - Views the **covenant of works** as law-based, requiring perfect obedience.
    - Sees the **covenant of grace** as gospel-based, grounded in Christ’s obedience.
    - Argues that confusion of law and gospel undermines assurance and the sufficiency of Christ.
    "The law commands and the gospel gives; confusing the two is the perennial danger of the church." ("The Christian Faith")

3. **Christ as the Mediator of the Covenant**
    - Teaches that **Christ** fulfills both the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**.
    - Emphasizes the representative obedience and substitutionary atonement of Christ.
    - Argues that **union with Christ** is the means by which believers participate in covenant blessings.
    - Connects the sacraments to Christ’s mediatorial work within the covenant.
    "Jesus Christ is the covenant keeper, the true Israel, and the last Adam." ("Covenant and Salvation")

4. **Sacraments as Covenant Signs and Seals**
    - Views **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** as means of grace within the covenant community.
    - Argues that sacraments signify and seal the promises of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Stresses the objective nature of the sacraments as God’s action, not merely human response.
    - Connects sacramental theology to the broader covenantal structure.
    "The sacraments are God’s visible words, confirming his covenant promises." ("The Christian Faith")

5. **Covenant and Ecclesiology**
    - Asserts that the **church** is the visible community of the covenant.
    - Emphasizes the corporate and generational dimensions of covenant membership.
    - Argues for the inclusion of children in the covenant community through **baptism**.
    - Sees church discipline and preaching as covenantal acts.
    "The church is not a voluntary association but a covenantal people called by God." ("People and Place")
