    "The structure of redemptive history is covenantal, and its center is Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Union with Christ as Central to Covenant Benefits**
    - All benefits of the **covenant of grace** flow from union with Christ.
    - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are inseparable aspects of this union.
    - Covenant membership is defined by participation in Christ’s resurrection life.
    - The forensic and transformative aspects of salvation cannot be separated.
    "Union with the exalted Christ is the central soteriological reality." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Organic Unity of Scripture in Covenant Theology**
    - Advocates a redemptive-historical approach to biblical interpretation.
    - The covenants reveal a single, unfolding plan of salvation.
    - Emphasizes continuity and development from promise to fulfillment.
    - Upholds the authority and coherence of the entire canon in covenantal terms.
    "The unity of Scripture is covenantal and Christocentric." (Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards)

4. **Integration of Soteriology and Eschatology**
    - The **ordo salutis** (order of salvation) must be understood within redemptive history.
    - Highlights the already/not yet tension of covenant blessings.
    - Connects Christ’s resurrection to the inauguration of the new covenant era.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is integral to covenantal soteriology.
    "Eschatology is not an appendix to soteriology but its essential framework." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Confessional Fidelity and Reformed Identity**

    - Critically engages with contemporary challenges to Reformed covenantal distinctives.
    - Maintains continuity with classic Reformed exegesis and doctrine.

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary **Reformed covenant theology**, especially through his focus on **union with Christ** and the integration of **redemptive history** with systematic theology. His influence is evident in the resurgence of biblical-theological approaches at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By emphasizing the organic unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ in the covenants, Gaffin has helped clarify and defend the distinctives of the Reformed tradition for a new generation of scholars and pastors.
