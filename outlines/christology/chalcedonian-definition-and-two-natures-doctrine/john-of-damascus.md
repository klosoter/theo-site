# John of Damascus (c. 675–749)

John of Damascus was a pivotal figure in articulating and defending the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ. He emphasized the full reality of both the **divine** and **human natures** in the one **Person of Christ**, upholding the unity and distinction without confusion, change, division, or separation, as defined at Chalcedon.

- "We confess one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, made known in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.3)

## Key Works

- "Exposition of the Orthodox Faith" (De Fide Orthodoxa)
- "Dialogue Against the Manichees"
- "On Heresies"
- "Homilies on the Nativity and the Transfiguration"
- Andrew Louth, "St John Damascene: Tradition and Originality in Byzantine Theology" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Insists on the **hypostatic union**: Christ is one Person in two natures.
    - Upholds the four Chalcedonian adverbs: "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
    - Rejects both **Nestorianism** (division of natures) and **Monophysitism** (confusion of natures).
    - Grounds Christological orthodoxy in the authority of the **ecumenical councils**.
    - "We do not divide the natures, but we distinguish them by reason and by their properties." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.3)

2. **Full Reality of Both Natures**
    - Asserts that Christ is truly **God** and truly **man**, possessing all that is proper to each nature.
    - Emphasizes that the **divine nature** remains impassible and immutable.
    - Maintains that the **human nature** is complete, including a rational soul and body.
    - Stresses that the properties of each nature are preserved in the union.
    - "Each nature wills and acts in accordance with its own properties, in communion with the other." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.19)

3. **Unity of the Person (Hypostasis)**
    - Teaches that the two natures are united in the one **hypostasis** of the Son.
    - Rejects any suggestion of two Sons or two Christs.
    - The union is not a mingling or blending, but a true personal union.
    - The subject of all Christ’s actions is the one Person of the Word.
    - "The Word of God became man, not by changing His own nature, but by taking on human nature into His own hypostasis." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.2)

4. **Communication of Idioms (Communicatio Idiomatum)**
    - Attributes the properties and actions of both natures to the one Person.
    - Allows for statements such as "God suffered" or "the Lord of glory was crucified," properly understood.
    - Insists that the natures themselves do not interchange properties, but the Person acts through both.
    - This communication safeguards the reality of the incarnation and redemption.
    - "We say that Christ suffered and was crucified, not as God, but as man; yet it is the same Person who is both God and man." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.27)

5. **Role of the Virgin Mary as Theotokos**
    - Defends the title **Theotokos** ("God-bearer") for Mary, affirming the unity of Christ’s person.
    - Argues that denying Theotokos undermines the reality of the incarnation.
    - Connects the doctrine to the preservation of both natures in the one Person.
    - Uses Marian doctrine to refute heresies that divide or confuse Christ’s natures.
    - "She truly gave birth to God incarnate, not to a mere man." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.12)

## Legacy and Impact

John of Damascus became a definitive voice for **Chalcedonian Christology** in the Eastern tradition, systematizing the two-natures doctrine for subsequent generations. His clear articulation of the **hypostatic union** and the communication of idioms shaped both Byzantine and later Western theology. His work provided a standard of orthodoxy against heresies and influenced the theological vocabulary of both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions. John’s synthesis remains foundational for understanding the person of Christ in classical Christian theology.
