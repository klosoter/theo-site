# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher critically engaged the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** by reinterpreting classical Christology through the lens of religious experience and **God-consciousness**. He questioned the metaphysical categories of **person** and **nature**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s consciousness rather than a strict ontological duality, thus departing from traditional **Reformed** and **orthodox** formulations.

- "The Redeemer, as a human being, is distinguished from all others by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On the Doctrine of the Two Natures in Christ (various sermons and lectures)
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Christliche Sittenlehre (Christian Ethics)
- Secondary: Gerrit Berkouwer, The Person of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Primacy of God-Consciousness in Christ**
   - Christ’s uniqueness lies in his perfect and uninterrupted **God-consciousness**.
   - The divine and human are united in the consciousness, not in metaphysical substance.
   - Rejects the Chalcedonian focus on "two natures" as abstract and speculative.
   - Christ’s role is paradigmatic for the religious life of the community.
   - "The divine essence is not a second nature in Christ, but the constant potency of God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Rejection of Metaphysical Dualism**
   - Critiques the use of **substance** and **nature** language as unhelpful.
   - Sees the Chalcedonian Definition as rooted in outdated philosophical categories.
   - Argues that the unity of Christ is existential, not ontological.
   - Emphasizes the historical Jesus over metaphysical speculation.
   - "The formula of two natures is not a necessary expression of the Christian faith." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Redefinition of Personhood**
   - Christ’s personhood is defined by his function as Redeemer, not by ontological composition.
   - The unity of Christ is a unity of consciousness and vocation.
   - The traditional hypostatic union is reinterpreted as a unity of divine purpose.
   - Personhood is relational and dynamic, not static or metaphysical.
   - "The Redeemer is not a compound of two persons or natures, but the one in whom God’s purpose is fully realized." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Soteriological Focus**
   - Christ’s saving work is grounded in his perfect God-consciousness.
   - The two-natures doctrine is secondary to the experience of redemption.
   - The community’s participation in Christ’s God-consciousness is central.
   - The significance of Christ is existential and transformative, not metaphysical.
   - "The communication of the divine to the human is the basis of redemption, not a metaphysical union." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Historical Critique of Chalcedon**
   - Views Chalcedon as a product of its historical context, not binding for all time.
   - Argues for doctrinal development in light of contemporary thought.
   - Sees the two-natures formula as a provisional expression of faith.
   - Calls for reinterpretation of Christology in terms relevant to modern consciousness.
   - "The doctrine of two natures must be understood as a historical formulation, not as an eternal truth." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **two-natures doctrine** profoundly influenced modern **liberal theology** and the trajectory of Christological reflection. By shifting the focus from metaphysical categories to **religious experience** and **God-consciousness**, he paved the way for existential and psychological approaches to Christology. His legacy is controversial in orthodox circles but foundational for many subsequent theological movements that seek to reconcile faith with modernity.
