# Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444)

Cyril of Alexandria was a central figure in the development of the **two-natures doctrine** and the **Chalcedonian Definition**. He vigorously defended the **unity of Christ’s person** against Nestorianism, emphasizing the **hypostatic union**—the inseparable joining of **divine and human natures** in the one person of Christ.

- "We do not divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons... but we affirm that the Word, by having united to himself hypostatically flesh endowed with a rational soul, became man in an ineffable and incomprehensible manner." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

## Key Works

- Third Letter to Nestorius
- Twelve Anathemas Against Nestorius
- On the Unity of Christ
- Commentary on John
- Letters to Succensus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ is one **person** (hypostasis) in whom **divine and human natures** are united.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The **Word** (Logos) truly became flesh, not merely indwelling a human.
    - The properties of each nature are preserved in the union.
    - "The Word, having united to himself hypostatically flesh endowed with a rational soul, became man." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

2. **Rejection of Nestorianism**
    - Opposed the teaching that Christ was two separate persons.
    - Emphasized the singularity of the **Son of God** incarnate.
    - Insisted on the use of **Theotokos** (God-bearer) for Mary.
    - Saw Nestorius’s view as dividing Christ’s person and undermining salvation.
    - "It is not that a man was born of the holy Virgin, but that God the Word, having become flesh, was born of her." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The attributes of both natures can be predicated of the one person.
    - The suffering and death of Christ are attributed to the **Word** according to his humanity.
    - Maintains the distinction of natures while affirming their union in one subject.
    - This principle undergirds orthodox Christological language.
    - "The Word suffered in the flesh, not in the Godhead." (On the Unity of Christ)

4. **Soteriological Necessity of the Union**
    - Only if Christ is truly God and truly man can he mediate salvation.
    - The union enables the **deification** (theosis) of humanity.
    - Salvation depends on the real participation of the divine in human experience.
    - The hypostatic union is essential for the efficacy of the atonement.
    - "For he was made man that we might be made God." (On the Incarnation)

5. **Scriptural Christology**
    - Christological doctrine must be grounded in the **Scriptures**.
    - Interpreted biblical texts to affirm the unity of Christ’s person.
    - Used exegesis to refute heretical Christologies.
    - Emphasized the continuity of Old and New Testament witness to Christ.
    - "We do not invent words out of our own heads, but we follow the divine Scriptures." (Commentary on John)

## Legacy and Impact

Cyril’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** was foundational for the **Chalcedonian Definition** and shaped the orthodox understanding of the **two-natures doctrine**. His terminology and arguments became central to later Christological debates and ecumenical councils. While his precise formulations were sometimes nuanced by later theologians, his insistence on the unity of Christ’s person remains a cornerstone of classical Christology.
