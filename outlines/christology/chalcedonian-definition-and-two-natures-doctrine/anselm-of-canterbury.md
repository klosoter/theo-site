# Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)

Anselm of Canterbury affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** as foundational for understanding the person of **Christ** and the logic of the **atonement**. He insisted that the union of **true God** and **true man** in the one person of Christ was necessary for the satisfaction of divine justice, grounding his soteriology in the framework established by Chalcedon.

- "For it is necessary that the selfsame Person who is to make this satisfaction be perfect God and perfect man." ("Cur Deus Homo")

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Christ is acknowledged in two natures, **divine and human**, without confusion or division.
    - The **hypostatic union** is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The integrity of both natures is maintained in the one person of the Son.
    - Anselm upholds the boundaries set by Chalcedon against both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors.
    - "He is so truly both God and man that neither nature is lacking to the other." (Cur Deus Homo)

2. **Necessity of the God-Man for Atonement**
    - Only one who is truly **God** can offer infinite satisfaction to God.
    - Only one who is truly **man** can represent humanity and make satisfaction on its behalf.
    - The two-natures doctrine is not abstract but essential for the logic of redemption.
    - The mediator must be both fully divine and fully human to reconcile God and man.
    - "It is necessary that the selfsame Person who is to make this satisfaction be perfect God and perfect man." (Cur Deus Homo)

3. **Unconfused and Inseparable Natures**
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of Christ without mixture.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The unity of person does not abolish the distinction of natures.
    - Anselm resists any reduction of Christ’s humanity or divinity.
    - "The same one is perfect God and perfect man, made up of a rational soul and human flesh." (Cur Deus Homo)

4. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Docetism**
    - Christ is not a mere man adopted by God, but the eternal Son incarnate.
    - The humanity of Christ is real, not an appearance.
    - The two-natures doctrine guards against both the denial of Christ’s deity and his true humanity.
    - Anselm’s Christology is rooted in the **orthodox catholic tradition**.
    - "He did not take on a man, but became man." (Cur Deus Homo)

5. **Christ’s Person as the Ground of Redemption**
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work depends on his unique person as **God-man**.
    - The satisfaction offered is of infinite worth because of the divine nature.
    - The offering is truly human, fulfilling the demands of justice for humanity.
    - The **Chalcedonian Christology** undergirds Anselm’s entire soteriology.
    - "No one, therefore, but God can make this satisfaction, and no one but man ought to make it; it is necessary, therefore, that a God-man should make it." (Cur Deus Homo)

## Legacy and Impact

Anselm’s rigorous articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** provided a crucial bridge between patristic Christology and medieval theology. His defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped later Western understandings of the person and work of Christ, especially in the context of atonement theology. Anselm’s influence endures in both Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, as his Christological framework remains foundational for orthodox confessions and systematic theology.
