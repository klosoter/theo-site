# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the **Chalcedonian Definition** and uphold the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ as foundational to Reformed Christology. These confessions articulate the full **divinity and humanity of Christ**, emphasizing the unity of His person without confusion or separation, in continuity with the ecumenical creeds.

- "We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only Son of God—eternally begotten, not made nor created, for then he would be a creature. He is one in essence with the Father; coeternal; the exact image of the person of the Father and the 'reflection of his glory,' being in all things like him." (Belgic Confession, Article 10)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (Articles 10, 18, 19)
- Heidelberg Catechism (Questions 15–18)
- Canons of Dort (Head II)
- Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian) as referenced in the confessions
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)

   - Recognizes the authority of the **ecumenical creeds** as doctrinal standards.
   - "We confess, therefore, that he is very God and very man: very God by his power to conquer death, and very man that he might die for us according to the infirmity of his flesh." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

2. **Full and True Humanity of Christ**
   - Asserts that Christ assumed a real human nature, body and soul.
   - Denies any docetic or merely apparent humanity.
   - Emphasizes Christ’s solidarity with humanity in all things except sin.

   - Denies that the natures are mixed or changed into one another.
   - Maintains the distinction of natures even in the union.

   - "So that by these means we confess Christ to be true God and true man—true God in order to conquer death by his power, and true man that he might die for us according to the infirmity of his flesh." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

5. **Necessity of the Two Natures for Redemption**

   - The two-natures doctrine is essential for the believer’s assurance and comfort.

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have provided enduring confessional clarity on the **two-natures doctrine**, ensuring that Reformed churches remain anchored in the **Chalcedonian Christological tradition**. Their careful articulation has shaped catechesis, preaching, and theological education in the Reformed world. By consistently referencing and upholding the ecumenical creeds, these confessions have fostered both catholicity and doctrinal precision within the broader Christian tradition.
