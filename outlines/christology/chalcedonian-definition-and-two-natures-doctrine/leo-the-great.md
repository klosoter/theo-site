# Leo the Great (c. 400–461)

Leo the Great was a pivotal figure in the development of the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ. He insisted that Christ is one Person in two distinct and unconfused **natures**, fully **divine** and fully **human**, a position that became foundational for orthodox **Christology**. Leo’s theological clarity, especially in his **Tome to Flavian**, shaped the outcome of the Council of Chalcedon and safeguarded the unity of Christ’s person.

- "For each form does what is proper to it with the cooperation of the other; that is, the Word does what is proper to the Word, and the flesh what is proper to the flesh." (Tome to Flavian)

## Key Works

- Tome to Flavian (Epistola 28)
- Sermons (Sermones)
- Letters (Epistolae)
- The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon (as preserved in conciliar documents)
- Leo the Great and the Spiritual Rebuilding of a Universal Rome (J. M. S. Cowdrey)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Christ is one **Person** (hypostasis), not two.
    - The divine and human natures are united without division or separation.
    - The unity preserves the integrity of both natures.
    - This unity is essential for the efficacy of redemption.
    - "Each nature performs what is proper to it in communion with the other." (Tome to Flavian)

2. **Distinction of Natures**
    - The **divine** and **human** natures remain distinct within the one Person.
    - There is no confusion or change between the natures.
    - Each nature retains its own attributes and operations.
    - The distinction safeguards both Christ’s true humanity and true divinity.
    - "The property of each nature is preserved, and comes together into one Person." (Tome to Flavian)

3. **Fullness of Humanity and Divinity**
    - Christ is fully **God** and fully **man**.
    - He possesses a rational soul and a true human body.
    - His divinity is consubstantial with the Father; his humanity is consubstantial with us.
    - Both natures are complete and perfect.
    - "He who is true God is also true man, and there is no illusion in this unity." (Tome to Flavian)

4. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The attributes of both natures are ascribed to the one Person.
    - The divine acts through the human, and the human is upheld by the divine.
    - This communication does not blend or confuse the natures.
    - It enables Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "Each form does what is proper to it with the cooperation of the other." (Tome to Flavian)

5. **Soteriological Necessity**
    - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The unconfused union is essential for the reality of salvation.
    - Christ’s two natures ensure the efficacy of his redemptive work.
    - The doctrine guards against both **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism**.
    - "The mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, could not have reconciled us to God unless he was both God and man." (Sermon 21)

## Legacy and Impact

Leo the Great’s articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** became the doctrinal standard for orthodox Christology in both East and West. His influence at the Council of Chalcedon ensured the rejection of heresies such as **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism**, and his **Tome** remains a touchstone for later theological reflection. Leo’s Christological clarity shaped the trajectory of Christian doctrine and provided a foundation for subsequent ecumenical councils. His legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ in the church’s confession.
