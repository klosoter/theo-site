# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** with a strong emphasis on the mystery and paradox inherent in the union of **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ. He affirmed the **orthodox Christological formulations** of Chalcedon while critically engaging with their historical development and ongoing theological relevance, highlighting the necessity of maintaining both the **unity of Christ’s person** and the **distinction of natures** without confusion or separation.

- "The confession of the two natures in Christ is not a speculative construction but a confession of the mystery of the incarnation." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced engagement with the **Chalcedonian Definition** has influenced Reformed and ecumenical Christological discussions, especially in his insistence on the mystery and humility required in approaching the **two-natures doctrine**. His work has encouraged theologians to remain anchored in **biblical revelation** while respecting the boundaries set by historic creeds. Berkouwer’s legacy endures in his ability to combine doctrinal fidelity with critical reflection, shaping contemporary conversations on the person and work of Christ.
