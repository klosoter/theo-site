# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** as essential for orthodox Christology, emphasizing the true **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion or separation. Kuyper integrated these classical doctrines into his broader **Reformed theology**, highlighting their significance for understanding the mediatorial work of Christ and the foundation of Christian faith.

- "The union of the two natures in the one person of the Mediator is the central mystery of the Christian confession." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust affirmation of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped Dutch Reformed theology and reinforced the centrality of orthodox Christology within the Neo-Calvinist tradition. His integration of the two-natures doctrine into the broader framework of **Reformed soteriology** and ecclesiology influenced subsequent theologians and church confessions. Kuyper’s insistence on the mystery and confession of Christ’s person continues to inform contemporary Reformed discussions on Christology and the doctrine of the Mediator.
