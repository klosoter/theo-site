# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** through the lens of his existential and ontological theology. He critiqued traditional formulations for their static metaphysics, instead emphasizing the **symbolic** and **paradoxical** nature of Christ’s divinity and humanity as expressions of the **New Being** that overcomes existential estrangement.

- "The assertion that Jesus as the Christ is true God and true man is a paradox, not a contradiction." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- The New Being
- A History of Christian Thought
- Christology and Symbolism (essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Chalcedon**
   - The Chalcedonian formula is a symbol pointing to the mystery of the Christ event.
   - Tillich resists literal or metaphysical readings of "two natures."
   - The language of "true God and true man" expresses existential realities, not ontological substances.
   - The symbol unites the finite and infinite in the person of Christ.
   - "The two-natures doctrine is a symbol for the paradox of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Existential Significance of the Two Natures**
   - Christ’s divinity and humanity address the human condition of estrangement.
   - The union of natures is meaningful as it relates to the healing of existential separation.
   - The doctrine is valuable for its power to transform human existence.
   - The focus is on the existential encounter with Christ, not metaphysical speculation.
   - "The Christ is the New Being in whom the gap between essential and existential being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Critique of Substantialist Metaphysics**
   - Tillich rejects the static substance metaphysics underlying classical Christology.
   - He interprets Chalcedon through the categories of existential ontology.
   - The "natures" are not substances but polarities within the event of the Christ.
   - The doctrine must be reformulated in terms of existential participation.
   - "The traditional doctrine is valid only if it is understood as expressing existential polarities." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Paradox and Mystery in Christology**
   - The two-natures doctrine is inherently paradoxical, not logically resolvable.
   - Paradox is essential to expressing the mystery of the Incarnation.
   - Tillich affirms the necessity of paradox for genuine theological understanding.
   - The paradox points to the depth dimension of faith, not to contradiction.
   - "The paradox is the only adequate expression for the unity of the divine and the human in Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Christ as the Bearer of the New Being**
   - Christ represents the actualization of the New Being, transcending estrangement.
   - The two natures are united in the event of the New Being, not in a metaphysical union.
   - The significance of Christ lies in his power to mediate reconciliation.
   - The doctrine serves to articulate the transformative encounter with the divine in Christ.
   - "In him the New Being has appeared, and this is the meaning of the doctrine of the two natures." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of the **Chalcedonian Definition** challenged traditional Christological formulations and influenced later **liberal Protestant** theology. His emphasis on **symbolism** and the existential dimension of doctrine provided a new framework for engaging classical dogma in the modern context. While controversial among confessional theologians, Tillich’s approach remains a significant resource for those seeking to relate the two-natures doctrine to contemporary philosophical and existential concerns.
