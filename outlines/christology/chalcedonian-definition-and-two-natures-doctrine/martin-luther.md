# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the orthodox **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, insisting that Jesus Christ is both fully **divine** and fully **human** in one **person**. Luther’s distinctive contribution lay in his articulation of the **communicatio idiomatum**, emphasizing the real participation of Christ’s human nature in the attributes of the divine, especially in the context of the **Lord’s Supper**.

- "He who does not believe that God is man is not a Christian; he who does not believe that man is God is not a Christian." (Sermons on John, LW 22:115)

## Key Works

- "The Babylonian Captivity of the Church" (1520)
- "Sermons on John" (Luther’s Works, Vol. 22)
- "The Large Catechism" (1529)
- "Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper" (1528)
- "The Smalcald Articles" (1537)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
   - Christ is one **person** in two distinct **natures**, divine and human.
   - The natures are united "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
   - Luther upheld the **orthodox Christology** of the early councils.
   - He rejected both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors.
   - "We believe, teach, and confess that the Son of God assumed the human nature into His own person." (Smalcald Articles)

2. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Attributes)**
   - The properties of both natures are truly communicated to the one person of Christ.
   - This doctrine is central to Luther’s understanding of the **real presence** in the Eucharist.
   - Luther emphasized that the human nature shares in divine attributes through the personal union.
   - He opposed any separation of the natures in the work and presence of Christ.
   - "Wherever Christ is, there is the whole person, who is both God and man." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

3. **Rejection of the Reformed Extra Calvinisticum**
   - Luther denied that the divine Logos exists outside the incarnate Christ in a way that would divide the person.
   - He insisted on the omnipresence of Christ’s humanity due to the union with the divine.
   - This led to his critique of the Reformed view of the Lord’s Supper.
   - Luther saw the Reformed as undermining the unity of Christ’s person.
   - "God and man are so united that they are one person, and wherever Christ is, there is the whole Christ." (Confession Concerning Christ’s Supper)

4. **Centrality of the Incarnation for Salvation**
   - The union of the two natures is essential for the work of **atonement**.
   - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
   - The benefits of Christ’s work are grounded in the unity of his person.
   - Luther’s soteriology depends on the true humanity and divinity of Christ.
   - "He has become our salvation because He is both God and man." (Large Catechism)

5. **Pastoral and Sacramental Implications**
   - The two-natures doctrine undergirds Luther’s theology of the **sacraments**, especially the Eucharist.
   - Christ’s presence in the Supper is real because of the personal union.
   - The believer’s assurance rests on the unbreakable union of Christ’s natures.
   - Luther’s Christology is always oriented toward the comfort and faith of the church.
   - "This is my body, which is given for you." (Babylonian Captivity of the Church)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **Chalcedonian Christology** shaped Lutheran orthodoxy and distinguished it from both Roman Catholic and Reformed traditions, particularly in debates over the **Lord’s Supper**. His emphasis on the **communicatio idiomatum** remains a hallmark of Lutheran theology. Luther’s Christological commitments continue to influence ecumenical dialogues and underscore the centrality of Christ’s person and work in Christian faith and practice.
