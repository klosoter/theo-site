# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen staunchly defended the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ as essential to orthodox Christianity. He argued that the true deity and true humanity of Christ, united in one person without confusion or division, are foundational for the **gospel**, the authority of **Scripture**, and the coherence of **Reformed Christology**.

- "The really important thing about the two natures is that both are there." ("The Person of Jesus")

## Key Works

- The Person of Jesus (1937)
- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Virgin Birth of Christ (1930)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- New Testament Greek for Beginners (1923) [background for exegesis]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Full Deity and Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ possesses a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - Denial of either nature undermines the **atonement** and the gospel.
    - The **Chalcedonian formula** safeguards against heresies such as **Docetism** and **Arianism**.
    - The two natures are united in one person, not mixed or confused.
    - "Jesus was both God and man; if He was not both, then the whole of the Christian message is false." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Unity of the Person**
    - The **hypostatic union** means Christ is one person with two natures.
    - There is no division of consciousness or will within Christ.
    - The unity of personhood is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The person of Christ is the acting subject of both divine and human actions.
    - "The New Testament everywhere attributes to one and the same person acts and experiences that are truly divine and truly human." (The Person of Jesus)

3. **Necessity of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy**
    - The **Chalcedonian Definition** is a non-negotiable boundary for Christian faith.
    - It preserves the mystery and integrity of the incarnation.
    - Machen saw departures from Chalcedon as leading to theological liberalism.
    - Chalcedon provides the framework for understanding biblical revelation about Christ.
    - "The doctrine of the two natures is not a product of speculation, but a safeguard of the facts revealed in Scripture." (The Person of Jesus)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Two Natures**
    - The New Testament presents Christ as both fully God and fully man.
    - Machen emphasized exegesis of key texts (e.g., John 1, Philippians 2).
    - The two-natures doctrine arises from biblical data, not philosophical speculation.
    - Scripture’s authority undergirds the church’s Christological confessions.
    - "The New Testament teaching about Jesus is the foundation of the church’s doctrine of His person." (The Person of Jesus)

5. **Soteriological Implications**
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can be the **mediator**.
    - The two natures are necessary for Christ’s substitutionary atonement.
    - Denial of the doctrine leads to a loss of the gospel’s saving power.
    - Machen linked Christology directly to the heart of the Christian message.
    - "If Jesus was only man, then we are without a Savior." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the two-natures doctrine shaped 20th-century American Reformed theology and provided a bulwark against theological liberalism. His insistence on the necessity of orthodox **Christology** influenced generations of pastors and scholars, especially within confessional Presbyterianism. Machen’s work remains a touchstone for those upholding the classic formulations of Christ’s person in the face of modern challenges.
