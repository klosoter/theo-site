# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not directly participate in the formulation of the **Chalcedonian Definition** (451), but his Christological reflections laid crucial groundwork for later articulation of the **two-natures doctrine**. He emphasized the true **humanity** and **divinity** of Christ, insisting on the unity of Christ’s person while distinguishing the properties of each nature. Augustine’s thought deeply influenced Western understanding of **hypostatic union** and the relationship between **nature** and **person** in Christ.

- "For the same one is truly Son of God and truly Son of Man, truly God and truly man." (Sermon 192)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- Sermons (especially Sermons 184, 187, 192)
- Letters (notably Letter 137 to Volusianus)
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
   - Christ is one **person** (persona), not a composite or divided being.
   - The **Word** assumed human nature without confusion or separation.
   - Both **natures** (divine and human) are united in the one Christ.
   - The unity preserves the full reality of both natures.
   - "He is not two sons of God, one God and the other man, but one Son of God—God and man together." (Sermon 192)

2. **Full Divinity of Christ**
   - Christ is consubstantial with the **Father** according to his divine nature.
   - The **Logos** is eternally begotten, not made.
   - The divine nature is not diminished by the incarnation.
   - Christ’s divine attributes remain intact in the union.
   - "He who was God was made man, but did not cease to be God." (Enchiridion 35)

3. **Full Humanity of Christ**
   - Christ assumed a complete **human nature**: body, soul, and will.
   - The humanity is real, not an appearance or mere instrument.
   - Christ’s human experiences (hunger, sorrow, death) are genuine.
   - The human nature is not absorbed or overwhelmed by the divine.
   - "He took upon him the form of a servant, yet lost not the form of God." (Sermon 187)

4. **Distinction Without Separation**
   - The two natures retain their distinct properties.
   - There is no **mixture** or **confusion** of natures.
   - Actions are attributed to the one person, but according to each nature.
   - The communication of attributes is grounded in the unity of person.
   - "Each nature performs its own proper function in communion with the other." (De Trinitate I.7)

5. **Soteriological Necessity of the Two Natures**
   - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
   - The divine nature provides the power to save; the human nature enables representation and substitution.
   - The union is essential for the efficacy of Christ’s work.
   - The two-natures doctrine safeguards the reality of redemption.
   - "For unless the Mediator between God and men took upon Him the nature of both, He could not reconcile them." (Enchiridion 36)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s Christology profoundly shaped the Western reception of the **Chalcedonian Definition**, providing conceptual tools for understanding the **hypostatic union**. His careful distinction between **nature** and **person** influenced later theologians such as Leo the Great and the medieval scholastics. While not a direct architect of Chalcedon, Augustine’s legacy endures in the ongoing articulation of orthodox Christology and the defense of the full **humanity** and **divinity** of Christ.
