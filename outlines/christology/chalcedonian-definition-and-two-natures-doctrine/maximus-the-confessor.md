# Maximus the Confessor (c. 580–662)

Maximus the Confessor was a pivotal defender of the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, articulating a robust account of the unity of Christ’s **divine and human natures**. He insisted on the full integrity of both natures, especially in the context of the **Monothelite controversy**, emphasizing that Christ possesses both a divine will and a human will, without confusion or division. Maximus’s Christology became foundational for later **orthodox** formulations of the person of Christ.

- "We do not say that the natures are divided, but that the natural properties are preserved in the union." (Opuscula Theologica et Polemica)

- Questions to Thalassius
- Letters (Epistulae)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Two Natures after the Union**
   - Christ retains both **divine** and **human natures** after the incarnation.
   - The union does not abolish or blend the properties of either nature.
   - Each nature acts according to its own properties within the one person.
   - The integrity of both natures is essential for salvation.
   - "The Word, having become flesh, did not change what He was, but assumed what He was not." (Ambigua 5)

2. **Dyothelitism: Two Wills in Christ**
   - Christ possesses both a **divine will** and a **human will**.
   - The human will is not abolished or overridden by the divine.
   - The two wills operate in harmony, not opposition.
   - This preserves the full reality of Christ’s humanity.
   - "In Christ there are two natural wills and two natural operations, without division or confusion." (Disputation with Pyrrhus)

3. **Unconfused and Inseparable Union**
   - The union of natures is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
   - The person of Christ is the locus of unity, not the fusion of natures.
   - Both natures remain distinct yet united in the one person.
   - This union is the basis for true mediation between God and humanity.
   - "The mystery of Christ is not the abolition of the difference of the natures, but their union in one and the same person." (Ambigua 41)

4. **Theological Necessity of the Human Will**
   - The human will is essential for Christ’s role as the new Adam.
   - Redemption requires that Christ’s human will freely obeys the divine will.
   - The human will is healed and perfected, not destroyed.
   - This affirms the reality of Christ’s human experience and obedience.
   - "If Christ did not have a human will, He could not have healed our will." (Opuscula Theologica)

5. **Soteriological Implications of Chalcedonian Christology**
   - Only one who is fully God and fully man can reconcile humanity to God.
   - The two-natures doctrine safeguards the reality of both divine initiative and human response in salvation.
   - Christ’s obedience in both natures is the ground of human deification.
   - The integrity of the natures ensures the efficacy of the atonement.
   - "That which is not assumed is not healed; but what is united to God is saved." (Epistulae)

## Legacy and Impact

Maximus the Confessor’s defense of **Chalcedonian Christology** decisively shaped the outcome of the Monothelite controversy and was affirmed at the Third Council of Constantinople. His articulation of the **two-natures and two-wills** doctrine became a cornerstone for later Eastern and Western orthodox theology. Maximus’s insights into the unity and distinction within Christ’s person continue to inform contemporary discussions on the incarnation and the nature of salvation. His legacy endures as a touchstone for orthodox reflection on the mystery of Christ.
