# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the orthodox articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, affirming that Jesus Christ is truly **God and man** in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. He insisted that this doctrine preserves both the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ, which are united in the **hypostatic union** and essential for the work of **redemption**.

- "The person of Christ is the great central fact of the history of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the Person of Christ)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Formula**
    - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the standard for orthodox Christology.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of confessing Christ as one person in two distinct natures.
    - Rejects both **Nestorianism** (dividing the person) and **Eutychianism** (confusing the natures).
    - Sees Chalcedon as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
    - "The Council of Chalcedon expressed the doctrine in terms which have ever since been accepted by the Church." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Full Deity and Humanity of Christ**
    - Asserts that Christ possesses all attributes of true **Godhead** and true **manhood**.
    - Denies any diminution of either nature in the incarnation.
    - Insists that Christ’s human nature is complete, including a rational soul and body.
    - Maintains that both natures are necessary for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "He is as truly man as He is truly God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Unity of the Person (Hypostatic Union)**
    - Teaches that the two natures are united in one **person** (hypostasis).
    - Rejects any notion of a divided or dual personality in Christ.
    - Affirms that the union is personal, not merely moral or accidental.
    - The one person of Christ acts through both natures.
    - "The union is not between two persons, but between two natures in one person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Distinction Without Separation or Confusion**
    - The divine and human natures remain distinct, each retaining its own properties.
    - There is no mixture or absorption of one nature into the other.
    - The natures are inseparably united, yet not altered by the union.
    - This distinction safeguards the integrity of both Christ’s deity and humanity.
    - "The two natures are united, but not confounded; distinct, but not separate." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Soteriological Necessity of the Two-Natures Doctrine**
    - Argues that only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Christ’s divinity gives infinite value to his atonement; his humanity enables him to represent and substitute for humans.
    - The two-natures doctrine undergirds the efficacy of Christ’s priestly, prophetic, and kingly offices.
    - Denial of either nature undermines the gospel and the possibility of salvation.
    - "If Christ were not God, He could not save us; if He were not man, He could not be our substitute." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped generations of Reformed and evangelical theologians, especially in the American context. His clear articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** became a standard reference in systematic theology and seminary education. By grounding Christology in both Scripture and historic creeds, Hodge helped ensure the ongoing confessional integrity of the **Princeton tradition** and broader Reformed orthodoxy. His influence endures in contemporary discussions of Christ’s person and work.
