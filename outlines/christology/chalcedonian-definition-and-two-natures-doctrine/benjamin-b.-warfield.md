# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield staunchly defended the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, emphasizing the full **deity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion or division. He saw Chalcedon as the definitive articulation of orthodox **Christology**, safeguarding the integrity of both natures against ancient and modern errors.

- "The two natures are united in one person, but continue each to preserve its own attributes." ("The Person of Christ")

## Key Works

- "The Person of Christ" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 2)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "The Humanity and Divinity of Christ" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "Incarnation and Inspiration"
- "The Christ that Paul Preached"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Full Deity and Humanity of Christ**
   - Christ possesses all the attributes of true **God** and true **man**.
   - Warfield insists on the completeness of both natures, rejecting any diminution.
   - The **divine nature** is not altered or limited by the incarnation.
   - The **human nature** is real, rational, and complete.
   - "Jesus Christ is God and man in one person, and it is only as such that He can be our Redeemer." ("The Person of Christ")

2. **Unity of the Person**
   - The two natures are united in the one **hypostasis** or person of the Son.
   - There is no mixture or confusion of the natures.
   - The unity is personal, not merely moral or cooperative.
   - Warfield affirms the **communicatio idiomatum** as grounded in the personal union.
   - "The two natures are united in one person, but continue each to preserve its own attributes." ("The Person of Christ")

3. **Chalcedonian Orthodoxy as Normative**
   - Warfield upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the standard for Christological orthodoxy.
   - He argues that Chalcedon provides the necessary boundaries against heresy.
   - The Definition maintains the balance between **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors.
   - Warfield sees Chalcedon as the culmination of biblical and patristic reflection.
   - "The Definition of Chalcedon is the terminus of the Church’s Christological confession." ("The Person of Christ")

4. **Rejection of Kenotic and Modernist Christologies**
   - Warfield critiques **kenotic** theories for compromising Christ’s deity.
   - He opposes any view that divides or diminishes the person of Christ.
   - Modernist reductions of Christ’s divinity are seen as a return to ancient heresies.
   - Warfield insists on the unchanging divine nature throughout the incarnation.
   - "The kenotic theory is not so much an explanation as a denial of the doctrine of the incarnation." ("The Person of Christ")

5. **Redemptive Necessity of the Two-Natures Doctrine**
   - Only one who is both fully **God** and fully **man** can mediate between God and humanity.
   - The two-natures doctrine undergirds the efficacy of Christ’s atoning work.
   - Warfield connects the person of Christ directly to the work of redemption.
   - Any compromise on the two natures undermines the gospel itself.
   - "If Christ be not God and man in one person, He is not, and cannot be, our Redeemer." ("The Person of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Christology** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and remains a touchstone for evangelical orthodoxy. His insistence on the integrity of both natures in the one person of Christ provided a bulwark against both liberal and sectarian distortions. Warfield’s work continues to inform contemporary discussions on the person and work of Christ, ensuring that the **two-natures doctrine** remains central to confessional theology.
