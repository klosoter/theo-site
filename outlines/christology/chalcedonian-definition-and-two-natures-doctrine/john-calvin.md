# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** as essential to orthodox Christology. He insisted on the **true union** of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**, rejecting any confusion, separation, or mingling of the natures. Calvin’s approach emphasized the practical and redemptive significance of the **incarnation** for the believer’s salvation.

- "We affirm that Christ is true God and true man, and that by the unity of person the two natures are so joined that they cease not to retain their own properties." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters xiii–xiv)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Theological Treatises (e.g., "Short Treatise on the Lord’s Supper")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Formula**
    - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the best summary of biblical teaching on Christ’s person.
    - Maintains the distinction yet unity of **divine and human natures** in Christ.
    - Rejects both **Nestorian division** and **Eutychian confusion** of natures.
    - Sees Chalcedon as a safeguard for the reality of both Christ’s deity and humanity.
    - "We, too, confess that Christ is very God and very man, in one person." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Insists that the **Logos** assumed a complete human nature, body and soul.
    - The two natures are united in one **hypostasis** (person), not blended or altered.
    - The personal union is real and enduring, not merely functional or temporary.
    - Christ’s actions are always those of the one person, not divided between natures.
    - "For we teach with one voice, that the divinity was so joined and united with the humanity, that the entire properties of each nature remain whole and unimpaired." (Institutes II.xiv.4)

3. **Distinction of Natures Maintained**
    - Both natures retain their distinct properties after the union.
    - The divine nature is not limited or changed by the human, nor vice versa.
    - The human nature is not deified or absorbed into the divine.
    - This distinction is crucial for the reality of Christ’s mediation and atonement.
    - "For we do not imagine a Christ who is God and man, as if he were compounded out of two natures, but we teach that he is God and man, according to the peculiar property of each nature." (Institutes II.xiv.6)

4. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
    - The properties of each nature are truly attributed to the one person.
    - Calvin rejects any transfer or mixing of attributes between natures.
    - The person acts according to either nature, but the natures themselves remain distinct.
    - This doctrine safeguards the reality of Christ’s suffering and divine power.
    - "Whatever is peculiar to each nature is so distinctively kept, that it does not pass over from the one to the other." (Institutes II.xiv.6)

5. **Soteriological Significance of the Two Natures**
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can be the **Mediator**.
    - Christ’s humanity enables him to represent and redeem humanity.
    - His divinity gives infinite value and efficacy to his work.
    - The two-natures doctrine is essential for the believer’s assurance of salvation.
    - "For we could not have had God as a Redeemer, unless he had become man, nor could man have reached God, unless God had come down to him." (Institutes II.xii.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** shaped Reformed confessions and catechisms, ensuring continuity with the ecumenical creeds. His careful distinction and union of natures influenced later Reformed Christology and polemics against both Lutheran and Socinian errors. Calvin’s emphasis on the practical, redemptive implications of the **Chalcedonian Definition** continues to inform contemporary Reformed theology and preaching.
