# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas robustly affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine**, articulating a Christology that upholds the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in the **one person** of the Son. He employs the tools of **scholastic theology** and **Aristotelian metaphysics** to clarify the unity of Christ’s person and the distinction of his natures, emphasizing the **communicatio idiomatum** and the integrity of both natures without confusion or division.

- "It must be said that in Christ there is only one hypostasis and one person, namely, the person of the Son of God." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 2, a. 3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, Part III (Questions 1–59)
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV (Chapters 27–55)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- De Veritate, Question 29
- Compendium Theologiae, Chapters 221–228

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Person (Hypostatic Union)**
   - Christ is one **person** (hypostasis), not a conjunction of two persons.
   - The **divine Word** assumes a complete human nature, not a human person.
   - The union is in the person, not in the nature or will.
   - The **hypostatic union** is unique and unrepeatable.
   - "Therefore, it must be said that in Christ there is only one person, namely, the person of the Son of God." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 2, a. 3)

2. **Distinction of Natures**
   - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
   - The two natures remain distinct, neither confounded nor changed.
   - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
   - The distinction is real, not merely conceptual.
   - "The distinction of natures is not destroyed by their union in one person." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 2, a. 1)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum**
   - The properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one person.
   - Divine and human attributes are attributed to Christ in virtue of the **personal union**.
   - The communication is not between natures, but from the natures to the person.
   - This grounds orthodox statements such as "God suffered" or "the Son of Man came down from heaven."
   - "Whatever belongs to either nature can be predicated of the person of Christ." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 16, a. 1)

4. **Integrity of Christ’s Humanity**
   - Christ assumed a true and complete human nature: body, soul, and rational mind.
   - His humanity is not diminished or absorbed by the divinity.
   - Christ’s human will and intellect are real and operative.
   - The human nature is assumed impersonal (anhypostatic), but personalized in the Word (enhypostatic).
   - "The Word of God assumed a complete human nature, that is, a body and a soul." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 5, a. 1)

5. **Necessity and Fittingness of the Incarnation**
   - The Incarnation is the most fitting means for human salvation.
   - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
   - The union of natures enables Christ’s redemptive work.
   - The Incarnation reveals the fullness of **divine grace** and love.
   - "It was most fitting that God should become incarnate for the salvation of man." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 1, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s synthesis of the **Chalcedonian Definition** with Aristotelian philosophy became foundational for Western Christology, shaping both Catholic and Protestant thought. His careful articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** provided a standard for later theological reflection and ecumenical dialogue. Aquinas’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of Christ’s person and work, especially regarding the relationship between **nature** and **person** in Christ. His work remains a touchstone for orthodox Christological formulations.
