# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** as a crucial articulation of Christ's person, emphasizing the unity of **divine and human natures** in the one **Person of Jesus Christ**. While upholding the classical **two-natures doctrine**, Barth reinterpreted it within his **Christocentric** framework, stressing the dynamic event of the **incarnation** and the inseparability of Christ's deity and humanity.

- "The Chalcedonian formula is not a static definition, but a pointer to the living mystery of Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Chalcedonian Definition as Normative but Dynamic**
    - Barth affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as a faithful witness to the mystery of Christ.
    - He sees Chalcedon as a guide rather than a final, exhaustive explanation.
    - The Definition is valuable for its boundaries: "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
    - Barth insists that the Definition points beyond itself to the living reality of Christ.
    - "Chalcedon is not a terminus but a signpost on the way to the mystery of Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - The **one Person** of Jesus Christ is the central reality, not an abstract union of natures.
    - Barth rejects any division or parallelism between the divine and human in Christ.
    - The unity is actualized in the event of the incarnation, not as a metaphysical synthesis.
    - The **personal union** is the basis for all Christological reflection.
    - "The subject of the incarnation is the one Lord, Jesus Christ." (Church Dogmatics IV/2)

3. **True Deity and True Humanity**
    - Barth insists that Jesus Christ is fully **God** and fully **man**.
    - Both natures are real and complete, without diminution or confusion.
    - The **humanity** of Christ is not a mere appearance but genuine and essential.
    - The **deity** of Christ remains undiminished in the incarnation.
    - "He who became man in Jesus Christ was and is God." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Rejection of Abstract Metaphysics**
    - Barth critiques speculative metaphysical accounts of the two natures.
    - He emphasizes the **revelatory event** of Christ over philosophical categories.
    - The doctrine must serve the proclamation of the gospel, not abstract speculation.
    - Barth prefers biblical and doxological language to metaphysical precision.
    - "We must not let the dogma become a metaphysical puzzle, but a confession of faith." (Dogmatics in Outline)

5. **Christology as the Center of Theology**
    - All doctrine, including the two-natures, is oriented around the **person and work of Christ**.
    - Barth’s **Christocentrism** shapes his reading of Chalcedon and all dogmatic loci.
    - The incarnation is the decisive act of **revelation** and reconciliation.
    - The two-natures doctrine is meaningful only as it serves the knowledge of Christ.
    - "All theology is Christology." (Church Dogmatics IV/3)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s interpretation of the **Chalcedonian Definition** revitalized modern Christology by grounding it in the event of the incarnation and the unity of Christ’s person. His approach challenged both liberal reductionism and scholastic abstraction, influencing generations of theologians to reconsider the meaning of the **two-natures doctrine**. Barth’s Christocentric method remains a touchstone for contemporary discussions of the person of Christ and the ongoing relevance of Chalcedon.
