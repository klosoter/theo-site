# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the definitive articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** in Christology, affirming the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion or separation. He emphasized the enduring significance of Chalcedon for maintaining the integrity of both natures and safeguarding the mystery of the **incarnation** within the framework of **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- "The church has always maintained that in Christ the divine and human natures are united in one person, without confusion, change, division, or separation." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Chalcedonian Christology**
    - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the church’s normative statement on Christ’s person.
    - Asserts the necessity of both **true divinity** and **true humanity** in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the unity of the **person** of Christ, not a mixture of natures.
    - Rejects both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors as threats to orthodox Christology.
    - "Chalcedon did not explain the mystery; it set boundaries within which the church must think and speak." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Maintains that the **divine and human natures** are united in the one **hypostasis** of the Son.
    - Insists that the **person** of Christ is the eternal Logos, not a human individual.
    - The two natures retain their distinct properties without confusion.
    - The unity is personal, not merely moral or accidental.
    - "The subject of the incarnation is the person of the Son, not a human being." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.284)

3. **Integrity of Both Natures**
    - Christ’s **divine nature** remains fully divine, unaltered by the incarnation.
    - Christ’s **human nature** is complete, including body and soul, and is not absorbed by the divine.
    - Both natures act in communion, yet each retains its own attributes.
    - The communicatio idiomatum is grounded in the unity of the person, not a fusion of natures.
    - "The two natures remain distinct, unconfused, and unmingled, each retaining its own attributes." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.295)

4. **Rejection of Kenoticism**
    - Opposes theories that diminish or alter Christ’s **divinity** in the incarnation.
    - Argues that the Logos did not give up divine attributes but assumed human nature.
    - Sees kenotic Christologies as incompatible with Chalcedonian boundaries.
    - Emphasizes the immutability and impassibility of the divine nature.
    - "The incarnation is not a self-emptying of the Logos, but an assumption of human nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.286)

5. **Mystery and Limits of Human Comprehension**
    - Recognizes the **incarnation** as a profound mystery beyond full human understanding.
    - Warns against speculative attempts to explain the mechanics of the union.
    - Stresses the importance of **faithful adherence** to scriptural and confessional boundaries.
    - Encourages reverence and humility before the mystery of Christ’s person.
    - "The church confesses the mystery, not by explaining it, but by setting boundaries for reverent faith." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **Chalcedonian Definition** has shaped modern Reformed Christology, ensuring continuity with the catholic tradition while engaging contemporary challenges. His careful balance of **orthodoxy** and theological humility has influenced generations of theologians in both academic and ecclesiastical contexts. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the person of Christ, the nature of the incarnation, and the enduring relevance of classical doctrinal formulations.
