# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the essential articulation of Christ’s **two-natures doctrine**, affirming the full **deity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. He emphasized the necessity of Chalcedonian categories for maintaining a biblically faithful **Christology** and safeguarding the integrity of the **incarnation** and **redemption**.

- "The Chalcedonian formula is not an intrusion upon the witness of Scripture but the necessary formulation of its teaching respecting the person of Christ." (Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "The Person of Christ" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Reformed Faith and Modern Substitutes" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)
- "Systematic Theology" lectures (Westminster Theological Seminary, unpublished but influential)
- "The Nature of the Atonement" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Formula**
    - Upholds the **one person, two natures** doctrine as biblically necessary.
    - Insists on the **without confusion, without change, without division, without separation** clauses.
    - Views Chalcedon as a faithful summary of **Scriptural Christology**.
    - Rejects both **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism** as contrary to biblical teaching.
    - "The Chalcedonian definition is the bulwark against every form of Christological error." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Full Deity and Full Humanity of Christ**
    - Asserts Christ is **truly God and truly man**.
    - Maintains that Christ’s **divine nature** is not diminished by the incarnation.
    - Emphasizes the **real and complete human nature** assumed by the Son.
    - Argues that both natures retain their distinct properties.
    - "The reality of our Lord’s humanity is as essential as the reality of his deity." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Unity of the Person**
    - Stresses the **hypostatic union**: two natures in one person.
    - Rejects any division of Christ into two persons or subjects.
    - Affirms that all actions of Christ are the actions of the one **divine-human person**.
    - Insists that the unity is not a fusion or mixture of natures.
    - "The subject of all the acts of the Mediator is the one person, the Son of God." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Biblical Foundation of Chalcedon**
    - Argues that Chalcedon is a necessary inference from the **biblical witness**.
    - Sees the New Testament as demanding both the full deity and full humanity of Christ.
    - Critiques any Christology that departs from the **Scriptural data**.
    - Uses exegesis to support the **orthodox formulation**.
    - "The doctrine of the two natures is not speculative but exegetical." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Soteriological Necessity**
    - Connects the two-natures doctrine to the efficacy of **redemption**.
    - Argues that only one who is both God and man can be **Mediator**.
    - Insists that the integrity of the **atonement** depends on the Chalcedonian Christ.
    - Maintains that denial of either nature undermines **salvation**.
    - "If Christ were not both God and man, he could not redeem us." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** has shaped Reformed and evangelical understandings of the **person of Christ** in the twentieth century. His careful exegesis and theological clarity provided a model for integrating **biblical theology** with historic orthodoxy. Murray’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **Christology**, especially in affirming the necessity of the two-natures doctrine for a coherent doctrine of redemption. His work remains a standard reference for those seeking a faithful exposition of the **incarnation** within the Reformed tradition.
