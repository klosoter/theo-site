# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** as essential to orthodox **Christology**, emphasizing the unity and distinction of **divine and human natures** in the person of Christ. He argued that these doctrines safeguard the mystery of the **incarnation** while maintaining the Creator-creature distinction, and he integrated them into his broader **Reformed apologetic** framework.

- "The Chalcedonian formula is the only adequate expression of the mystery of the incarnation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy**
    - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the definitive statement on Christ’s person.
    - Insists on the full **deity and humanity** of Christ without confusion or separation.
    - Views Chalcedon as a necessary boundary against both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors.
    - Sees the definition as a safeguard for the integrity of **redemptive history**.
    - "The church has rightly insisted that Christ is one person with two natures, unmixed, unchanged, undivided, and inseparable." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Creator-Creature Distinction in Christology**
    - Emphasizes that the union of natures does not blur the line between **Creator and creature**.
    - Argues that only the **Second Person of the Trinity** assumes human nature.
    - Maintains that the incarnation is a unique, non-repeatable event in **redemptive history**.
    - Warns against any Christology that compromises the transcendence of God.
    - "The incarnation does not mean that God becomes man in such a way that the distinction between God and man is lost." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Analogical Knowledge and Mystery**
    - Stresses that human knowledge of the **incarnation** is always analogical, not exhaustive.
    - Affirms the **mystery** of the two-natures doctrine as essential to true worship.
    - Rejects rationalistic attempts to fully explain the union of natures.
    - Encourages humble submission to the limits of **revelation**.
    - "We must accept the mystery of the two natures in Christ as it is revealed, not as we would construct it." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Centrality of the Incarnation**
    - Sees the **incarnation** as the climax of God’s self-revelation in history.
    - Connects the two-natures doctrine to the fulfillment of **covenant promises**.
    - Argues that only the God-man can accomplish **atonement**.
    - Integrates Christology into the broader narrative of **creation, fall, and redemption**.
    - "The incarnation is the heart of the Christian faith because it is the only basis for redemption." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Apologetic Significance of Orthodox Christology**
    - Uses the **Chalcedonian Christ** as a foundation for **presuppositional apologetics**.
    - Argues that non-Christian worldviews cannot account for the unity and diversity found in Christ.
    - Maintains that only orthodox Christology provides coherence to the doctrines of **revelation** and **salvation**.
    - Challenges all forms of **Christological reductionism** as ultimately self-defeating.
    - "Without the Chalcedonian Christ, there is no intelligible basis for Christian theism." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped generations of Reformed theologians and apologists, reinforcing the centrality of orthodox **Christology** in systematic theology. His integration of the two-natures doctrine into a presuppositional framework influenced the way Reformed thinkers approach both doctrine and apologetics. Van Til’s insistence on the mystery and necessity of the **incarnation** continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between **revelation** and reason.
