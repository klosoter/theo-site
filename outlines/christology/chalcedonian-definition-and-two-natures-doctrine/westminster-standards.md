# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards affirm the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** by upholding the full **deity** and **humanity** of Christ in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. Rooted in classical **Reformed Christology**, the Standards articulate the unity of Christ’s person and the distinction of his **natures**, ensuring the integrity of both for the sake of redemption.

- "Two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (Westminster Confession of Faith, VIII.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially Chapters VIII and II)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–40)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on Christ’s person and work)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the incarnation and mediation of Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Definition**
    - Explicitly upholds the language and categories of **Chalcedon** (451 AD).
    - Asserts Christ is "truly God and truly man" in one person.
    - Rejects all forms of **Nestorianism** and **Eutychianism**.
    - Maintains the integrity of both natures without confusion or separation.
    - "So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person." (WCF VIII.2)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Christ is one person, the only **Mediator** between God and man.
    - The personal union is not a mixture but a true union.
    - The person of the Son assumed human nature, not a human person.
    - All actions of Christ are theandric, belonging to the one person.
    - "Which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man." (WCF VIII.2)

3. **Distinction of the Two Natures**
    - The **divine** and **human** natures remain distinct and unconfused.
    - Each nature retains its own properties.
    - The natures are united without conversion, composition, or confusion.
    - The distinction is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "The two natures are united in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WLC Q.36)

4. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - The two-natures doctrine is essential for Christ’s role as **Redeemer**.
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate and atone.
    - The human nature enables Christ to obey and suffer.
    - The divine nature gives infinite value to his obedience and suffering.
    - "It was requisite that the Mediator should be God, that he might sustain and keep the human nature from sinking under the infinite wrath of God." (WLC Q.38)

5. **Rejection of Heresies**
    - Explicitly denies **Arian**, **Nestorian**, **Eutychian**, and **Socinian** errors.
    - Affirms the orthodox boundaries set by the early ecumenical councils.
    - Protects the church from Christological confusion and division.
    - Ensures doctrinal clarity for worship and preaching.
    - "Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures; by each nature doing that which is proper to itself." (WLC Q.40)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have provided a definitive **Reformed articulation** of the Chalcedonian Christological framework, shaping confessional identity and doctrinal clarity for generations. Their precise language on the **two-natures doctrine** has influenced countless Reformed churches and theological institutions. By rooting their Christology in the historic creeds, the Standards have ensured continuity with the broader catholic tradition while safeguarding the distinctives of Reformed theology.
