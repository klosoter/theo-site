# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He questioned the metaphysical categories underlying traditional **Christology**, arguing that the significance of Jesus Christ lies not in ontological formulations but in the existential encounter with the **kerygma**. For Bultmann, the proclamation of Christ is meaningful only insofar as it addresses the individual's existence before God.

- "The Christ who is preached is not a mythological figure but the eschatological event in which God encounters man." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "Kerygma and Myth" (1948, with contributions by Bultmann)
- "Faith and Understanding" (1969)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christological Formulas**
    - Traditional **two-natures doctrine** is rooted in outdated metaphysical concepts.
    - The language of **Chalcedon** must be reinterpreted to speak meaningfully to modern people.
    - Mythological elements should be translated into existential terms.
    - The focus shifts from ontological claims to the existential significance of Christ.
    - "We cannot use electric light and the wireless and avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Christ**
    - Christ is encountered as the decisive event of God's self-revelation.
    - The meaning of Christ's person is found in the call to authentic existence.
    - The **incarnation** is not a metaphysical union but an existential event.
    - Faith is not assent to doctrine but a response to the kerygma.
    - "What matters is not the objective fact of the two natures, but the existential decision to follow Christ." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Rejection of Ontological Christology**
    - The metaphysical categories of **substance** and **nature** are foreign to the New Testament.
    - The Chalcedonian formula is a product of Hellenistic thought, not apostolic witness.
    - Christological dogma should not be confused with the proclamation of the gospel.
    - The reality of Christ is accessible only in the act of faith.
    - "The question of Christ's person is not a question of metaphysics but of existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - The **kerygma** is the proclamation of the event of Christ, not a metaphysical explanation.
    - The saving significance of Christ is found in the preached word.
    - The two-natures doctrine is secondary to the existential encounter with the message.
    - The church's task is to proclaim, not to explain metaphysical mysteries.
    - "Faith is not assent to propositions but surrender to the word that addresses me." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Historical-Critical Approach to Doctrine**
    - Doctrinal formulations must be understood in their historical context.
    - The **Chalcedonian Definition** reflects a particular stage in doctrinal development.
    - Modern theology must critically assess inherited dogmas.
    - The enduring value of Christology lies in its existential relevance, not its metaphysical precision.
    - "Dogma is valid only insofar as it expresses the existential meaning of the gospel." (Kerygma and Myth)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** and the existential interpretation of Christian faith. His insistence on demythologization challenged traditional dogmatic formulations and redirected theological focus toward the existential encounter with the **kerygma**. While controversial, his work forced later theologians to grapple with the relationship between historical doctrine and contemporary faith, leaving a lasting mark on both liberal and critical theological discourse.
