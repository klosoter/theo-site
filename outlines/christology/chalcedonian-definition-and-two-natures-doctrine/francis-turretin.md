# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin robustly affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, emphasizing the **hypostatic union** of true humanity and true divinity in the one person of the Son. He maintained the **immutability** and **inseparability** of Christ's natures, upholding the Reformed tradition's commitment to the integrity of both natures without confusion, change, division, or separation.

- "The two natures are so united in the person of Christ that they are not confounded, nor is the one changed into the other, nor are they separated or divided, but each remains entire in its own properties." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 13.8.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 2, Topics 13–14)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- John Beardslee, *Reformed Dogmatics* (secondary, for summary of Turretin's Christology)
- Richard Muller, *Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics* (secondary, for context and analysis)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Hypostatic Union**
   - Christ is one person in two distinct, unconfused natures: **divine** and **human**.
   - The union is personal (hypostatic), not essential or accidental.
   - The natures retain their own properties and operations.
   - The union was effected at the moment of the Incarnation.
   - "The union is not an essential or accidental one, but hypostatic, that is, personal." (Institutes 13.7.2)

2. **Rejection of Eutychianism and Nestorianism**
   - Eutychian confusion of natures is denied; the natures are not mingled or fused.
   - Nestorian division of persons is rejected; Christ is not two persons.
   - Each heresy is critiqued as undermining the work of redemption.
   - The **Chalcedonian Definition** is upheld as the orthodox standard.
   - "We must avoid both the confusion of natures and the division of persons." (Institutes 13.8.5)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
   - The properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one person.
   - There is no transfer or mixing of essential attributes between natures.
   - The communication is of the person, not of the natures themselves.
   - This doctrine safeguards the reality of Christ’s suffering and divinity.
   - "The communication of properties is not a communication of the natures, but of the person." (Institutes 13.10.2)

4. **Impeccability and Immutability of Christ**
   - Christ’s divine nature is impeccable and immutable.
   - The human nature, though capable of suffering, is preserved from sin by the union.
   - The person of the Son ensures the sinlessness of the human nature.
   - The two natures act in concert, but according to their own properties.
   - "The human nature was sanctified and preserved from all sin by its union with the Word." (Institutes 13.14.6)

5. **Necessity of the Two-Natures for Redemption**
   - Only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate between God and humanity.
   - The divine nature gives infinite value to Christ’s work; the human nature enables substitution.
   - The unity of person ensures the efficacy of Christ’s obedience and suffering.
   - The two-natures doctrine is essential for the doctrine of **atonement**.
   - "If Christ were not true God and true man, he could not be our Mediator and Redeemer." (Institutes 13.12.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of the **Chalcedonian Christology** shaped Reformed orthodoxy and provided a systematic bulwark against both ancient and contemporary Christological errors. His articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** influenced later confessional standards and remains a touchstone for Reformed dogmatics. Turretin’s careful distinctions and polemical clarity continue to inform theological education and ecumenical dialogue on the person of Christ.
