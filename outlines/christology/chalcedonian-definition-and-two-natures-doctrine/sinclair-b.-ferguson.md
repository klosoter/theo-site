# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the essential articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** in Christology, emphasizing the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. He situates Chalcedon as a safeguard for orthodox **Trinitarian** and **soteriological** convictions, stressing its ongoing relevance for the church’s confession and worship.

- "The Chalcedonian Definition remains the touchstone of Christological orthodoxy, preserving both the mystery and the reality of the incarnation." (The Holy Spirit)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s exposition of the **Chalcedonian Definition** has reinforced its centrality in contemporary Reformed theology and pastoral ministry. His writings have helped a new generation appreciate the doctrinal precision and spiritual depth of the **two-natures doctrine**. By connecting classical Christology to practical Christian living, Ferguson has ensured that Chalcedon remains not only a historical touchstone but a living confession for the church today.
