# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as a faithful articulation of the biblical witness to the **two natures of Christ**—fully divine and fully human—in one **person**. He emphasizes the importance of **biblical authority** and the necessity of maintaining both the **unity** and **distinction** of Christ’s natures without confusion or separation, interpreting Chalcedon through a Reformed lens that prioritizes scriptural clarity over philosophical speculation.

- "The Chalcedonian formula is not an attempt to explain the mystery of the incarnation, but to set boundaries around our thinking so that we do not fall into heresy." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- "Chalcedon and the Two Natures of Christ" (in various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy**
    - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the ecumenical standard for Christology.
    - Insists on the **full deity and full humanity** of Christ, united in one person.
    - Rejects both **Nestorianism** (separating the natures) and **Eutychianism** (confusing the natures).
    - Sees Chalcedon as a boundary, not an exhaustive explanation.
    - "Chalcedon gives us boundaries, not a blueprint for metaphysical speculation." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Primacy of Scriptural Authority**
    - Grounds all Christological formulations in **biblical revelation**.
    - Critiques speculative approaches that go beyond or against Scripture.
    - Uses Chalcedon as a summary of biblical teaching, not a replacement for exegesis.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture in doctrinal matters.
    - "We must always test our creeds and confessions by the Word of God." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Unity and Distinction in Christ**
    - Maintains the **personal union** of Christ’s two natures.
    - Stresses that the natures are **without confusion, change, division, or separation**.
    - Argues that each nature retains its own attributes.
    - Affirms that the one person of Christ acts through both natures.
    - "Jesus is one person, not two, and his two natures are united without confusion or division." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Rejection of Speculative Metaphysics**
    - Warns against philosophical constructs that overshadow biblical teaching.
    - Prioritizes **biblical categories** over Greek philosophical terms.
    - Accepts mystery where Scripture does not fully explain.
    - Sees the Chalcedonian language as a guardrail, not a comprehensive system.
    - "We must not let philosophical speculation take us beyond what Scripture teaches." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Christological Implications for Redemption**
    - Connects the two-natures doctrine directly to the **work of Christ** in redemption.
    - Argues that only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of the incarnation for **atonement** and **reconciliation**.
    - Sees Chalcedon as safeguarding the gospel itself.
    - "Only the God-man can accomplish the salvation of sinners." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s approach to the **Chalcedonian Definition** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by insisting on the primacy of **biblical authority** in Christological formulations. His work has encouraged theologians to appreciate the boundaries set by Chalcedon while resisting speculative excess. Frame’s emphasis on the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures continues to shape evangelical and Reformed discussions of the person of Christ. His clear articulation of these doctrines has made them accessible to both scholars and lay readers.
