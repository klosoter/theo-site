# Vern Poythress (1946– )

Vern Poythress affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the orthodox articulation of Christ’s **two-natures doctrine**, emphasizing the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. He integrates this classic Christology with a **multiperspectival** approach, highlighting the mystery and coherence of the incarnation within a robust **Reformed** and **biblical-theological** framework.

- "The Chalcedonian formula remains a faithful summary of the biblical teaching about Christ’s person, preserving both his full deity and full humanity." (The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses)

    - Encourages humility before the mystery of Christ’s person.
    - "Multiperspectivalism helps us appreciate the fullness of Christ’s person without collapsing his natures." (Symphonic Theology)

3. **Scriptural Foundation for Two Natures**

## Legacy and Impact

Poythress’s work has reinforced the enduring significance of the **Chalcedonian Definition** within contemporary Reformed theology, especially by integrating it with a multiperspectival and biblical-theological approach. His writings have helped students and pastors appreciate the coherence and mystery of the **two-natures doctrine** while remaining rooted in Scripture. Poythress’s influence extends to debates on Christology, hermeneutics, and the relationship between doctrine and redemptive history. His approach encourages humility and fidelity to the historic confessions of the church.
