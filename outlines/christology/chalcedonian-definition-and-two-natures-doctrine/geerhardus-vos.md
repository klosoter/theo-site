# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos affirmed the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the orthodox articulation of the **two-natures doctrine** of Christ, emphasizing the unity of the **divine and human natures** in the one **person of the Son**. He maintained that Chalcedon provided the necessary theological boundaries to safeguard both the **immutability of the divine nature** and the **true humanity** of Christ, which are essential for a biblically faithful **Christology**.

- "The Chalcedonian formula is not a speculative construction, but the necessary outcome of the scriptural data concerning the person of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus (especially lectures on the person of Christ)
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (for implications of Christ’s person in covenant)
- Pauline Eschatology (for Christological implications in Paul’s writings)
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (touches on the incarnation and person of Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Chalcedonian Formula**
   - Recognizes Chalcedon as the definitive statement on the union of two natures in one person.
   - Upholds the distinction between **divine** and **human natures** without confusion or separation.
   - Emphasizes the necessity of Chalcedon for maintaining orthodox **Christology**.
   - Views the formula as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.
   - "Chalcedon did not invent a new Christ, but confessed the Christ of the Scriptures." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
   - Insists that the **person of the Son** is the subject of both natures.
   - Rejects any division of personhood in Christ.
   - Maintains that all actions of Christ are actions of the one person.
   - Sees the unity as essential for the efficacy of redemption.
   - "The subject of the incarnation is the eternal Son, who assumes human nature without ceasing to be what He was." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Distinction and Integrity of the Two Natures**
   - Asserts that the **divine** and **human natures** remain distinct and unconfused.
   - Denies any mixture or transformation of the natures.
   - Affirms the full reality of Christ’s humanity and deity.
   - Argues that each nature retains its own attributes and operations.
   - "The two natures are united in the one person, but each retains its own properties." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - Stresses that the **divine nature** is not altered by the incarnation.
   - Rejects any notion of kenotic Christology that diminishes divine attributes.
   - Holds that the Son’s assumption of humanity is an addition, not a subtraction.
   - Maintains that Christ’s deity is fully preserved in the union.
   - "The incarnation means addition of human nature, not subtraction from the divine." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Significance of the Incarnation**
   - Connects the two-natures doctrine to the accomplishment of redemption.
   - Argues that only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate between God and man.
   - Sees the incarnation as the climax of **redemptive history**.
   - Emphasizes the necessity of the two-natures for Christ’s priestly and kingly offices.
   - "The God-man alone can stand as Mediator, for only He unites in Himself the two parties to be reconciled." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped Reformed engagement with classical Christology in the twentieth century, ensuring that the **two-natures doctrine** remained central in confessional theology. His integration of biblical theology with dogmatic precision provided a model for subsequent theologians seeking to uphold both the integrity of Scripture and the historic creeds. Vos’s work continues to influence Reformed discussions on the person of Christ, especially in relation to the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures.
