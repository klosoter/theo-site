# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame emphasizes the centrality of **Christ** throughout both the **Old and New Testaments**, arguing that all of Scripture is unified by the person and work of **Jesus Christ**. He maintains that the **covenantal structure** of redemptive history reveals Christ as the fulfillment of **God’s promises**, and that both Testaments must be interpreted with a **Christocentric** focus.

- "The whole Bible is about Jesus, and every part of it points to him." ("The Doctrine of the Word of God")

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Word of God (2009)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (2013)
- Perspectives on the Word of God (1990)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Scripture**
    - Christ is the unifying subject of both Old and New Testaments.
    - All biblical revelation points to or is fulfilled in Christ.
    - The promises, types, and prophecies of the Old Testament culminate in Jesus.
    - The New Testament interprets and clarifies the Christ-centered meaning of the Old.
    - "Jesus is not only the center of the New Testament, but of the whole Bible." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Continuity**
    - The covenants of Scripture progressively reveal God’s redemptive plan in Christ.
    - Old Testament covenants (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic) anticipate Christ’s coming.
    - The New Covenant is the fulfillment and consummation of prior covenants in Jesus.
    - The unity of the covenants underscores the coherence of God’s revelation in Christ.
    - "The covenants are not separate dispensations, but one unfolding promise centered in Christ." (The Doctrine of God)

3. **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament types, symbols, and events prefigure Christ’s person and work.
    - Prophetic promises find their ultimate realization in Jesus.
    - Typology is a legitimate, divinely intended method of reading Scripture.
    - The New Testament authors model this Christ-centered interpretation.
    - "The Old Testament is full of types and shadows that find their reality in Christ." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

4. **Trinitarian Hermeneutics**
    - The interpretation of Scripture is shaped by the triune nature of God.
    - The Father speaks, the Son is the Word, and the Spirit illumines the text.
    - Christ is the mediator of revelation, making God known throughout both Testaments.
    - Trinitarian theology guards against reductionistic readings of Christ in Scripture.
    - "The Trinity is the context in which all biblical revelation, including Christ’s role, must be understood." (The Doctrine of the Word of God)

5. **Multiperspectival Approach**
    - Understanding Christ in Scripture requires multiple perspectives: normative (God’s Word), situational (history), and existential (personal response).
    - No single perspective exhausts the richness of Christ’s presence in the Bible.
    - Multiperspectivalism helps avoid reductionism in biblical theology.
    - This approach encourages humility and depth in reading both Testaments.
    - "We must look at Christ in Scripture from every angle God gives us: his commands, his works, and our response." (Perspectives on the Word of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Frame’s **Christocentric** reading of both Old and New Testaments has influenced contemporary Reformed hermeneutics, especially in emphasizing the unity of Scripture. His **multiperspectivalism** has encouraged theologians to approach biblical texts with greater nuance and depth. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on **covenantal theology** and the role of Christ in redemptive history, making him a significant voice in modern systematic theology.
