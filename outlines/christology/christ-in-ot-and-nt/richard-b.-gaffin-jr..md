# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who emphasizes the centrality of **Christ** in both the **Old and New Testaments**, arguing for a robust **redemptive-historical** approach to Scripture. He maintains that the person and work of **Christ** are organically revealed throughout the canon, with the **Old Testament** anticipating and the **New Testament** fulfilling the promises of redemption. Gaffin’s work underscores the unity of **biblical revelation** and the necessity of interpreting all Scripture in light of **Christ’s resurrection**.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
    - Scripture must be interpreted as a unified story centered on **Christ’s redemptive work**.
    - The **Old Testament** is not merely background but foundational for understanding the **New Testament**.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment are essential for tracing Christ throughout both Testaments.
    - The **progress of revelation** culminates in the person and work of Jesus.
    - "The unity of the Bible is found in the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan in Christ." ("Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation")

2. **Christocentric Reading of Scripture**
    - All of Scripture ultimately points to and is fulfilled in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **apostolic preaching** interprets the Old Testament as testifying to Christ.
    - The **resurrection** is the interpretive key for understanding the Old Testament’s fulfillment.
    - The **New Testament** writers model a Christ-centered hermeneutic for the church.
    - "The New Testament writers see the Old Testament as a book about Christ." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

3. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
    - There is a single, unfolding **covenant of grace** from Genesis to Revelation.
    - The **Old and New Testaments** are organically connected, not artificially joined.
    - The promises to Israel find their true fulfillment in **Christ** and his people.
    - Discontinuities between the Testaments serve the purpose of redemptive fulfillment.
    - "The unity of the covenant is maintained in the organic connection between the Testaments." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

4. **Centrality of the Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection of Christ** is the pivotal event in redemptive history.
    - It provides the framework for understanding both Old Testament prophecy and New Testament fulfillment.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the **eschatological age** anticipated in the Old Testament.
    - All of Christian life and hope is grounded in the reality of Christ’s resurrection.
    - "The resurrection is the hinge on which the entire history of redemption turns." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Revelation**
    - The **Holy Spirit** is the agent of both inspiration and illumination in Scripture.
    - The Spirit enables believers to see Christ in all of Scripture.
    - Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Spirit promised in the Old Testament.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for the church’s ongoing understanding of Christ in the Word.
    - "The Spirit is the bond by which Christ is present and active in his Word." ("Perspectives on Pentecost")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped contemporary **Reformed biblical theology**, especially in the areas of **hermeneutics** and the doctrine of **revelation**. His emphasis on the **redemptive-historical** unity of Scripture has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly within the Westminster tradition. By highlighting the centrality of **Christ’s resurrection** and the organic connection between the Testaments, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for understanding the Bible as a unified, Christ-centered revelation.
