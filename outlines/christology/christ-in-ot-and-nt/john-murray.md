# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray emphasized the centrality of **Christ** in both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament**, arguing that the unity of **redemptive history** is grounded in the person and work of Christ. He maintained that the **covenant of grace** unfolds progressively, with Christ as its focus from Genesis to Revelation, and that the **hermeneutical key** to Scripture is the recognition of Christ’s presence and promise throughout both Testaments.

- "The unity of the covenant of grace is found in Christ, and the Old Testament is as truly the revelation of Christ as the New." 

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied"
- "The Covenant of Grace" (Collected Writings, Vol. 4)
- "The Unity of the Old and New Testaments" (Collected Writings, Vol. 1)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT Commentary)
- "Principles of Conduct"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Redemptive History**
    - Christ is the focal point of both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - The promises and types of the Old Testament find their fulfillment in Christ.
    - The unity of Scripture is grounded in the person and work of Christ.
    - The entire history of redemption is oriented toward the coming and accomplishment of Christ’s mission.
    - "The whole process of revelation and redemption is Christocentric." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Continuity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The covenant of grace spans both Testaments, with Christ as its mediator.
    - Old Testament covenants (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic) are administrations of the one covenant of grace.
    - The New Testament does not replace but fulfills the Old Testament promises.
    - The people of God are one, united in Christ across both Testaments.
    - "There is one people of God, one covenant of grace, one way of salvation." ("The Covenant of Grace")

3. **Typology and Promise in the Old Testament**
    - Old Testament types and shadows point forward to Christ.
    - The sacrificial system, priesthood, and kingship prefigure Christ’s work.
    - Prophetic promises are ultimately realized in the person of Jesus.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but grounded in God’s sovereign design.
    - "The types and prophecies of the Old Testament find their reality in Christ." ("The Unity of the Old and New Testaments")

4. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is organically unified, not merely a collection of disconnected writings.
    - The Old and New Testaments are parts of one unfolding revelation.
    - The progress of revelation is cumulative and coherent, centered on Christ.
    - The authority and inspiration of both Testaments are equally affirmed.
    - "The unity of Scripture is organic, not mechanical." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 1")

5. **Hermeneutical Priority of Christ**
    - Christ is the interpretive key to understanding all of Scripture.
    - Exegesis must account for the Christological focus of both Testaments.
    - The New Testament’s interpretation of the Old is normative for Christian hermeneutics.
    - The church reads the Old Testament in light of the revelation of Christ.
    - "The New Testament is the divinely inspired interpretation of the Old." ("Collected Writings, Vol. 1")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **unity of redemptive history** has shaped Reformed approaches to biblical theology and hermeneutics. His insistence on the **centrality of Christ** in both Testaments has influenced generations of pastors and scholars, particularly within the Westminster tradition. By emphasizing the continuity of the **covenant of grace** and the organic unity of Scripture, Murray provided a theological framework that continues to inform contemporary discussions on Christ in the Old and New Testaments.
