# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther viewed **Christ** as the central figure of both the **Old and New Testaments**, insisting that all of Scripture testifies to Him. He emphasized the unity of the **covenantal promise** and saw the **gospel** as present throughout the entire biblical narrative, with the **law and gospel** distinction clarifying the function of Christ in both testaments.

- "All the stories of Holy Writ, if viewed aright, point to Christ." (Luther’s Works, 22:339)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Genesis (Luther’s Works, Vols. 1–8)
- Preface to the Old Testament (Luther’s Works, Vol. 35)
- Lectures on Galatians (Luther’s Works, Vols. 26–27)
- Sermons on the Gospel Texts (Various volumes in Luther’s Works)
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Scripture**
    - All of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, finds its fulfillment in Christ.
    - The Old Testament contains types and prophecies that are realized in Jesus.
    - Luther rejected interpretations that separated the testaments or diminished Christ’s presence in the Old Testament.
    - He saw the unity of the biblical narrative as grounded in the person and work of Christ.
    - "Take Christ from the Scriptures, and what more will you find in them?" (Preface to the Old Testament)

2. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The Old Testament law reveals sin and the need for redemption.
    - The gospel, present in both testaments, proclaims the promise of salvation through Christ.
    - Luther insisted that the distinction clarifies the role of Christ in both covenants.
    - He warned against confusing law and gospel, which obscures Christ’s saving work.
    - "The law shows us our sin; the gospel shows us our Savior." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament figures and events serve as types pointing to Christ.
    - The promises made to the patriarchs are fulfilled in Jesus.
    - Luther read the Old Testament as a book of promises, not merely moral instruction.
    - He emphasized the continuity of God’s redemptive plan across both testaments.
    - "Whatever is written of Christ in the Old Testament is promise; in the New, fulfillment." (Preface to the Old Testament)

4. **Unity of the Covenants**
    - Luther affirmed one covenant of grace, progressively revealed.
    - He saw the substance of salvation as unchanged from Old to New Testament.
    - The difference lies in the clarity and administration, not in the content of the promise.
    - The faith of Old Testament believers was directed toward Christ, though dimly seen.
    - "The fathers had the same faith and spirit as we, only the revelation was less clear." (Lectures on Genesis)

5. **Scripture Interprets Scripture**
    - Luther advocated for interpreting obscure passages in light of clearer ones, especially Christological texts.
    - He rejected allegorical readings not grounded in the text’s witness to Christ.
    - The New Testament provides the key to understanding the Old.
    - He insisted that Christ is the “hermeneutical key” to all of Scripture.
    - "The Holy Spirit is the simplest writer and speaker in heaven and on earth, and therefore His words can have no more than the one simplest meaning, which we call the written meaning, or the literal meaning, of Scripture." (Preface to the Old Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s insistence on **Christocentric interpretation** shaped Protestant approaches to both biblical theology and exegesis. His robust doctrine of the **law and gospel** distinction continues to influence Reformed and Lutheran traditions. By emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the typological reading of Scripture, Luther provided a foundation for later developments in redemptive-historical hermeneutics. His approach remains a touchstone for understanding the relationship between the Old and New Testaments in Christian theology.
