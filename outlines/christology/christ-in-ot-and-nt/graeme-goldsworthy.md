# Graeme Goldsworthy (1934–2023)

Graeme Goldsworthy is renowned for his robust articulation of **biblical theology**, emphasizing the centrality of **Christ** throughout both the **Old and New Testaments**. He argues that the entire biblical narrative unfolds as a unified story culminating in **Jesus Christ**, with the **kingdom of God** as a central motif that ties together redemptive history. Goldsworthy’s approach insists that all Scripture must be interpreted through the lens of **Christ’s person and work**.

- "The Old Testament is not fully understood except in the light of the gospel." (According to Plan)

## Key Works

- Gospel and Kingdom (1981)
- According to Plan: The Unfolding Revelation of God in the Bible (1991)
- Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture (2000)
- Christ-Centered Biblical Theology (2012)
- The Goldsworthy Trilogy (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Scripture**
    - All of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, finds its fulfillment in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **gospel** is the interpretive key for understanding the entire biblical narrative.
    - The **Old Testament** anticipates and foreshadows Christ, while the **New Testament** reveals and explains Him.
    - Christ’s person and work are the climax of **redemptive history**.
    - "The gospel is the key to understanding the whole Bible." (Gospel and Kingdom)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - The Bible presents a single, unfolding story of **God’s redemptive plan**.
    - **Covenant** structures provide the framework for understanding continuity between the Testaments.
    - The **kingdom of God** motif unites the narrative from Genesis to Revelation.
    - Typology and promise-fulfillment patterns reveal the coherence of Scripture.
    - "Biblical theology is the study of the unity of the message of the Bible." (According to Plan)

3. **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment**
    - **Types** and **shadows** in the Old Testament point forward to their fulfillment in Christ.
    - The promises made to Israel are ultimately realized in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Typological interpretation is essential for reading the Old Testament as Christian Scripture.
    - The **New Testament** authors model this approach in their use of the Old Testament.
    - "The Old Testament is the book of Christ as much as the New Testament." (Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture)

4. **The Kingdom of God as Central Motif**
    - The **kingdom of God** is the organizing theme of biblical revelation.
    - Goldsworthy defines the kingdom as "God’s people in God’s place under God’s rule."
    - This motif structures the progression from creation, through Israel, to Christ and the church.
    - The consummation of the kingdom is found in Christ’s return and the new creation.
    - "The kingdom of God is the unifying theme of the whole Bible." (Gospel and Kingdom)

5. **Necessity of Christ-Centered Preaching**
    - All preaching must be grounded in the **gospel** and point to Christ.
    - The preacher’s task is to show how every text relates to **Jesus** and His redemptive work.
    - Moral or exemplary readings of Scripture are insufficient apart from their connection to Christ.
    - The church is nourished by preaching that unfolds the **whole counsel of God** in Christ.
    - "To preach the whole Bible as Christian Scripture is to preach Christ from all the Scriptures." (Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture)

## Legacy and Impact

Goldsworthy’s work has profoundly shaped the field of **biblical theology**, especially within Reformed and evangelical circles. His insistence on a **Christ-centered reading** of both Old and New Testaments has influenced generations of pastors, scholars, and preachers. The centrality of the **kingdom of God** and the unity of redemptive history remain hallmarks of his legacy, providing a framework for understanding Scripture as a cohesive, gospel-centered narrative.
