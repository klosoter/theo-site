### TITLE
Reading Christ Canonically: Divine Authorship, Redemptive-Historical Unity, and the Apostolic Hermeneutic

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the one triune God speaks one canon in two testaments such that Christ is both subject matter and telos of the Old Testament, and how the New Testament’s christological reading establishes normative hermeneutical principles without collapsing history into allegory.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, John Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Geerhardus Vos, Richard B. Hays.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic hermeneutics under the rule of faith, Reformation and Reformed exegesis, Princeton doctrine of Scripture, Reformed biblical theology, post-critical canonical and intertextual approaches.
- Debates:
  - Internal: typology versus allegory, one-sense versus sensus plenior, christocentric versus christotelic readings, the legitimacy of Christophanies and prosopological exegesis.
  - External: historical criticism and Jewish non-christological readings, denial of predictive prophecy, charges of eisegesis in NT use of the OT.
  - Contemporary: theological interpretation of Scripture, canonical criticism, charge of supersessionism, the apostolic hermeneutic and inerrancy.
- Position defended: Christ is the divinely intended substance and end of the Old Testament, discerned through a **redemptive-historical**, **covenantal** and **typological** hermeneutic regulated by **divine authorship**, apostolic practice, and the **rule of faith**, avoiding arbitrary allegory while affirming a God-intended **sensus plenior**.

### ESSAY
The topic Christ in the Old and New Testaments concerns not a clever method but the ontological and hermeneutical reality of a single divine discourse that unfolds through promise and fulfillment to its telos in the incarnate Son. The claim is that the two-testament canon presents one economy of revelation by one triune speaker whose speech is self-consistent because of **divine simplicity**, whose purposes advance through covenants that are organically and progressively ordered, and whose definitive Word makes the retrospective and prospective sense of all that came before. To treat Christ in the Old and New Testaments, therefore, is to clarify how the Son is present across the canon as subject matter, as the one in whom every divine promise becomes Yes and Amen, and as the hermeneutical key by which Scripture interprets Scripture. This requires staking out a principled account of **divine authorship**, **covenantal unity**, and **typology**, while refusing both a flat biblicism that ignores development and a free-floating allegory that ignores history.

Augustine of Hippo (354–430) is decisive because he stabilized Christian reading along two axes that remain non-negotiable: the rule of faith and charity as hermeneutical norms and the unity of the two testaments in the totus Christus. In De Doctrina Christiana he defines signs and things and insists that Scripture’s literal sense is the basis for all reading, yet he also articulates how figurae point beyond themselves in God’s economy. The Old Testament is Christologically pregnant because the one God orders history figurally, not because readers impose fancies. Augustine’s prosopological exegesis of the Psalms, discerning the voice of Christ and his body in the first-person laments and praises, is not arbitrary but grounded in the identity of Israel’s king as type of the Messiah and in the apostolic appropriation of Psalm 2 and 110. His famous dictum that the New is hidden in the Old and the Old unveiled in the New is often oversimplified. Augustine’s real contribution is to bind signification to the **rule of faith** and to treat Israel’s Scriptures as the testimony of the one economy of grace. Against Manichean dualism he insists that the God who gives the Law is the Father of Jesus Christ and that the Israel-church relation is one people across time under one Mediator. He is concerned with sanctifying desire as well as clarifying meaning. For Augustine, Christ is the lumen that illumines both the literal and spiritual senses because the same Son who speaks in the prophets speaks now in the gospel. This warrants figural reading but disciplines it by the ecclesial confession of the Trinity and the incarnation and by the apostolic pattern of exegesis. Examiners will ask whether Augustine licenses allegory unmoored from the text. The answer is no. Augustine repeatedly subordinates spiritual readings to the literal and to the purposes of cultivating love of God and neighbor; he rejects readings that violate the creed or charity. He offers a metaphysical ground for **typology** by locating it in providence, not in readerly invention, and a canonical ground by locating it within the ecclesial rule of truth.

John Calvin (1509–1564) presses the other half of the task: the reform of exegesis to the literality of the text without surrendering christological substance. In his commentaries and the Institutes he insists on the literal sense as the Spirit’s sense and rejects the uncontrolled medieval fourfold sense. Yet he is not a historicist. He argues the unity of the covenants under one Mediator, refusing any notion that grace is a novelty. Calvin’s **covenantal unity** secures Israel-church continuity in the substance of promise while acknowledging administrative diversity. In practice, Calvin reads the Pentateuch and Psalms with relentless attention to grammar and history while also tracing God’s pedagogical economy toward Christ. He countenances **theophany** and occasionally associates the Angel of the Lord with the preincarnate Son without confusing theophany with incarnation. He reads Psalm 110’s priest-king as directly messianic on the basis of Davidic authorship and the divine oath, and he treats Isaiah 53 as a clear prophecy of the suffering servant fulfilled in Christ. His theology of **accommodation** protects both inspiration and literality; God speaks baby-talk so that human ears might understand. Calvin’s hermeneutical courage is to insist that the spiritual sense is not second-tier but identical with the literal sense when rightly read in its covenantal placement. When examiners press whether Calvin’s literalism suppresses **sensus plenior**, one replies that for Calvin the fuller sense is not a second meaning but the fuller intention of the one divine author realized in the progress of history and accessed through **analogia fidei**. This affirms depth without multiplying senses.

B. B. Warfield (1851–1921) anchors the doctrine of Scripture and the canonical shape of Christology for the modern period. In The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible and across his essays on messianic prophecy, Warfield articulates **inspiration** as concursive operation, where human authors speak freely yet their words are the words of God. This frames the hermeneutical question. If the canon has one divine author, we are obliged to read it according to that author’s intention, which the New Testament manifests. Warfield’s famous claim that the Old Testament contains latent trinitarian revelation that the New renders explicit is not license to read anachronistically but a principle of progressive disclosure. His defense of predictive prophecy counters the historical-critical denial of forward-looking messianism, while his insistence that types are God-instituted patterns links the grammatical-historical to the Christological. Warfield’s Princeton discipline, often caricatured as anti-figural, in fact secures figural reading by grounding it in **divine authorship** and the **canonical form**. The external challenge from critics who claim New Testament authors violate Old Testament contexts meets its reply here: the apostolic hermeneutic is God’s hermeneutic, not a homiletical flourish. Warfield thus supplies the doctrinal scaffolding upon which christological reading stands.

Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949) is the architect of a mature **redemptive-historical** method in which the Old Testament’s Christ-centeredness is neither atomistic nor vague. In Biblical Theology and The Pauline Eschatology he describes revelation as organically embedded in history, advancing under the pressure of eschatological promise. For Vos, typology is not a reader’s analogy but a divinely patterned, symbolically loaded institution or person placed in history as provisional embodiment of the eschaton. The exodus, the tabernacle, Davidic kingship, and priestly cult are divinely minted forms whose telos is Christ. Vos insists that exegesis travel along the grain of redemptive epochs so that Christ is seen as the deep structure of Israel’s life. He privileges texts like Luke 24 where the risen Christ interprets Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms concerning himself, and Hebrews, where cultic and covenantal patterns meet their fulfillment in the Son’s priesthood. Vos supplies the metaphysic that Augustine gestures toward, but he does so with a rigorous attention to textual history. The Old Testament is not a mere set of proof texts; it is the matrix of Christological identity. Internal debates within the Reformed family over one-sense exegesis versus **sensus plenior**, and over a so-called christotelic posture that prefers to say the Old Testament leads to Christ without being about Christ, receive clarity from Vos. He would insist that telos without subject matter guts the canonical claim, while subject matter without telos flattens history. The Old Testament is both about Christ and toward Christ because the living God plotted it so. When pressed on whether Vos sanctions retrospective rereading that changes original meaning, one must emphasize his notion of organic development. Later revelation does not contradict earlier meaning; it reveals its ontological depth within the same divine plan. This is **divine authorship** applied to historical process.

Richard B. Hays (born 1948) represents a decisive modern retrieval of figural reading within a post-critical horizon. In Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul and Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels he develops criteria for identifying intertextual allusion and argues that New Testament writers read the Old with a christological and ecclesial imagination shaped by Israel’s narrative. Hays’s language of figural reading and narrative substructure is helpful in resourcing non-reductive intertextuality. He highlights the way the evangelists depict Jesus as embodying Israel: a new exodus in Matthew, a new servant in Luke-Acts, a new temple in John. Hays’s method supports the claim that Christ is not a late overlay but the eschatological substance toward which Israel’s Scriptures point. The caution required is to tether figural echoes to **divine authorship** and the **rule of faith**, lest figurality drift into reader-response. Hays himself gestures to ecclesial constraints, but a confessional account strengthens the case: the reason these echoes are true is that the Spirit authored both Testaments. Where critics allege eisegesis, the answer is not simply a list of verbal parallels but the affirmation that history has been providentially patterned to yield these correspondences. Hays’s work, allied to Vos’s historical theology and Warfield’s doctrine of Scripture, yields a robust, constructive account.

With these figures in view, we can state the position. Christ is the divinely intended subject and goal of the Old Testament across modes: promise, type, wisdom, and theophany, as well as the telos of law and prophecy. This is not to deny original contexts but to locate them within an **apostolic hermeneutic** that discerns the unity of the drama. Several examiner objections must be faced directly. First, does christological interpretation violate the Old Testament’s historical integrity. The answer is no, because God’s providence shapes history typologically. A type is a real historical entity whose God-intended meaning exceeds its immediate horizon. The exodus is liberation for Israel and also an eschatological pattern that Christ fulfills in his death and resurrection. The book of Hebrews teaches us to read cultic law as a shadow of heavenly reality embodied in the Son’s priesthood. This is **analogical knowledge** in action. The analogy between sign and fulfillment is not arbitrary because the same God authored both. Calvin’s literal sense and Vos’s epochal context preserve historicity, while Augustine’s and Hays’s figural insight keeps us from reduction.

Second, does New Testament use of the Old Testament mishandle context. Consider Matthew 2’s use of Hosea 11. Out of Egypt I called my son is a backward glance at the exodus. Matthew reads it typologically, not as a simple prediction but as a providential pattern that culminates in Christ as true Israel. This is grounded in **federal headship**. The corporate son finds fulfillment in the individual Son who recapitulates Israel’s life. Similarly, Paul’s argument in Galatians 3 about the seed does not ignore collective singular usage. It argues that the promise’s logic is ultimately concentrated in one representative, Christ, in whom the many find their inheritance. These are not mistakes of grammar but theological readings of providentially shaped semantics under **divine authorship**. When examiners query whether this depends on **sensus plenior**, the answer is yes if sensus plenior is defined as God-intended fullness of meaning, revealed in the progress to Christ and normed by apostolic usage. It is one sense in God, historically unfolded and canonically disclosed.

Third, are Christophanies legitimate. The Angel of the Lord speaks as God, receives worship, and distinguishes himself from God. The phenomenon is best read within a **Trinitarian economy** as a theophanic anticipation of the Son’s mediatorial role, not as an incarnation before the incarnation. Augustine and Calvin both acknowledge such theophanies while guarding the distinction between theophany and assumption of human nature. This reading is secured by the church’s **Trinitarian** confession and by the New Testament’s identification of Christ as the Rock who followed Israel and as the Lord whose glory Isaiah saw. Our reading does not collapse the persons of the Trinity but discerns a veiled presence that fits the later clarity.

Fourth, does christological reading entail supersessionism. Properly framed **federal theology** denies that the church replaces Israel as a different people. Rather, the church is Israel renewed in the Messiah, composed of Jew and Gentile grafted into the one olive tree. Christ’s fulfillment does not abrogate the promises but keeps them. The land, temple, and kingship promises reach their climactic form in the resurrected Lord, who gives the Spirit and builds a worldwide temple-people. This reading satisfies the prophets’ universal horizon while honoring the particularity of Israel’s role. To claim otherwise is to shrink God’s purpose to a geopolitical enclave. The continuity lies in covenant substance; the discontinuity lies in administration.

We must also face external criticisms that prophecy and typology are post hoc Christian constructions. The counterargument has two components. First, there is internal coherence. The Old Testament itself narrates patterns of repetition and escalation: exodus recurs, tabernacle becomes temple, Davidic kingship is promised an eternal dynasty, priesthood persists with its inadequacy signaled, a new covenant is promised. These patterns anticipate a climacteric resolution. Second, the New Testament’s claims are not arbitrary overlay but resonant with these internal dynamics. The resurrection of Jesus as the vindication of his messianic identity functions as God’s seal that this story is his. Without resurrection, christological reading would be ungrounded. With resurrection, christological reading is warranted as divinely ratified interpretation.

This topic presses into adjacent loci. The doctrine of Scripture is foundational. **Divine authorship** yields canonical unity and the **canonical form** of the text becomes a theological datum. The Trinity matters because the speaker in both testaments is the triune God, and the Son is both revealer and revealed. Christology matters because the one who fulfills is true God and true man. Without the two-natures doctrine, Old Testament realities either overwhelm the humanity of Christ or are diminished as mere metaphors. Soteriology comes into focus because the efficacy of atonement is prefigured in sacrificial institutions that are fulfilled in the Son’s priestly self-offering once for all. Ecclesiology is implicated because the people defined by these realities is the church as the Israel of God. Sacramentology is illuminated by the exodus and Passover background of the Supper and the Jordan exodus imagery of baptism. Even **divine simplicity** plays a role by ensuring God is not a composite being who changes his plan from Old to New.

Internal debates require clarity and charity. There are those within evangelical circles who prefer to call the reading of the Old Testament christotelic, implying that the texts do not mean Christ but lead to him. This reacts against naive proof-texting and anachronism. The corrective value is real, but the thesis fails if it denies that God intended the Old Testament to be about Christ in a proper sense. The apostolic hermeneutic locates Christ as subject matter, not merely endpoint. Luke 24 does not say the Old merely leads to Christ; it says Moses and all the prophets speak concerning him. Hebrews argues not only telos but ontology. The shadow had its meaning from the reality that cast it. A properly nuanced **sensus plenior** helps here. The one divine intention, historically unfolded, yields many textual horizons without multiplying senses in a way that would dissolve literality. Likewise, typology must be distinguished from allegory. Allegory as imagined connections without textual or historical warrant fails. Typology attends to textual cues, redemptive patterns, institutional design, and the intercanonical citations that bind them. Vos’s method helps police the fence line.

How then would one actually read key cases. Psalm 110 should be read as Davidic and messianic. Jesus’ question in the Synoptics about David calling the Messiah Lord is not a riddle beside the point but an insistence that the Messiah’s status exceeds mere dynastic succession. The oath of an eternal priesthood according to Melchizedek signals a priest-king structure unknown in the Levitical economy but anticipated in Genesis 14. Hebrews’ exegesis is legitimate because it respects authorial discourse and covenantal structure. Isaiah 53 belongs to the servant songs whose corporate-vocational context does not preclude but invites concentration in a representative figure. The servant restores Jacob yet is distinct from Jacob. Substitutionary logic is explicit. Matthew’s Emmanuel reading of Isaiah 7 handles the original context of Ahaz’s sign while locating its ultimate sense in the virgin conception of the Messiah as the climactic divine-with-us. Hosea 11, as noted, is typological. The Psalms, read prosopologically, often oscillate between the Davidic king and the Messiah who is the true singer, and between Christ and his body. Augustine’s totus Christus protects against an individualizing privatism and against a reduction of the Psalter to moralism. None of these readings abandon the literal but expand it to its canonical fullness under **divine authorship**.

Richard Hays’s category of figural reading can be integrated with this framework when tethered to covenantal ontology. The exodus figure in the Gospels is not literary thinking alone; it is sacramental history. John’s presentation of Jesus as temple is not metaphor; it is ontological fulfillment. Paul’s Adam-Christ typology in Romans 5 is not a clever analogy; it is **federal headship**, historically anchored and soteriologically effective. Hays teaches us to hear echoes, but Vos and Warfield teach us why those echoes are reality-laden. Calvin ensures we do not float off from the text. Augustine ensures we read ecclesially and worshipfully.

A final contemporary worry is that theological interpretation of Scripture simply sacralizes the church’s power. The answer is to keep hermeneutics tethered to exegesis and exegesis tethered to dogma. The dogmatic anchors of **divine authorship**, the Trinity, and the incarnation do not replace reading but norm it. They forbid readings that deny God’s covenantal fidelity or Christ’s uniqueness. Conversely, robust exegesis keeps dogma from abstraction, as the cultic specifics of Leviticus force precise talk of atonement and priesthood that prevent sentimental christologies. The truth is that the apostolic hermeneutic is a package deal. It is inseparable from the apostolic confession. To accept their creed and reject their reading method is incoherent. Warfield’s insistence on concursive inspiration, Calvin’s unity of the covenants, Augustine’s totus Christus, Vos’s organic typology, and Hays’s figural attentiveness converge to show that the New Testament’s use of the Old is neither arbitrary nor optional but the Spirit’s own pattern for the church.

Therefore, the defensible position is clear. Christ is present in the Old Testament as the one Mediator whose person and work are prefigured and promised, as the one to whom the covenants aim, and as the one speaking by the Spirit in the prophets, now unveiled in the apostolic witness. The New Testament does not impose him upon Israel’s Scriptures; it discloses him as their heart. Bound to **divine authorship**, constrained by the **rule of faith**, directed by the **redemptive-historical** architecture of the canon, and executed through disciplined **typology** and warranted **sensus plenior**, this reading can face internal and external objections without flinching. It will resist both arbitrary allegory and sterile historicism. It will honor Israel and yet confess that every promise finds its Yes in the seed, the servant, the priest-king, the prophet like Moses, who is Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever.
