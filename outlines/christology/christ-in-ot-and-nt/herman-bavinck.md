# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck maintained that **Christ** is the central figure of both the **Old and New Testaments**, with the entire **history of revelation** culminating in Him. He argued that the **unity of Scripture** is grounded in the person and work of Christ, who is progressively revealed through **typology**, **prophecy**, and ultimately in the incarnation. For Bavinck, the **organic unity** of redemptive history ensures that Christ is present throughout the whole of Scripture, not merely in the New Testament.

- "Christ is not only the center but also the content of revelation, both in the Old and in the New Testament." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a unified whole, with **Christ** as its center and goal.
    - The Old and New Testaments are organically connected, not merely by external references.
    - Typology and prophecy in the Old Testament find their fulfillment in Christ.
    - The unity is rooted in the single divine author, the **Holy Spirit**.
    - "The Old and New Testaments are not two separate books, but together constitute one organic whole." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds progressively, climaxing in Christ.
    - The Old Testament contains shadows and types that anticipate Christ.
    - The New Testament reveals the fullness of what was promised and prefigured.
    - This progression is both historical and theological.
    - "Revelation is not a communication of abstract truths but the history of God’s acts in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

3. **Typology and Prophecy**
    - Old Testament persons, events, and institutions serve as types pointing to Christ.
    - Prophetic promises are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Typology is grounded in the unity of God’s redemptive plan.
    - Christ is the antitype who brings the types to their intended meaning.
    - "The types and prophecies of the Old Testament are fulfilled and completed in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Christ as the Center of Redemptive History**
    - All of redemptive history is oriented toward the coming of Christ.
    - The incarnation is the pivotal event in the history of salvation.
    - Both Testaments testify to the one Mediator between God and humanity.
    - The work of Christ retroactively applies to Old Testament believers.
    - "Christ is the heart and core of the entire Scripture and of all history." (The Wonderful Works of God)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity**
    - There is real continuity between the covenants, centered on Christ.
    - Discontinuity exists in the form and administration of the covenant, not its substance.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - The New Testament brings greater clarity and fulfillment, not contradiction.
    - "The new covenant is the realization of the promise given to Abraham, fulfilled in Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **organic unity of Scripture** and his Christ-centered reading of both Testaments have profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology. His emphasis on **progressive revelation** and typology provided a framework for understanding the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. Bavinck’s work continues to influence contemporary discussions on biblical theology, hermeneutics, and the doctrine of Scripture, especially within confessional Reformed circles.
