# Christopher J.H. Wright (1954– )

Christopher J.H. Wright is a leading advocate for reading both the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** as a unified narrative centered on **Christ**. He emphasizes the **missional** and **covenantal** dimensions of Scripture, arguing that the entire biblical story finds its fulfillment in the person and work of **Jesus Christ**. Wright’s approach highlights the continuity of **God’s redemptive plan** across both Testaments.

- "Jesus himself understood his own identity and mission in the light of the Old Testament Scriptures." (Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament)

## Key Works

- Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament
- The Mission of God: Unlocking the Bible’s Grand Narrative
- The Old Testament in Seven Sentences
- The New Testament and the People of God (contributor)
- The Mission of God’s People

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Fulfillment of the Old Testament**
    - Christ is the climax of the **biblical narrative** that begins in the Old Testament.
    - The promises to **Abraham**, **David**, and Israel find their ultimate realization in Jesus.
    - Wright reads the Old Testament as inherently **messianic** and forward-looking.
    - He insists that the **identity** and **mission** of Christ cannot be understood apart from the Old Testament.
    - "The Old Testament tells the story which Jesus completes." (Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament)

2. **Missional Hermeneutic**
    - The Bible’s grand narrative is fundamentally about **God’s mission** to redeem creation.
    - Both Testaments reveal God’s purpose to bless all nations through Christ.
    - The church’s mission is rooted in the **missio Dei** revealed in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Wright sees Christ as the embodiment and agent of God’s mission.
    - "Mission is not just one of a list of things that the Bible happens to talk about, only more urgently than some. Mission is, in that much-abused phrase, 'what it’s all about.'" (The Mission of God)

3. **Covenant Continuity**
    - The **covenants** with Israel are not abolished but fulfilled in Christ.
    - Jesus is the true Israelite who embodies and fulfills the covenant obligations.
    - The New Testament’s understanding of Christ is inseparable from Old Testament covenantal themes.
    - The church participates in the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant through union with Christ.
    - "Jesus is the one in whom all the promises of God are Yes and Amen." (The Mission of God’s People)

4. **Scripture as a Unified Story**
    - Wright insists on the **unity** of the biblical canon, centered on Christ.
    - He rejects readings that fragment the Testaments or minimize their coherence.
    - The Old Testament is not merely background but is essential for understanding the New Testament’s claims about Jesus.
    - The story of Jesus is the continuation and fulfillment of the Old Testament narrative.
    - "We cannot know Jesus without knowing his story, and his story begins in the Old Testament." (Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament)

5. **Typology and Theological Interpretation**
    - Wright employs **typology** to show how Old Testament figures and events prefigure Christ.
    - He advocates for a theological reading that sees Christ as the center of all Scripture.
    - Typological connections are not arbitrary but grounded in the canonical shape of the Bible.
    - This approach deepens the church’s understanding of Christ’s identity and mission.
    - "The Old Testament is full of patterns, images, and trajectories that converge in Jesus." (The Old Testament in Seven Sentences)

## Legacy and Impact

Christopher J.H. Wright has significantly shaped contemporary evangelical approaches to **biblical theology**, especially regarding the integration of the Old and New Testaments around the person of Christ. His emphasis on the **missional** dimension of Scripture has influenced both academic and church contexts, encouraging a holistic reading of the Bible’s redemptive story. Wright’s work continues to inspire pastors, scholars, and missionaries to see Christ as the fulfillment of God’s promises and the center of the entire biblical narrative.
