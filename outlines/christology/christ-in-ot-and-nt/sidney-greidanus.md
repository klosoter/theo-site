# Sidney Greidanus (1935–)

Sidney Greidanus is a leading advocate for **Christ-centered preaching** that faithfully bridges the **Old and New Testaments**. He insists that the **unity of Scripture** demands a **redemptive-historical** approach, where Christ is seen as the fulfillment of the **Old Testament** and the heart of the **New Testament** proclamation.

- "The Old Testament is not merely background for the New Testament but is itself part of the one redemptive history that finds its climax in Jesus Christ." (Preaching Christ from the Old Testament)

## Key Works

- Preaching Christ from the Old Testament (1999)
- Preaching Christ from Genesis (2007)
- Preaching Christ from Daniel (2012)
- The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text (1988)
- Sola Scriptura: Problems and Principles in Preaching Historical Texts (1970)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
    - Emphasizes that all of Scripture ultimately points to **Christ** as its center.
    - Advocates for interpreting **Old Testament** texts in light of their fulfillment in the **New Testament**.
    - Warns against mere moralistic or allegorical readings that bypass the redemptive focus.
    - Sees the **unity of the Bible** as grounded in the person and work of Christ.
    - "To preach Christ from the Old Testament is not to impose Him on the text, but to recognize the organic unity of Scripture." (Preaching Christ from the Old Testament)

2. **Redemptive-Historical Approach**
    - Frames biblical history as a progressive unfolding of **God’s redemptive plan** culminating in Christ.
    - Encourages preachers to trace the movement from **promise to fulfillment**.
    - Stresses the importance of context: literary, historical, and canonical.
    - Rejects atomistic readings that fragment the biblical narrative.
    - "Redemptive history is the backbone of biblical revelation." (The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text)

3. **Legitimate Ways to Preach Christ from the Old Testament**
    - Outlines specific methods: **redemptive-historical progression**, **promise-fulfillment**, **typology**, **analogy**, and **longitudinal themes**.
    - Insists that these methods must arise from the text itself, not be artificially imposed.
    - Encourages careful exegesis to discern how each passage relates to Christ.
    - Warns against superficial connections that lack textual grounding.
    - "There are legitimate ways to preach Christ from the Old Testament, but they require careful, responsible interpretation." (Preaching Christ from the Old Testament)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity between Testaments**
    - Affirms both the **continuity** (one covenant of grace) and **discontinuity** (progressive revelation) between the Testaments.
    - Sees the **Old Testament** as incomplete without the **New Testament**.
    - Argues that the **New Testament** interprets and fulfills the **Old Testament**.
    - Maintains that Christ is present in the Old Testament both in promise and type.
    - "The Old Testament is the first act of the drama; the New Testament is the climax and resolution." (Preaching Christ from the Old Testament)

5. **Authority and Sufficiency of Scripture**
    - Upholds the **inspiration** and **authority** of both Testaments.
    - Rejects any approach that diminishes the theological value of the Old Testament.
    - Argues that the **whole counsel of God** must be preached for a full understanding of Christ.
    - Emphasizes that the **Scriptures** are sufficient for revealing Christ and His work.
    - "Both Testaments are the Word of God and together reveal the full glory of Christ." (Preaching Christ from the Old Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Greidanus has profoundly shaped the field of **biblical theology** and the practice of **expository preaching** by insisting on a robustly Christ-centered approach to both the Old and New Testaments. His methodological clarity and practical guidelines have influenced generations of preachers and scholars, especially within the Reformed tradition. By emphasizing the organic unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ, Greidanus has helped recover a holistic vision of the Bible’s redemptive message.
