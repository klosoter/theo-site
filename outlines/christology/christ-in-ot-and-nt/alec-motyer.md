# Alec Motyer (1924–2016)

Alec Motyer was a leading evangelical scholar who emphasized the continuity of **Christological revelation** across the **Old and New Testaments**. He argued that the **Old Testament** is inherently **messianic**, with its themes, promises, and typologies finding their fulfillment in the person and work of **Jesus Christ** as revealed in the **New Testament**.

- "The Old Testament is Jesus predicted; the Gospels are Jesus revealed; Acts is Jesus preached; the Epistles, Jesus explained; and the Revelation, Jesus expected." (Look to the Rock)

## Key Works

- The Prophecy of Isaiah: An Introduction & Commentary
- Look to the Rock: An Old Testament Background to Our Understanding of Christ
- The Message of Exodus (The Bible Speaks Today Series)
- Roots: Let the Old Testament Speak
- Psalms by the Day: A New Devotional Translation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture**
    - The **Old and New Testaments** form a single, unified narrative centered on **God’s redemptive plan**.
    - Christ is the interpretive key to understanding the whole of Scripture.
    - The promises and patterns of the Old Testament are fulfilled in Jesus.
    - Typology and prophecy are not accidental but divinely intended.
    - "The Bible is one book, and you cannot understand it unless you see that it is a book about Jesus Christ." (Look to the Rock)

2. **Messianic Prophecy**
    - The Old Testament contains direct and indirect prophecies about the Messiah.
    - Isaiah and the Psalms are especially rich in **messianic expectation**.
    - Prophecy is both predictive and pattern-based, pointing forward to Christ.
    - Fulfillment in the New Testament is both literal and typological.
    - "Isaiah’s Servant is not just a figure of hope but the very Christ who comes in the Gospels." (The Prophecy of Isaiah)

3. **Typology and Patterns**
    - Old Testament events, institutions, and persons serve as types that prefigure Christ.
    - Typology is grounded in the text and intention of the Old Testament authors.
    - The Exodus, sacrificial system, and Davidic kingship all point to Jesus.
    - Typology is not mere allegory but rooted in redemptive history.
    - "The Exodus is the Old Testament’s greatest act of redemption, and it points forward to the greater redemption in Christ." (The Message of Exodus)

4. **Christological Reading of the Old Testament**
    - The Old Testament must be read with a view to its fulfillment in Christ.
    - The New Testament authors model a **Christ-centered hermeneutic**.
    - The Old Testament is not superseded but brought to fullness in Jesus.
    - Preaching and teaching should reflect the Christological unity of Scripture.
    - "We must let the Old Testament speak, but we must also let it lead us to Christ." (Roots: Let the Old Testament Speak)

5. **Continuity and Fulfillment**
    - There is a fundamental continuity between the covenants, climaxing in Christ.
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Jesus and extended to the church.
    - The law, prophets, and writings all anticipate the coming Messiah.
    - Fulfillment in Christ does not abolish the Old Testament but brings its meaning to completion.
    - "Jesus is the fulfillment, not the cancellation, of all that the Old Testament anticipated." (Look to the Rock)

## Legacy and Impact

Motyer’s work has profoundly shaped evangelical understanding of the **Christ-centered unity of Scripture**, especially in the area of **Old Testament exegesis**. His insistence on reading the Old Testament as inherently messianic has influenced generations of pastors, scholars, and lay readers. Motyer’s accessible commentaries and theological writings continue to serve as essential resources for those seeking to understand how the whole Bible testifies to Christ. His legacy endures in the ongoing commitment to a robust, **biblical-theological** approach to Scripture.
