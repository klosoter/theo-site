# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth revolutionized the understanding of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** by insisting that all of Scripture bears witness to **Jesus Christ** as the central revelation of God. He rejected both liberal historicism and fundamentalist literalism, emphasizing the **unity of Scripture** and the necessity of reading the **Old Testament** in light of its fulfillment in **Christ** as revealed in the **New Testament**.

- "Jesus Christ is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Key Works

- Church Dogmatics I/2 (Doctrine of the Word of God)
- Church Dogmatics IV/1 (Doctrine of Reconciliation)
- "The Strange New World Within the Bible" (Essay)
- Evangelical Theology: An Introduction
- The Epistle to the Romans

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christocentric Interpretation of Scripture**
    - All of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, finds its meaning in **Jesus Christ**.
    - The **Old Testament** is not merely preparatory but is itself a witness to Christ.
    - The **New Testament** reveals the fulfillment of what the Old Testament anticipates.
    - Christ is the hermeneutical key to understanding the unity and purpose of the biblical canon.
    - "The Old Testament is witness to Christ, as is the New Testament." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

2. **Revelation as Event in Christ**
    - Revelation is not a static deposit but the dynamic event of God’s self-disclosure in Christ.
    - The **Word of God** is supremely revealed in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Both Testaments are vehicles for this event, not merely historical records.
    - The encounter with Christ through Scripture is always a present, living reality.
    - "Revelation means the self-unveiling, imparted by God, of the mystery of His being." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

3. **Unity of the Testaments**
    - The Old and New Testaments form a single, coherent witness to God’s redemptive action.
    - The **covenant** theme unites both Testaments in the person of Christ.
    - Discontinuity is only apparent; the substance is continuous in Christ.
    - The church must resist any division that separates the Testaments’ theological message.
    - "The Bible as a whole is the document of the covenant between God and man." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

4. **Rejection of Allegory and Historicism**
    - Barth rejects both allegorical readings and purely historical-critical approaches.
    - He insists on a **theological reading** that recognizes the divine subject of Scripture.
    - The meaning of the text is found in its witness to Christ, not in hidden codes or mere history.
    - The authority of Scripture is rooted in its function as the medium of God’s self-revelation.
    - "Scripture is the witness of divine revelation, not revelation itself." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

5. **Scripture as Witness, Not Identity, with Revelation**
    - The Bible is not itself the revelation but the authoritative witness to the revelation in Christ.
    - The **Holy Spirit** enables the church to hear Christ’s voice through the biblical text.
    - Both Testaments are indispensable for the church’s knowledge of Christ.
    - The authority of Scripture is derivative from its function as Christ’s witness.
    - "The Bible becomes the Word of God as God speaks through it." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s **Christocentric hermeneutic** reshaped modern theology’s approach to the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, challenging both liberal and conservative paradigms. His insistence on the **unity of Scripture** and the centrality of Christ as the key to all biblical interpretation has deeply influenced Reformed and ecumenical biblical theology. Barth’s approach continues to provoke debate and inspire renewed attention to the theological reading of both Testaments in the service of the church’s proclamation.
