# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **religious consciousness** and the development of **Christian faith**. He emphasized the uniqueness of Christ as the culmination of **God-consciousness**, while interpreting the Old Testament as preparatory and the New Testament as the normative witness to Christ’s person and work.

- "The Old Testament is only preparatory, and the New Testament is the original document of our faith." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Works

- The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)
- On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers
- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology
- Hermeneutics: The Handwritten Manuscripts
- Christian Ethics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Highest God-Consciousness**
    - Christ embodies the perfect realization of **God-consciousness** in humanity.
    - The New Testament uniquely witnesses to this consciousness in the historical Jesus.
    - The Old Testament is seen as preparatory, pointing forward to the fullness realized in Christ.
    - The significance of Christ is existential and experiential, not merely doctrinal.
    - "In Christ, the divine essence is present in a unique and unsurpassed way." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Progressive Revelation**
    - Revelation is understood as a historical process, culminating in Christ.
    - The Old Testament contains anticipatory elements that find fulfillment in the New Testament.
    - The unity of Scripture is found in the movement toward the revelation of Christ.
    - The New Testament is normative for Christian doctrine and piety.
    - "The Old Testament is preparatory, the New Testament is constitutive." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Scripture as Witness to Religious Experience**
    - The Bible is not primarily a sourcebook of doctrine but a record of religious experience.
    - The Old and New Testaments witness to the evolving consciousness of God among God’s people.
    - Christ’s appearance is the central event to which all Scripture points.
    - Interpretation must focus on the lived faith of the community.
    - "Scripture is the original document of the religious self-consciousness of the Christian Church." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Hermeneutics and Historical Context**
    - Understanding Christ in Scripture requires sensitivity to historical and cultural context.
    - The meaning of Old Testament texts is not static but unfolds in light of Christ.
    - The interpreter must discern the movement from preparatory forms to fulfillment in Christ.
    - Hermeneutics is both historical and theological, rooted in the church’s ongoing experience.
    - "Every interpretation must be guided by the consciousness of the church and the historical development of faith." (Hermeneutics)

5. **Christ’s Uniqueness and Mediatorship**
    - Christ is the unique mediator between God and humanity.
    - The Old Testament mediators (prophets, priests, kings) prefigure Christ’s ultimate role.
    - The New Testament reveals Christ as the definitive revelation of God.
    - Faith in Christ is the foundation of Christian community and doctrine.
    - "Christ is the Redeemer because in Him the divine and human are perfectly united." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** shifted the focus from propositional revelation to the development of **God-consciousness** and religious experience. His emphasis on the historical and experiential dimensions of revelation influenced modern biblical hermeneutics and liberal theology. While his views diverged from traditional **Reformed Christology**, his work remains foundational for understanding the evolution of modern theological approaches to Scripture and the person of Christ.
