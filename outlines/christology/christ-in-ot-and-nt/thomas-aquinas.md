# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas viewed **Christ** as the center of both the **Old and New Testaments**, affirming the unity of **divine revelation** and the progressive unfolding of **salvation history**. He taught that the **Old Testament** prefigures and prepares for Christ, while the **New Testament** reveals Him fully, with both testaments inspired by the same **divine author** and oriented toward the mystery of the **Incarnation**.

- "The Old Testament is a figure of the New, and the New is a spiritual fulfillment of the Old." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae (especially III, q.1–59; I-II, q.106–108)
- Catena Aurea (commentary on the Gospels)
- Commentary on the Psalms
- Commentary on Isaiah
- Commentary on the Gospel of John

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture through Christ**
    - Both **Old and New Testaments** have a single divine author, God, whose plan centers on Christ.
    - The Old Testament contains **types and figures** that point forward to Christ.
    - The New Testament reveals the **fulfillment** of what was promised and prefigured.
    - Christ is the hermeneutical key to understanding all of Scripture.
    - "All the Scriptures, both of the Old and of the New Testament, treat of Christ." (Summa Theologiae III, q.60, a.6)

2. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - The events, persons, and institutions of the Old Testament are **types** that find their reality in Christ.
    - The **sacrificial system**, kingship, and prophecy all prefigure Christ’s work.
    - The New Testament interprets and fulfills these types, making their meaning explicit.
    - Typology safeguards the unity and coherence of **salvation history**.
    - "The Old Law is a shadow of the New Law, and the New Law is the truth of the Old." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.107, a.2)

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s revelation unfolds progressively, with the Old Testament as preparation and the New as consummation.
    - The **Incarnation** is the climax of revelation, anticipated in the Old Testament.
    - The New Testament provides a fuller and clearer disclosure of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The unity of revelation is preserved through its **Christocentric** focus.
    - "The knowledge of Christ was more explicit in the New than in the Old Testament." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.7)

4. **Literal and Spiritual Senses of Scripture**
    - Aquinas affirms both the **literal** and **spiritual** (allegorical, moral, anagogical) senses of Scripture.
    - The spiritual senses often reveal Christ in the Old Testament through typology and prophecy.
    - The literal sense is foundational, but the spiritual sense is grounded in Christ’s fulfillment.
    - This multi-layered reading enriches the understanding of **Christ in both Testaments**.
    - "All the senses of Holy Scripture are founded on one—the literal—from which alone can any argument be drawn." (Summa Theologiae I, q.1, a.10)

5. **Continuity and Distinction of the Covenants**
    - The Old and New Covenants are distinct in form but united in purpose: leading to Christ.
    - The Old Covenant is preparatory, containing **promises** and **figures** of the New.
    - The New Covenant brings the **grace** and **truth** realized in Christ.
    - The distinction upholds the progress of redemption while affirming the unity of God’s plan.
    - "The Old Law was given to prepare the way for Christ, and the New Law is given through Christ Himself." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q.98, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust **Christocentric reading of Scripture** shaped medieval and later Christian exegesis, influencing both Catholic and Protestant traditions. His synthesis of **typology**, **progressive revelation**, and the fourfold sense of Scripture provided a framework for understanding the unity of the **Old and New Testaments** in relation to Christ. Aquinas’s approach continues to inform theological reflection on the continuity of **salvation history** and the centrality of Christ in biblical interpretation.
