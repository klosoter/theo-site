# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **revelation** and **personal encounter** rather than typological or predictive readings. He emphasized that the **Word of God** is supremely revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, with the **Old Testament** serving as a preparatory witness and the **New Testament** as the fulfillment and interpretation of that revelation. Brunner rejected both allegorical readings and strict historical-critical reductionism, insisting that the unity of Scripture is found in its testimony to the living Christ.

- "The Old Testament is the book of promise; the New Testament is the book of fulfillment, and both together bear witness to the one revelation of God in Jesus Christ." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

## Key Works

- The Divine-Human Encounter
- Revelation and Reason
- The Christian Doctrine of God (Dogmatics, Vol. 1)
- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Truth as Encounter

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation is Personal, Not Propositional**
    - Revelation is fundamentally an encounter with the living God, not merely doctrinal information.
    - Christ is the center and content of all true revelation in both Testaments.
    - The Old Testament prepares for, and the New Testament interprets, the Christ-event.
    - The unity of Scripture is relational, grounded in the self-disclosure of God in Christ.
    - "Revelation is always the event of personal address, not the communication of timeless truths." (Revelation and Reason)

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Old Testament Promise**
    - The Old Testament is incomplete without its fulfillment in Christ.
    - Prophecy and promise in the Old Testament point forward to the coming of Christ.
    - The New Testament interprets the Old Testament in light of the Christ-event.
    - The continuity of Scripture is found in the movement from promise to fulfillment.
    - "The Old Testament is the book of promise; the New Testament is the book of fulfillment." (The Divine-Human Encounter)

3. **Rejection of Allegorical and Rationalist Readings**
    - Brunner opposes allegorical interpretations that obscure the historical reality of revelation.
    - He also rejects rationalist approaches that reduce Scripture to mere history or ethics.
    - The meaning of Scripture is found in its witness to Christ, not in hidden codes or moral lessons.
    - Both Testaments must be read in light of the living encounter with Christ.
    - "The unity of the Bible is not a literary or historical unity, but the unity of the one divine revelation in Christ." (The Mediator)

4. **The Word of God as Event**
    - The Word is not simply the written text, but the dynamic act of God addressing humanity.
    - Christ is the living Word to whom both Testaments bear witness.
    - The authority of Scripture is derived from its function as the medium of divine encounter.
    - The Old and New Testaments are united in their role as vehicles of the Word-event.
    - "The Word of God is always an event, an act of God’s self-revelation in Christ." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Scripture’s Authority is Christocentric**
    - The authority of both Testaments is grounded in their witness to Christ.
    - The Old Testament has authority as promise; the New Testament as fulfillment.
    - All interpretation must be oriented toward the revelation of God in Jesus Christ.
    - The Bible’s unity and authority are inseparable from its Christological center.
    - "The Bible is authoritative because it is the witness to the one revelation of God in Christ." (The Christian Doctrine of God)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** shaped 20th-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the centrality of **revelation as encounter** and the Christocentric unity of Scripture. His rejection of both allegorical and purely historical-critical methods influenced later discussions on biblical interpretation. Brunner’s insistence on the personal, relational character of revelation continues to inform debates on the nature of biblical authority and the relationship between the Testaments. His work remains a significant reference point for those seeking a mediating position between traditional dogmatics and modern critical scholarship.
