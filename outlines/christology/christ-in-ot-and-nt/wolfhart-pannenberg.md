# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **revelation as history** and the unity of **salvation history**. He emphasized that the identity of Christ is disclosed through the unfolding of **God’s self-revelation** across both Testaments, culminating in the resurrection as the decisive event that retroactively illuminates all of Scripture.

- "The revelation of God is not a timeless truth but an event in history, which reaches its climax in the history of Jesus." (Revelation as History)

## Key Works

- Revelation as History (1969)
- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1970–1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
    - Revelation unfolds through concrete historical events, not abstract propositions.
    - The **resurrection of Jesus** is the central event that interprets all previous revelation.
    - The meaning of Old Testament texts is clarified in light of Christ’s historical appearance.
    - History itself is the medium of God’s self-disclosure.
    - "Only in the light of the end can the meaning of history be fully known." (Revelation as History)

2. **Unity of Salvation History**
    - The Old and New Testaments form a single, coherent narrative of **God’s redemptive action**.
    - Christ is the fulfillment and interpretive key to the entire biblical story.
    - Typology and prophecy in the Old Testament point forward to Christ’s person and work.
    - The unity of Scripture is grounded in the unity of God’s historical action.
    - "The unity of the biblical witness is grounded in the unity of the divine action in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

3. **Christological Hermeneutic**
    - The identity of Christ is revealed through the totality of biblical history.
    - The Old Testament must be read in light of the resurrection and the Christ event.
    - The New Testament interprets the Old, but also depends on it for its own meaning.
    - The hermeneutical circle between Testaments is necessary for theological understanding.
    - "The Christ event is the key to the interpretation of all Scripture." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Provisionality and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament revelation is provisional, awaiting fulfillment in Christ.
    - Full meaning is only disclosed in the eschaton, but anticipated in Christ’s resurrection.
    - The future consummation retroactively illuminates the significance of past events.
    - The **eschatological horizon** shapes both Testaments’ witness to Christ.
    - "The meaning of history is only finally disclosed at its end, but the resurrection anticipates that end." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Universal Scope of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s significance is not limited to Israel or the church but extends to all humanity.
    - The Old Testament’s universal promises find their realization in Christ.
    - The resurrection is a public event with implications for all history and peoples.
    - The unity of the Testaments points to the cosmic scope of redemption.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the proleptic revelation of the destiny of all mankind." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s integration of **revelation as history** and his insistence on the unity of **salvation history** have significantly shaped modern discussions of Christ in both the Old and New Testaments. His approach influenced contemporary hermeneutics by emphasizing the centrality of the resurrection for biblical interpretation. Pannenberg’s work continues to challenge theologians to consider the historical and universal dimensions of Christ’s identity and mission, bridging gaps between biblical studies and systematic theology.
