# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the centrality of **Christ** throughout both the **Old and New Testaments**. These confessions teach that the **promises, types, and prophecies** of the Old Testament are fulfilled in Christ, and that the unity of Scripture is grounded in the one **covenant of grace** revealed progressively in redemptive history.

- "The gospel was promised before in the Holy Scriptures by the prophets, and God fulfilled the promise which He made to the fathers by the mouth of His holy prophets when He sent His only and eternal Son into the world." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 17–23
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Lord’s Days 6, 12, 17, 18, 19
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially First and Second Heads of Doctrine
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort (standard collected edition)
- The Reformation Study Bible (notes on confessional documents)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Old Testament Promises**
    - Christ is the substance of all **Old Testament types, shadows, and prophecies**.
    - The confessions explicitly connect the **covenant promises** to their realization in Christ.
    - The unity of the Testaments is maintained through the person and work of Christ.
    - The Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the coming Christ, just as believers are now.
    "We believe that all the Scriptures point to Christ, who is the end of the law." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 19)

2. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The confessions teach one **covenant of grace** administered differently before and after Christ’s coming.
    - The promises made to Abraham and the patriarchs are realized in Christ and extended to all believers.
    - The sacraments (circumcision/baptism, Passover/Lord’s Supper) signify the same spiritual realities centered in Christ.
    - Both Testaments reveal the same way of salvation: faith in Christ alone.
    "We believe that Jesus Christ is the true seed that was promised to Abraham and to David." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

3. **Typology and Prophecy**
    - The confessions recognize **types and figures** in the Old Testament as prefiguring Christ’s person and work.
    - Prophetic revelation is seen as progressively unveiling the coming Messiah.
    - The ceremonial law is fulfilled and abrogated in Christ, who is its reality.
    - The Old Testament priesthood, sacrifices, and kingship all point to Christ’s offices.
    "All the shadows are fulfilled in Christ, so that the substance is found in Him." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 19)

4. **Christ’s Presence and Work in Both Testaments**
    - Christ is active as **Mediator** before and after the incarnation.
    - The confessions affirm that the Son was present and operative in the Old Testament church.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are applied to believers in all ages.
    - The distinction between Testaments is one of administration, not substance.
    "The Son of God from the beginning of the world to its end gathers, defends, and preserves for Himself a community chosen to eternal life." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 54)

5. **Scripture’s Unity and Authority**
    - Both Testaments are equally inspired and authoritative as the **Word of God**.
    - The confessions reject any division between the God of the Old and New Testaments.
    - The gospel is present in the Old Testament, though more obscurely.
    - The whole of Scripture is to be interpreted in light of Christ.
    "We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith." (Belgic Confession, Art. 5)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed hermeneutics, emphasizing the **unity of redemptive history** and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture. Their teaching on Christ in the Old and New Testaments has influenced catechesis, preaching, and theological method in the continental Reformed tradition. By grounding the unity of the Bible in the person and work of Christ, these confessions continue to guide Reformed churches in reading both Testaments as one unfolding story of redemption.
