# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through his method of **correlation**, interpreting biblical revelation as the symbolic expression of ultimate concern. He saw **Christ** as the "New Being," whose appearance in history fulfills the existential questions raised throughout the **Hebrew Scriptures** and the **New Testament**, rather than as the direct fulfillment of predictive prophecy or typology.

- "The Christ is the New Being in whom the estrangement of existence is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Interpretation of History
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality
- The New Being

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ represents the answer to the existential estrangement depicted throughout the biblical narrative.
    - The **Old Testament** anticipates the possibility of reunion with the **Ground of Being**, which is realized in Christ.
    - The **New Testament** proclaims the actualization of this reunion through the historical Jesus.
    - Christ is not merely a historical figure but the manifestation of the divine answer to human anxiety.
    - "In the New Being, the separation between God and man is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Symbolic Interpretation of Scripture**
    - Biblical texts are symbols that participate in the reality to which they point, rather than literal predictions.
    - The **Christ-event** is interpreted through symbolic language that conveys existential truth.
    - Both Testaments use myth and symbol to express the human condition and its resolution in Christ.
    - The meaning of Christ in the OT is not direct prophecy but symbolic anticipation.
    - "Symbols are not signs; they participate in the reality to which they point." (Dynamics of Faith)

3. **Method of Correlation**
    - Theology must correlate the existential questions of humanity with the answers found in revelation.
    - The **Old Testament** raises questions of meaning, estrangement, and hope.
    - The **New Testament** provides the answer in the person and work of Christ.
    - The unity of the Testaments is found in the existential correlation, not in typological or predictive continuity.
    - "The method of correlation explains the contents of the Christian faith through existential questions and theological answers." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Existential Longing**
    - The **Old Testament** expresses the longing for reunion with the divine, which is fulfilled in Christ.
    - Christ embodies the solution to the alienation and anxiety depicted in the Hebrew Scriptures.
    - The fulfillment is existential and ontological, not merely historical or legal.
    - The **New Testament** proclaims the actualization of this fulfillment in the Christ-event.
    - "The Christ is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets, not by abolishing them, but by bringing their meaning to reality." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Universal Significance of Christ**
    - Christ is the universal answer to the human predicament, not limited to Israel or the church.
    - The **Old Testament** is a particular history that points to a universal solution.
    - The **New Testament** proclaims the universality of the New Being in Christ.
    - The significance of Christ transcends historical and cultural boundaries.
    - "The New Being is the answer to the question implied in every human existence." (The New Being)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** shifted the focus from predictive prophecy and typology to existential fulfillment and symbolic meaning. His **method of correlation** influenced generations of theologians seeking to relate biblical revelation to modern existential questions. While his views have been critiqued for downplaying historical continuity, his emphasis on the **universal significance of Christ** and the symbolic depth of Scripture remains influential in contemporary theology. Tillich’s work continues to shape discussions on the relationship between biblical texts and existential meaning.
