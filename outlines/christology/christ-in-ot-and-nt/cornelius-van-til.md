# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **redemptive-historical revelation** and **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the **unity of Scripture** and the necessity of interpreting both Testaments as a coherent, Christ-centered revelation, grounded in the **Trinitarian self-disclosure** of God. For Van Til, the person and work of Christ are not merely anticipated in the Old Testament but are the very foundation and fulfillment of all biblical revelation.

- "The whole of the Old Testament is a revelation of the Christ who was to come, and the whole of the New Testament is a revelation of the Christ who has come." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Redemptive History**
    - Christ is the focal point of both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - All Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, unfolds the one redemptive plan centered in Christ.
    - The Old Testament anticipates and typifies Christ; the New Testament reveals and interprets Him.
    - The unity of the Testaments is grounded in the eternal counsel of the Triune God.
    - "The Scriptures are Christ-centered because all of history is Christ-centered." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - The Bible is a unified, organic whole, not a collection of disparate parts.
    - The Old and New Testaments are inseparably connected in their witness to Christ.
    - Typology and prophecy in the Old Testament find their fulfillment in the New Testament.
    - The unity of revelation reflects the unity of God's redemptive purpose.
    - "There is one covenant of grace, progressively revealed and fulfilled in Christ." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Presuppositional Approach to Revelation**
    - The authority and interpretation of Scripture presuppose the truth of Christ’s person and work.
    - Human reason must be subordinated to the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
    - The Old Testament cannot be rightly understood apart from its fulfillment in Christ.
    - The New Testament interprets and confirms the Christ-centered meaning of the Old.
    - "All facts are what they are because of Christ, and all interpretation must be Christ-centered." (Christian Apologetics)

4. **Trinitarian Foundation of Christ’s Revelation**
    - The revelation of Christ in both Testaments is rooted in the Triune nature of God.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are equally involved in the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - The incarnation and atonement are the climax of the Triune God’s redemptive plan.
    - The unity of the Testaments reflects the unity of the Godhead.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity is the presupposition of all revelation, including the revelation of Christ." (Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis between Covenant and Unbelief**
    - The Christ of the Old and New Testaments stands in antithesis to all forms of unbelief.
    - The covenant community is defined by faith in the promised and revealed Christ.
    - The history of redemption is marked by the conflict between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.
    - The fulfillment of Old Testament promises in Christ exposes the futility of autonomous human reasoning.
    - "There is no neutrality: one either stands with the Christ of Scripture or against Him." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust emphasis on the **unity of Christ in both Testaments** has profoundly shaped Reformed hermeneutics and apologetics, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on a **redemptive-historical** approach to Scripture has influenced generations of theologians to read the Bible as a coherent, Christ-centered revelation. Van Til’s legacy endures in the ongoing development of **presuppositional apologetics** and in the commitment to uphold the centrality of Christ throughout all of Scripture.
