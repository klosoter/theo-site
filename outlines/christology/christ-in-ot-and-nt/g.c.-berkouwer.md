# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** with a focus on the unity of **redemptive history** and the unfolding of **revelation**. He emphasized that the **promise-fulfillment** motif is central to understanding how Christ is anticipated in the Old Testament and revealed in the New, while warning against both **allegorism** and a purely historical-critical separation of the Testaments.

- "The unity of the Old and New Testaments is not a matter of mere continuity, but of fulfillment in Christ." (The Person of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ
- Holy Scripture
- The Work of Christ
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Revelation
- The Return of Christ

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Old Testament Promise**
    - Christ is the center and goal of **Old Testament prophecy**.
    - The **promise-fulfillment** structure shapes the entire biblical narrative.
    - Fulfillment in Christ does not negate the Old Testament but brings its meaning to completion.
    - The Old Testament must be read in light of the **eschatological reality** revealed in Christ.
    - "The Old Testament is not abolished, but fulfilled in the coming of Christ." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Unity of Redemptive History**
    - **Revelation** unfolds progressively, culminating in Christ.
    - The Old and New Testaments are not two separate covenants but stages in one divine plan.
    - The continuity of **God’s covenant** is essential for understanding Christ’s work.
    - Christ is present in the Old Testament as the promised Redeemer, not merely as a type.
    - "Redemptive history is a unity, and Christ is its center and fulfillment." (Faith and Revelation)

3. **Rejection of Allegorical Interpretation**
    - Berkouwer warns against reading Christ into every Old Testament text allegorically.
    - He insists on **historical-grammatical exegesis** that respects the original context.
    - True **Christological interpretation** arises from the text’s own trajectory toward fulfillment.
    - The meaning of the Old Testament is not exhausted by its Christological fulfillment.
    - "We must avoid an arbitrary allegorization that obscures the true movement of revelation." (Holy Scripture)

4. **Scripture’s Theological Coherence**
    - The **inspiration** of Scripture ensures its unity and coherence across both Testaments.
    - The Old Testament’s witness to Christ is not accidental but divinely intended.
    - The New Testament writers interpret the Old Testament in light of Christ’s coming.
    - The **hermeneutical principle** is that Christ unlocks the meaning of all Scripture.
    - "The coherence of Scripture is grounded in the reality of Christ as the key to revelation." (Holy Scripture)

5. **Christological Hermeneutics and Eschatology**
    - Christ’s first and second comings frame the **eschatological horizon** of both Testaments.
    - The Old Testament’s hope is realized but not exhausted in Christ’s incarnation.
    - The New Testament looks back to fulfillment and forward to consummation in Christ.
    - The church reads both Testaments as witnesses to the one **eschatological Christ**.
    - "The eschatological fulfillment in Christ gives meaning to all of Scripture." (The Return of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of **redemptive history** and the unity of Scripture. His careful balance between promise and fulfillment, and his rejection of both allegorism and critical fragmentation, influenced generations of biblical theologians. Berkouwer’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking a theologically robust, historically sensitive reading of the Testaments centered on Christ.
