# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield championed the unity and continuity of **revelation** in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the progressive unfolding of **Christ** as the center of all Scripture. He argued that the **Messianic promises** and types of the Old Testament find their fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ, and that the New Testament writers, under **inspiration**, authoritatively interpret the Old Testament as bearing witness to Christ.

- "The Old Testament may be likened to a chamber richly furnished but dimly lighted, the introduction of light brings into it nothing which was not in it before; but it brings out into clearer view much of what is in it." ("The Divine Origin of the Bible," in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 1)

## Key Works

- "The Divine Origin of the Bible" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 1)
- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible"
- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "The Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity"
- "Revelation and Inspiration"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a single, divinely inspired whole, with the Old and New Testaments forming a unified revelation.
    - The **progress of revelation** is organic, not mechanical; Christ is present throughout, though more fully revealed in the New Testament.
    - The Old Testament contains real, though sometimes veiled, **types and prophecies** of Christ.
    - The unity of the Testaments is grounded in the single divine authorship of Scripture.
    - "The New Testament is hidden in the Old; the Old is made plain by the New." ("The Divine Origin of the Bible")

2. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Old Testament Types and Prophecies**
    - Christ is the substance to which all Old Testament **types, shadows, and prophecies** point.
    - The New Testament writers, under inspiration, interpret the Old Testament as testifying to Christ.
    - The Messianic expectation is progressively clarified and fulfilled in Jesus.
    - The Old Testament is incomplete apart from its fulfillment in Christ.
    - "The Old Testament is a book of anticipation; the New Testament is a book of fulfillment." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds gradually, culminating in the revelation of Christ.
    - Earlier stages of revelation are true but partial, awaiting completion in the New Testament.
    - The **doctrine of Christ** is present in seed form in the Old Testament.
    - The full significance of Old Testament texts is often only apparent in light of Christ’s coming.
    - "Revelation is not a mere repetition, but a progress from the less to the more perfect." ("Revelation and Inspiration")

4. **Apostolic Interpretation as Authoritative**
    - The New Testament authors provide the divinely sanctioned interpretation of the Old Testament.
    - Apostolic exegesis reveals the true **Christological meaning** of Old Testament passages.
    - The authority of the apostles rests on their inspiration by the Holy Spirit.
    - The church is bound to read the Old Testament in the way the apostles did.
    - "The apostles are our authoritative guides in the interpretation of the Old Testament." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

5. **Inspiration and Inerrancy of Scripture**
    - Both Old and New Testaments are equally inspired and without error.
    - Inspiration guarantees the unity and reliability of the biblical witness to Christ.
    - The divine origin of Scripture ensures its trustworthiness in all it affirms about Christ.
    - The doctrine of inspiration undergirds the continuity of **redemptive history**.
    - "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." ("The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **unity of Scripture** and the centrality of Christ in both Testaments has profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology and hermeneutics. His articulation of **progressive revelation** and the authoritative role of apostolic interpretation remain foundational for evangelical approaches to the relationship between the Old and New Testaments. Warfield’s influence endures in debates over **inspiration**, typology, and the Christocentric reading of Scripture.
