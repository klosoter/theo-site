### ESSAY 1500-1800 words.
#### 1.**Definition & Dogmatic Location**
The doctrine of Christ in the Old and New Testaments articulates that the one **eternal Son** who becomes incarnate in Jesus is operative, promised, and present throughout Israel's Scriptures, and that the New Testament bears authoritative witness to that fulfillment according to **promise and fulfillment**. This claim belongs to **Christology and Bibliology**, and is regulated by **Rahners Rule**, namely that the economic missions reveal the immanent processions, which secures the identity of the acting subject across the testaments without confusing *ad intra* and *ad extra*. In classical terms, the Scriptures present Christ under figures and promises in the Old Testament and as the embodied **Messiah and Lord** in the New Testament, read within the church's **rule of faith**. The hermeneutical hinge is the distinction and relation of the **literal sense and typological sense**, granted by divine authorship and the unity of the **covenant of grace**.

At stake is not a hunt for clever correspondences but a confession about **one economy of salvation**, grounded in the **preexistence of the Son** and the Spirit's inspiration of Scripture. Because Scripture has both **human authors** and a **divine author**, the church has confessed a richer sense than human intention alone, often signaled by the term *sensus plenior*. The result is a disciplined Christological reading that avoids **allegorical arbitrariness** by attending to textual patterns of promise, oath, and oath-fulfillment, anchored in **covenantal structures**.

#### 2.**Biblical Foundations**
In Luke 24, probably within the 30s, the risen Jesus interprets Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms as that which must be fulfilled concerning him, giving the canonical charter for **Christological exegesis** and **typology**. John 5 announces that Moses wrote of Jesus, and John 1 confesses the preexistent *logos*, affirming **Christ's preexistence and identity** with the God of Israel. Paul in 1 Corinthians 10 identifies the Rock that followed Israel as **Christ**, and Hebrews 1 to 3 reads the Psalms as divine speech about and by the Son, establishing **prosopological exegesis** as apostolic practice.

Key Old Testament texts display patterned promise. Genesis 3.15 signals the **protevangelium**, promising a seed who will crush the serpent, which the New Testament reads as realized in **Christ's cross and resurrection**. The Abrahamic oath in Genesis 22 is read by Paul in Galatians 3 as the gospel preached beforehand to Abraham, joining **covenant**, **justification**, and **Christology**. The Passover and exodus, especially Exodus 12 and Numbers 21, become types of **atonement** and **new exodus**, exemplified in John 19 and John 3 where the lifted serpent typifies **the crucified Son**. The **Davidic covenant** in 2 Samuel 7 grounds royal messianism that flowers in Psalms 2 and 110, with Psalm 110.1 read by Jesus and the apostles as testimony to **the exalted Lord**, whose sitting at the right hand is central to Acts 2.

Prophetic expectation intensifies with Isaiah 7, 9, 11, and 52 to 53, where servant and king converge, providing textures for **vicarious suffering** and **eschatological rule** fulfilled in Jesus. Daniel 7 introduces the **Son of Man**, a heavenly figure receiving dominion, echoed in Mark 14 and Revelation, and integrating **apocalyptic Christology** with royal and priestly motifs. Wisdom texts like Proverbs 8 and Sirach, later drawn into Christian reflection, supply a matrix for **Wisdom Christology**, which John deploys in naming Christ as the *logos*. Theophanic and angelic passages, including the *mal'ak YHWH*, the Angel of the Lord in Genesis 16 and Exodus 3, and the commander of the Lord's army in Joshua 5, raise the question of **Christophanies** and the Son's **mediated presence** before the incarnation.

The New Testament's hermeneutic leverages the Septuagint's *kurios* language for YHWH, applied to Jesus, which effects a **high Christology** by scriptural inclusion rather than mere wordplay. Romans 10 equates confessing Jesus as *kurios* with the Lord of Joel 2, and Philippians 2 draws on Isaiah 45 to ascribe to Jesus the divine name, securing **Christ's inclusion in the divine identity**. Hebrews reads cultic institutions as **shadows and types**, distinguishing **antitype** from type without negating Israel's history, and culminating in the once-for-all **priestly sacrifice** of the Son.

#### 3.**Historical Development**
The second century saw **Justin Martyr** in Dialogue with Trypho around 155 argue that the **Angel of the Lord** and theophanies were manifestations of the **preexistent Logos**, and **Irenaeus** in Against Heresies around 180 advanced **recapitulation**, *anakephalaiosis*, where Christ sums up Adam, Israel, and humanity. Irenaeus stressed the unity of economies, guarding **Christological continuity** from creation through incarnation, and reading the Scriptures through the **rule of truth**. Origen in the early third century developed multiple senses but insisted on the **literal sense** as foundational, while perceiving Christ as the **spiritual sense** of Scripture.

By the fourth and fifth centuries, **Nicaea 325** and **Chalcedon 451** stabilized **Nicene Christology** and the **hypostatic union**, which in turn shaped exegesis. **Athanasius** contended that the Old Testament speaks of the one **homoousios Son**, thus the fulfillment is not a new deity. **Augustine** in On Christian Doctrine around 397 to 426 taught that the Old is revealed in the New and the New is veiled in the Old, giving classic expression to **scripture unity** and **caritas as hermeneutical end**. Antiochene theologians, including **Theodore of Mopsuestia**, pressed a more historical **literal sense**, warning against uncontrolled allegory, thereby clarifying the difference between **typology and allegory**.

The medieval period institutionalized the **fourfold sense**, with **Aquinas** in Summa Theologiae I, question 1, teaching that God authors the spiritual sense through events, which provides a metaphysical basis for **typology**. The Reformation retained Christocentrism with reform, as **Luther's Christum treiben** centered preaching on **law and gospel**, while **Calvin** in the 1559 Institutes and commentaries emphasized **covenantal unity**, arguing that Christ is the substance of the Old Testament while insisting on the **literal sense**. Post-Reformation Reformed scholastics such as **Johannes Cocceius** and **Herman Witsius** in Economy of the Covenants in 1677 systematized **covenant theology**, identifying **covenant of works and covenant of grace** as the framework for Christ's presence across the ages.

Jonathan Edwards in the eighteenth century wrote Notes on the Types, pursuing richly textured **typology** while aiming to discipline it by **redemptive-historical unity**. The Enlightenment and nineteenth century historical criticism, marked by **J. G. Eichhorn** and **Wellhausen**, questioned **messianic prophecy** and blurred divine authorship, while **F. D. E. Schleiermacher** reoriented theology toward religious consciousness. Twentieth century ressourcement with **Henri de Lubac** in 1950 and 1959 retrieved **patristic exegesis**, while **Brevard Childs** in 1979 proposed **canonical criticism**, holding together critical awareness and **canonical shape**. Recent work by **Richard Hays** and **N. T. Wright** has advanced attention to **intertextual echoes** and **Second Temple Jewish** patterns, while **Matthew Bates** has renewed **prosopological exegesis** that hears Trinitarian voices within Israel's Scriptures.

#### 4.**Reformed Doctrine (Old Princeton / Dutch Neo-Calvinist / Westminster)**
Within the Reformed tradition, **Westminster Confession 1646–1648** crystallizes the trajectory. WCF 7 confesses that after the fall God revealed the **covenant of grace** progressively by further steps, and WCF 8 identifies Christ as **the only Mediator** promised from the beginning, thereby grounding a robust **Christ-in-OT** claim. The Heidelberg Catechism Q19 in 1563 states that the gospel was first revealed in Paradise, later published by the patriarchs and prophets, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices, which enshrines **typology** within catechesis.

**Old Princeton** combined critical rigor with confessional fidelity. **B. B. Warfield** argued for the unity of revelation and the **Messiah of the Old Testament**, observing that the New is in the Old contained and the Old is in the New explained, which asserts **organic unity** rather than artificial proof texting. **Geerhardus Vos** developed **biblical theology** in the early twentieth century, presenting revelation as **historically progressive** and eschatological, culminating in Christ the **second Adam** who brings the kingdom in history. Vos insisted that typology is grounded in **divine authorship**, covenantal structure, and the teleology of the ages, all of which constrain **redemptive-historical preaching**.

Dutch Neo-Calvinism, through **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck**, emphasized **organic inspiration** and **Christocentric dogmatics**. Bavinck in Reformed Dogmatics 1895 to 1901 presents Christ as the center of creation and recreation, so that the Old Testament is architectonically ordered toward **Christ's mediatorial work**. Later Reformed voices like **Meredith Kline** refined **typological intrusion** and kingdom oath-structure, reading exodus and conquest as **eschatological prototypes** of final judgment and redemption, stabilizing a disciplined **typology versus allegory** distinction.

#### 5.**Alternative Accounts (Roman Catholic / Lutheran / Modern / Analytic)**
Roman Catholic teaching in **Dei Verbum 1965** affirms that God is the author of both Testaments and that the Old prepares the way for the New, thereby warranting **typology** and a rightly ordered *sensus plenior*. **Henri de Lubac** retrieved the **fourfold sense**, arguing that Christ is the spiritual sense of Scripture, while insisting on the **literal sense** as the foundation, which protects theological reading from arbitrariness. Contemporary Catholic scholarship engages **canonical unity** and resists **supersessionism**, proposing **participatory fulfillment** in which the church shares Israel's promises in the Messiah.

Lutheran interpretation keeps a sharp **law–gospel** distinction and a **Christocentric canon**. **Luther** urged that the Scriptures drive to Christ, **Christum treiben**, while retaining the priority of **the literal sense**. Lutheran dogmatics tends to see ceremonial law and sacrificial types as **shadows of Christ**, while warning against collapsing Israel's narrative into undifferentiated allegory, thereby protecting **two kingdoms** and the integrity of Israel's vocation within **salvation history**.

Modern historical critics like **Wellhausen** and **Bultmann** tended to minimize prediction and typology, re-situating texts within their own horizons and treating **messianic readings** as retrospective church constructions. **Brevard Childs** and **Christopher Seitz** advanced **canonical criticism**, arguing that the final form presents a theological shape coherent with **apostolic Christology**. **Richard Hays** explored **figural reading** and **echoes of Scripture**, while **N. T. Wright** pressed **Second Temple Jewish** categories to show how Jesus embodies Israel's story. In analytic and biblical-theological crosswork, **Matthew Bates** argues for **prosopological exegesis** where New Testament authors construe Old Testament speakers and addressees in Trinitarian terms, thereby reinforcing **triune Christology** rooted in Scripture. **Speech-act theory** has also aided accounts of **divine authorship** that legitimize multiple levels of meaning without dismissing **human intention**.

#### 6.**Current Debates and Objections**
A first objection concerns **supersessionism**, the charge that Christological readings erase Israel. Reformed and Catholic responses appeal to **participatory fulfillment** and **one olive tree** language from Romans 11, affirming the abiding significance of Israel while confessing **Jesus as Israels Messiah**. The aim is to hold **promise and fulfillment** without elimination, allowing for ongoing Jewish vocation within **Gods covenantal faithfulness**.

A second debate centers on **Christophanies**, especially the **Angel of the Lord**. Some, following **Justin and Calvin**, identify the angel as the **preincarnate Son**, given divine speech and worship, while others caution that the narratives present a theophany of the one God without hypostatic specification. A measured approach recognizes **theophanic mediation** and divine self-presentation that becomes clear as **Christological economy** in the New Testament, without requiring that each angelic appearance be identified dogmatically with the Son.

A third debate disputes *sensus plenior*. Critics fear it violates **original meaning**, while proponents argue that **divine authorship and canonical shape** warrant deeper senses that are textually and salvation-historically grounded. The best accounts tie **typology** to covenantal structures, intertextual usage, and the **apostolic hermeneutic** of Luke 24 and Hebrews, avoiding free-floating **allegory**. Textual issues, such as the **Jude 5 Jesus** variant that may attribute the exodus to Jesus, illustrate how textual criticism intersects with **Christological readings**, calling for humble judgment and canonical balance.

Finally, the cultural setting demands attention to **Jewish–Christian relations**, ensuring that **Christological confession** is not weaponized against Jews, and to the integrity of **literal sense and typological sense**, which protects both historical reality and theological fulfillment. The aim is a hermeneutic that is doxological, ecclesial, and hospitable to **Scriptures divine–human** nature.

#### 7.**System Links (Trinity / Christology / Anthropology etc.)**
Trinitarianly, **Rahners Rule** anchors the claim that the one acting in Israel is the **eternal Son**, thereby tying Christ-in-OT to **Nicene faith** and **divine simplicity** in the sense that God is not divided in his works. Christologically, **Chalcedonian unity** ensures that Old Testament portraits converge on the one **person of the Son**, whose incarnate mission fulfills previous **mediations and types**. Pneumatologically, the **Spirit of prophecy** bears witness to Christ, so that a Spirit-led reading participates in the **economy of revelation**.

Anthropology and hamartiology are clarified as Adam and Israel prefigure **Christ the true image**, so that **imago Dei** is recapitulated in the Son who is the image of God in Colossians 1.15. Soteriology is unified by **covenant of grace** and **federal headship**, where sacrifices, priesthood, and kingdom anticipate **atonement and union with Christ**. Ecclesiology is informed by **one people of God**, grafting Gentiles into Israels promises through **Christ the seed of Abraham**, while maintaining the churchs dependence on **Israel's Scriptures**. Sacramentally, Passover and circumcision give way to **Lord's Supper and baptism**, typologically connected yet transformed by **Christ's once-for-all work**. Eschatology is structured by **already and not yet**, where prophetic hopes begin fulfillment in **Christ's resurrection and ascension** and await consummation. Bibliology is illuminated by **inspiration and canon**, where divine authorship grounds **canonical unity** and the legitimacy of **figural reading**.

#### 8.**Pastoral and Liturgical Payoff**
Pastorally, a robust doctrine of Christ in both Testaments generates **Christ-centered preaching** that honors the **literal sense** of Old Testament texts while tracing **redemptive-historical trajectories** to Christ. Catechesis can use the creeds and catechisms, such as Heidelberg Q19, to teach believers the **unity of Scripture** and the coherence of **gospel promises** from Genesis to Revelation. Liturgically, the church learns to pray the **Psalms as the prayers of Christ and his body**, to inhabit **Advent** as the time of promise and **Easter** as fulfillment, and to receive **baptism and the Supper** as typologically rich enactments. Ethically, believers are formed by **union with Christ**, seeing the exodus as paradigm for liberation from sin, and the law as fulfilled in **love through the Spirit**.

Such practice demands safeguards. Ministers should avoid **allegorical excess** by consulting the rule of faith, the lectionary, and sound exegesis, and by showing their work from the **textual patterns** that the apostles themselves exploit. Communities should cultivate humility toward **Jewish neighbors**, confessing that reading the Old Testament as Christian Scripture is a confession about **Christ's identity** rather than a dismissal of Israels testimony. Finally, pastors should train congregations to delight in **canonical intertextuality**, learning the music of **types and antitypes** so that the church sings Christ from Genesis to the Apocalypse.

#### 9.**One concise closing sentence.**
The one Lord Jesus Christ, eternally Son and incarnate Savior, is the living center who speaks in Israel's Scriptures and fulfills them in the gospel, uniting the Testaments in the one **covenant of grace** and the praise of the **triune God**.
