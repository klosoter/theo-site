# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge approached the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through a robust commitment to the **unity of Scripture** and the **progressive revelation** of the **Messiah**. He emphasized that the **types, prophecies, and promises** of the Old Testament find their fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ as revealed in the New Testament, maintaining a strong **Reformed hermeneutic** that sees Christ as the central figure of redemptive history.

- "The whole of the Old Testament is a prophecy or type of Christ, and the whole of the New Testament is the record of His advent and work." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans

- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a single, divinely inspired narrative centered on **Christ**.
    - The Old and New Testaments are organically connected, not disparate revelations.
    - The **covenant of grace** underlies both Testaments, with Christ as its mediator.
    - All Scripture ultimately points to the person and work of Jesus.
    - "The Bible is one book, and its unity is found in Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Typology and Prophecy**
    - Old Testament types (e.g., sacrifices, priesthood, kingship) prefigure Christ.
    - Prophetic passages explicitly and implicitly anticipate the coming Messiah.
    - Fulfillment in Christ validates the divine authorship and coherence of Scripture.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but grounded in God’s redemptive plan.
    - "All the institutions of the Old Testament were designed to prefigure the redemption to be effected by Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s revelation unfolds gradually, culminating in Christ.
    - Earlier revelations are preparatory and partial, clarified in the New Testament.
    - The Old Testament contains shadows; the New Testament brings substance in Christ.
    - The unity of the Testaments is seen in the unfolding of the **plan of salvation**.
    - "The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Christocentric Hermeneutics**
    - Interpretation of both Testaments must be centered on Christ.
    - Exegesis should recognize the ultimate reference to Christ in OT passages.
    - The apostles’ use of the Old Testament models a Christ-centered reading.
    - The meaning of Scripture is fully realized in the light of Christ’s person and work.
    - "The Scriptures testify of Christ, and to Him all the prophets give witness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Continuity and Fulfillment**
    - The promises to Israel are fulfilled in Christ and extended to the church.
    - The Old Testament law, ceremonies, and prophecies find their completion in Jesus.
    - The church is the continuation of the people of God, united in Christ.
    - Fulfillment does not abolish the Old Testament but brings its meaning to fullness.
    - "The Old dispensation was preparatory; the New is consummative in Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** shaped generations of Reformed theologians, especially through his emphasis on the **unity of redemptive history**. His Christocentric reading of Scripture became foundational for later Princeton theology and influenced evangelical biblical interpretation. Hodge’s insistence on the organic connection between the Testaments continues to inform contemporary discussions on biblical theology and hermeneutics.
