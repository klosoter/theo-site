# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine viewed **Christ** as the unifying center of both the **Old and New Testaments**, insisting that the entire **Scriptural canon** testifies to the person and work of Christ. He emphasized the **unity of redemptive history**, interpreting the Old Testament as containing **types and prophecies** fulfilled in the New, with Christ as the key to understanding all of Scripture.

- "In the Old Testament the New is concealed, in the New the Old is revealed." (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2.73)

## Key Works

- Confessions
- De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine)
- Enarrationes in Psalmos (Expositions on the Psalms)
- Tractates on the Gospel of John
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Scripture**
    - Both Testaments form a single, coherent narrative centered on Christ.
    - The Old Testament is not abolished but fulfilled in the New.
    - Christ is present throughout the entire biblical canon.
    - The same God acts in both Testaments, revealing a unified plan of salvation.
    - "The two Testaments are not opposed to each other, but the New is hidden in the Old and the Old is made manifest in the New." (De Catechizandis Rudibus)

2. **Typology and Allegory**
    - Old Testament figures and events serve as **types** pointing to Christ.
    - Allegorical interpretation uncovers deeper spiritual meanings fulfilled in Jesus.
    - The literal sense is important but subordinate to the spiritual sense.
    - Christ is the hermeneutical key for interpreting all Scripture.
    - "Whatever is said in the Old Testament is a prophecy of Christ." (Enarrationes in Psalmos)

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God's self-disclosure unfolds gradually from Old to New Testament.
    - The fullness of revelation comes in Christ, but earlier stages are preparatory.
    - The Old Testament contains shadows and promises; the New brings fulfillment.
    - The unity of revelation is maintained despite historical progression.
    - "The Law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the Law might be fulfilled." (De Spiritu et Littera)

4. **Christ as the Center of Salvation History**
    - All of history, including Israel's story, points toward Christ's incarnation and redemptive work.
    - The promises to Israel find their ultimate meaning in Christ.
    - The church, as the body of Christ, is the continuation of God's people.
    - Christ's work is the climax and interpretive key of all biblical history.
    - "All things that were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope—in Christ." (City of God)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination**
    - The Holy Spirit enables believers to perceive Christ in both Testaments.
    - Spiritual understanding is necessary to grasp the unity of Scripture.
    - The Spirit guides the church in rightly interpreting Christ throughout the Bible.
    - Without the Spirit, the deeper meaning of Scripture remains veiled.
    - "The Holy Spirit has been given to us so that we might understand the things freely given us by God, especially Christ as revealed in the Scriptures." (De Doctrina Christiana)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** profoundly shaped Western exegesis, especially through his emphasis on **typology** and the **unity of redemptive history**. His interpretive methods influenced medieval, Reformation, and modern theological traditions, providing a framework for reading Scripture as a unified testimony to Christ. Augustine’s legacy endures in the ongoing Christian conviction that Christ is the center and fulfillment of all biblical revelation.
