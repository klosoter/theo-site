# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the question of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**. He rejected traditional notions of **predictive prophecy** and typology, instead emphasizing the **kerygma** of the New Testament and the existential encounter with Christ as decisive for faith, rather than historical or literary continuity between the Testaments.

- "The Old Testament is not in itself a witness to Christ, but it becomes such in so far as it is understood in the light of the kerygma." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

## Key Works

- "Jesus Christ and Mythology" (1958)
- "Theology of the New Testament" (1948–1953)
- "History and Eschatology" (1957)
- "New Testament and Mythology" (in Kerygma and Myth, 1941)
- "Exegesis Without Presuppositions?" (1946)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Scripture**
    - Interprets biblical texts by stripping away mythological worldviews to uncover existential meaning.
    - Views Old Testament references to Christ as mythic constructs shaped by early Christian faith.
    - Rejects literal fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Christ.
    - Sees myth as a vehicle for existential truth, not historical fact.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the other-worldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." ("New Testament and Mythology")

2. **Primacy of the Kerygma**
    - Centers the proclamation of Christ’s death and resurrection as the core of Christian faith.
    - Asserts that the New Testament’s witness to Christ is not dependent on Old Testament predictions.
    - Emphasizes the existential call to decision in the kerygma over historical continuity.
    - The Old Testament becomes Christian Scripture only through its reinterpretation in light of the kerygma.
    - "The kerygma alone is the word of God, and it alone makes the Old Testament a Christian book." ("Jesus Christ and Mythology")

3. **Existential Interpretation**
    - Reads both Testaments through the lens of existential philosophy, especially Heidegger.
    - Focuses on the individual's encounter with the Christ-event as the locus of meaning.
    - Downplays historical or typological connections between Old and New Testaments.
    - Sees Christ as the one who confronts each person with the demand for authentic existence.
    - "What matters is not the historical Jesus, but the Christ who is preached." ("Theology of the New Testament")

4. **Discontinuity Between Testaments**
    - Argues that the Old Testament is not inherently Christian Scripture.
    - Claims that only through reinterpretation by the early church does the Old Testament witness to Christ.
    - Rejects typological or predictive readings as anachronistic.
    - Emphasizes the radical newness of the Christ-event in the New Testament.
    - "The Old Testament is only indirectly related to the New, through the faith of the early Church." ("Theology of the New Testament")

5. **Historical Skepticism**
    - Maintains a critical stance toward the historicity of both Old Testament events and New Testament claims.
    - Views the Christ of faith as distinct from the Jesus of history.
    - Sees historical investigation as secondary to existential interpretation.
    - Argues that faith does not rest on historical fulfillment but on existential encounter.
    - "Faith is not based on historical knowledge, but on the word which is proclaimed." ("History and Eschatology")

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** profoundly shaped twentieth-century biblical scholarship, especially in the areas of **hermeneutics** and the relationship between history and faith. His emphasis on existential interpretation and the kerygma challenged traditional views of prophecy and typology, leading to ongoing debates about the unity of Scripture. While often criticized by confessional theologians, his work remains a touchstone for discussions on the theological meaning of the Testaments and the nature of biblical authority.
