# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline advanced a distinctive approach to the presence of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** by emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the centrality of **covenant theology**. He argued that the **Old Testament** is replete with **typological patterns** and **theophanic manifestations** that find their fulfillment in the person and work of Christ as revealed in the **New Testament**.

- "The Old Testament is Christotelic, pointing forward to the coming of Christ as the fulfillment of its covenantal promises and typological structures." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- By Oath Consigned
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Typology as Christocentric**
   - The **Old Testament** is structured around typological patterns that prefigure Christ.
   - Types such as Adam, Noah, and David serve as anticipatory figures of the Messiah.
   - Typology is not mere analogy but is rooted in God’s sovereign design of history.
   - The fulfillment of these types in Christ is essential for understanding the unity of Scripture.
   - "Typology is a divinely intended correspondence between persons, events, and institutions in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Covenant as the Framework of Redemptive History**
   - The covenants of creation, works, and grace structure the biblical narrative.
   - Christ is the mediator and fulfillment of the **covenant of grace**.
   - The **Old Testament covenants** anticipate and foreshadow the new covenant in Christ.
   - The continuity and discontinuity between covenants are crucial for biblical theology.
   - "The history of redemption is the history of the covenants, culminating in Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Theophany and Divine Presence**
   - **Theophanies** in the Old Testament are pre-incarnate manifestations of the Son.
   - These appearances reveal the continuity of Christ’s presence throughout redemptive history.
   - The glory-cloud and Angel of the Lord are central theophanic motifs.
   - The New Testament identifies Christ as the one who was present in these Old Testament events.
   - "The Angel of the Lord is the pre-incarnate Christ, the divine presence among his people." (Images of the Spirit)

4. **Canonical and Structural Unity**
   - The Bible is a unified canon with Christ as its central theme.
   - The structure of biblical authority is grounded in the divine authorship and coherence of Scripture.
   - Both Testaments must be interpreted in light of their ultimate reference to Christ.
   - The **New Testament** provides the authoritative interpretation of the Old.
   - "The New Testament is the inspired commentary on the Old Testament, revealing its Christological focus." (The Structure of Biblical Authority)

5. **Eschatology and Consummation in Christ**
   - The Old Testament’s eschatological hopes are realized in Christ’s first and second comings.
   - The movement from promise to fulfillment is central to understanding biblical eschatology.
   - Christ inaugurates the new creation anticipated in the prophetic and apocalyptic literature.
   - The church lives in the tension of the already and not yet, grounded in Christ’s redemptive work.
   - "The eschatological kingdom anticipated in the Old Testament is inaugurated and consummated in Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of **typology**, covenant, and theophany has shaped contemporary Reformed approaches to the unity of the **Old and New Testaments**. His work has influenced generations of biblical theologians, especially in the areas of **covenant theology** and the interpretation of Christ in all of Scripture. Kline’s emphasis on the structural and canonical unity of the Bible continues to inform debates on biblical theology and hermeneutics within the Reformed tradition.
