# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin maintained that **Christ** is the central figure of both the **Old and New Testaments**, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** and the continuity of the **covenant of grace**. He argued that the **promises, types, and prophecies** of the Old Testament find their fulfillment in the person and work of Christ, who is revealed progressively but consistently throughout Scripture.

- "Christ is the same in both Testaments, the author and mediator of the covenant of grace, although revealed in different ways." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- Commentary on Hebrews
- Disputations on the Covenant of Grace
- Selected sermons and disputations on Messianic prophecy

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is one in substance, administered differently in the Old and New Testaments.
    - Christ is the mediator and substance of this covenant in both eras.
    - The Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the promised Christ.
    - The differences between the Testaments are in form, not in essence.
    - "The covenant of grace is the same in both Testaments as to substance, differing only in circumstances and mode of administration." (Institutes)

2. **Typology and Prophecy Point to Christ**
    - Old Testament types (e.g., sacrifices, priesthood) prefigure Christ’s person and work.
    - Prophecies concerning the Messiah are fulfilled in Jesus.
    - The ceremonial law was a shadow, with Christ as the reality.
    - The unity of Scripture is demonstrated in the coherence of typological fulfillment.
    - "All the types and shadows of the law pointed to Christ, who is their end and fulfillment." (Institutes)

3. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s revelation of Christ is gradual, increasing in clarity from the Old to the New Testament.
    - The Old Testament contains the **gospel** in seed form, fully manifested in the New.
    - The promises to the patriarchs are realized in Christ.
    - The New Testament interprets and confirms the Old Testament witness to Christ.
    - "The doctrine of salvation was not new in the New Testament, but more clearly revealed." (Institutes)

4. **Christ as the Center of Scripture**
    - Christ is the unifying subject of all Scripture.
    - Both Testaments testify to the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s work.
    - The Scriptures are to be interpreted with Christ as their focus.
    - The Old Testament is not obsolete but preparatory for Christ’s coming.
    - "Christ is the scope and center to which all the Scriptures tend." (Institutes)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
    - The Old and New Testaments differ in external rites and ceremonies.
    - The substance of salvation remains unchanged: faith in Christ.
    - The New Testament brings greater clarity and freedom from ceremonial law.
    - The church is one people of God across both Testaments.
    - "The difference is not of substance, but of administration and degree of revelation." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust articulation of **Christ’s presence in both the Old and New Testaments** shaped later Reformed approaches to biblical theology and covenantal continuity. His defense of the unity of the **covenant of grace** influenced confessional standards and provided a foundation for typological and Christocentric interpretation. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the Testaments and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture.
