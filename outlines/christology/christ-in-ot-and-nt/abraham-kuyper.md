# Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920)

Abraham Kuyper emphasized the unity of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ** throughout both the **Old and New Testaments**. He argued that the entire biblical narrative is oriented toward the revelation of **Christ as Mediator**, and that the **covenant of grace** progressively unfolds in both testaments, culminating in the person and work of Jesus.

- "The Old Testament is not complete without the New, nor the New without the Old; both together form the one Word of the one God concerning the one Christ." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture is a unified revelation, with **Christ** as its center in both testaments.
    - The **Old Testament** anticipates and prepares for the coming of Christ.
    - The **New Testament** fulfills and interprets the promises and types of the Old.
    - The unity is not merely thematic but rooted in divine authorship.
    - "The Holy Scriptures are not a collection of disconnected writings, but a living organism, whose soul is Christ." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

2. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s revelation unfolds gradually, with increasing clarity about **Christ**.
    - The **covenant of grace** is progressively revealed from Genesis to Revelation.
    - Types, shadows, and prophecies in the Old Testament point to Christ.
    - The New Testament provides the full light in which the Old is understood.
    - "Revelation is not static but grows and matures, culminating in Christ." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

3. **Christ as Mediator in Both Testaments**
    - Christ is the only Mediator between God and humanity throughout redemptive history.
    - Old Testament saints are saved through faith in the coming Christ.
    - The sacrificial system and prophetic office prefigure Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The New Testament reveals the fulfillment of this mediation in Jesus.
    - "There is but one Mediator, and He is present in promise and type before His incarnation." (The Work of the Holy Spirit)

4. **Covenant of Grace as Unifying Principle**
    - The **covenant of grace** binds together the people of God in both testaments.
    - The promises to Abraham and David are realized in Christ.
    - The church is one across both dispensations, united in Christ.
    - The sacraments of both testaments signify the same redemptive reality.
    - "The covenant of grace is the golden thread that runs through all of Scripture." (Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology)

5. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament types and ceremonies are divinely intended to foreshadow Christ.
    - The New Testament interprets these types as fulfilled in Jesus.
    - Typology is not arbitrary but grounded in God’s sovereign design.
    - The reality (Christ) surpasses the shadow (type), but both are necessary for understanding redemption.
    - "The types and shadows of the Old find their truth and substance in the Christ of the New." (Pro Rege)

## Legacy and Impact

Kuyper’s robust doctrine of **Christ in both the Old and New Testaments** shaped Reformed biblical theology and influenced later neo-Calvinist thought. His emphasis on the **organic unity of Scripture** and the centrality of the **covenant of grace** provided a framework for understanding redemptive history as a coherent whole. Kuyper’s insights continue to inform discussions on biblical theology, hermeneutics, and the relationship between the testaments within the Reformed tradition.
