# N.T. Wright (1948–)

N.T. Wright emphasizes the continuity of **Christ** as the fulfillment of **Old Testament promises** and the embodiment of **Israel’s vocation** in the **New Testament**. He argues that Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection are best understood within the narrative of **Second Temple Judaism**, where the **Messiah** brings to completion the story of **Israel** and inaugurates the **kingdom of God**.

- "Jesus believed himself called to embody Israel’s destiny, to bring about the long-awaited kingdom, and to fulfill the scriptures." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

## Key Works

- The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)
- Scripture and the Authority of God (2011)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Fulfillment of Israel’s Story**
    - Jesus’ mission is rooted in the narrative of **Israel’s scriptures**.
    - The Old Testament is not merely background but is **fulfilled** and reinterpreted in Christ.
    - Jesus embodies the role of **Messiah** as anticipated by Israel’s prophets.
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated through Jesus as the climax of Israel’s history.
    - "Jesus saw himself as the one in whom and through whom the purposes of Israel’s God would at last be accomplished." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

2. **Second Temple Jewish Context**
    - Understanding Jesus requires situating him within **Second Temple Judaism**.
    - The expectations of **Messiah** and **restoration** shape the NT presentation of Christ.
    - Jesus redefines messianic hopes through his suffering and resurrection.
    - The NT writers interpret Jesus’ work as the true realization of Israel’s hopes.
    - "The New Testament is incomprehensible without the story of Israel and the hopes of Second Temple Judaism." (The New Testament and the People of God)

3. **Scriptural Narrative and Typology**
    - Wright stresses the **narrative unity** of Scripture, with Christ as its center.
    - Old Testament events and figures are **types** pointing forward to Jesus.
    - The NT authors read the OT through a **christological lens**.
    - Typology is not allegory but the recognition of God’s consistent redemptive pattern.
    - "The early Christians read their scriptures as a story now brought to its climax in Jesus." (Scripture and the Authority of God)

4. **Resurrection as Vindication**
    - The resurrection is the **decisive event** confirming Jesus as Messiah.
    - OT prophecies of **restoration** are fulfilled in Jesus’ resurrection.
    - The resurrection is both the fulfillment of Israel’s hope and the foundation of the church’s proclamation.
    - It signals the beginning of **new creation** as foretold in the prophets.
    - "The resurrection was seen as the moment when the creator God fulfilled his ancient promises to Israel." (The Resurrection of the Son of God)

5. **Kingdom of God and New Exodus**
    - Jesus’ ministry enacts a **new exodus**, liberating God’s people from sin and exile.
    - The **kingdom of God** is inaugurated in Jesus’ life and ministry, fulfilling OT expectations.
    - The NT presents Jesus as the one who leads God’s people into a new covenant reality.
    - The church is called to live out this **kingdom reality** as the renewed people of God.
    - "Jesus’ announcement of the kingdom was the announcement that the long exile was over." (Jesus and the Victory of God)

## Legacy and Impact

N.T. Wright has profoundly shaped contemporary understanding of **Christ in the Old and New Testaments** by insisting on the narrative and covenantal continuity between them. His scholarship has revitalized the study of **Second Temple Judaism** as essential for interpreting Jesus and the early church. Wright’s work continues to influence biblical theology, especially in how the **kingdom of God** and the identity of Jesus as Messiah are understood within the grand sweep of Scripture.
