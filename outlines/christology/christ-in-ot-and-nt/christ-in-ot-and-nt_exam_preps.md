### TITLE
One Christ in Two Testaments: The Canonical Unity of Old and New in the Person and Work of the Son

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How the one **Christ of the covenant of grace** is present, promised, and operative in the Old Testament and revealed and interpreted in the New Testament, without collapsing or dividing the two Testaments.
- Decisive figures: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, Geerhardus Vos, B B Warfield.
- Relevant traditions: Patristic exegesis and canon formation, medieval scholastic theology, Reformation and post‑Reformation **federal theology**, and early Reformed biblical theology.
- Debates:
  - Internal: patristic and Reformed disagreements over allegory versus typology, law–gospel relation, and the continuity of the **covenant of grace**.
  - External: Marcionism and its modern revivals, historical‑critical reductionism, dispensational separations of Israel and the church.
  - Contemporary: christocentric versus christotelic hermeneutics, accusations of supersessionism, and the use of the Old Testament in systematic theology and preaching.
- Defended position: The one eternal Son is the covenantal and hermeneutical center of both Old and New Testaments, so that the Old genuinely and progressively reveals Christ in shadow and promise, while the New normatively interprets the Old in the light of the incarnate, crucified, and risen Lord, within a single **organic unity of special revelation**.

### ESSAY
To confess Christ in Old and New Testaments is to assert that the one eternal Son is not only the climax of a historical process but the principium of the canon itself. The topic is not merely whether prophetic texts predict Jesus but whether the entire economy of Old Testament revelation is ordered to, grounded in, and pervaded by the person and work of the Son, and whether the New Testament’s witness is both the unveiling of that same Christ and the inspired hermeneutical key to the earlier Scriptures. The question presses the candidate to hold together **trinitarian revelation**, **covenantal continuity**, and **canonical unity** against both reductionist historical criticism and speculative spiritualizing. I will defend the position that the one Christ of the **covenant of grace** is truly, though progressively and typologically, revealed in the Old Testament and that the New Testament, as the apostolic witness to the incarnate Son, authoritatively interprets and consummates that revelation. This position is demanded by the canon’s own structure, by the church’s rule of faith, and by the internal coherence of classical Reformed theology.

Augustine is decisive because he first gave the Western church its stable formula for the Testaments’ relation and a robustly christological reading of the Old. His famous dictum that the New is latent in the Old and the Old is patent in the New asserts an **organic unity of special revelation**: one divine author, two distinct yet internally ordered economies of disclosure. For Augustine, the decisive hermeneutical anchor is Christ as the eternal Wisdom of God, the one through whom all things were made and through whom all saving revelation is mediated. In works like De Doctrina Christiana and his preaching on the Psalms, he insists that the true understanding of the Old Testament is bound to the rule of faith, whose center is the incarnate, crucified, and risen Christ. This rule is not an extrinsic grid imposed upon the text but the confession of what the text itself communicates when read in the light of the whole canon and the Trinity.

Yet Augustine is also the place where internal debates about allegory begin. His spiritual readings of the Old Testament often move quickly from literal to figurative senses. Examiners will ask whether this dissolves the historical particularity of Israel into timeless moral lessons. The right response is to distinguish Augustine’s best insights from his occasional excesses. At his best, he maintains a genuine historical sense, where the literal historical reality of Israel’s history is itself the bearer of typological significance. When he interprets the Psalms as the voice of Christ and his body, he is not evacuating Davidic authorship but discerning in David a Spirit‑given pattern that finds its fullness in Christ. The candidate must concede that patristic exegesis sometimes blurred literal and allegorical senses, yet insist that Augustine’s fundamental thesis is sound: the Old Testament is a Christological book within a Trinitarian economy, and it must be read in communion with the apostolic faith.

Thomas Aquinas develops this patristic inheritance with scholastic precision, especially in his account of the senses of Scripture. In the Summa Theologiae he grounds multiple senses in **divine authorship**. Because God is Lord of history and language, he can ordain that historical realities, not merely words, signify further realities. This makes **typology** a subset of the literal sense in an expanded sense of literal, while the allegorical, moral, and anagogical senses express dimensions of the spiritual sense. Christ is the center of this multi‑layered signification. Old Testament persons and events are divinely instituted types of Christ, the church, and eschatological glory. For Aquinas, the unity of the two Testaments is thus anchored in the one divine intention that orders all of redemptive history to Christ, while still affirming a robust literal historicity.

Aquinas is crucial for two contemporary objections. First, historical critics claim that reading Christ into the Old Testament imports later meanings that the original human authors could not have intended. Aquinas’ distinction between the principal author, God, and instrumental human authors allows us to answer: the human author’s conscious horizon is real but not exhaustive. Because the Spirit superintends the authors and events, the text can bear a surplus of meaning intentionally placed there by the divine author, later unveiled in the New Testament. This does not license arbitrary readings, since the spiritual sense must be grounded in the divinely ordained realities and in the New Testament’s own patterns of interpretation. Second, some Protestants worry that the fourfold sense undermines grammatical‑historical exegesis. Here one can appeal to Aquinas’ insistence that the literal sense is foundational and that spiritual senses can never contradict it. Properly chastened by Reformation concerns, Aquinas actually gives a metaphysical account of why typology is not eisegesis but recognition of God’s sovereign authorship of history.

If Augustine and Aquinas supply the metaphysical and hermeneutical grammar of a christological Old Testament, Calvin is decisive for rooting that grammar in **covenant theology** and a disciplined return to the text. Calvin insists in his Institutes and commentaries that Christ is the substance of the law and the prophets and that the **covenant of grace** is one in substance though diverse in administration. For him, the patriarchs had real, if shadowy, communion with Christ. Abraham believed in the promised seed, and that faith was faith in Christ, though without the historical clarity granted to the apostles.

Calvin’s decisive contribution is to locate christological presence in the Old Testament not only in individual predictions but in the structure of redemptive history as a series of covenants ordered to Christ. The Mosaic law, temple, priesthood, and sacrifices are not arbitrary religious artifacts but divinely instituted types pointing forward to the once‑for‑all priestly work of Christ. Yet Calvin resists arbitrary allegorizing. His commentaries insist on the literal sense and on careful attention to historical context and literary form. The Old Testament has integrity as a word addressed to Israel in its own time, even as its full import can only be grasped post‑Christum. This balance is a hallmark of the Reformed tradition and remains essential under cross‑examination.

Here internal Reformed debates emerge. Within **federal theology**, some lean toward heavier typological readings, others toward stricter grammatical‑historical controls. The candidate must be able to articulate that the confessional Reformed position, shaped by Calvin and codified in documents like the Westminster Confession, holds that the Old and New Testaments are one **covenant of grace**, differently administered. Christ is present under the promises, types, and sacrifices of the Old, and more fully and clearly exhibited in the ordinances of the New. A likely examiner challenge will press whether this makes Old Testament believers Christians. The answer is yes, according to the substance of their faith, which was in the promised mediator, though they did not yet confess the name Jesus of Nazareth with apostolic specificity. Hebrews 11 is decisive: the patriarchs looked for the city whose builder is God and greeted the promises from afar. They are saved by Christ, through faith, under Old Testament administrations.

B B Warfield stands at the intersection of Reformed orthodoxy and modern critical challenges. His famous description of progressive revelation likens the Old Testament to a richly furnished room dimly lit and the New Testament to the same room with the lights turned on. The furniture does not change; its form and arrangement become clear. For Warfield, the canon is a single divine revelation with a progressive, historical unfolding culminating in Christ. His doctrine of **inspiration** and **organic revelation** is key: God’s self‑disclosure is not a series of disconnected oracles but an organically developing history and interpretation of that history, guided by the Spirit toward Christ as the telos.

Warfield confronts external modern opponents directly. Against liberal historicism that treats the Old Testament as Israel’s evolving religious consciousness with no necessary relation to Jesus of Nazareth, Warfield insists on the prophetic and typological orientation of the Old toward Christ as an intrinsic feature of the text, not a retrojective Christian imposition. At the same time, he warns against a mechanical proof‑text approach that flattens the richness of Old Testament theology into a string of messianic predictions detached from their literary and covenantal contexts. Under examination, one must show how Warfield’s analogy rebuts both Marcionite severance and modern reductionism: Marcion severs the Testaments by positing a different god; Warfield shows that the same God speaks throughout, once in promise and shadow, then in accomplishment and light.

Geerhardus Vos intensifies and deepens this line by articulating a thoroughly christological **biblical theology**. In his Biblical Theology and his Pauline Eschatology, Vos argues that the unity of Scripture lies not primarily in thematic abstraction but in the historical unfolding of the **kingdom of God** centered on Christ. The Old Testament is not a flat field of doctrines awaiting systematic arrangement; it is a progressive history in which God’s eschatological kingdom is announced, prefigured, and gradually realized, so that Christ is both the center of that process and its final horizon. Vos is decisive for rebutting both dispensational and christotelic moves that threaten the substantive presence of Christ in the Old.

Vos insists that the Old Testament saints had real, eschatologically oriented communion with Christ by promise and Spirit. The types and shadows are not accidental; they are the Spirit’s own forward‑pointing structures embedded in the history. This allows Vos to affirm with Reformed confessions that the **covenant of grace** is one across the Testaments, while also emphasizing the epochal newness of Christ’s advent and the outpouring of the Spirit. Under questioning, one must stress that for Vos the New Testament’s use of the Old is not eisegetical but the climactic divine commentary on that earlier revelation. When Jesus opens the Scriptures to the disciples on the Emmaus road and shows that Moses and all the Prophets spoke of his sufferings and glory, he is not twisting texts to fit his story but unveiling the divine intention that structured those texts all along.

These figures collectively prepare us to engage internal, external, and contemporary debates. Internally, the key issues are allegory versus typology, and continuity versus discontinuity in the covenants. The patristic and medieval traditions, represented by Augustine and Aquinas, provide a theological grammar for spiritual reading that must be disciplined by Calvin’s and Vos’s insistence on historical and covenantal particularity. A Reformed candidate should affirm **typology** as God‑ordained, Christ‑centered signification in history, while rejecting arbitrary allegory not grounded in text, history, and New Testament warrant. On covenantal continuity, one must reject both anabaptist and dispensational fragmentations that radically separate Israel and the church or law and gospel in ways that undermine the one **covenant of grace**. Yet one must also avoid flattening the progress of revelation. The difference between Old and New is not one of two different ways of salvation but of clarity, fullness, and redemptive accomplishment in Christ.

Externally, Marcionism, both ancient and modern, poses a direct challenge. Marcion denied the Old Testament God as the Father of Jesus and rejected the Old Testament as Christian Scripture. Modern functional Marcionism does the same by neglect or embarrassment, sidelining Israel’s Scriptures as morally problematic or theologically obsolete. Against this, the candidate must assert, with Augustine and the entire catholic tradition, that the God of Abraham is the Father of Jesus and that Christ himself and his apostles receive the Old Testament as divinely given. To sever Christ from the Old Testament is to invent a different Christ. This also addresses contemporary moral objections to Old Testament law and narratives: the same Christ who fulfills the law is the lawgiver, and the cross unveils both the gravity of Old Testament judgment and the depth of divine mercy.

Historical‑critical reductionism is another external opponent. It insists that meaning is exhausted by the horizon of human authors and original audiences, often combined with skepticism about predictive prophecy and typology. Here Aquinas’ account of **divine authorship**, Warfield’s **organic revelation**, and Vos’s biblical theology converge. Because the triune God is Lord of history and language, he can shape a history and a corpus of texts so that they are internally ordered to Christ, even when human authors only dimly apprehend the fullness of that order. Predictive prophecy and type are not violations of historical process but its deepest truth, seen only when the light of Christ is turned on. The New Testament’s use of the Old, including texts that seem to go beyond the surface sense, is thus not a hermeneutical error to be corrected by modern scholars but an inspired pattern we are called to learn and imitate with reverent care.

Dispensationalism raises a different external challenge, claiming radical discontinuity between Israel and the church and often treating Old Testament promises as primarily for ethnic Israel, with the church a parenthesis. The Reformed doctrine of the **covenant of grace**, shaped by Calvin and developed by Vos, answers by insisting that Christ is the one seed of Abraham in whom Jew and Gentile are blessed. The olive tree is one; branches are broken off and grafted in, but the root is the same. The New Testament’s reapplication of Old Testament promises to the church is not spiritualizing theft but the revelation that Christ is the true Israel and that union with him is participation in Israel’s inheritance. Examiners may push on charges of supersessionism. The answer is to distinguish a punitive supersessionism that discards Israel from a christological fulfillment in which Israel’s vocation is concentrated in the Messiah and extended to the nations. Romans 9–11 forbids any theology that boasts against the branches or denies a future ingathering of ethnic Jews; yet it also insists that there is only one olive tree and one way of salvation, namely, Christ.

Contemporary debates about christocentric versus christotelic hermeneutics sharpen these issues. Some evangelicals propose that the Old Testament is not Christ‑centered in its own right but only tends toward Christ as a later telos, without Christ being truly revealed in it. This is often presented as a concession to historical criticism. In response, the position defended here, following Augustine, Calvin, Warfield, and Vos, is that Christ is both the telos and the inner center of Old Testament revelation. The telic dimension is real; the prophets themselves sought and inquired into the time and circumstances of what the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating. Yet Peter explicitly says it was the Spirit of Christ in them who testified beforehand to the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. That is more than a generic eschatological orientation; it is the personal presence and testimony of the preincarnate Son. Christotelic language can be accepted if it means that Christ is the consummating goal, but it must not be used to deny his substantive revelation and presence in the Old Testament itself.

Finally, this topic cannot be isolated from adjacent loci. **Christology**, **Trinity**, **Scripture**, and **covenant theology** are tightly interwoven here. If Christ is not the eternal Son, consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, then his presence in the Old Testament can be reduced to mere foreshadowing or retrospective projection. Classical **trinitarian revelation** claims that the Son as Word and Wisdom is always the mediator of revelation, so that every theophany, every prophetic word, is already christologically mediated. If Scripture is not a unified, inspired canon, then Old and New might be detached. If the **covenant of grace** is not one in substance, then Old Testament salvation could be assigned to a different principle than faith in Christ. The doctrinal stakes are therefore high. To confess Christ in both Testaments is to confess the one triune God acting in one economy of redemption, progressively unveiling his Son by the Spirit, until the Word becomes flesh and the apostles bear witness, giving us the New Testament as the Spirit’s own interpretation of all that went before.

Under the pressure of oral examination, the candidate must therefore articulate a clear, non‑Marcionite, non‑dispensational, non‑reductionist thesis: the Old Testament genuinely reveals Christ in promise, type, and prophetic word, by the Spirit of Christ, within the structures of the **covenant of grace**, while the New Testament bears inspired witness to the incarnation and work of that same Christ and authoritatively interprets the Old in his light. This thesis is sustained by Augustine’s rule of faith and canon, Aquinas’ account of divine authorship and multiple senses, Calvin’s covenantal and textual discipline, Warfield’s doctrine of organic and progressive revelation, and Vos’s eschatological biblical theology. Together they show that Christ in Old and New Testaments is not a homiletical trick but the very heartbeat of Christian Scripture.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The one eternal Son is the covenantal and hermeneutical center of both Testaments, truly revealed in the Old through promise, type, and prophecy and fully unveiled in the New, within an **organic unity of special revelation** under the **covenant of grace**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Augustine: formulated the mutual interpenetration of Testaments and insisted on a christological reading of the Old within the rule of faith.
  - Aquinas: grounded **typology** and spiritual senses in **divine authorship**, ensuring Christ‑centered readings while preserving the literal sense.
  - Calvin: anchored Christ in the Old through **covenant theology**, stressing one **covenant of grace** and disciplined, historical exegesis.
  - Warfield: articulated **organic**, progressive revelation, Old as dimly lit room, New as light turned on, against Marcionism and liberalism.
  - Vos: developed Reformed **biblical theology**, showing the eschatological, kingdom‑centered unfolding of Scripture with Christ as both center and telos.
- Debates:
  - Internal: allegory vs controlled typology; degree of continuity in covenants; how Old Testament believers relate to Christ.
  - External: Marcionism and its modern forms; historical‑critical reduction of meaning to human authors; dispensational severing of Israel and church.
  - Contemporary: christocentric vs christotelic hermeneutics; supersessionism; the New Testament’s use of the Old in preaching and theology.
- Defended position: The Old Testament is genuinely, though progressively and typologically, a revelation of Christ by the Spirit of Christ, and the New Testament is the climactic, normative interpretation of that revelation in light of the incarnation, cross, and resurrection, all within one Trinitarian **covenant of grace**.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Are you reading Christ back into the Old Testament?  
    No, I am following the canon’s own pattern, where the same divine author progressively reveals Christ and the New Testament interprets that earlier revelation.
  - How did Old Testament believers relate to Christ?  
    They trusted the promised mediator under types and shadows, so their faith was in Christ according to substance though not yet in New Testament clarity.
  - Does your view entail supersessionism?  
    It entails christological fulfillment, where Israel’s vocation is concentrated in the Messiah and extended to the nations, without discarding God’s purposes for ethnic Israel.
  - How do you justify typology without allegorical excess?  
    By grounding it in God‑ordained historical patterns, constrained by the literal sense and New Testament usage, as Aquinas, Calvin, and Vos model.
  - What happens to your thesis if Christ is not the eternal Son?  
    The unity of revelation collapses, since only the consubstantial Son can be the mediator of all revelation and the substantive center of both Testaments.
