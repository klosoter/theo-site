# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin maintained that **Christ** is the central figure of both the **Old and New Testaments**, with the entire **Scriptural narrative** oriented toward the revelation of the **mediator**. He argued that the **covenant of grace** unites the Testaments, and that the **promises, types, and ceremonies** of the Old Testament find their fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Calvin’s approach to exegesis emphasized the **unity of redemptive history** and the necessity of reading all Scripture through the lens of Christ.

- "For the law was not given to abolish the promise, but rather to lead men by the hand to Christ, the promised seed." (Institutes II.7.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II and III)
- Commentaries on Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, and the Minor Prophets
- Commentary on the Harmony of the Gospels
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin’s Prefaces to his Biblical Commentaries

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - Calvin taught that the **covenant of grace** underlies both Testaments, with Christ as its substance.
    - The promises made to the patriarchs are realized in Christ, binding the Old and New Testaments together.
    - The external administration differs, but the **spiritual reality** remains the same.
    - The Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the coming Christ, just as believers are now.
    - "The Old Testament is a testimony of God’s mercy and fatherly favor toward the ancient Israelites, and is to be considered as a covenant of grace." (Institutes II.10.2)

2. **Typology and Fulfillment in Christ**
    - Calvin identified **types, shadows, and ceremonies** in the Old Testament as prefigurations of Christ.
    - He insisted that these types are not arbitrary, but divinely instituted to point to the coming Redeemer.
    - The fulfillment of these types is found in the historical work of Jesus.
    - This typological reading safeguards the unity and coherence of Scripture.
    - "Whatever is set forth in the Old Testament concerning the Messiah must be referred to Christ alone." (Commentary on Isaiah 7:14)

3. **Christ as the Center of Scripture**
    - Calvin asserted that all Scripture, both Law and Prophets, testifies to Christ.
    - He encouraged a **Christocentric hermeneutic** that seeks Christ in every part of the Bible.
    - The New Testament writers, for Calvin, interpret the Old Testament rightly by showing its fulfillment in Christ.
    - He warned against speculative allegory, advocating for a sober, textually grounded approach.
    - "We ought to read the Scriptures with the express design of finding Christ in them." (Commentary on John 5:39)

4. **Continuity and Discontinuity between Testaments**
    - Calvin recognized both continuity (in substance) and discontinuity (in form) between the Testaments.
    - The **moral law** remains, while ceremonial and civil laws are fulfilled and abrogated in Christ.
    - The clarity of revelation increases in the New Testament, but the substance of salvation is unchanged.
    - The church is one people of God across both Testaments, united in Christ.
    - "The difference between the Old and New Testaments lies more in the manner of dispensation than in the substance." (Institutes II.11.1)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Illumination**
    - Calvin emphasized the necessity of the **Holy Spirit** to understand Christ in both Testaments.
    - The Spirit enables believers to perceive the true meaning and unity of Scripture.
    - Without the Spirit, the veiled references to Christ in the Old Testament remain obscure.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for both the original authors and present-day readers.
    - "It is the office of the Holy Spirit to illumine our minds, that we may discern Christ in the Scriptures." (Institutes I.7.5)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust **Christocentric reading of Scripture** shaped the Reformed tradition’s approach to biblical theology and exegesis. His emphasis on the **unity of the covenant of grace** and the centrality of Christ in both Testaments influenced generations of theologians, pastors, and biblical scholars. Calvin’s exegetical method, combining careful attention to the text with a redemptive-historical perspective, remains foundational for Reformed hermeneutics and continues to inform contemporary discussions on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
