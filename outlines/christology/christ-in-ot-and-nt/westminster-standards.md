# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards present a unified and robust doctrine of **Christ** as the central figure of both the **Old and New Testaments**, asserting the unity of **God’s covenant of grace** throughout redemptive history. They teach that the **person and work of Christ** are progressively revealed in the Old Testament through types, promises, and prophecies, and fully manifested in the New Testament, where Christ is the substance of all previous shadows.

- "Under the gospel, when Christ the substance was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper." (Westminster Confession of Faith 7.6)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 8, 11)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–57, 191)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–28)
- The Directory for Public Worship
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The same **covenant of grace** is administered in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Christ is the mediator and substance of this covenant in every age.
    - The Old Testament contains types and shadows pointing to Christ.
    - The New Testament reveals Christ as the fulfillment of all promises.
    - "There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations." (WCF 7.6)

2. **Progressive Revelation of Christ**
    - Christ is revealed in the Old Testament through promises, prophecies, and sacrifices.
    - The fullness of Christ’s person and work is made manifest in the New Testament.
    - The Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the promised Messiah.
    - The New Testament clarifies and confirms the hope of the Old Testament.
    - "The covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel." (WCF 7.5)

3. **Typology and Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament ceremonies, sacrifices, and offices prefigure Christ.
    - Christ is the true prophet, priest, and king anticipated in the Old Testament.
    - The ceremonial law is abrogated because its reality is found in Christ.
    - The moral law continues, but its fulfillment is in Christ’s obedience.
    - "All those ceremonial laws are now abrogated under the New Testament." (WCF 19.3)

4. **Christ as the Only Mediator**
    - Christ is the only mediator between God and man in both Testaments.
    - His mediatorial work is necessary for the salvation of all the elect.
    - The benefits of redemption are applied to believers before and after His incarnation.
    - No one comes to the Father except through Christ, regardless of era.
    - "The only Redeemer of God’s elect is the Lord Jesus Christ." (WSC 21)

5. **Continuity and Discontinuity in Administration**
    - The substance of salvation is the same, but the outward administration changes.
    - Old Testament sacraments (circumcision, Passover) are replaced by New Testament sacraments (baptism, Lord’s Supper).
    - The means of grace are more clearly and fully revealed in the New Testament.
    - The church is one, though differently administered in each era.
    - "The sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the New." (WCF 27.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** by articulating a Christ-centered reading of both the Old and New Testaments. Their emphasis on the unity of the **covenant of grace** and the centrality of Christ in all of Scripture has influenced generations of confessional churches and theologians. This framework continues to guide biblical interpretation, preaching, and doctrinal formulation within Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions.
