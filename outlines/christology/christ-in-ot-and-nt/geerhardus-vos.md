# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos is renowned for his pioneering work in **biblical theology**, emphasizing the organic unity of **revelation** and the centrality of **Christ** throughout both the **Old and New Testaments**. He argued that the **progressive unfolding of redemptive history** finds its climax in Christ, who is present in promise, type, and fulfillment across the canon.

- "The Old Testament, as well as the New, is a book of Christ." (Biblical Theology)

## Key Works

- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- The Eschatology of the Old Testament
- "The Idea of Biblical Theology as a Science and as a Theological Discipline" (article)
- Reformed Dogmatics (especially volumes on Christology and revelation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of Scripture**
    - Scripture forms a single, unfolding story centered on **Christ**.
    - The Old and New Testaments are not disparate, but integrally related.
    - Typology and promise in the Old Testament anticipate Christ’s person and work.
    - The unity is rooted in the divine authorship and purpose of **revelation**.
    - "The relation between the two Testaments is not accidental, but organic." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Progressive Revelation**
    - God’s self-disclosure unfolds in stages, culminating in Christ.
    - Earlier revelation is preparatory and anticipatory of the New Testament.
    - The meaning of Old Testament passages is fully realized in the light of Christ.
    - Each epoch of revelation builds upon and clarifies previous stages.
    - "Revelation is not an abstract doctrine, but a historical process." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Christ as the Center of Redemptive History**
    - Christ is the focal point of all **redemptive acts** in Scripture.
    - Old Testament types, prophecies, and institutions point to Christ.
    - The New Testament interprets the Old in light of Christ’s person and work.
    - The unity of the Testaments is grounded in their shared orientation to Christ.
    - "The Messianic idea is the center of the Old Testament." (Biblical Theology)

4. **Typology and Promise-Fulfillment**
    - Old Testament types and promises find their fulfillment in Christ.
    - Typology is not mere allegory but rooted in historical-redemptive realities.
    - The New Testament’s use of the Old is governed by the principle of fulfillment.
    - Christ embodies and surpasses all Old Testament anticipations.
    - "The typical is the prophetic in the form of history." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Biblical Theology as a Distinct Discipline**
    - Biblical theology traces the historical development of revelation.
    - It differs from systematic theology by focusing on the unfolding process.
    - The discipline highlights the unity and diversity within Scripture.
    - It provides the framework for understanding Christ’s presence in both Testaments.
    - "Biblical Theology deals with revelation as a divine activity historically unfolded." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s approach to **biblical theology** has profoundly shaped Reformed exegesis and the understanding of **Christ in all of Scripture**. His emphasis on the organic unity and progressive revelation of the Bible has influenced generations of theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. Vos’s work remains foundational for those seeking to interpret the Old and New Testaments as a unified, Christ-centered revelation.
