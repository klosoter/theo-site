# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge provided a classic **Reformed articulation** of the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—emphasizing its biblical foundation and centrality to the work of redemption. He maintained that these offices are inseparable in Christ’s mediatorial work, each contributing essentially to the accomplishment of **salvation** and the establishment of the **covenant of grace**.

- "Christ, as Mediator, discharges the offices of a prophet, priest, and king." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the person and work of Christ)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Biblical Foundation of Munus Triplex**
    - The threefold office is rooted in both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - Hodge traces the typological development of **prophet, priest, and king** through Israel’s history.
    - He insists that the unity of these offices in Christ is essential for a full understanding of His mediatorial work.
    - Scriptural exegesis undergirds his presentation of each office.
    - "The offices of Christ are not arbitrary, but are founded on the necessities of our condition and the requirements of the law of God." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Prophetic Office: Revelation and Teaching**
    - Christ as **Prophet** reveals the will of God for salvation.
    - Hodge emphasizes the necessity of divine revelation for fallen humanity.
    - The prophetic office is exercised through Christ’s teaching, miracles, and the sending of the Spirit.
    - This office continues through the ministry of the Word in the church.
    - "As a prophet, Christ is the teacher sent from God, the light of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Priestly Office: Atonement and Intercession**
    - Christ as **Priest** offers Himself as a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice.
    - Hodge stresses the substitutionary and vicarious nature of Christ’s atonement.
    - The priestly office includes both the once-for-all sacrifice and Christ’s ongoing intercession.
    - This office is central to the application of redemption to believers.
    - "As a priest, He offered Himself as a sacrifice, and ever lives to make intercession for us." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Kingly Office: Rule and Preservation**
    - Christ as **King** exercises sovereign rule over His people and the universe.
    - Hodge highlights Christ’s authority in establishing and defending the church.
    - The kingly office involves both spiritual reign in the hearts of believers and cosmic lordship.
    - This office assures the final victory of Christ and the consummation of His kingdom.
    - "As a king, He rules and defends His people, and restrains and conquers all His and their enemies." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Unity and Distinction of the Offices**
    - The three offices are distinct yet inseparably united in the person of Christ.
    - Hodge warns against separating the offices, which would distort the doctrine of Christ’s work.
    - Each office is necessary for the full accomplishment of redemption.
    - The munus triplex framework safeguards the integrity of Christ’s mediatorial role.
    - "These offices are united in the same person, and are exercised in the work of redemption." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s exposition of the **munus triplex** became a standard reference in Reformed dogmatics, shaping subsequent theological reflection on the person and work of Christ. His careful biblical and systematic treatment reinforced the centrality of Christ’s threefold office in the **Westminster tradition** and broader evangelical theology. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary discussions of Christology, especially regarding the unity and necessity of Christ’s mediatorial roles.
