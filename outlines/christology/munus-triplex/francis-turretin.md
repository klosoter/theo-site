# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated the doctrine of **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—as essential to understanding the person and work of the Mediator. He emphasized that each office is distinct yet inseparable, together constituting the fullness of Christ’s **mediatorial work** for the salvation of the elect. Turretin’s formulation is deeply rooted in **Reformed scholasticism** and serves as a bulwark against both Socinian and Roman Catholic distortions.

- "Christ was anointed by the Holy Spirit to discharge the threefold office of Prophet, Priest, and King, which are necessary for the complete salvation of the church." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 2.15.1)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), especially Volume 2, Topic 15
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on the person and work of Christ
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (for context on Turretin’s method)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity and Distinction of the Three Offices**
    - The **Prophet, Priest, and King** offices are united in the one person of Christ.
    - Each office is distinct in function but inseparable in the work of redemption.
    - The offices correspond to the threefold misery of fallen humanity: ignorance, guilt, and bondage.
    - Christ’s anointing by the Spirit qualifies Him uniquely for all three offices.
    - "Although the offices are distinct, they are never separated in the Mediator, but always concur in the same person and work." (Institutes, 2.15.2)

2. **Prophetic Office: Revelation of Divine Will**
    - Christ as **Prophet** reveals the will of God perfectly and finally.
    - He surpasses all previous prophets, being the very Word incarnate.
    - The prophetic office addresses human ignorance and spiritual blindness.
    - The Spirit’s anointing empowers Christ to teach with authority.
    - "He is called the Prophet not only because he teaches, but because he is the very wisdom and Word of God." (Institutes, 2.15.5)

3. **Priestly Office: Atonement and Intercession**
    - Christ as **Priest** offers Himself as a perfect sacrifice for sin.
    - His priesthood is both expiatory (sacrifice) and intercessory (prayer).
    - The priestly office addresses human guilt and alienation from God.
    - Christ’s priesthood is superior to the Levitical order, being after the order of Melchizedek.
    - "He was made a priest to satisfy for our sins and to intercede for us with the Father." (Institutes, 2.15.7)

4. **Kingly Office: Rule and Protection**
    - Christ as **King** rules over His church and subdues His and our enemies.
    - The kingly office addresses human bondage to sin and Satan.
    - His reign is both spiritual (in the hearts of believers) and eschatological (in final victory).
    - Christ’s kingship ensures the preservation and ultimate triumph of the church.
    - "He is our King to govern, defend, and finally glorify us." (Institutes, 2.15.9)

5. **Necessity and Sufficiency of the Munus Triplex**
    - The threefold office is necessary for the complete salvation of the elect.
    - Each office is sufficient in its own sphere, but all are required for the fullness of redemption.
    - Denial or distortion of any office undermines the work of Christ as Mediator.
    - The munus triplex guards against both legalism and antinomianism.
    - "The threefold office is so necessary that without it Christ could not be a perfect and sufficient Mediator." (Institutes, 2.15.10)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust articulation of the **munus triplex** became a standard formulation in later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional documents and systematic theologies. His careful distinctions and polemical clarity provided a framework for defending the sufficiency and necessity of Christ’s mediatorial work against both Roman Catholic and Socinian critiques. The enduring influence of Turretin’s treatment is evident in the ongoing use of the threefold office in Reformed dogmatics and catechesis.
