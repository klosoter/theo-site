# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust and classically Reformed account of the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—emphasizing their unity in the accomplishment of **redemption**. He stressed that Christ’s mediatorial work cannot be properly understood apart from the integration of these offices, each of which is essential to the fulfillment of the **covenant of grace** and the securing of the believer’s **salvation**.

- "The offices are not to be conceived as existing independently or as exercised separately; they are exercised conjointly and in unity." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "Collected Writings of John Murray," Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (Commentary)
- "The Covenant of Grace" (in Collected Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Three Offices**
    - Christ’s **prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices** are inseparable in his mediatorial work.
    - Each office informs and supports the others in the accomplishment of redemption.
    - The unity reflects the indivisible person and mission of Christ.
    - Denying the unity distorts the biblical presentation of Christ’s work.
    - "The offices are exercised conjointly and in unity." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

2. **Prophetic Office: Revelation and Authority**
    - Christ as Prophet is the supreme revealer of God’s will.
    - His prophetic work is foundational for faith and obedience.
    - The prophetic office is exercised through both word and deed.
    - This office is essential for the knowledge of salvation.
    - "He is the Prophet who is the finality of revelation." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

3. **Priestly Office: Atonement and Intercession**
    - Christ’s priestly work centers on **sacrifice, expiation, and intercession**.
    - The priestly office is indispensable for reconciliation with God.
    - His once-for-all sacrifice is the ground of justification.
    - Ongoing intercession secures the application of redemption.
    - "He is the Priest who offered Himself once for all and ever lives to make intercession." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Kingly Office: Rule and Subjection of Enemies**
    - Christ as King exercises sovereign rule over all creation and the church.
    - His kingship ensures the subjection of all enemies and the establishment of his kingdom.
    - The kingly office is expressed in both present reign and future consummation.
    - Believers participate in his reign through union with him.
    - "He is the King who subdues us to himself, rules and defends us, and restrains and conquers all his and our enemies." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

5. **Redemptive-Historical Integration**
    - The **munus triplex** is rooted in the unfolding of redemptive history.
    - Each office is anticipated in the Old Testament and fulfilled in Christ.
    - The threefold office shapes the structure of biblical revelation.
    - The application of redemption is inseparable from Christ’s threefold work.
    - "The offices of Christ are grounded in the exigencies of our redemption as it is unfolded in the history of revelation." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of the **munus triplex** has shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of Christ’s mediatorial work, emphasizing the necessity of holding the three offices together for a coherent doctrine of redemption. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity have influenced generations of pastors and theologians, especially within the Westminster tradition. The enduring value of his work lies in its insistence on the unity and fullness of Christ’s saving offices.
