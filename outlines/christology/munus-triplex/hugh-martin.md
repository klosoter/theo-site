# Hugh Martin (1822–1885)

Hugh Martin, a Scottish Presbyterian theologian, offered a distinctive and robust account of the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**. Martin emphasized the organic unity of these offices, arguing that Christ’s mediatorial work is indivisible and that each office is exercised in harmony with the others, particularly highlighting the centrality of the **priestly office** in the atonement and intercession.

- "The three offices are not so many departments of Christ’s work, but so many aspects of His one indivisible mediatorial function." (The Threefold Office of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Threefold Office of Christ (sermons and essays)
- The Atonement: In Its Relations to the Covenant, the Priesthood, the Intercession of Our Lord
- Christ’s Presence in the Gospel History
- The Shadow of Calvary: Gethsemane and the Cross

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Organic Unity of the Three Offices**
   - Christ’s **Prophet, Priest, and King** offices are inseparable in His mediatorial work.
   - Each office informs and supports the others, forming a unified whole.
   - The unity reflects the singularity of Christ’s person and mission.
   - Division of the offices is only for theological clarity, not actual separation in Christ’s work.
   - "The three offices are not so many departments of Christ’s work, but so many aspects of His one indivisible mediatorial function." (The Threefold Office of Christ)

2. **Primacy of the Priestly Office**
   - The **priestly office** is central, especially in Christ’s atonement and intercession.
   - Christ’s sacrifice is the foundation for His prophetic teaching and kingly rule.
   - The priestly work secures the benefits dispensed through the other offices.
   - Intercession is a continual exercise of Christ’s priesthood in heaven.
   - "The priesthood of Christ is the axis on which the whole mediatorial economy revolves." (The Atonement)

3. **Prophetic Office as Divine Revelation**
   - Christ as **Prophet** reveals God’s will perfectly and authoritatively.
   - His prophetic work is inseparable from His person and redemptive mission.
   - The prophetic office is exercised in both word and deed, culminating in the cross.
   - Christ’s teaching is effectual because it is grounded in His priestly sacrifice.
   - "He teaches as one having authority, because He teaches as the Redeemer." (The Threefold Office of Christ)

4. **Kingly Office as Redemptive Rule**
   - Christ’s **kingly office** is exercised in subduing His people to Himself.
   - His rule is redemptive, not merely judicial or political.
   - The kingly office is grounded in His priestly work and resurrection.
   - Christ’s reign is both present (spiritual) and future (consummated).
   - "He reigns because He has redeemed; His throne is established in righteousness by His sacrifice." (The Atonement)

5. **Indivisibility of Christ’s Person and Work**
   - The **munus triplex** reflects the unity of Christ’s person and mission.
   - Christ’s offices are not abstract roles but expressions of His singular mediatorial identity.
   - The work of redemption is accomplished through the harmonious exercise of all three offices.
   - Any attempt to isolate one office distorts the biblical portrait of Christ.
   - "It is the one Christ who is Prophet, Priest, and King, and in all He is Mediator." (The Threefold Office of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Hugh Martin’s treatment of the **munus triplex** reinforced the classic Reformed understanding while offering a distinctive emphasis on the organic unity and the centrality of the priestly office. His work influenced later Presbyterian theology, especially in discussions of the atonement and Christ’s ongoing intercession. Martin’s careful integration of the three offices continues to inform contemporary Christological reflection within the Reformed tradition.
