# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—as central to understanding the person and work of Jesus within the **Reformed tradition**. He emphasized that these offices are inseparable and collectively reveal the fullness of Christ’s mediatorial role, grounding them in both **biblical exegesis** and **systematic theology**. Warfield’s treatment underscores the unity of Christ’s saving work and its application to the believer.

- "Christ is our Prophet, Priest, and King, and in these three offices is summed up all that He does for His people." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "Biblical and Theological Studies" (esp. essays on Christology)
- "The Redeemer and His Work"
- "The Plan of Salvation"
- "The Westminster Confession of Faith" (lectures and commentaries)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Three Offices**
    - The **Prophet, Priest, and King** offices are distinct yet inseparable in Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Each office complements and presupposes the others for a complete understanding of redemption.
    - Warfield insists that dividing the offices distorts the biblical portrait of Christ.
    - The unity reflects the comprehensive nature of Christ’s mission.
    - "The three offices are not to be separated, but are the several aspects of the one work of the Redeemer." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

2. **Biblical Foundation of Munus Triplex**
    - Warfield grounds the threefold office in both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - He traces typological patterns from Israel’s prophets, priests, and kings to their fulfillment in Christ.
    - The munus triplex is not a later theological invention but rooted in scriptural testimony.
    - Warfield employs rigorous exegesis to defend the biblical legitimacy of the doctrine.
    - "The conception of the threefold office is not an artificial construction, but the product of the biblical data." ("Biblical and Theological Studies")

3. **Christ’s Prophetic Office**
    - Christ as **Prophet** reveals God’s will and embodies divine truth.
    - Warfield highlights Jesus’ teaching ministry and the finality of His revelation.
    - The prophetic office is essential for the believer’s knowledge of salvation.
    - Warfield connects the prophetic role to the inspiration and authority of Scripture.
    - "As Prophet, He is the very Word of God, the Revealer of the Father." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

4. **Christ’s Priestly Office**
    - Warfield emphasizes Christ’s role as **Priest** in atonement and intercession.
    - The priestly office centers on Christ’s self-sacrifice and mediation for sinners.
    - Warfield upholds the substitutionary nature of Christ’s priestly work.
    - The ongoing intercession of Christ is vital for the believer’s assurance.
    - "He is Priest, offering Himself as the sacrifice, and ever living to make intercession." ("The Redeemer and His Work")

5. **Christ’s Kingly Office**
    - Warfield asserts Christ’s **Kingship** over the church and the cosmos.
    - The kingly office involves both the present reign of Christ and His eschatological victory.
    - Warfield links Christ’s rule to the application of redemption and the sanctification of believers.
    - The kingly office guarantees the ultimate triumph of God’s kingdom.
    - "As King, He rules and defends His people, and subdues all His and their enemies." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s exposition of the **munus triplex** has shaped Reformed Christology and remains a standard reference for understanding the offices of Christ. His integration of biblical exegesis with systematic theology provided a robust framework for later theologians. Warfield’s influence endures in confessional documents and contemporary discussions of Christ’s mediatorial work, reinforcing the centrality of the threefold office in evangelical and Reformed thought.
