# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate the doctrine of **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—as central to his mediatorial work. This framework structures the Standards’ understanding of **Christology**, **redemption**, and the application of salvation, emphasizing Christ’s unique sufficiency and authority in each office.

- "Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature." (Westminster Confession of Faith 8.7)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 8 (“Of Christ the Mediator”)
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 36–45
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 23–26
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on Christ’s offices)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith (commentary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Threefold Office is Essential to His Mediatorship**
    - Christ fulfills the roles of **Prophet, Priest, and King** as the only Mediator between God and man.
    - Each office is necessary for the full accomplishment of redemption.
    - The munus triplex guards against reductionistic views of Christ’s work.
    - The unity of the offices is grounded in the unity of Christ’s person.
    - "It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus... to be the Mediator between God and man, the Prophet, Priest, and King." (WCF 8.1)

2. **Prophetic Office: Christ as the Final Revealer**
    - Christ reveals the will of God for salvation through his Word and Spirit.
    - He is the supreme and final Prophet, surpassing all previous revelation.
    - The prophetic office ensures the sufficiency and clarity of divine revelation.
    - This office is exercised both in his earthly ministry and through the ongoing ministry of the Word.
    - "Our Redeemer... executes the office of a prophet, in revealing to us, by his Word and Spirit, the will of God for our salvation." (WSC 24)

3. **Priestly Office: Christ’s Atonement and Intercession**
    - Christ offers himself as a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice and reconcile sinners.
    - His priesthood is unique, perpetual, and unrepeatable.
    - He continually intercedes for his people before the Father.
    - The priestly office grounds assurance of forgiveness and access to God.
    - "Christ executeth the office of a priest, in his once offering up of himself a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, and reconcile us to God; and in making continual intercession for us." (WSC 25)

4. **Kingly Office: Christ’s Rule and Protection**
    - Christ subdues, rules, and defends his people as King.
    - He governs the church and restrains and conquers all his and our enemies.
    - The kingly office includes both spiritual reign and eschatological fulfillment.
    - This office assures believers of Christ’s sovereign care and victory.
    - "Christ executeth the office of a king, in subduing us to himself, in ruling and defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies." (WSC 26)

5. **Munus Triplex as the Pattern for Christian Life and Ministry**
    - Believers are united to Christ and share in his offices in a derivative sense.
    - The church’s ministry reflects Christ’s prophetic, priestly, and kingly functions.
    - This pattern shapes the church’s teaching, worship, and governance.
    - The munus triplex provides a comprehensive vision for discipleship and mission.
    - "They that are effectually called... are by his Spirit united to him... and made partakers of his offices." (WLC 69)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** established the munus triplex as a foundational category in **Reformed Christology** and catechesis, shaping subsequent confessional and theological traditions. Their articulation of Christ’s threefold office has influenced Protestant preaching, worship, and ecclesiology, providing a robust framework for understanding the person and work of Christ. The enduring significance of the munus triplex in Reformed theology underscores the comprehensive sufficiency of Christ as **Mediator**.
