# Donald Macleod (1940–2023)

Donald Macleod provided a robust and classically Reformed account of the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**. He emphasized the unity and distinctiveness of each office in the person and work of Christ, arguing that this framework is essential for understanding the fullness of **mediatorial work** and the application of **redemption**.

- "Christ’s threefold office is not an artificial construct, but the very essence of his mediatorial work." (The Person of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (1998)
- Christ Crucified: Understanding the Atonement (2014)
- A Faith to Live By (1998)
- Jesus Is Lord: Christology Yesterday and Today (1982)
- "The Threefold Office of Christ" (chapter in various theological collections)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Munus Triplex**
    - The three offices are inseparable in the person of Christ.
    - Each office is exercised simultaneously throughout Christ’s earthly ministry.
    - The unity reflects the singular purpose of **redemption**.
    - Rejects any reduction of Christ’s work to a single office.
    "The offices are not watertight compartments but aspects of a single mediatorial role." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Prophetic Office: Revelation and Word**
    - Christ is the ultimate **Revelator** of God’s will.
    - His prophetic role is foundational for faith and knowledge of God.
    - The office continues through the ministry of the **Word** and **Spirit**.
    - Emphasizes the necessity of divine revelation for salvation.
    "As Prophet, Christ is the voice of God to man, the final and definitive Word." (A Faith to Live By)

3. **Priestly Office: Atonement and Intercession**
    - Central to Christ’s work is his role as **Priest**, offering himself as a sacrifice.
    - Stresses the substitutionary nature of the **atonement**.
    - Christ’s priesthood is both sacrificial and intercessory.
    - The priestly office assures believers of ongoing access to God.
    "He is both the priest and the sacrifice, the offerer and the offering." (Christ Crucified)

4. **Kingly Office: Rule and Renewal**
    - Christ exercises sovereign rule over the church and cosmos.
    - His kingship is both present (spiritual reign) and future (consummation).
    - The kingly office involves the subduing of enemies and the renewal of creation.
    - Believers share in Christ’s victory and authority.
    "The kingdom of Christ is a present reality and a future hope." (The Person of Christ)

5. **Necessity for a Comprehensive Soteriology**
    - The **munus triplex** is essential for a full understanding of **salvation**.
    - Each office addresses a distinct aspect of human need: ignorance, guilt, and bondage.
    - The framework guards against reductionism in **Christology** and **soteriology**.
    - It provides a holistic vision of Christ’s ongoing ministry.
    "Only as Prophet, Priest, and King does Christ fully meet the needs of fallen humanity." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Macleod’s articulation of the **munus triplex** has reinforced its centrality in contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of **Christ’s mediatorial work**. His clear, accessible writing has made the doctrine more widely appreciated among pastors and laypeople. Macleod’s influence persists in both academic and ecclesiastical contexts, shaping how the church understands and proclaims the person and work of Christ.
