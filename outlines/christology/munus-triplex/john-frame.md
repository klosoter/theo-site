# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame approaches the **munus triplex**—Christ’s threefold office as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—with an emphasis on the unity and interdependence of these roles within the broader framework of **Lordship**. He integrates the offices into his **tri-perspectival** method, arguing that each office reveals a distinct perspective on Christ’s comprehensive mediatorial work. Frame’s treatment highlights the practical and doctrinal significance of the munus triplex for understanding **redemption**, **revelation**, and **Christian ethics**.

- "Jesus is the supreme prophet, priest, and king, and these offices are perspectives on his lordship." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Munus Triplex as Perspectives on Lordship**
    - Christ’s offices are not isolated functions but perspectives on his unified lordship.
    - Each office expresses a different aspect of Christ’s authority over his people.
    - The offices are mutually interpretive and inseparable in Christ’s ministry.
    - This perspective shapes how believers relate to Christ in faith and obedience.
    - "The three offices are perspectives on the one Lordship of Christ." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Prophet: Christ as the Ultimate Revealer**
    - Christ fulfills the prophetic office by perfectly revealing God’s will.
    - His prophetic work grounds the authority of **Scripture** and the church’s teaching.
    - The prophetic office is essential for understanding **revelation** and **knowledge of God**.
    - Frame connects the prophetic role to the **normative perspective** in his tri-perspectivalism.
    - "As prophet, Jesus is the Word of God, the ultimate revelation." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Priest: Christ as the Perfect Mediator**
    - Christ’s priestly office centers on his atoning sacrifice and ongoing intercession.
    - The priestly work is foundational for **redemption** and **reconciliation**.
    - Frame links the priestly office to the **existential perspective**, focusing on personal transformation.
    - The priesthood of Christ ensures believers’ access to God and spiritual renewal.
    - "As priest, Jesus offers himself as the perfect sacrifice and intercedes for us." (Systematic Theology)

4. **King: Christ’s Sovereign Rule**
    - The kingly office emphasizes Christ’s authority over all creation and the church.
    - Christ’s kingship is the basis for **ethics**, **obedience**, and the advance of God’s kingdom.
    - Frame relates the kingly office to the **situational perspective**, highlighting application in life.
    - The kingly role integrates the other offices into a comprehensive vision of Christ’s reign.
    - "As king, Jesus rules over all things for the sake of his people." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Integration of Munus Triplex in Christian Life**
    - The three offices shape Christian worship, discipleship, and mission.
    - Frame urges believers to embrace Christ in all three roles for holistic growth.
    - The munus triplex provides a framework for understanding **sanctification** and **service**.
    - This integration guards against reductionism in Christology and practical theology.
    - "We must receive Christ as prophet, priest, and king, for he is all three for us." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s treatment of the **munus triplex** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by emphasizing the unity and practical relevance of Christ’s offices. His **tri-perspectival** approach has provided a fresh lens for systematic theology, integrating doctrine with Christian living. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on the nature of **Christ’s mediatorial work** and its implications for the church’s faith and practice.
