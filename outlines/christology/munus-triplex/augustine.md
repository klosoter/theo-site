# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly formulate the doctrine of **munus triplex** (threefold office of Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King), but his writings laid crucial groundwork for later development of this concept. He explored Christ’s roles in relation to **revelation**, **atonement**, and **sovereignty**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s work in the **economy of salvation** and the transformation of believers into His image.

- "Christus ergo et Deus est et homo: Deus, quia Verbum Dei; homo, quia in unitatem personae accessit anima rationalis et caro." (De Trinitate, I.13)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate
- Enarrationes in Psalmos
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Sermones (Selected Sermons)
- Contra Faustum

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Revealer of Divine Truth**
   - Christ is the eternal **Word** who reveals the Father.
   - The Incarnation brings the fullness of **revelation** to humanity.
   - Christ’s teaching fulfills and surpasses the prophets.
   - The Spirit continues Christ’s prophetic work in the Church.
   - "Ipse est enim verus illuminator, qui illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum." (Enarrationes in Psalmos, 36)

2. **Christ as Mediator and Priest**
   - Christ mediates between God and humanity through His unique person.
   - His sacrifice is the fulfillment of all Old Testament sacrifices.
   - Christ intercedes for believers as the true **High Priest**.
   - The Eucharist is a participation in Christ’s priestly offering.
   - "Unus enim mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus Iesus." (De Civitate Dei, X.20)

3. **Christ as King and Lord**
   - Christ reigns over the **City of God** and the hearts of believers.
   - His kingship is both present (spiritual) and future (eschatological).
   - The Church is the visible manifestation of Christ’s reign.
   - Christ subdues His enemies and brings peace through His rule.
   - "Regnavit a ligno Deus." (Enarrationes in Psalmos, 96)

4. **Unity of Christ’s Offices**
   - Augustine sees no strict separation between Christ’s roles.
   - The offices are united in the one person and work of Christ.
   - Each office serves the purpose of **redemption** and restoration.
   - Believers are conformed to Christ’s image in all three aspects.
   - "Ipse enim et sacerdos est offerens, et oblatio quae offertur, et rex qui regnat." (Sermo 85)

5. **Participation of the Church in Christ’s Offices**
   - The Church shares in Christ’s prophetic, priestly, and kingly functions.
   - Believers proclaim the Word, offer spiritual sacrifices, and serve in Christ’s kingdom.
   - The Church’s ministry is grounded in union with Christ.
   - Augustine’s ecclesiology anticipates later Reformed emphases on the **priesthood of all believers**.
   - "Totus Christus, caput et corpus, unus est Christus." (Enarrationes in Psalmos, 30)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s integration of Christ’s roles as **Prophet**, **Priest**, and **King** provided a foundational framework for later systematic theology, especially in the Western tradition. His emphasis on the unity of Christ’s person and work influenced medieval and Reformation theologians in their articulation of the **munus triplex**. Augustine’s vision of the Church as participating in Christ’s offices shaped ecclesiology and the understanding of Christian vocation for centuries.
