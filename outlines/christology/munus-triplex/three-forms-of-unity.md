# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate the **munus triplex** (threefold office) of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**. These confessions emphasize Christ’s unique mediatorial work, grounding the believer’s salvation in His fulfillment of these offices and connecting them to the broader structure of **covenant theology** and **Reformed soteriology**.

- "Why is he called Christ, that is, Anointed? Because he is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Ghost, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher... our only High Priest... and our eternal King." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 31–32
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 20–23
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially on Christ’s mediatorial work
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Ecumenical and Reformed Creeds and Confessions)
- The Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (James T. Dennison, Jr., ed.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Prophet**
    - Christ reveals the **will of God** for our redemption.
    - He is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the ultimate **Teacher**.
    - The confessions stress His ongoing work through the **Word and Spirit**.
    - Believers are called to confess Him and witness to His truth.
    - "Our chief Prophet and Teacher, who has fully revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our redemption." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

2. **Christ as Priest**
    - Christ is the only **High Priest**, offering Himself as a perfect sacrifice.
    - His priestly work includes both **atonement** and **intercession**.
    - The confessions reject any ongoing priesthood apart from Christ.
    - Assurance of salvation is grounded in His finished work.
    - "Our only High Priest, who by the one sacrifice of His body has redeemed us, and makes continual intercession with the Father for us." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

3. **Christ as King**
    - Christ rules over His people and **defends** them by His power.
    - His kingship is both spiritual (over the church) and cosmic (over all creation).
    - The confessions highlight His subduing of enemies and governance by His Word.
    - Believers share in His anointing and are called to live under His lordship.
    - "Our eternal King, who governs us by His Word and Spirit, and who defends and preserves us in the enjoyment of that salvation He has purchased for us." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

4. **Unity of the Offices in Christ’s Person**
    - The three offices are inseparable in Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Each office is necessary for the full accomplishment of redemption.
    - The confessions stress the **personal union** of Christ’s natures in His offices.
    - This unity safeguards against reducing Christ’s work to a single function.
    - "He is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy Ghost, to be our chief Prophet and Teacher... our only High Priest... and our eternal King." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

5. **Participation of Believers in Christ’s Offices**
    - Believers are united to Christ and share in His anointing.
    - The confessions teach the **priesthood of all believers** and their prophetic and kingly callings.
    - Christians are called to confess Christ, offer spiritual sacrifices, and fight against sin.
    - This participation is rooted in union with Christ and empowered by the Spirit.
    - "But why are you called a Christian? Because by faith I am a member of Christ, and thus a partaker of His anointing..." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 32)

## Legacy and Impact

The **munus triplex** as articulated in the Three Forms of Unity has profoundly shaped **Reformed Christology** and the understanding of Christ’s mediatorial work. These confessions provided a robust framework for later Reformed theology, influencing catechesis, preaching, and ecclesiology. Their emphasis on the unity and distinctiveness of Christ’s offices continues to inform contemporary discussions of **covenant theology** and the believer’s identity in Christ. The Three Forms remain foundational for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring the enduring relevance of the threefold office in doctrine and practice.
