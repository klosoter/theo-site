# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the **munus triplex**—Christ’s threefold office of **Prophet, Priest, and King**—through the lens of **biblical theology** and **covenant structure**. He emphasized how the offices are organically integrated within the unfolding of **redemptive history**, particularly as they relate to the **covenant mediator** role of Christ and the typological patterns established in the Old Testament.

- "The offices of prophet, priest, and king are united in the person and work of the covenant mediator." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- Images of the Spirit
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- The Structure of Biblical Authority
- Treaty of the Great King

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Munus Triplex as Covenant Mediation**
    - Christ’s threefold office is rooted in his role as the ultimate **covenant mediator**.
    - Each office fulfills and transforms Old Testament typology within the new covenant.
    - The unity of the offices is essential for understanding Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The munus triplex is inseparable from the structure of **divine covenants**.
    - "The covenantal structure of redemptive history finds its fulfillment in the one who is simultaneously prophet, priest, and king." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Prophetic Office and Revelation**
    - Christ as Prophet is the supreme revealer of God’s will and the archetype of all prophetic ministry.
    - The prophetic office is closely tied to the administration of the covenant word.
    - Old Testament prophets prefigure Christ’s ultimate prophetic role.
    - The prophetic function is foundational for the church’s identity as a covenant community.
    - "The prophetic office is the vehicle of covenant revelation and administration." (Images of the Spirit)

3. **Priestly Office and Sacrifice**
    - Christ’s priesthood fulfills and transcends the Levitical priesthood.
    - The priestly office centers on **atonement**, intercession, and access to God.
    - Sacrificial typology in the Old Testament points to Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice.
    - The priestly role is essential for the maintenance and renewal of the covenant relationship.
    - "The priestly office is the heart of the covenant’s provision for reconciliation." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Kingly Office and Dominion**
    - Christ’s kingship is the restoration and consummation of Adamic dominion.
    - The kingly office involves both judgment and blessing within the covenant community.
    - Old Testament kingship is a type fulfilled in Christ’s universal reign.
    - The kingdom of God is realized through the kingly office of the mediator.
    - "The kingly office is the exercise of covenant lordship over creation and the people of God." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The munus triplex is revealed progressively through typological structures in Scripture.
    - Christ’s offices are the eschatological fulfillment of Old Testament patterns.
    - Typology demonstrates the organic unity of redemptive history.
    - The church participates in Christ’s offices through union with him.
    - "Typology is the divinely intended correspondence between the Old Testament offices and their eschatological fulfillment in Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal and typological approach to the **munus triplex** has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in understanding the unity of Christ’s work across redemptive history. His insights have influenced generations of scholars in the fields of **covenant theology** and the interpretation of Old Testament typology. Kline’s integration of the threefold office with the structure of divine covenants remains a hallmark of his theological legacy, providing a robust framework for understanding Christ’s mediatorial work.
