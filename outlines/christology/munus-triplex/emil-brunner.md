# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of Christ as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—as a dynamic expression of Christ’s mediatorial work, emphasizing its existential and relational significance. He saw these offices as essential to understanding the person and work of Christ, particularly in the context of **revelation**, **atonement**, and the **kingdom of God**. Brunner’s interpretation is marked by a strong focus on the encounter between God and humanity in Christ, rather than on abstract doctrinal formulations.

- "The threefold office of Christ is not a mere dogmatic scheme, but the living reality of His work for us and in us." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Christian Doctrine of God
- Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Prophet: Revelation and Encounter**
    - Christ’s prophetic office centers on the personal revelation of God to humanity.
    - The Word is not merely information but a transformative encounter.
    - Brunner rejects abstract propositionalism in favor of relational revelation.
    - The prophetic office is inseparable from Christ’s person as the Revealer.
    - "Christ is the living Word, not merely the bearer of a message." (The Mediator)

2. **Christ as Priest: Mediation and Reconciliation**
    - The priestly office is foundational for understanding atonement.
    - Christ mediates between God and humanity, effecting reconciliation.
    - Brunner emphasizes the existential reality of forgiveness in Christ.
    - The cross is the decisive act of God’s self-giving love.
    - "In the Cross, the Priest offers Himself and thus reconciles God and man." (The Mediator)

3. **Christ as King: Lordship and the Kingdom of God**
    - The kingly office expresses Christ’s authority over creation and the church.
    - Brunner links the kingdom of God to the present reality of Christ’s reign.
    - The kingship of Christ is not political but spiritual and eschatological.
    - Christ’s rule is realized in the transformation of human existence.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the reign of Christ in the hearts and lives of men." (Dogmatics II)

4. **Unity of the Offices: One Mediator, Threefold Work**
    - Brunner insists the three offices are inseparable aspects of Christ’s mediation.
    - Each office interprets and completes the others in the work of salvation.
    - The unity of the offices reflects the unity of Christ’s person and mission.
    - Fragmenting the offices distorts the fullness of Christ’s saving work.
    - "The threefold office is the unity of Christ’s saving action for us." (The Mediator)

5. **Existential and Relational Emphasis**
    - Brunner prioritizes the existential encounter with Christ over doctrinal abstraction.
    - The munus triplex is meaningful only as it is experienced in faith.
    - The offices are not static roles but dynamic realities in the believer’s life.
    - Christ’s work is always directed toward personal relationship and transformation.
    - "Doctrine must serve the living encounter with Christ, not replace it." (Revelation and Reason)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of the **munus triplex** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology by re-centering the doctrine on the existential encounter with Christ rather than on scholastic categories. His relational and dynamic approach challenged both liberal reductionism and rigid orthodoxy, contributing to ongoing discussions about **revelation** and the nature of Christ’s work. Brunner’s thought remains significant for those seeking to integrate classical doctrine with contemporary existential concerns.
