# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust understanding of **Christ’s offices**—**Prophet**, **Priest**, and **King**—though he did not use the term *munus triplex* explicitly. He integrated these roles within his broader **Christology**, emphasizing Christ’s unique mediation, teaching authority, and sovereign rule as essential to the work of redemption. Aquinas’s synthesis of **Scripture**, **patristic tradition**, and **scholastic reasoning** provided a foundational framework for later developments of the threefold office.

- "Christ is called a King in respect of His dominion, a Priest in respect of His reconciliation, and a Prophet in respect of His teaching." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 22, a. 1, ad 3)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially IIIa, qq. 22–26
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- Catena Aurea (commentary on the Gospels)
- Thomas Weinandy, "Does God Suffer?" (secondary, for Christological context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Prophet: Divine Teacher**
    - Christ possesses the fullness of **divine knowledge** and reveals the truth of God to humanity.
    - His prophetic office is exercised through both His earthly ministry and the ongoing teaching of the Church.
    - The **Incarnation** enables Christ to communicate divine mysteries in a human mode.
    - Christ’s prophetic role fulfills and surpasses all Old Testament prophets.
    - "Christ is called a Prophet, as making known hidden things, and as teaching the truth." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 27, a. 1, ad 2)

2. **Christ as Priest: Perfect Mediator**
    - Christ is the unique **Mediator** who offers Himself as a true and sufficient sacrifice for sin.
    - His priesthood is both sacrificial (on the cross) and intercessory (before the Father).
    - The **Eucharist** is the sacramental continuation of Christ’s priestly work.
    - Christ’s priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood, being after the order of **Melchizedek**.
    - "Christ is a Priest as offering Himself for us, and as interceding for us." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 22, a. 1)

3. **Christ as King: Sovereign Lord**
    - Christ’s kingship is rooted in His divine and human natures, granting Him authority over all creation.
    - His reign is both spiritual (over the hearts of believers) and eschatological (in final judgment).
    - The **Kingdom of God** is inaugurated through Christ’s ministry and will be consummated at His return.
    - Christ’s kingship entails the governance, protection, and sanctification of His people.
    - "Christ is King, as having dominion over all things, and as leading His people to the kingdom of heaven." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 22, a. 1, ad 3)

4. **Unity of the Offices in the Person of Christ**
    - The three offices are inseparable and mutually informing within the **hypostatic union**.
    - Each office is exercised according to both Christ’s divine and human natures.
    - The unity of the offices ensures the completeness of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - Aquinas grounds the offices in the singular mission of the **Incarnate Word**.
    - "All these offices belong to Christ inasmuch as He is the God-man." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 22, a. 1, ad 3)

5. **Scriptural and Patristic Foundations**
    - Aquinas draws extensively on **Scripture** (especially Hebrews, Psalms, and the Gospels) to articulate the threefold office.
    - He synthesizes insights from **Augustine**, **Gregory the Great**, and other Church Fathers.
    - The munus triplex is seen as the fulfillment of Old Testament types and promises.
    - Aquinas’s method is to harmonize biblical exegesis with systematic theology.
    - "The offices of Christ are prefigured in the Old Law and fulfilled in the New." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 22, a. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s exposition of Christ’s **prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices** laid a crucial foundation for later systematic theology, especially in the Western tradition. Though the explicit terminology of *munus triplex* was more fully developed by Reformed theologians, Aquinas’s integration of these roles influenced both Catholic and Protestant Christology. His approach continues to shape discussions on the unity and distinctiveness of Christ’s mediatorial work, providing a bridge between patristic sources and scholastic synthesis.
