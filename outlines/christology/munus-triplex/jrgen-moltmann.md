# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann reinterprets the **munus triplex**—the threefold office of **prophet, priest, and king**—within his theology of **eschatological hope** and the **Kingdom of God**. He emphasizes the communal and future-oriented dimensions of these offices, seeing Christ’s work as inaugurating a new creation and empowering the church to participate in God’s redemptive mission.

- "The threefold office of Christ is not only a doctrine about Christ, but also a doctrine about the church’s participation in his mission." (The Church in the Power of the Spirit)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- The Church in the Power of the Spirit (1975)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s reworking of the **munus triplex** has significantly influenced contemporary theology by integrating the threefold office with themes of **eschatology**, liberation, and communal participation. His approach encourages churches to see themselves as active agents in God’s mission, embodying prophetic, priestly, and kingly roles in society. Moltmann’s vision continues to shape ecumenical discussions and practical theology, especially in contexts concerned with justice, hope, and the renewal of creation.
