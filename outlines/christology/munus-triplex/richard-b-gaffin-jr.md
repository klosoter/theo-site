# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has emphasized the centrality of the **munus triplex**—Christ’s threefold office as **Prophet, Priest, and King**—for understanding the person and work of Christ. Gaffin’s approach integrates the **redemptive-historical** framework, highlighting how Christ’s offices are inseparable from his **resurrection** and the application of **salvation** to the church. He insists that the **munus triplex** is not merely a doctrinal construct but foundational for grasping the unity of Christ’s mediatorial work.

- "The threefold office is not an artificial or arbitrary construct but is rooted in the structure of Christ’s redemptive accomplishment and its application." ("The Centrality of the Resurrection," in Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Priesthood of Christ: Reformed Developments and Debates" (WTJ article)
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Third Commandment

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Munus triplex as Redemptive-Historical Framework**
    - Christ’s threefold office is organically tied to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The offices are not isolated roles but unified in the person and work of Christ.
    - Each office is fulfilled climactically in Christ’s **resurrection** and exaltation.
    - The munus triplex shapes the structure of both **accomplished** and **applied** redemption.
    - "The threefold office provides a redemptive-historical matrix for understanding Christ’s work." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Prophetic Office: Revelation and Eschatology**
    - Christ as Prophet is the definitive **revelation** of God, especially in his resurrection.
    - The prophetic office is inseparable from the giving of the **Spirit**.
    - The church’s prophetic witness is grounded in union with the risen Christ.
    - Eschatological fulfillment is central to Christ’s prophetic ministry.
    - "The resurrection marks the decisive prophetic act of the last days." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Priestly Office: Sacrifice and Intercession**
    - Christ’s priesthood centers on his once-for-all **sacrifice** and ongoing **intercession**.
    - The priestly office is realized in Christ’s resurrection and ascension.
    - Believers participate in Christ’s priesthood through union with him.
    - The priestly work ensures the efficacy and application of redemption.
    - "His priestly work is not exhausted at the cross but continues in his resurrection life." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Kingly Office: Reign and Eschatological Victory**
    - Christ’s kingship is inaugurated in his resurrection and session at God’s right hand.
    - The kingly office involves both present reign and future consummation.
    - The church shares in Christ’s kingly authority through the Spirit.
    - The kingdom is both already inaugurated and not yet consummated.
    - "The resurrection is the turning point in the exercise of Christ’s kingly rule." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Union with Christ and the Application of the Munus Triplex**
    - All benefits of Christ’s offices are applied to believers through **union with Christ**.
    - The Spirit mediates the ongoing reality of Christ’s threefold office in the church.
    - The munus triplex structures the believer’s identity and vocation.
    - The church’s ministry reflects Christ’s prophetic, priestly, and kingly roles.
    - "Union with the exalted Christ is the means by which his threefold office is realized in the church." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **munus triplex** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its redemptive-historical and eschatological dimensions. His work has influenced how theologians and pastors understand the unity of Christ’s person and work, and the ongoing significance of Christ’s offices for the life of the church. By rooting the threefold office in the resurrection and union with Christ, Gaffin has provided a robust framework for both academic theology and pastoral ministry.
