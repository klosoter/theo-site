# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich rejected the traditional **pactum salutis** and the Reformed understanding of **Christ as covenant head**, instead interpreting **covenant** through his existential and ontological framework. For Tillich, Christ is the bearer of the **New Being**, overcoming estrangement between God and humanity, but not as a federal head in a pre-temporal covenant. His approach emphasizes the **symbolic** nature of theological language and the existential realization of salvation.

- "The Christ is the New Being in whom the separation between God and man is overcome." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Volumes 1–3
- The Shaking of the Foundations
- The Dynamics of Faith
- A History of Christian Thought

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of Classical Covenant Theology**
    - Tillich does not affirm a historical or ontological **pactum salutis** between the Father and the Son.
    - He views **covenant** as a symbol for the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - The idea of a pre-temporal covenant is seen as mythological rather than ontological.
    - He critiques the objectification of theological concepts, preferring existential interpretation.
    "Theological symbols have meaning only as they express the ultimate concern of man." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

2. **Christ as the "New Being"**
    - Christ is not a federal head in a legal or covenantal sense.
    - The work of Christ is to actualize the **New Being** that reconciles estranged existence.
    - The significance of Christ is ontological, not juridical.
    - Christ mediates the divine-human encounter, not a covenantal transaction.
    "In the Christ the gap between essential and existential being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Symbolic Interpretation of Theological Language**
    - All theological statements, including those about **covenant**, are symbolic.
    - Symbols participate in the reality to which they point but are not literal descriptions.
    - The **pactum salutis** is reinterpreted as a symbol of divine-human unity.
    - Tillich resists literalist readings of doctrinal formulations.
    "Symbols open up levels of reality which otherwise are closed to us." (Dynamics of Faith)

4. **Existential Understanding of Salvation**
    - Salvation is not a legal arrangement but the healing of existential estrangement.
    - The work of Christ is to bring about reunion between God and humanity.
    - The **covenant** is existentially realized in the individual's encounter with the Christ.
    - The focus is on transformation, not on forensic imputation.
    "Salvation is the reunion of the separated." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Critique of Federal Headship**
    - Tillich rejects the notion of Christ as a representative in a forensic or federal sense.
    - He sees such categories as rooted in outdated metaphysical systems.
    - The unity Christ brings is existential and ontological, not covenantal or juridical.
    - The emphasis is on participation in the **New Being**, not on legal headship.
    "The Christ is not a representative in the legal sense, but the bearer of the New Being for all." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **covenant** and **Christology** challenged traditional Reformed categories such as the **pactum salutis** and federal headship. His existential and symbolic approach influenced 20th-century theology, especially in the dialogue between philosophy and Christian doctrine. While his views stand in contrast to confessional Reformed theology, his work remains significant for those exploring the intersection of **systematic theology** and existential philosophy. Tillich’s legacy is marked by his innovative use of symbols and his focus on the ontological dimensions of salvation.
