# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust understanding of the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption) as foundational to the work of **Christ as covenant head**. He emphasized the **Trinitarian agreement** in salvation, highlighting Christ’s unique role as the representative and substitute for the **elect** within the framework of **federal theology**.

- "The plan of salvation is rooted in the eternal covenant between the Persons of the Godhead." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Key Works

- The Plan of Salvation
- Biblical and Theological Studies (essays on covenant theology)
- The Person and Work of Christ
- Selected Shorter Writings (especially essays on federal theology)
- Calvin and Augustine (contextual analysis of covenant thought)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Pactum salutis as Trinitarian foundation**
    - The **covenant of redemption** is an eternal agreement within the Godhead.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit each assume distinct roles in the plan of salvation.
    - This pact grounds the historical outworking of redemption.
    - It ensures the certainty and unity of the divine purpose.
    - "The whole work of redemption is the execution of an eternal inter-Trinitarian covenant." (The Plan of Salvation)

2. **Christ as federal head of the elect**
    - Christ represents the elect as their covenant head in the pactum salutis.
    - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to those He represents.
    - The federal relationship mirrors Adam’s headship in the covenant of works.
    - This headship is essential for understanding justification and atonement.
    - "Christ stands to His people as the Second Adam, their covenant head and representative." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

3. **Covenant theology as the structure of redemptive history**
    - Warfield sees the **covenant of redemption**, **works**, and **grace** as the backbone of biblical history.
    - The pactum salutis precedes and grounds the historical covenants.
    - The unity of the covenants reflects God’s unchanging purpose.
    - This framework safeguards the doctrines of grace and assurance.
    - "The whole history of redemption is the unfolding of the eternal covenant." (The Plan of Salvation)

4. **Substitutionary atonement rooted in covenant headship**
    - Christ’s atoning work is effective because of His covenantal representation.
    - The legal and relational aspects of the covenant are both emphasized.
    - The pactum salutis provides the basis for penal substitution.
    - The elect’s union with Christ is covenantal and forensic.
    - "It is as covenant head that Christ bears the penalty and secures the blessing for His people." (The Person and Work of Christ)

5. **Assurance grounded in the eternal covenant**
    - The pactum salutis guarantees the infallibility of salvation for the elect.
    - The unbreakable nature of the intra-Trinitarian covenant undergirds assurance.
    - Christ’s faithfulness as covenant head is the believer’s security.
    - The doctrine fosters confidence in the immutability of God’s promises.
    - "Our assurance rests on the eternal covenant, ordered in all things and sure." (The Plan of Salvation)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as covenant head reinforced the centrality of **federal theology** in Reformed thought. His work provided a systematic and exegetical defense of the covenantal structure of redemption, influencing later theologians at Westminster and beyond. Warfield’s emphasis on the Trinitarian and forensic dimensions of salvation continues to shape contemporary discussions of covenant theology and the doctrine of Christ’s headship.
