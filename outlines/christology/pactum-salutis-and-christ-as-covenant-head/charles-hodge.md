# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a robust doctrine of the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption), emphasizing the eternal agreement within the **Trinity** whereby the **Father** appoints the **Son** as the **covenant head** of the elect. Hodge maintained that Christ’s federal headship is foundational for understanding the **imputation** of righteousness and the structure of **redemptive history**.

- "The plan of salvation was arranged in the covenant of redemption, entered into between the Father and the Son before the foundation of the world." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Covenant within the Trinity**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal agreement between the Father and the Son.
    - It establishes the roles and promises concerning the redemption of the elect.
    - The Holy Spirit is included as the applier of redemption.
    - This covenant grounds the certainty and unity of the plan of salvation.
    - "There was, therefore, a covenant between the Father and the Son, in which the latter undertook to do a certain work, and the former engaged to bestow a certain reward." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Christ as Federal Head**
    - Christ represents the elect as their **covenant head**.
    - His obedience and suffering are imputed to those he represents.
    - This federal relationship parallels Adam’s headship in the covenant of works.
    - The benefits of redemption flow from Christ’s representative role.
    - "He was the head and representative of his people, and acted in their name and in their behalf." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Imputation and Representation**
    - The righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers through his covenant headship.
    - The legal standing of the elect is secured by Christ’s fulfillment of the covenant.
    - Hodge affirms the forensic nature of justification rooted in this imputation.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to his soteriology.
    - "The ground of justification is the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to the believer." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is the historical outworking of the eternal pactum salutis.
    - All administrations of the covenant of grace are rooted in Christ’s headship.
    - The promises made to Christ in the eternal covenant are realized in history.
    - The unity of the covenant underscores the continuity of redemption.
    - "The covenant of grace is the execution in time of the covenant of redemption." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Trinitarian Structure of Redemption**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit each have distinct roles in the pactum salutis.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - This structure preserves both unity and distinction within the Godhead.
    - The work of redemption is thus thoroughly Trinitarian in its foundation.
    - "The plan of salvation is the work of the triune God, each person acting in his own sphere." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as **covenant head** became a standard reference in Reformed dogmatics, especially in American Presbyterianism. His clear exposition influenced subsequent theologians at Princeton and beyond, shaping the understanding of federal theology and the structure of redemption. Hodge’s emphasis on the forensic and representative aspects of Christ’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of **imputation** and covenant theology in the Reformed tradition.
