# Three Forms of Unity (1618–1619)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a robust **federal theology** in which the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption) grounds Christ’s role as the **covenant head** of the elect. These confessions emphasize the eternal agreement within the **Trinity** for the salvation of the church, with Christ appointed as Mediator and Surety, ensuring the fulfillment of the **covenant of grace** for His people.

- "God, out of the infinite mercy, freely set forth and appointed the Mediator by His own eternal counsel and most gracious will." (Canons of Dort, II.8)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession (1561), esp. Articles 16, 20, 22
- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), esp. Q&A 15–18, 26, 60
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), esp. Heads I & II
- The Three Forms of Unity: Texts and Historical Introductions (ed. Beeke & Ferguson)
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. Dennison)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Covenant of Redemption (Pactum Salutis)**
    - The confessions teach that the plan of salvation originates in the eternal counsel of the **Triune God**.
    - Christ is appointed as Mediator and Head by the Father before the foundation of the world.
    - The **pactum salutis** is implicit in the language of divine appointment and sending of the Son.
    - The unity of the divine will ensures the certainty of redemption for the elect.
    - "God appointed His Son to be Mediator and Head of the elect, making a covenant with Him." (Belgic Confession, Art. 20)

2. **Christ as Covenant Head and Surety**
    - Christ represents the elect as their federal Head in the **covenant of grace**.
    - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to believers.
    - The confessions stress Christ’s substitutionary work as fulfilling the demands of the covenant.
    - Christ’s headship guarantees the efficacy and application of redemption.
    - "He is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 18)

3. **Trinitarian Foundation of Salvation**
    - The work of redemption is rooted in the united will and action of Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - The confessions emphasize the inseparable operations of the Trinity in the covenant.
    - The eternal counsel of God is the source of the covenantal arrangement.
    - "The Father has given to the Son those whom He has chosen." (Canons of Dort, I.7)

4. **Unconditional Election and Definite Atonement**
    - Election is grounded in God’s sovereign, gracious will, not foreseen faith or merit.
    - Christ’s headship is particular: He represents and redeems the elect alone.
    - The atonement is effectual and limited to those given to Christ in the eternal covenant.
    - The confessions reject universalism and uphold particular redemption.
    - "It was the will of God that Christ by the blood of the cross should effectually redeem...all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen." (Canons of Dort, II.8)

5. **Assurance and Perseverance in the Covenant**
    - The confessions teach that the benefits of Christ’s headship are infallibly applied to the elect.
    - Assurance is grounded in the objective work of Christ as covenant Head.
    - Perseverance flows from the unbreakable bond established in the **pactum salutis**.
    - The Spirit’s testimony and the promises of the covenant secure believers’ confidence.
    - "Those whom God has received in His Son will He never cast away from Him." (Canons of Dort, V.9)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed understandings of the **covenant of redemption** and Christ’s federal headship. Their articulation of the **pactum salutis** provided a confessional foundation for later covenant theology, influencing both continental and British Reformed traditions. By grounding assurance and perseverance in Christ’s covenantal work, these confessions continue to inform Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology worldwide.
