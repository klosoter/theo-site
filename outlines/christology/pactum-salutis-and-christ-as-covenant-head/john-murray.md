# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust articulation of the **pactum salutis** (the covenant of redemption), emphasizing its eternal, intra-Trinitarian character and its foundational role in the **covenant of grace**. He viewed **Christ as covenant head** in a federal sense, representing the elect in the accomplishment of redemption and ensuring the efficacy of his mediatorial work.

- "The plan of salvation is rooted in a covenantal arrangement between the Father and the Son, the Son undertaking to accomplish redemption as the representative and surety of his people." ("The Covenant of Grace," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

## Key Works

- "The Covenant of Grace" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 4)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied
- "The Adamic Administration" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- Romans (NICNT Commentary)
- The Imputation of Adam’s Sin

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Intra-Trinitarian Covenant**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal agreement within the Godhead, particularly between the Father and the Son.
    - This covenant precedes and grounds the historical **covenant of grace**.
    - The Son voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption as Mediator.
    - The Father promises the Son a people and the rewards of obedience.
    - "The covenant of redemption is the eternal prototype of the covenant of grace." ("The Covenant of Grace," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

2. **Christ as Federal Head**
    - Christ acts as the representative and surety for the elect in the **covenant of grace**.
    - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to those he represents.
    - This headship is analogous to Adam’s federal role in the covenant of works.
    - The efficacy of redemption depends on Christ’s covenantal headship.
    - "The Son as Mediator is constituted the federal head of the people given to him by the Father." ("The Covenant of Grace," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of grace** is one in substance throughout redemptive history.
    - The administration of the covenant varies, but its foundation in Christ’s headship remains constant.
    - The Old and New Testaments reveal progressive unfolding, not two separate covenants.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are applied to all covenant members, past and present.
    - "There is but one covenant of grace, and it is the same in all ages." ("The Covenant of Grace," Collected Writings, Vol. 4)

4. **Voluntary Obedience of the Son**
    - The Son’s obedience is not coerced but freely undertaken in the context of the **pactum salutis**.
    - This voluntary obedience fulfills the covenantal requirements for the elect.
    - The merit of Christ’s work is grounded in his willing submission to the Father’s will.
    - The Son’s obedience is both active (fulfilling the law) and passive (suffering the penalty).
    - "The obedience of Christ was voluntary, and it was this voluntary obedience that gave to his work its redemptive virtue." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Imputation and Representation**
    - The benefits of Christ’s covenantal obedience are imputed to believers.
    - Christ’s role as covenant head ensures the legal and vital union with his people.
    - The structure of federal representation is essential for understanding justification.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ undergirds the doctrine of imputation.
    - "As Adam was the representative of his posterity, so Christ is the representative of his people." (The Imputation of Adam’s Sin)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as covenant head has significantly shaped modern Reformed theology, especially in discussions of federal representation and the unity of the covenant of grace. His careful exegesis and systematic clarity have influenced generations of theologians at Westminster and beyond. By grounding redemption in the eternal counsel of the Triune God, Murray reinforced the coherence and depth of the Reformed soteriological framework.
