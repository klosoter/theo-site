### TITLE
Eternal Counsel, One Will: The pactum salutis as the ground of Christ’s federal headship

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether and how the **pactum salutis**—an eternal **covenant of redemption**—can be affirmed under **divine simplicity** to ground Christ’s **federal headship** without introducing multiple wills in God.
- Decisive figures: Johannes Cocceius, Francis Turretin, John Owen, Herman Witsius, Herman Bavinck, Karl Barth.
- Traditions: Reformed scholastic **federal theology** and Puritan orthodoxy; modern Reformed dogmatics; interaction with Lutheran and modern critiques.
- Debates:
  - Internal: pactum as distinct from or identical with the **eternal decree**; place of the Spirit; ordering to the **covenant of grace**; supralapsarian-infralapsarian coordination; merit and **imputation**; scope of **federal headship**.
  - External: Lutheran skepticism about intra-trinitarian covenant; Socinian and modern denials of **penal substitution** and **active obedience**; Barth’s attack on an abstract pretemporal pact.
  - Contemporary: charges of tritheism and eternal functional subordination; biblical-theological warrant; relation to union with Christ and the extent of atonement; theological method and **analogical knowledge**.
- Position defended: The **pactum salutis** is a warranted, analogical inference from Scripture within the unity of the one divine will that personally terminates on the Son and Spirit, establishing Christ as **second Adam** and **federal head** of the elect; it secures the justice, efficacy, and coherence of the **covenant of grace** without compromising **divine simplicity**.

### ESSAY
The pactum salutis names the eternal determination of the triune God to redeem a people by appointing the Son as mediator and **federal head**, to be anointed by the Spirit, with promises and obligations that terminate personally within the Godhead and issue in the historical **covenant of grace**. The term covenant here functions analogically and forensically, indicating structured commitments, conditions, and rewards, rather than a contract between independent agents. The doctrine’s dogmatic center is not a speculative treaty in heaven but the biblical portrayal of the Father sending, the Son consenting and undertaking, and the Spirit anointing and applying, all in the indivisible action of the one God. The question is whether this can be affirmed without violating **divine simplicity** and the unity of the divine will, while providing a firm ground for Christ’s representative obedience, satisfaction, and meritorious inheritance for his people.

Johannes Cocceius 1603–1669 gave the pactum salutis its explicit covenantal articulation within a broader **federal theology**. Against an undifferentiated decree, Cocceius structured redemptive history under the headship of covenants and read Scripture canonically as the progressive administration of one saving purpose ordered to Christ. He drew on texts that depict a pretemporal grant to the Son and promissory commitments shaping his messianic mission. Psalm 2 announces the decree of sonship and an inheritance of the nations. Psalm 110 depicts an oath establishing a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Isaiah 42 presents the servant upheld by the Lord with the Spirit upon him and appointed as a covenant for the people. John 6 speaks of a people given by the Father to the Son and the Son’s consequent commitment to lose none of them. John 17 gives voice to the Son’s consciousness of having accomplished the work the Father gave him and of receiving glory given before the world existed. Hebrews 7 to 10 reads Christ’s priesthood and once-for-all sacrifice as pledged in the divine oath and fulfilled in time. Cocceius read these texts not as mere temporal moments but as the outworking of an eternal counsel. His method combined exegesis, biblical-theological synthesis, and dogmatic reasoning: if the economy manifests ordered commitments between Father and Son, and if those commitments are grounded in a divine oath, then their ratio is eternal and foundational to the economy. Thus the pactum.

Cocceius’s conceptual contribution was twofold. First, he reframed the relation of decree and execution by embedding decree-like determination in covenantal form, thereby safeguarding the legal-ethical texture of redemption. Second, he sharpened Christ’s status as **federal head** by tracing his messianic obligations and rewards to a pretemporal ordination, which gives robust grounding for both **active obedience** and exaltation. Critics charged him with multiplying divine acts ad intra and with over-formalizing the decree. Cocceius answered by insisting that covenant language is a mode of revelation and a fitting human way to describe the personal ordering of the one will of God as it terminates on distinct persons. The personal order is not three centers of willing but a single divine willing subsisting in three persons, appropriated personally according to paternity, filiation, and spiration.

Francis Turretin 1623–1687 systematized and guarded the pactum salutis within the apparatus of Reformed scholasticism. In the Institutes of Elenctic Theology he argued that the pact is neither a fourth covenant nor a mere rhetorical flourish, but a distinct aspect of the **eternal decree** insofar as it involves orderings of means to ends with personal properties and economic roles in view. To Turretin, Scripture’s language of giving, sending, undertaking, promising, and rewarding cannot be collapsed into a simple decree without loss of covenantal content. He framed the pact in terms of stipulations and promises: the Son, having assumed a human nature in the fullness of time, would fulfill the law, bear the curse due for the elect, and establish a kingdom; the Father would prepare a body, sustain him by the Spirit, accept the satisfaction, raise and exalt him, and give him a seed. The Spirit, not a contracting party in the same way, is the bond of the covenant, anoints the mediator, and applies the benefits to the elect. This triple focus secures both the unity of divine action and the real economy of salvation. Turretin also pressed precision where Cocceius was broader: the pact is not with a preexisting Mediator, for the Son is not mediator ad intra, but with the Son considered as to his future mediatorial office. That distinction protects the impassibility and aseity of God while giving genuine force to the pact’s conditions and promises as they are realized in the economy.

Turretin anticipated the most acute examiner challenge: does the pactum posit three wills in God, contradicting **divine simplicity** and the doctrine that will is a property of nature, not person? He replied decisively by appealing to **analogical knowledge** and the distinction between the immanent act and its personal termination. There is one divine will. Yet the single willing of God is ordered personally with respect to the fittingness of missions and offices. The Father’s willing to send is the same willing as the Son’s willing to be sent, although the mode of subsistence is different. The term covenant thus denotes the trinitarian taxis of the one decree relative to the mediator and his people. The personal relations do not introduce separate volitional faculties; they mark how the one will of God, under distinct personal properties, tends to effects ad extra. The pactum therefore does not entail tritheism or a society of wills. It speaks, in creaturely mode, of the relations and promises revealed in the economy and rooted in God.

John Owen 1616–1683 deepened the federal logic and tied the pactum salutis to definite atonement and **imputation**. In The Death of Death Owen read the Father’s giving of a people to the Son and the Son’s suretyship as the internal ground of particular redemption. The Son assumes an office as **surety** and **federal head**, such that his obedience and satisfaction are rendered on behalf of a determinate people united to him by divine grant. That prior grant constrains the intent of the atonement. Owen’s conceptual move is not a speculative narrowing of divine love but a juridical clarification: federal representation always presupposes parties, terms, and identification. There is no undefined entity called humanity to which the Mediator is head. Rather, Adam is **federal head** of humanity in the **covenant of works**, Christ is **federal head** of the elect in the **covenant of grace**, and the transition from Adamic to Christic headship occurs by union with Christ, which the Spirit effects in time according to the Father’s gift to the Son in the pact. Owen insisted that Christ’s **active obedience** is not merely preparatory; it fulfills the law as the covenantal condition for the inheritance promised in the pact, so that righteousness is not only the removal of guilt but a positive title to life. The Son, by pactal appointment, becomes heir of all things and receives a seed. That inheritance is shared with the seed by **double imputation**, the sin of the elect accounted to Christ and the righteousness of Christ accounted to the elect. Some objected that this reduces salvation to legal fiction. Owen’s response is Christological and covenantal: since the mediator is a real person in whom the elect are federally summed up, the covenantal transfer is not a fiction but the proper operation of **federal headship** established by God’s oath.

Herman Witsius 1636–1708 supplied the classic synthesis in The Economy of the Covenants. He wove Cocceian progress, Turretinian precision, and Owenic federal particularism into a judicious whole. Witsius emphasized that the pact is the archetype of the **covenant of grace**, not a covenant of grace ad intra. It is a covenant of works for Christ in the sense that he fulfills the precept and penalty of the law on behalf of the elect and thereby purchases for them the covenant of grace, which is free in its recipients because merited by the mediator. He tightened exegesis of the pact’s loci: the intercessory logic of John 17 presupposes prior donation; Hebrews’ oath corresponds to eternal counsel and brings to light the promissory reward; the Servant Songs articulate an exchange of work and reward with the Spirit’s anointing as both condition of mission and earnest of inheritance. Witsius also faced Lutheran wariness about speaking of intratrinitarian covenant. He agreed that covenant, strictly, applies to God and man. But he maintained that Scripture’s oaths and promises between Father and Son warrant the analogical extension. The alternative is to dissolve the legal-ethical structure of redemption into an undifferentiated decree, at cost to the unity of Scripture’s forensic and filial idioms.

Herman Bavinck 1854–1921 brought modern Reformed dogmatics to bear, tightening metaphysical guardrails while retaining the dogma. He affirmed that the pactum salutis is not an independent transaction alongside God’s decree but the decree itself considered with respect to the Mediator and his people. He integrated the doctrine under **divine simplicity** and immutability: no new relations arise in God, but the one simple act of will has multiple aspects and orders relative to its effects. Bavinck also pressed the trinitarian completion of the doctrine. The Spirit is not a bystander but the one who furnishes Christ with gifts, bears him in his obedience, and communicates the acquired salvation to the elect, thereby fulfilling the pact’s terms. Bavinck’s methodological counsel is decisive for contemporary debate. One must avoid social-trinitarian reification and equally avoid collapsing covenant form into abstraction. Biblical language authorizes the analogy; metaphysical clarity disciplines it. The result is a doctrine that secures the trinitarian depth of the gospel and the juridical solidity of our salvation.

Against this internal development, Karl Barth 1886–1968 leveled a powerful external critique. Barth rejected a pretemporal pact as mythological and voluntaristic. For Barth, covenant is the form of the one eternal decision of God to be for humanity in Jesus Christ, the election of Jesus Christ being the whole content of predestination. Consequently, the direction of covenant is God’s self-determination to be man in Christ, not an exchange of stipulations and merits. He feared that the pact collapsed God’s freedom into an antecedent legal scheme and introduced a contractualism that endangers grace. The Reformed reply, shaped by Turretin and Bavinck, is not to deny the gratuity of God’s decision but to insist that the covenantal form is itself the form of that free decision. The pact does not yoke God to an alien law; it is the determination of the Son to fulfill the law he shares as God and the promise of the Father to crown that obedience. All of this is internal to God’s goodness and faithfulness, not external constraint. Here the distinction between God’s will as simple and his willing as ordered in respect of effects bears the explanatory load. The pact is not a fourth entity beside God and creation; it is the wise order of grace, freely willed.

With these figures and their trajectories in view, we can now state and defend a coherent position. The **pactum salutis** is a legitimate doctrinal inference from Scripture, necessary to secure the integrity of Christ’s **federal headship** and the coherence of the **covenant of grace**, and fully compatible with **divine simplicity** and one divine will. It distinguishes, without separating, decree and execution by providing a covenantal ratio for the economy. The pact assigns offices and promises with personal termini: the Father appoints and gives, the Son undertakes and merits, the Spirit anoints and applies. Each act is the one act of God, personally appropriated. The pact grounds Christ’s representation: as the second Adam he fulfills what the first failed, bearing curse and attaining righteousness for his seed. It supplies the juridical foundation for **active obedience** and **double imputation**. It clarifies the scope of atonement as federal and definite, because the mediator’s work is for those given him and united to him.

This position must bear three pressure tests. First, the trinitarian test. Does the pact entail subordination in the immanent Trinity or suggest EFS? No. The Son’s covenantal obedience is the obedience of the incarnate mediator according to his human will, assumed in the hypostatic union, and the eternal fittingness of mission flows from eternal generation, not from inequality of deity. The pact presupposes consubstantial equality and taxis, not hierarchy of essence. The one will of God is simply willed, and the economy manifests it in missions that mirror personal relations. The Father’s sending and the Son’s being sent do not entail two wills but one will whose personal order corresponds to paternity and filiation. If pressed with the examiner’s sharpest point—do you posit willing in the Son distinct from the Father ad intra?—the answer is no, we deny distinct volitional faculties in God. We affirm distinct personal appropriations of the one simple willing relative to the mediator and his work.

Second, the biblical-theological test. Is there warrant for covenantal language ad intra? Scripture nowhere narrates a heavenly contract. Yet the pervasive intertextual pattern of oath, grant, and reward to the Messiah demands explanatory unity. Psalm 110’s oracle, Isaiah’s Servant commission and promise of a seed, the Father’s giving a people and a cup, the Son’s sense of commission and accomplished work in John 17, the oath-bound priesthood of Hebrews, and the Pauline second Adam schema yield, together, a covenantal structure. To deny the analogy leaves the forensic and promissory texture of redemption dangling. To embrace it provides a principled ground for Christ’s federal labor and reward as the promised heir. The analogy is safe because it is tethered to the economy and disciplined by metaphysics.

Third, the soteriological test. Does **federal headship** distort union with Christ or make salvation a mere legal fiction? Quite the opposite. Federal representation is the legal form of real spiritual union. Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 establish a two-Adam structure where guilt and death come by one representative and righteousness and life by another. Union with Christ is the Spirit’s application of what the pact ordered and the mediator merited. The legal righteousness imputed is grounded in the personal obedience of Christ as covenant head, and the vivifying union that follows is the Spirit’s communication of that righteousness and life. The pact unites what God has joined: forensic declaration and transformative communion. Examiner objections that federalism sidelines mystical union or ecclesial mediation fail to note that the Spirit who applies the pact’s benefits unites believers to Christ in his body and mediates grace through word and sacrament, thereby exhibiting the ecclesial outworking of the eternal counsel.

Internal Reformed debates refine rather than overturn this picture. Is the pact distinct from the **eternal decree** or simply the decree under a certain respect? Turretin and Bavinck recommend the latter: distinction of reason, not real separation. Does the pact entail supralapsarian ordering of election relative to the fall? Not necessarily. The pact may be coordinated with either order, provided that Christ’s mediatorial appointment envisages the elect in need of redemption and assigns him the task of remedying Adamic ruin. Is the Spirit a covenanting party? Most classical accounts deny parity, yet affirm that the Spirit is constitutive of the pact’s execution as the unction of the mediator and bond of application. What is the relation of the pact to the **covenant of works**? Witsius’s answer remains most serviceable: the pact recapitulates and surpasses the demands of the covenant of works by requiring of Christ the full obedience and satisfaction due under the law and promising a reward exceeding Adam’s natural inheritance, namely, a glorified people and cosmic lordship. That is why the covenant of grace is genuinely gracious toward us; it is purchased in Christ by strict justice.

External debates press from different flanks. Lutheran orthodoxy often objected to the extension of covenant language ad intra and to the federal structure that seemed to elevate law. Yet the Reformed read law not as alien to grace but as the expression of God’s moral order and the appointed arena of Christ’s obedience. Socinians denied **penal substitution** and with it the need for a pact. But the Reformed showed from Scripture that Christ bore curse and satisfied justice, which presupposes a federal identification and warrant. Modern moral theorists protest the transfer of guilt and righteousness as unjust. The reply is that federal bonds change the moral frame: what is unjust between private parties becomes just when the representative relation is divinely instituted, as Romans 5 argues. Barth’s critique, powerful in rhetoric, collapses under two points. He rightly makes Christ central to election; but by resisting pactal form, he undercuts the forensic, promissory shape of the gospel evidenced in Scripture. And by grounding everything in a single all-encompassing election, he risks dissolving the legal structure into a metaphysical identity of God and man in Christ, which the biblical economy does not support.

Contemporary debates force further clarity. The accusation that the pactum rejoins EFS fails because the pact is about the mediatorial economy and the personal order of missions, not eternal role subordination. The charge of tritheism collapses when we insist on one will and on **analogical knowledge**. The worry that the pact imposes a legalist frame on Scripture ignores that Christ’s covenantal obedience secures filial communion as its reward, so that legal and filial categories interpenetrate rather than compete. Questions about biblical warrant can be met by careful exegesis of the father-son dynamics in John, the oath in Hebrews, and the second-Adam doctrine in Paul. Concerns about pastoralia are also addressed: the pact assures believers that their salvation rests not on their faith’s intensity but on the sworn transactions within the triune life that guarantee the mediator’s work and its application.

Finally, the doctrine’s implications for adjacent loci confirm its integrative power. In Trinity, it honors **divine simplicity**, indivisible operations, and the taxis of persons. In Christology, it grounds the mediator’s mission, obedience, and exaltation. In atonement, it stabilizes **penal substitution** and **double imputation**. In soteriology, it coordinates **union with Christ**, **justification**, and **sanctification** under one federal head. In ecclesiology, it frames the church as the people given to the Son and gathered by the Spirit under the royal priesthood of Christ. In eschatology, it locates the inheritance of the saints in the reward promised to the mediator and shared with his seed.

To conclude, the **pactum salutis** is a disciplined, necessary way of speaking about the trinitarian ground of redemption. Cocceius gave it biblical-covenantal form; Turretin secured its metaphysical measure; Owen tied it to **federal headship**, merit, and definite atonement; Witsius harmonized and administered it across Scripture; Bavinck integrated it with modern dogmatic concerns; Barth challenged it and in so doing sharpened its defenses. Properly understood, the pact does not posit competing volitions in God nor does it collapse grace into law. It preserves the glory of the Son’s filial obedience, the justice of God’s acceptance, and the certainty of the church’s inheritance. Christ as **covenant head** is not an abstract representative but the anointed mediator who, by sworn appointment, fulfilled the law, bore the curse, and secured life for his people. The church confesses and rests here: the gospel’s legal and filial assurances meet and kiss in the eternal counsel of the triune God, executed in time by the obedient Son and applied by the life-giving Spirit, to the praise of the Father who gave him a people and in him their everlasting covenant.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The **pactum salutis** is the eternal, analogically conceived **covenant of redemption** within the one divine will, personally ordered to the Father’s appointment, the Son’s mediatorial undertaking, and the Spirit’s anointing and application, establishing Christ as **federal head** of the elect and grounding the **covenant of grace**.

  - Cocceius: canonical, covenantal formulation of the pact; biblical warrant in psalms, prophets, John, Hebrews.
  - Turretin: scholastic precision, one will with personal termination; pact as decree under a distinct respect; Spirit as bond.
  - Owen: suretyship, definite atonement, **active obedience**, **double imputation**, pact as ground of representation.
  - Witsius: classic synthesis; pact as archetype of covenant of grace; law-grace coordination.
  - Bavinck: integration under **divine simplicity**; trinitarian completion; methodological discipline.
  - Barth: rejection of a pretemporal pact; critique of contractualism; provoked clarifications.
- Debates:
  - Internal: distinctness from decree; role of Spirit; supralapsarian or infralapsarian coordination; merit and **imputation**; scope of **federal headship**.

  - Contemporary: EFS accusations; tritheism fears; biblical-theological warrant; union with Christ versus legalism; extent of atonement.
- Defended position: The pact is a warranted, non-competitive specification of the one decree that grounds Christ’s **federal headship**, secures the juridical and filial shape of salvation, and maintains **divine simplicity** by treating covenant language analogically with personal appropriation of the one will.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does the pact introduce three wills in God? No, one will personally appropriated; covenant is analogical, not three faculties.
  - Where is it in Scripture? In the oath and promise pattern of Psalm 110, Isaiah 42, John 6 and 17, and Hebrews’ priestly oath.
  - How does the Spirit fit? As the anointing bond and applier of benefits, personally terminating the one will in mission.
  - Is this EFS? No, obedience is economic in the incarnate Son; eternal generation grounds mission without subordination of essence.
  - Does federalism make salvation legal fiction? No, representation is real by divine institution; **imputation** follows true **federal headship**.
  - Does it force limited atonement? It entails definite federal intent; the mediator dies for those given him and united to him.
