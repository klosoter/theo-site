# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who has emphasized the centrality of the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption) in understanding the work of **Christ as covenant head**. Gaffin situates Christ’s mediatorial role within the framework of **federal theology**, highlighting the importance of the **Trinitarian** agreement in the accomplishment of **redemption** and the representative function of Christ for the **elect**. His work underscores the inseparability of Christ’s person and work, especially as it relates to the **ordo salutis** and union with Christ.

- "The obedience of Christ as the second Adam is the obedience of the covenant head, the representative of his people, in fulfillment of the pactum salutis." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "The Work of Christ Applied" in The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century, Vol. 2
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (WTJ 65)
- "The Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Consummation" in The Glory of the Atonement

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Pactum Salutis as Trinitarian Foundation**
   - The **pactum salutis** is an intra-Trinitarian covenant between the Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - It establishes the eternal plan for the redemption of the elect.
   - The Son voluntarily assumes the role of Mediator and Surety.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the church.
   - "The pactum salutis is the pretemporal foundation for the accomplishment and application of salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Christ as Federal Head**
   - Christ fulfills the role of the second Adam, representing the elect in the covenant of grace.
   - His obedience and righteousness are imputed to believers.
   - The federal headship of Christ is essential for understanding justification and union with Christ.
   - The solidarity of Christ with his people is rooted in the eternal covenant.
   - "As covenant head, Christ’s obedience is the ground of the believer’s justification and life." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Obedience and Active/Passive Righteousness**
   - Christ’s obedience is both active (fulfilling the law) and passive (suffering the penalty for sin).
   - Both aspects are necessary for the accomplishment of redemption.
   - The obedience is rendered as covenant head, not merely as private individual.
   - This obedience is the fulfillment of the **pactum salutis**.
   - "The distinction between active and passive obedience is meaningful only in the context of Christ’s covenant headship." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Union with Christ and the Ordo Salutis**
   - All benefits of salvation flow from union with Christ, the covenant head.
   - The application of redemption is inseparable from Christ’s representative role.
   - Justification, sanctification, and glorification are all grounded in this union.
   - The ordo salutis is not a sequence apart from Christ, but participation in him.
   - "Union with Christ is the central soteriological reality, rooted in his covenant headship." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
   - The accomplishment and application of redemption must be understood in redemptive-historical terms.
   - Christ’s work as covenant head unfolds in history, culminating in resurrection and exaltation.
   - The **pactum salutis** provides the eschatological framework for understanding salvation.
   - The church’s life is participation in the ongoing work of the risen covenant head.
   - "Redemption is accomplished and applied in the history of Christ, the covenant head of his people." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as **covenant head** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed soteriology, especially in its Trinitarian and redemptive-historical dimensions. His emphasis on union with Christ and the federal structure of redemption has influenced both academic theology and pastoral practice. Gaffin’s work continues to inform debates on justification, the ordo salutis, and the coherence of Reformed covenant theology. His legacy endures in the ongoing retrieval of classic Reformed categories for modern theological reflection.
