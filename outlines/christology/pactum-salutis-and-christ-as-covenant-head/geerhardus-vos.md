# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos developed a robust doctrine of the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption), emphasizing its foundational role in the **history of redemption** and the work of **Christ as covenant head**. Vos argued that the intra-Trinitarian agreement between the Father and the Son grounds the unity of **covenant theology**, ensuring that Christ’s mediatorial work is both representative and vicarious for the elect.

- "The covenant of redemption is the pre-temporal root of all the covenants God makes with man." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- "Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 2: Anthropology
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (1891)
- "Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments"
- "The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God and the Church"
- "The Eschatology of the Old Testament"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Pactum salutis as eternal foundation**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an intra-Trinitarian covenant between the Father and the Son before creation.
    - It establishes the basis for the **covenant of grace** in history.
    - The Son voluntarily undertakes the role of **mediator** and **covenant head**.
    - The Father promises the Son a redeemed people and the gifts necessary for redemption.
    - "The covenant of redemption is the eternal prototype of the historical covenants." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 2)

2. **Christ as covenant head and representative**
    - Christ is appointed as the federal head of the elect in the **pactum salutis**.
    - His obedience and suffering are vicarious, fulfilling the covenant on behalf of his people.
    - The unity of the people of God is grounded in their union with Christ as head.
    - The benefits of redemption flow from Christ’s covenantal obedience.
    - "The Son is not merely the executor, but the representative head of the covenant people." ("Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

3. **Organic unity of covenant history**
    - The **pactum salutis** ensures continuity between the covenants of redemption, works, and grace.
    - Vos sees all redemptive history as unfolding from this eternal agreement.
    - The historical covenants are expressions of the eternal will of God.
    - The unity of Scripture is rooted in the unity of the divine covenant purpose.
    - "The history of redemption is the temporal outworking of the eternal covenant." ("Biblical Theology")

4. **Trinitarian structure of redemption**
    - The **pactum salutis** highlights the distinct roles of Father, Son, and Spirit in redemption.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - This covenantal structure safeguards both unity and distinction within the Godhead.
    - The work of Christ as covenant head is inseparable from the Trinitarian economy.
    - "The covenant of redemption is the key to understanding the Trinitarian character of salvation." ("Reformed Dogmatics," Vol. 2)

5. **Covenant theology as central to Reformed soteriology**
    - Vos insists that the **pactum salutis** is not a speculative doctrine but essential to understanding salvation.
    - It secures the certainty and efficacy of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The doctrine shapes the Reformed understanding of assurance and perseverance.
    - Covenant theology provides the framework for interpreting the work of Christ and the application of salvation.
    - "Without the pactum salutis, the coherence of Reformed soteriology is lost." ("Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ as covenant head profoundly shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, especially in the areas of biblical theology and covenantal thought. His work provided a systematic and historical grounding for understanding the unity of Scripture and the centrality of Christ’s mediatorial role. Vos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of **federal theology**, the Trinity, and the relationship between the eternal counsel of God and redemptive history.
