# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the concepts of the **pactum salutis** and **Christ as covenant head** through his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. He was critical of traditional **Reformed federal theology**, viewing the idea of pre-temporal covenants and Christ’s federal headship as mythological constructs that must be reinterpreted in existential terms. For Bultmann, the significance of Christ lies not in metaphysical covenants but in the **kerygma** and the individual's encounter with the risen Lord.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Covenant Concepts**
    - Interprets biblical covenants as mythological language expressing existential realities.
    - Rejects the literal pre-temporal **pactum salutis** as a speculative, non-historical construct.
    - Sees the covenant as a metaphor for the individual's encounter with God in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the existential decision over metaphysical frameworks.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the other-worldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Christ’s Role**
    - Christ is not a federal head in the juridical sense but the decisive event of God’s self-revelation.
    - The individual's response to the kerygma is central, not participation in Adam or Christ as covenant heads.
    - The meaning of Christ’s work is realized in personal faith, not in covenantal representation.
    - The focus is on the present encounter with Christ, not on pre-temporal agreements.
    - "What matters is not the objective historicity of the event, but its existential meaning for faith." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Critique of Objective Salvation-History**
    - Questions the historical reality of salvation-historical schemes like the **pactum salutis**.
    - Argues that salvation is not a transaction between divine persons but an existential event.
    - Dismisses federal theology’s two-Adam structure as mythological.
    - Prioritizes the proclamation (kerygma) over metaphysical or legal categories.
    - "The real meaning of salvation history is disclosed only in the existential decision of faith." (History and Eschatology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the locus of God’s action, not a covenantal framework.
    - The kerygma confronts individuals with the demand for authentic existence.
    - The saving event is the word preached, not a pre-temporal pact.
    - The church’s task is to interpret the kerygma for contemporary existence.
    - "Faith is the acceptance of the kerygma as the word of God addressed to me." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Rejection of Metaphysical Federalism**
    - Denies the ontological or legal imputation of Adam’s or Christ’s acts.
    - Sees such doctrines as relics of an outdated worldview.
    - Emphasizes personal responsibility and decision in the present.
    - Christ’s significance is existential, not federal or representative.
    - "The mythological view of the world is not only obsolete but unintelligible to modern man." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **covenant theology** challenged traditional Reformed categories such as the **pactum salutis** and **Christ as covenant head**. His approach provoked significant debate, leading to both sharp criticism and creative engagement within 20th-century theology. While his rejection of federal theology distanced him from confessional Reformed thought, his emphasis on the **kerygma** and existential faith continues to influence modern biblical interpretation and theological method.
