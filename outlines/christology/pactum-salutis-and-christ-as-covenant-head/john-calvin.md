# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin did not explicitly formulate the **pactum salutis** (the intra-Trinitarian covenant of redemption), but his theology laid crucial groundwork for later Reformed developments of this doctrine. Calvin robustly affirmed **Christ as covenant head**, emphasizing Christ’s federal representation of the elect in the **covenant of grace** and grounding salvation in the eternal counsel of the **Trinity**. His exegesis and doctrinal formulations provided the categories that would later be systematized into the pactum salutis by his theological heirs.

- "For as Adam did not die for himself alone, but for us all, so Christ’s resurrection is not his own, but ours also." (Institutes, 3.21.7)

## Key Works

- Commentary on Romans

- Richard A. Muller, "Christ and the Decree" (secondary, on Calvin’s influence)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as Federal Head of the Elect**
    - Christ represents the elect as the new Adam, securing their salvation by his obedience.
    - The solidarity between Christ and believers is rooted in divine appointment.
    - Just as Adam’s disobedience brought condemnation, Christ’s obedience brings righteousness.
    - The benefits of redemption are applied to the elect through union with Christ.
    - "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (Institutes, 2.16.7)

2. **Eternal Counsel of the Trinity**
    - The plan of redemption originates in the eternal will of the triune God.
    - The Father appoints the Son as Mediator before the foundation of the world.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - Calvin emphasizes the unity and harmony of the divine persons in redemption.
    - "The Father is the beginning and fountain; the Son, wisdom and counsel; the Spirit, power and efficacy." (Institutes, 1.13.18)

3. **Covenant of Grace as Redemptive Framework**
    - The covenant of grace is the means by which God administers salvation after the fall.
    - Christ is the mediator and guarantor of this covenant.
    - The promises of the covenant are fulfilled in Christ’s person and work.
    - The covenant of grace unites Old and New Testament believers in one people of God.
    - "All the promises of God are confirmed and fulfilled in Christ." (Institutes, 2.10.2)

4. **Obedience and Satisfaction of Christ**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience are central to his mediatorial work.
    - His obedience fulfills the law on behalf of the elect.
    - His sacrificial death satisfies divine justice.
    - The merit of Christ is imputed to believers by faith.
    - "By his obedience, Christ has truly acquired and merited grace for us with his Father." (Institutes, 2.17.5)

5. **Union with Christ**
    - Believers are united to Christ by the Holy Spirit through faith.
    - All benefits of salvation flow from this union.
    - Union with Christ grounds justification, sanctification, and adoption.
    - This union is covenantal, rooted in God’s eternal purpose.
    - "As long as Christ remains outside of us, and we are separated from him, all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of the human race remains useless and of no value for us." (Institutes, 3.1.1)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **Christ as covenant head** profoundly shaped later Reformed theology, especially the development of federal or covenant theology. While he did not use the term **pactum salutis**, his emphasis on the eternal counsel of the Trinity and Christ’s representative role provided the exegetical and theological foundation for this doctrine. Calvin’s influence endures in the Reformed tradition’s understanding of the unity of redemption, the work of Christ, and the structure of the covenant of grace.
