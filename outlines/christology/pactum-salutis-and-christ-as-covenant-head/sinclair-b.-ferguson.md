# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson emphasizes the centrality of the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption) in understanding the person and work of **Christ as covenant head**. He articulates how the intra-Trinitarian agreement grounds the **covenant of grace**, with Christ representing the elect as their federal head, ensuring the accomplishment and application of redemption.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Pactum Salutis as Trinitarian Foundation**
   - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal, intra-Trinitarian covenant between the Father, Son, and Spirit.
   - It establishes the Son’s voluntary role as **mediator** and **covenant head**.
   - The Father promises a people to the Son, who undertakes their redemption.
   - The Spirit applies the benefits secured by Christ to the elect.
   - "The covenant of redemption is the pre-temporal root of the covenant of grace." ("The Whole Christ")

2. **Christ as Federal Head of the Elect**
   - Christ represents the elect in the **covenant of grace** as their federal head.
   - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to those united to Him.
   - The structure mirrors Adam’s federal headship, but with Christ as the second and last Adam.
   - This headship ensures the certainty and security of salvation for the elect.
   - "In Christ, the elect have a new covenant head whose obedience secures their salvation." ("The Whole Christ")

3. **Unity of the Covenant of Redemption and Covenant of Grace**
   - The **covenant of grace** in history is the outworking of the eternal **pactum salutis**.
   - There is no division between the eternal plan and its historical execution.
   - The promises made within the Trinity are realized in the lives of believers.
   - This unity underscores the unbreakable nature of God’s saving purpose.
   - "The covenant of grace is the historical manifestation of the eternal covenant of redemption." ("The Whole Christ")

4. **Voluntary Obedience of the Son**
   - The Son willingly accepts the role of mediator in the **pactum salutis**.
   - His obedience is both active and passive, fulfilling all covenant obligations.
   - This voluntary submission highlights the harmony of the divine will.
   - Christ’s obedience is the ground of believers’ justification and adoption.
   - "The Son’s obedience is not coerced but freely given in loving submission to the Father." ("The Whole Christ")

5. **Assurance and Application through Union with Christ**
   - Union with Christ as covenant head is the means by which believers receive all covenant blessings.
   - The Spirit’s work unites the elect to Christ, applying redemption personally.
   - Assurance flows from Christ’s finished work as covenant head, not from human effort.
   - This union grounds the believer’s identity and perseverance in salvation.
   - "All the blessings of the covenant flow to us through our union with Christ, the covenant head." ("The Whole Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s robust articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s federal headship has reinforced classic Reformed covenant theology for contemporary audiences. His clear exposition has shaped pastors and theologians, especially in understanding the Trinitarian grounding of redemption and the believer’s union with Christ. Ferguson’s work has contributed to renewed interest in the practical and pastoral implications of covenant theology within the broader Reformed tradition.
