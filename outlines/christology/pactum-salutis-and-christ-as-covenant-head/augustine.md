# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly formulate the **pactum salutis** or the concept of Christ as **covenant head** in the later Reformed sense, but his theology laid crucial groundwork for these doctrines. He emphasized the unity of the **divine will** in redemption, the necessity of **Christ’s mediation**, and the representative role of Christ as the **second Adam**, which would later inform covenantal thinking.

- "For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants, 1.9.11)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- De Civitate Dei (The City of God)
- Contra Julianum (Against Julian)
- On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Second Adam**
    - Christ is the new head of humanity, reversing Adam’s curse.
    - The obedience of Christ restores what was lost in the Fall.
    - Augustine sees a parallel between Adam’s disobedience and Christ’s obedience.
    - This typology undergirds later covenantal representations.
    - "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." (Enchiridion, 34)

2. **Unity of the Divine Will in Redemption**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit act inseparably in the work of salvation.
    - There is no division of purpose within the Trinity regarding redemption.
    - The Son’s mission is rooted in the eternal counsel of the Godhead.
    - Augustine’s trinitarian theology anticipates later pactum salutis formulations.
    - "The works of the Trinity are inseparable." (De Trinitate, I.7)

3. **Necessity of Christ’s Mediation**
    - Humanity requires a mediator due to the depth of sin.
    - Christ’s unique person as God-man qualifies Him for this role.
    - The mediation of Christ is central to Augustine’s soteriology.
    - This mediation is both representative and substitutionary.
    - "There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." (Enchiridion, 36)

4. **Covenantal Structure in Salvation History**
    - Augustine recognizes a divine ordering of history through covenants.
    - He sees continuity and fulfillment from Adam to Christ.
    - The “two cities” motif reflects a covenantal division of humanity.
    - While not systematic, his views anticipate federal theology.
    - "The first covenant was not without a mediator, nor is the new." (City of God, XVI.27)

5. **Election and Predestination in Christ**
    - Salvation is rooted in God’s eternal choice in Christ.
    - The elect are united to Christ as their representative head.
    - Predestination is Christocentric and gracious.
    - This anticipates later Reformed developments of covenant headship.
    - "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world." (Enchiridion, 98)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of **Christ as the second Adam** and his emphasis on the unity of the divine will in redemption provided foundational categories for later covenant theology. Though he did not explicitly teach the **pactum salutis**, his trinitarian and Christological insights deeply influenced Reformed formulations of Christ as covenant head. His legacy endures in the way subsequent theologians have understood the representative and mediatorial work of Christ within the framework of redemptive history.
