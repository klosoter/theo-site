# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas did not explicitly formulate the **pactum salutis** as later Reformed theologians did, but his doctrine of the **Trinity**, **Christ’s mediatorial office**, and the **eternal decree** laid groundwork for later covenantal developments. Aquinas viewed Christ as the **head of the Church** by virtue of his unique role in the **Incarnation** and **redemptive mission**, emphasizing the unity of the divine will in the economy of salvation.

- "Christ is the head of the Church by reason of His fullness, which is a source of grace to all the members of the Church." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, q. 8 (On Christ as Head of the Church)
- Summa Theologiae, I, q. 23 (On Predestination)
- Summa Theologiae, III, q. 18 (On Christ’s Will)
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III
- De Veritate

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of the Divine Will in Salvation**
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit share a single, undivided will in the **divine decree** of salvation.
    - No real distinction of wills exists between the divine persons; the economy reflects the unity of the Trinity.
    - The mission of the Son is rooted in the eternal counsel of the Godhead.
    - The Son’s obedience is a manifestation of the one divine will in human nature.
    - "The will of the Father and the Son is one, and therefore the obedience of the Son is the carrying out of the Father’s will." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 18, a. 1)

2. **Christ as Head by Grace and Merit**
    - Christ is the **head of the Church** because of the fullness of grace in his human nature.
    - His headship is both ontological (by union) and functional (by mediation).
    - Christ communicates grace to the members as the source and exemplar.
    - His merit is the basis for the salvation of the elect.
    - "Christ is called the head of the Church by reason of His influence, which is spiritual, and whereby He bestows grace on the members." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 8, a. 1)

3. **Incarnation as the Foundation of Mediation**
    - The **hypostatic union** enables Christ to mediate between God and man.
    - Christ’s obedience and satisfaction are possible only as true God and true man.
    - The Incarnation is the means by which the eternal purpose of redemption is accomplished.
    - Christ’s mediatorship is unique and unrepeatable.
    - "It was fitting that God and man should be united in order that man might be led to God by God." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 1, a. 2)

4. **Predestination and the Eternal Decree**
    - God’s **predestination** is the eternal ordering of persons to salvation through Christ.
    - The decree includes the appointment of Christ as the means and head of salvation.
    - The elect are united to Christ as their representative and source of life.
    - The decree is executed in time through Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "Predestination is a part of providence, as it is the plan concerning the salvation of men." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 23, a. 1)

5. **No Explicit Pactum Salutis, but Trinitarian Economy**
    - Aquinas does not posit a formal **covenant of redemption** within the Godhead.
    - The relations between Father and Son are described in terms of mission and obedience, not covenant.
    - The Trinitarian sending of the Son is grounded in eternal generation, not contractual agreement.
    - Later covenant theology develops categories not present in Aquinas’s framework.
    - "The mission of the Son is founded on the eternal procession, not on a pact or agreement." (Summa Theologiae I, q. 43, a. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s robust doctrine of **Christ as head** and his articulation of the **Trinitarian economy** profoundly shaped medieval and later Christian theology. While he did not develop the **pactum salutis** as a distinct locus, his insights on the unity of the divine will and the mediatorial role of Christ provided essential building blocks for later Reformed covenantal thought. His influence endures in both Roman Catholic and Protestant discussions of Christ’s person and work.
