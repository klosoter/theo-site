# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther did not explicitly articulate the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption) as later Reformed theology would, nor did he develop the concept of **Christ as covenant head** in federal terms. However, his theology of **Christ’s mediatorship**, the **incarnation**, and the **work of Christ** as the representative of humanity laid foundational elements for later covenantal formulations. Luther emphasized the initiative of God in salvation and the unique role of Christ as the one who fulfills the divine promise for His people.

- "Christ is the mediator, not only of redemption, but also of the eternal and gracious covenant of God." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1531, 1535)
- The Bondage of the Will (1525)
- Commentary on Genesis (1535–1545)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Sole Mediator**
    - Christ alone stands between God and humanity, fulfilling all righteousness.
    - The work of Christ is the center of God’s saving action.
    - No human merit or priestly mediation can replace Christ’s unique role.
    - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are sufficient for salvation.
    - "There is no other mediator between God and men than Jesus Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Divine Initiative in Salvation**
    - Salvation originates in the will and promise of God, not human effort.
    - God’s covenant is grounded in His grace, not in human response.
    - The promise to Abraham is fulfilled in Christ, apart from the law.
    - Faith receives what God has already accomplished in Christ.
    - "The promise of God precedes and faith follows." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Christ as Representative of Humanity**
    - Christ takes the place of sinners, bearing their sin and curse.
    - His righteousness is imputed to believers by faith.
    - Christ’s obedience is vicarious, standing in for all who are united to Him.
    - The believer’s union with Christ is central to justification.
    - "He became sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." (Commentary on Galatians)

4. **Covenant Promises Fulfilled in Christ**
    - The promises made to the patriarchs are realized in Christ.
    - The new covenant is established in Christ’s blood.
    - Christ is the seed of Abraham, in whom all nations are blessed.
    - The old and new covenants are unified in the person and work of Christ.
    - "All the promises of God find their Yes in Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Law and Gospel Distinction**
    - The law reveals sin and drives sinners to Christ.
    - The gospel proclaims the free promise of salvation in Christ.
    - The covenant of works is contrasted with the covenant of grace.
    - Assurance comes from trusting in Christ’s finished work, not in law-keeping.
    - "The law says, 'Do this,' and it is never done. The gospel says, 'Believe in this,' and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust doctrine of **Christ’s mediatorship** and his emphasis on the unilateral promise of God shaped later Protestant understandings of **covenant theology**, even though he did not develop the **pactum salutis** in technical terms. His focus on Christ as the representative and substitute for sinners provided a foundation for later Reformed formulations of **Christ as covenant head**. Luther’s distinction between law and gospel and his insistence on the primacy of grace continue to influence discussions of the covenant in both Lutheran and Reformed traditions.
