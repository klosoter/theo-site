# Johannes Cocceius (1603–1669)

Johannes Cocceius was a principal architect of **federal theology**, emphasizing the centrality of the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption) as an eternal agreement within the **Trinity** for the salvation of the elect. He identified **Christ as covenant head** in the **covenant of grace**, viewing all of redemptive history as unfolding through distinct, divinely instituted **biblical covenants**.

- "The covenant of God with man is the agreement between God and man about the method of obtaining eternal life." (Summa Doctrinae de Foedere et Testamento Dei)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Pactum salutis as eternal intra-Trinitarian covenant**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal agreement between the Father and the Son, prior to creation.
    - It establishes the Son’s role as **mediator** and **covenant head** for the elect.
    - The Holy Spirit applies the benefits of this covenant to believers.
    - This covenant grounds the historical **covenant of grace**.
    "The foundation of the covenant of grace is the pact made between the Father and the Son." (Summa Doctrinae)

2. **Christ as covenant head and representative**
    - Christ acts as the federal head of the elect, fulfilling all covenant obligations on their behalf.
    - His obedience and satisfaction secure the blessings of the covenant for his people.
    - The elect are united to Christ and receive the benefits of his mediatorial work.
    - This headship is rooted in the eternal counsel of God.
    "Christ is the head of the covenant, and all who are in him are partakers of its blessings." (Summa Doctrinae)

3. **Unity and progression of biblical covenants**
    - Cocceius taught a historical unfolding of God’s covenants, culminating in Christ.
    - The **covenant of works** with Adam is distinct from, but preparatory for, the **covenant of grace**.
    - Each covenant administration reveals more of God’s redemptive plan.
    - The unity of the covenants is found in their fulfillment in Christ.
    "The whole of Scripture is the unfolding of the covenant of God with man." (Summa Doctrinae)

4. **Law and gospel distinguished within covenant history**
    - The law is associated with the **covenant of works**, demanding perfect obedience.
    - The gospel is the promise of grace in Christ, offered in the **covenant of grace**.
    - Cocceius traced the transition from law to gospel through redemptive history.
    - This distinction clarifies the believer’s relationship to God in Christ.
    "The law was given to show the need for the promise, which is fulfilled in Christ." (Summa Doctrinae)

5. **Covenant theology as the organizing principle of Scripture**
    - Cocceius viewed the covenants as the key to understanding all of Scripture.
    - Redemptive history is structured by successive covenants, each revealing God’s purpose.
    - The **covenant of grace** is progressively revealed and consummated in Christ.
    - This framework unites exegesis, doctrine, and piety.
    "All the doctrines of our religion are contained in the doctrine of the covenant." (Summa Doctrinae)

## Legacy and Impact

Cocceius’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as **covenant head** became foundational for later Reformed federal theology, influencing figures such as Herman Witsius and shaping the confessional tradition. His emphasis on the unity and progression of the biblical covenants provided a robust framework for understanding redemptive history. Cocceius’s covenantal approach continues to inform **Reformed exegesis**, systematic theology, and debates on the relationship between law and gospel.
