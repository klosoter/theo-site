# Petrus van Mastricht (1630–1706)

Petrus van Mastricht offered a robust account of the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption) as the foundation for the **covenant of grace** and the work of **Christ as covenant head**. He emphasized the intra-Trinitarian agreement in which the Father appoints, the Son accepts, and the Spirit applies redemption, highlighting Christ’s federal role as representative and surety for the elect. Mastricht’s approach integrates **Reformed federal theology** with a strong focus on the unity of the divine decrees and the historical accomplishment of salvation.

- "The pact between the Father and the Son is the foundation of the covenant of grace, and Christ is its Mediator and Head." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Pactum salutis as eternal intra-Trinitarian covenant**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal agreement within the Godhead, preceding all temporal covenants.
    - The Father promises to give a people to the Son, who undertakes their redemption.
    - The Spirit is pledged to apply the benefits of Christ’s work to the elect.
    - This covenant grounds the historical **covenant of grace**.
    - "The pactum salutis is the eternal root from which the covenant of grace springs." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 2)

2. **Christ as federal head and surety**
    - Christ represents the elect as their **covenant head** in the pactum salutis.
    - He assumes their obligations and bears their penalty as surety.
    - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to those he represents.
    - This federal headship is essential for the efficacy of redemption.
    - "Christ, as covenant head, stands in the place of all those given to him by the Father." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 4)

3. **Unity of divine decrees and historical accomplishment**
    - The eternal pactum salutis ensures the unity of God’s decree and its execution in history.
    - There is no division between God’s eternal will and Christ’s historical work.
    - The covenant of redemption guarantees the infallible accomplishment of salvation.
    - The historical covenants unfold the eternal purpose of God.
    - "What God decreed in eternity, Christ fulfills in time as covenant head." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 2)

4. **Trinitarian structure of redemption**
    - Each person of the Trinity has a distinct role in the pactum salutis.
    - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
    - This structure safeguards both the unity and distinction within the Godhead.
    - The work of Christ as covenant head is inseparable from the Spirit’s application.
    - "The whole Trinity is engaged in the work of redemption, each according to the pactum salutis." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 2)

5. **Covenant theology as the framework for soteriology**
    - The **covenant of grace** is rooted in the eternal pactum salutis.
    - Christ’s mediatorial office is defined by his covenant headship.
    - The benefits of salvation are distributed covenantally to the elect.
    - Assurance and perseverance flow from Christ’s fulfillment of the covenant.
    - "All the blessings of salvation are communicated to us through Christ’s covenant headship." (Theoretical-Practical Theology, vol. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Mastricht’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as **covenant head** became a cornerstone of later Reformed federal theology, influencing both continental and British traditions. His careful integration of **Trinitarian theology** with covenantal categories provided a model for subsequent orthodox Reformed theologians. Mastricht’s work remains a key reference for understanding the theological coherence and biblical grounding of the covenant of redemption in classic Reformed thought.
