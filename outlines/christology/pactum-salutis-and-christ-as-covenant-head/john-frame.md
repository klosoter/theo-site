# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **pactum salutis** as the eternal covenant among the **Trinitarian persons** to accomplish redemption, with Christ serving as the **covenant head** representing the elect. He emphasizes the unity of the **covenant of redemption** with the broader biblical covenants and highlights Christ’s unique role as mediator and representative in the outworking of salvation.

- "The covenant of redemption is the eternal agreement among the Father, Son, and Spirit to save a people for God’s glory." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Foundation of the Pactum Salutis**
    - The **pactum salutis** is an intra-Trinitarian agreement, not merely a plan or decree.
    - Each divine person plays a distinct role: the Father sends, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit applies.
    - The covenant demonstrates the unity and diversity within the Godhead.
    - This foundation safeguards both divine sovereignty and personal relations in redemption.
    - "The pactum salutis is a covenant among the persons of the Trinity, each fulfilling a unique role in our salvation." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Christ as Covenant Head and Representative**
    - Christ is appointed as the federal head of the elect in the **covenant of redemption**.
    - His obedience and atonement are vicarious, fulfilling the covenant on behalf of his people.
    - Christ’s headship is rooted in both his divine sonship and messianic office.
    - The elect are united to Christ and receive the benefits of his covenantal work.
    - "Jesus is the representative head of his people, acting on their behalf in the eternal covenant." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Continuity of the Covenant of Redemption with Other Covenants**
    - The **pactum salutis** undergirds and shapes the historical covenants (works, grace, redemption).
    - Frame stresses the organic unity of God’s covenantal dealings throughout Scripture.
    - The work of Christ as covenant head fulfills the promises and requirements of earlier covenants.
    - This continuity affirms the coherence of redemptive history.
    - "The covenant of redemption is the foundation for all of God’s covenants with humanity." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Covenant and Divine Lordship**
    - Frame links the **covenant of redemption** to his broader doctrine of **divine lordship** (authority, control, presence).
    - The pactum salutis displays God’s sovereign initiative and faithfulness.
    - Christ’s covenant headship is an expression of his lordship over the redeemed.
    - The covenant structure reveals God’s relational and authoritative engagement with his people.
    - "God’s lordship is expressed in his covenantal dealings, supremely in the pactum salutis." (The Doctrine of God)

5. **Practical and Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The **pactum salutis** is not merely speculative but grounds assurance and the application of redemption.
    - Christ’s covenant headship ensures the certainty and efficacy of salvation for the elect.
    - Frame applies covenant theology pastorally, emphasizing its implications for worship and obedience.
    - The redemptive-historical framework shapes Christian identity and mission.
    - "The eternal covenant gives us confidence that our salvation is secure in Christ, our covenant head." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ as covenant head has reinforced the centrality of covenant theology in contemporary Reformed thought. His integration of **Trinitarian theology**, redemptive history, and practical application has influenced pastors, theologians, and students. Frame’s emphasis on the unity of God’s covenants and the lordship of Christ continues to shape evangelical discussions on the nature of salvation and the work of Christ.
