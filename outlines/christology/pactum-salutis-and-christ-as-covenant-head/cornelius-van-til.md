# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til integrated the **pactum salutis** (the eternal covenant of redemption) into his **Reformed trinitarianism** and **Christology**, emphasizing the ontological and functional unity of the **Trinity** in the work of redemption. He viewed **Christ as covenant head** not only as a historical mediator but as the eternal representative of the elect within the intra-Trinitarian counsel, grounding the economy of salvation in the eternal purposes of God.

- "The plan of salvation is, therefore, a covenant plan, and Christ is the head of the covenant." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Trinitarian Foundation of the Pactum Salutis**
   - The **pactum salutis** is rooted in the eternal counsel of the **Trinity**, not merely a temporal arrangement.
   - The Father, Son, and Spirit are co-equal participants in the covenant of redemption.
   - The unity and diversity within the Godhead are reflected in the covenantal roles.
   - The intra-Trinitarian relationship grounds the certainty and efficacy of redemption.
   - "The persons of the Trinity are eternally related to one another in the covenant of redemption." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

2. **Christ as the Representative Covenant Head**
   - Christ is appointed as the federal head of the elect in the eternal covenant.
   - His headship is both ontological (as Son) and functional (as Mediator).
   - The obedience of Christ is covenantal, fulfilling the stipulations of the pactum salutis.
   - The elect are united to Christ as their representative before the Father.
   - "Christ is the head of the covenant, representing his people before God from all eternity." ("The Defense of the Faith")

3. **Covenantal Structure of Revelation and Redemption**
   - All of God’s dealings with humanity are covenantal, reflecting the eternal pactum salutis.
   - The history of redemption unfolds the eternal purposes established within the Godhead.
   - The covenant of grace in history is the outworking of the eternal covenant.
   - The unity of Scripture is grounded in the unity of the covenantal plan.
   - "The whole of revelation is covenantal because it is grounded in the eternal counsel of God." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

4. **Antithesis and Covenant Headship**
   - The antithesis between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent is covenantal in nature.
   - Christ, as covenant head, secures victory for his people in this cosmic conflict.
   - The elect are distinguished from the reprobate by their union with Christ in the covenant.
   - The covenant headship of Christ is the foundation for the church’s identity and mission.
   - "It is only in Christ, the covenant head, that the antithesis is decisively maintained." ("Christian Theistic Ethics")

5. **Presuppositional Implications of the Pactum Salutis**
   - The eternal covenant shapes the epistemological starting point for Christian theology.
   - Human knowledge and ethics must be grounded in the covenantal revelation of God.
   - The pactum salutis provides the ultimate context for understanding redemption and history.
   - Apologetics must presuppose the triune God and his covenantal plan in Christ.
   - "Our presupposition is the triune God who has eternally covenanted for our salvation." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust articulation of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s role as covenant head has profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **covenant theology** and **presuppositional apologetics**. His emphasis on the Trinitarian and covenantal structure of redemption has influenced generations of theologians at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. By rooting the economy of salvation in the eternal counsel of the triune God, Van Til provided a framework for understanding both the unity and diversity of God’s redemptive work. His legacy endures in contemporary discussions of **federal theology** and the relationship between theology and apologetics.
