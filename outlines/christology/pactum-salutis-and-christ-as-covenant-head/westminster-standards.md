# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **pactum salutis** (covenant of redemption), grounding the work of **Christ as covenant head** within the eternal counsel of the **Trinity**. They present Christ as the **mediator** and **federal head** of the elect, whose obedience and sacrifice fulfill the terms of the covenant established between the Father and the Son for the salvation of God's people.

- "It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and man." (Westminster Confession of Faith 8.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, especially chapters 7 ("Of God's Covenant with Man") and 8 ("Of Christ the Mediator")
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Questions 30–36, 57–59
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Questions 20–23
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A.A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Covenant of Redemption**
   - The **pactum salutis** is an eternal agreement within the Godhead, particularly between the Father and the Son.
   - The Father appoints the Son to be the **mediator** and head of the elect.
   - The Son voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption on behalf of the chosen people.
   - This covenant forms the foundation for all subsequent covenants in redemptive history.
   - "It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus... to be the Mediator." (WCF 8.1)

2. **Christ as Federal Head**
   - Christ represents the elect as their **covenant head**, analogous to Adam's headship in the covenant of works.
   - His obedience and satisfaction are imputed to those whom He represents.
   - The unity of the elect with Christ is covenantal and legal, not merely exemplary.
   - The benefits of redemption are applied to the elect by virtue of their union with Christ.
   - "The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed." (WLC 31)

3. **Trinitarian Foundation**
   - The work of redemption is rooted in the eternal counsel and will of the **Trinity**.
   - The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit applies redemption.
   - The distinct roles of each person in the Godhead are preserved within the unity of the divine will.
   - The **pactum salutis** safeguards both divine initiative and Christ's voluntary obedience.
   - "The Lord Jesus... did most willingly undertake [the office of Mediator]." (WCF 8.4)

4. **Covenant of Grace Grounded in Christ**
   - The **covenant of grace** is administered through Christ as its mediator and head.
   - All the promises, benefits, and blessings of the covenant are secured by Christ's fulfillment of the **pactum salutis**.
   - The administration of the covenant of grace in history flows from the eternal covenant of redemption.
   - The elect are united to Christ and receive all covenant blessings in Him.
   - "The grace of God is manifested in the second covenant, in that he freely provideth and offereth to sinners a Mediator." (WLC 32)

5. **Necessity and Sufficiency of Christ’s Work**
   - Christ’s obedience and sacrifice are both necessary and sufficient for the salvation of the elect.
   - The **pactum salutis** ensures that redemption is accomplished and applied infallibly.
   - Christ’s role as covenant head guarantees the security and perseverance of the elect.
   - The sufficiency of Christ’s work is rooted in His unique person and office as mediator.
   - "By his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself... the Lord Jesus hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father." (WCF 8.5)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed covenant theology**, especially the doctrines of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s federal headship. Their articulation of Christ as the covenant head of the elect has become foundational for later Presbyterian and Reformed confessions. The Standards’ Trinitarian grounding of redemption and their emphasis on the unity of the covenant of grace continue to influence systematic theology, catechesis, and pastoral ministry in the Reformed tradition.
