# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth fundamentally reinterpreted the **covenant of redemption (pactum salutis)** and the role of **Christ as covenant head** within his broader doctrine of **election**. Rejecting the traditional Reformed view of a pre-temporal intra-Trinitarian pact, Barth instead located the covenant in God's free act of self-determination in Jesus Christ, who is both the electing God and the elected man. For Barth, the covenant is not a legal contract but the dynamic, gracious relationship established by God with humanity in Christ.

- "In Jesus Christ God has from all eternity willed to be our God, and willed that we should be his people." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

- Karl Barth’s Doctrine of Election (Bruce McCormack)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Rejection of a Pre-temporal Pactum Salutis**
    - Barth denies a literal, pre-temporal covenant between Father and Son as a separate legal agreement.
    - He sees the **covenant of grace** as the one and only covenant, realized in history.
    - The eternal decision is God’s self-determination to be God for humanity in Christ.
    - The pactum is not a contract but the event of divine freedom and love.
    - "The covenant of grace is the meaning and goal of all God’s dealings with man." (CD IV/1)

2. **Christ as the Electing God and Elected Man**
    - Christ is both the subject (God who elects) and object (man who is elected) of election.
    - This duality grounds Christ’s unique role as covenant head.
    - The election of Christ is the basis for the election of all humanity.
    - Christ’s headship is not forensic but ontological and representative.
    - "In Jesus Christ God has chosen Himself for man and man for Himself." (CD II/2)

3. **Covenant as the Essence of Divine-Human Relationship**
    - The covenant is the form of God’s relationship with humanity, not a legal arrangement.
    - It is rooted in God’s grace and faithfulness, not mutual negotiation.
    - The covenant is fulfilled and revealed in the person and work of Christ.
    - Barth emphasizes the unity of creation and covenant in God’s purpose.
    - "Creation is the external basis of the covenant, and the covenant is the internal basis of creation." (CD III/1)

4. **Rejection of Federal Theology’s Legalism**
    - Barth critiques the legal and contractual categories of classic federal theology.
    - He sees such categories as undermining the personal and gracious character of God’s action.
    - The covenant is not about merit or works, but about God’s free grace in Christ.
    - Barth’s approach stresses the relational and dynamic nature of the covenant.
    - "The legalistic conception of the covenant is alien to the biblical witness." (CD IV/1)

5. **Universal Scope of the Covenant in Christ**
    - Barth’s doctrine of election and covenant has a universal orientation.
    - Christ as covenant head represents all humanity, not just the elect in a limited sense.
    - The covenant’s benefits are offered to all in Christ, though not all respond in faith.
    - This universalism is grounded in the singularity of Christ’s person and work.
    - "He is the Head and Representative of all men." (CD IV/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s reconfiguration of the **pactum salutis** and Christ’s covenant headship profoundly challenged and reshaped twentieth-century Reformed theology. His Christocentric and relational understanding of the covenant influenced later discussions on **election**, the Trinity, and the nature of salvation. While Barth’s views were controversial among confessional Reformed theologians, his emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the dynamic character of the covenant continues to provoke theological reflection and debate.
