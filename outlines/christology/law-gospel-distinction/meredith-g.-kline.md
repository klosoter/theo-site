# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline was a Reformed theologian and biblical scholar who articulated a distinctive understanding of the **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **covenant theology**. He emphasized the contrast between the **works principle** operative in the **Mosaic covenant** and the **grace principle** of the **covenant of grace**, arguing that the Law and Gospel represent fundamentally different modes of inheritance and relationship with God.

- "The law is not of faith, and the inheritance is not of works but of promise." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos
- "Law Covenant" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1964)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel as Distinct Covenantal Principles**
    - The **Law** operates on a **works principle**: "do this and live."
    - The **Gospel** is grounded in the **grace principle**: inheritance by promise.
    - The Mosaic covenant is typologically a republication of the works principle.
    - The Abrahamic and New covenants are administrations of the covenant of grace.
    - "The law is antithetical to the promise as a method of securing the inheritance." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Republication of the Covenant of Works in Moses**
    - The Mosaic covenant reintroduces the works principle typologically for Israel.
    - This republication is not soteriological but typological, pointing to Christ.
    - The Sinai covenant serves as a national probation for Israel in the land.
    - The curse and exile motifs reinforce the conditionality of the Mosaic arrangement.
    - "The law covenant at Sinai was a typological re-enactment of the Adamic probation." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Typology and Eschatology in Law-Gospel Distinction**
    - The Law points forward to Christ through typological structures.
    - The Gospel fulfills the Law’s demands in the person and work of Christ.
    - Eschatological inheritance is secured by grace, not by works.
    - Typological judgments (e.g., exile) prefigure final judgment and redemption.
    - "The typological kingdom under the law pointed to the eschatological kingdom secured by grace." (Kingdom Prologue)

4. **Covenant Structure and Oath-Sanctions**
    - Covenants are structured by oaths, sanctions, and stipulations.
    - The Law brings curse for disobedience; the Gospel brings blessing by promise.
    - The Mosaic covenant’s sanctions highlight the impossibility of life by works.
    - Christ bears the curse of the Law to secure the blessings of the Gospel.
    - "The sanctions of the law covenant anticipated the curse-bearing work of the Redeemer." (By Oath Consigned)

5. **Hermeneutical Implications for Redemptive History**
    - Law-Gospel distinction shapes biblical theology and interpretation.
    - Proper reading of Scripture requires attention to covenantal context.
    - The Law’s function is preparatory and pedagogical, not salvific.
    - The unity of redemptive history is maintained through covenantal progression.
    - "The law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** has significantly influenced contemporary Reformed covenant theology, especially debates on the nature of the Mosaic covenant and its relationship to the covenant of grace. His emphasis on the **republication thesis** and typological reading of redemptive history has shaped both scholarly and pastoral approaches to biblical interpretation. Kline’s work continues to provoke discussion regarding the structure of biblical covenants and the proper understanding of **justification by faith**.
