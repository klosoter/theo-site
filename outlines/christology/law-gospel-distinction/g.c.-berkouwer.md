# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **Law-Gospel distinction** with a nuanced Reformed perspective, emphasizing the unity of **redemptive history** while recognizing the distinct roles of **Law** and **Gospel** in the economy of salvation. He critiqued both legalism and antinomianism, arguing that the **Law** exposes sin and drives one to Christ, while the **Gospel** proclaims deliverance and new life in Him.

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s careful articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** has influenced generations of Reformed theologians, especially in the context of debates over justification and sanctification. His emphasis on the unity of **redemptive history** and the proper roles of Law and Gospel has provided a mediating position between Lutheran and Reformed traditions. Berkouwer’s work remains a significant resource for those seeking to avoid both legalism and antinomianism while maintaining the centrality of the Gospel in Christian theology.
