# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **Law-Gospel distinction** through the lens of his program of **demythologization** and existential interpretation of the New Testament. He saw the **Law** as representing humanity’s bondage to self-reliance and the **Gospel** as the proclamation of authentic existence through faith in Christ, emphasizing the existential encounter rather than forensic categories.

- "The law is the demand of God, and the gospel is the gift of God’s grace." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Works

- Theology of the New Testament (1948)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- Faith and Understanding (1969)
- Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann (1960)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Law and Gospel**
   - Interprets **Law** and **Gospel** through existential categories, not historical or legalistic terms.
   - Seeks to strip away mythological elements to reveal the existential call of the Gospel.
   - Views the Law as representing human self-sufficiency and alienation from God.
   - The Gospel is the call to authentic existence in response to God’s act in Christ.
   - "Demythologizing is interpreting the mythological statements of the New Testament existentially." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter with the Gospel**
   - The Gospel is not a new legal code but a summons to decision and faith.
   - Emphasizes personal appropriation of the Gospel message in the present.
   - The Law exposes human inauthenticity and need for transformation.
   - The Gospel is experienced as liberation from self and openness to God.
   - "Faith is the abandonment of every human security and the readiness to accept the divine gift." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
   - Downplays traditional **forensic** or juridical understandings of Law and Gospel.
   - Focuses on the existential meaning of justification rather than legal imputation.
   - The Law is not merely a set of commands but a revelation of human estrangement.
   - The Gospel is not a legal acquittal but a new mode of being.
   - "Justification by faith means the self-understanding of man as one who is claimed by God." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Kerygma as the Center of the Gospel**
   - The Gospel is the **kerygma**, the proclamation of Christ’s death and resurrection.
   - The Law prepares for the kerygmatic encounter by revealing human need.
   - The distinction is not a doctrinal formula but an existential event in proclamation.
   - The Gospel is effective only as it is proclaimed and received in faith.
   - "The kerygma confronts man with the demand for decision." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

5. **Transformation of Existence**
   - The Law reveals the impossibility of self-justification.
   - The Gospel offers a new existence grounded in faith and openness to God.
   - The distinction is ultimately about the transformation from inauthentic to authentic existence.
   - The Law-Gospel dynamic is existential, not merely historical or doctrinal.
   - "The real meaning of the law is disclosed only in the light of the gospel." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential interpretation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** profoundly shaped 20th-century New Testament scholarship and theology, especially through his emphasis on **demythologization** and the existential call of the Gospel. While his approach diverged sharply from traditional Reformation categories, it influenced later existential and post-liberal theologians. His work remains a touchstone for debates about the relationship between biblical proclamation and human existence. Bultmann’s legacy continues to provoke discussion on the nature of faith, revelation, and the meaning of the Gospel in the modern world.
