# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **covenant theology**. They distinguish the **moral law** as a perpetual rule of righteousness and the **gospel** as the revelation of salvation in Christ, clarifying the roles of both in the believer’s justification and sanctification.

- "The moral law doth forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof." (Westminster Confession of Faith 19.5)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 7, 11, 19)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 91–97)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 39–44)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on preaching and sacraments)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Moral Law’s Perpetual Authority**
    - The **moral law** is rooted in God’s character and binds all people at all times.
    - It is distinct from the **ceremonial** and **judicial laws**, which have been abrogated or expired.
    - The law serves as a rule of life for believers, not as a means of justification.
    - The law continues to reveal sin and drive people to Christ.
    - "Neither doth Christ, in the gospel, any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation." (WCF 19.5)

2. **The Gospel as the Means of Salvation**
    - The **gospel** reveals the only way of salvation through faith in Christ.
    - It is distinct from the law, which cannot give life or righteousness.
    - The gospel offers free grace, not earned by works of the law.
    - The preaching of the gospel is necessary for faith and repentance.
    - "The covenant of grace was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel." (WCF 7.5)

3. **Covenant Theology as the Framework**
    - The Standards distinguish between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**.
    - The law was originally given as a covenant of works to Adam.
    - After the Fall, the gospel is administered through the covenant of grace.
    - The distinction clarifies the different roles of law and gospel in redemptive history.
    - "God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience." (WCF 7.2)

4. **The Law’s Threefold Use**
    - The law convicts of sin and drives sinners to Christ (pedagogical use).
    - It restrains evil in society (civil use).
    - It guides believers in holy living (normative use).
    - The law is not a means of justification but a rule for gratitude.
    - "Although true believers be not under the law, as a covenant of works, to be thereby justified, or condemned; yet it is of great use to them." (WCF 19.6)

5. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is by faith alone, not by works of the law.
    - The law exposes sin but cannot justify; only Christ’s righteousness imputed by faith justifies.
    - Good works are the fruit of faith, not the ground of acceptance.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s work, not law-keeping.
    - "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." (WCF 11.2)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian understandings of the **Law-Gospel distinction**, influencing confessional identity and pastoral practice. Their articulation of **covenant theology** and the proper uses of the law remains foundational for systematic theology and preaching. The Standards’ careful distinctions continue to inform debates on justification, sanctification, and the Christian life within the broader Reformed tradition.
