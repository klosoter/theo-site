# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—articulate a classic **Reformed law-gospel distinction**. They emphasize that the **law** reveals human sin and the need for **justification by faith alone**, while the **gospel** proclaims the free promise of salvation in Christ. This distinction is foundational for understanding the believer's relationship to God's commands and the assurance found in the gospel.

- "Q. 2: How many things must you know to live and die in the joy of this comfort? A. Three: first, how great my sins and misery are; second, how I am delivered from all my sins and misery; third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance." (Heidelberg Catechism)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Questions 2, 3–5, 12–21, 86–115
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 22–24
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Heads of Doctrine I–III/IV
- Lyle D. Bierma, "An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism" (secondary)
- Joel R. Beeke & Sinclair B. Ferguson, "Reformed Confessions Harmonized" (secondary)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law exposes sin and misery**
    - The law is given to reveal the depth of human **sinfulness** and inability to attain righteousness.
    - It functions as a mirror, showing the need for **redemption**.
    - The law convicts and drives sinners to seek deliverance in Christ.
    - This conviction is foundational for understanding the gospel's necessity.
    - "From where do you know your sins and misery? From the law of God." (Heidelberg Catechism Q.3)

2. **Gospel as the promise of grace in Christ**
    - The gospel is distinct from the law, offering the promise of **forgiveness** and **righteousness** through Christ.
    - It proclaims what God has done for sinners, not what sinners must do for God.
    - The gospel is received by faith alone, apart from works of the law.
    - Assurance and comfort flow from the gospel’s objective promises.
    - "What is your only comfort in life and in death? That I am not my own, but belong...to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q.1)

3. **Justification by faith alone, apart from law-keeping**
    - Justification is grounded solely in Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - Human works, even those done after regeneration, cannot contribute to justification.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which Christ’s righteousness is received.
    - The law cannot justify; it only condemns apart from Christ.
    - "We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for Jesus Christ’s sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is implied." (Belgic Confession Art. 23)

4. **Threefold use of the law**
    - The law functions as a mirror (to reveal sin), a civil restraint, and a guide for Christian living.
    - For believers, the law serves as a rule of gratitude, guiding sanctification.
    - The law no longer condemns those in Christ but instructs them in holy living.
    - The distinction between law and gospel is maintained even as the law guides the thankful life.
    - "Since we are redeemed...why must we still do good? Because Christ, having redeemed us...also renews us to be His image." (Heidelberg Catechism Q.86)

5. **Necessity of gratitude and sanctification**
    - Deliverance from the law’s curse leads to a life of gratitude, not antinomianism.
    - Good works are the fruit and evidence of true faith, not the basis of acceptance.
    - The believer’s obedience is motivated by thankfulness for gospel grace.
    - The law, in its third use, shapes the believer’s response to the gospel.
    - "We do good works...so that with our whole life we may show ourselves thankful to God for His blessing." (Heidelberg Catechism Q.86)

## Legacy and Impact

The **law-gospel distinction** articulated in the Three Forms of Unity has profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional identity** and pastoral practice. It safeguards the doctrine of **justification by faith alone** and provides a framework for preaching, catechesis, and assurance. This distinction continues to influence Reformed churches globally, ensuring that the gospel remains central and that the law is rightly used in the life of the believer.
