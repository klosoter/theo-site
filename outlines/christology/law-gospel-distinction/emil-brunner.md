# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner’s understanding of the **Law-Gospel distinction** is rooted in his dialectical theology, emphasizing the existential encounter between God and humanity. He sees **Law** as the divine demand that exposes human sinfulness, and **Gospel** as the message of reconciliation in Christ, insisting that both are necessary for a true understanding of **revelation** and **justification**. Brunner’s approach highlights the relational and personal dimensions of God’s address, rather than a purely forensic or propositional framework.

- "The Law is the divine claim upon man, the Gospel is the divine gift to man." (The Divine Imperative)

## Key Works

- The Divine Imperative (1937)
- Revelation and Reason (1946)
- The Mediator (1934)
- Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God (1946)
- Truth as Encounter (1937)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law as Divine Command**
    - The **Law** represents God’s absolute claim and demand on human life.
    - It reveals human inability to fulfill God’s will, exposing the reality of sin.
    - The Law is not merely ethical but is encountered as a personal address from God.
    - It prepares the way for the reception of the **Gospel** by making human need evident.
    - "The Law is the form in which God’s will confronts man as demand." (The Divine Imperative)

2. **Gospel as Divine Gift**
    - The **Gospel** is the proclamation of God’s grace and reconciliation in Christ.
    - It is not a new law but the announcement of what God has done for humanity.
    - The Gospel liberates from the condemnation of the Law.
    - It is received in faith, not achieved by works or moral effort.
    - "The Gospel is not a new Law, but the end of the Law." (The Divine Imperative)

3. **Dialectical Relationship between Law and Gospel**
    - Law and Gospel are inseparable yet distinct in God’s revelation.
    - The Law drives to despair and the need for salvation; the Gospel brings hope.
    - Both are necessary for a full encounter with God’s Word.
    - The distinction is not chronological but existential, experienced in the present.
    - "Law and Gospel are not two stages, but two aspects of the one Word of God." (The Divine Imperative)

4. **Personal Encounter with Revelation**
    - Revelation is not abstract but a personal encounter with God’s address.
    - The Law-Gospel distinction is experienced in the existential response of the individual.
    - Brunner rejects purely propositional or legalistic understandings of revelation.
    - The Law convicts; the Gospel restores relationship with God.
    - "Revelation is always an encounter, not a communication of truths." (Truth as Encounter)

5. **Critique of Legalism and Antinomianism**
    - Brunner warns against confusing the Gospel with a new set of laws (legalism).
    - He also rejects antinomianism, affirming the ongoing significance of the Law.
    - The Law continues to guide Christian life, but only in the light of the Gospel.
    - The Christian is called to obedience, but as a response to grace, not as a means of merit.
    - "Christian ethics is not a new law, but the life which springs from the Gospel." (The Divine Imperative)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology, especially in the context of **dialectical theology** and existentialist approaches to revelation. His emphasis on the personal and relational aspects of God’s address challenged both liberal moralism and rigid confessionalism. Brunner’s work remains significant for discussions on **revelation**, **justification**, and the nature of Christian ethics, continuing to provoke debate on the proper relationship between divine command and divine gift.
