# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a nuanced **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **covenant theology**, emphasizing both the continuity and discontinuity between the Old and New Testaments. For Calvin, the **Law** reveals human sin and drives sinners to Christ, while the **Gospel** proclaims the promise of salvation in Christ, yet both are united in God's redemptive plan. He maintained that the **moral law** retains abiding significance for the believer, especially in its third use.

- "The law was given, in order to lead us by the hand to Christ." (Institutes 2.7.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book II, chapters 6–11)
- Commentaries on Galatians and Romans
- Sermons on Deuteronomy
- Calvin’s Catechism of the Church of Geneva
- Calvin and the Biblical Languages (ed. T.H.L. Parker)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Threefold Use of the Law**
    - The law convicts of sin (pedagogical use), restrains evil (civil use), and guides believers in godly living (normative use).
    - The third use is especially important for the regenerate, shaping Christian obedience.
    - The law’s accusatory function drives sinners to seek grace in Christ.
    - The law is not abrogated by the Gospel but fulfilled in Christ.
    - "The law is like a mirror in which we behold, first, our impotence; secondly, our iniquity; and, lastly, the consequence of both, our obnoxiousness to the curse." (Institutes 2.7.7)

2. **Unity and Distinction of Law and Gospel**
    - Both Law and Gospel are part of God’s single covenantal purpose.
    - The Law and Gospel differ in function: the Law commands and condemns, the Gospel promises and saves.
    - The substance of the covenant is the same: Christ is the mediator in both.
    - The distinction is not absolute separation but a difference of administration and effect.
    - "The covenant made with all the fathers is so far from differing from ours in reality and substance, that it is altogether one and the same." (Institutes 2.10.2)

3. **Law as Preparation for the Gospel**
    - The Law exposes human sinfulness and incapacity for righteousness.
    - It prepares the heart to receive the grace offered in the Gospel.
    - The Law’s threats and promises point forward to Christ’s fulfillment.
    - The pedagogical use is essential for understanding the need for redemption.
    - "The law was added because of transgressions, that it might make transgressions manifest, and thus compel men to acknowledge their guilt." (Commentary on Galatians 3:19)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Law**
    - Christ perfectly obeys and fulfills the demands of the Law.
    - Believers are justified by faith in Christ, not by works of the Law.
    - The Law’s ceremonial and judicial aspects are abrogated in Christ.
    - The moral law remains as a rule of gratitude for believers.
    - "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." (Romans Commentary)

5. **Abiding Role of the Moral Law**
    - The moral law reflects God’s unchanging character and will.
    - It continues to instruct and sanctify believers.
    - The Spirit enables believers to delight in and obey the law.
    - The law is not contrary to the Gospel but complements it in the life of faith.
    - "The law is not at variance with the Gospel, but is in perfect harmony with it." (Institutes 2.7.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** profoundly shaped Reformed theology, especially in the development of the **threefold use of the law**. His emphasis on the unity of God’s covenant and the abiding significance of the moral law influenced later confessional standards and pastoral practice. Calvin’s careful balance between the convicting role of the Law and the gracious promise of the Gospel continues to inform contemporary discussions on justification, sanctification, and Christian ethics.
