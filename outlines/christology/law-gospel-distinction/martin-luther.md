# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s theology is foundational for the **Law-Gospel distinction**, which he saw as the heart of biblical interpretation and Christian life. He taught that the **Law** reveals human sin and the need for salvation, while the **Gospel** proclaims the free promise of **justification by faith** in Christ alone.

- "The distinction between law and gospel is the highest art in Christendom." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Preface to the New Testament (1522)
- Luther’s Works, Vol. 26: Lectures on Galatians 1535

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel as Distinct Words of God**
    - The **Law** commands and condemns, exposing sin and human inability.
    - The **Gospel** promises forgiveness and life through Christ, apart from works.
    - Confusing Law and Gospel leads to theological and pastoral error.
    - Proper distinction is essential for true **Christian doctrine** and assurance.
    - "Therefore whoever knows well this art of distinguishing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him a doctor of Holy Scripture." (Lectures on Galatians)

2. **Law’s Function to Reveal Sin**
    - The Law shows God’s righteous demands and humanity’s failure.
    - It brings knowledge of sin and drives sinners to despair of self-righteousness.
    - The Law prepares the heart for the Gospel by exposing the need for grace.
    - It cannot justify or give life, only accuse and kill.
    - "The principal point of the Law is to make men not better but worse; that is to say, it shows unto them their sin, that by the knowledge thereof they may be humbled, terrified, bruised, and broken." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Gospel as Promise and Gift**
    - The Gospel is the proclamation of Christ’s work and the free offer of salvation.
    - It is received by faith alone, not by works or merit.
    - The Gospel gives what the Law cannot: righteousness, peace, and new life.
    - It is the central message of Scripture and the church’s true treasure.
    - "The Gospel, however, is a light that illumines the heart and makes it alive." (Heidelberg Disputation)

4. **Simul Justus et Peccator**
    - Believers are simultaneously righteous in Christ and sinners in themselves.
    - The Law continues to accuse, but the Gospel continually absolves.
    - This tension shapes the Christian life and humility before God.
    - Assurance rests not in self, but in Christ’s promise.
    - "To be sure, we are sinners, but Christ is righteous and He is our righteousness." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Hermeneutical Centrality of the Distinction**
    - The Law-Gospel distinction is the key to interpreting Scripture rightly.
    - It guards against moralism and legalism in preaching and teaching.
    - All Scripture contains both Law and Gospel, but they must not be confused.
    - This distinction is vital for pastoral care and the comfort of consciences.
    - "Virtually the whole of the Scriptures and the understanding of the whole of theology—the entire Christian life—depends on the true understanding of the law and the gospel." (Preface to the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s **Law-Gospel distinction** became a cornerstone of Protestant theology, shaping Lutheran and broader Reformation traditions. His insights influenced later confessional documents and provided a framework for understanding **justification by faith** and the role of Scripture. The distinction remains a vital tool for pastoral ministry and biblical interpretation, ensuring the centrality of Christ’s work for sinners. Luther’s approach continues to provoke theological reflection and debate within both Protestant and ecumenical contexts.
