# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **Law-Gospel distinction** through the lens of **Reformed covenant theology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the unity of **God’s revelation** in both Law and Gospel, while maintaining their distinct functions within the unfolding of **redemptive history**. For Van Til, the Law-Gospel distinction must be understood within the context of the **covenant of grace** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief.

- "The law and the gospel are not to be separated, but neither are they to be confused." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel in Covenant Context**
   - Law and Gospel are unified within the overarching **covenant of grace**.
   - The Law reveals God’s righteous standard and humanity’s need for redemption.
   - The Gospel fulfills the Law’s demands through Christ’s atoning work.
   - The distinction is not a separation but a redemptive-historical progression.
   - "The law is not contrary to the gospel, but the gospel is the fulfillment of the law." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Antithesis between Belief and Unbelief**
   - The Law-Gospel distinction is sharpened by the antithesis between the regenerate and unregenerate.
   - Unbelievers suppress the truth of both Law and Gospel.
   - Only through **regeneration** can one rightly understand the Law’s condemnation and the Gospel’s promise.
   - The distinction is epistemological as well as soteriological.
   - "The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, whether law or gospel." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Organic Unity of Revelation**
   - Law and Gospel are organically related within the single, unified revelation of God.
   - Both serve God’s redemptive purposes and are not in ultimate tension.
   - The Law prepares for the Gospel; the Gospel upholds the Law.
   - The unity of Scripture is foundational for understanding their relationship.
   - "There is no ultimate dualism in Scripture; law and gospel are parts of one revelation." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
   - The Law-Gospel distinction unfolds progressively in redemptive history.
   - The Law’s pedagogical role points forward to Christ.
   - The Gospel is the climax of God’s redemptive acts in history.
   - The distinction must be interpreted in light of biblical theology.
   - "The history of redemption is the history of the relation of law and gospel." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Presuppositional Approach to Law and Gospel**
   - The proper understanding of Law and Gospel presupposes the truth of the Christian worldview.
   - Apologetics must defend both Law and Gospel as inseparable aspects of God’s revelation.
   - The unbeliever’s rejection of Law and Gospel is rooted in autonomous reasoning.
   - The Law-Gospel distinction is intelligible only within the framework of **Reformed presuppositionalism**.
   - "We must presuppose the truth of both law and gospel in all our reasoning." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s approach to the **Law-Gospel distinction** has shaped Reformed apologetics and systematic theology by insisting on the unity of **covenant revelation** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief. His emphasis on the organic relationship between Law and Gospel continues to influence discussions on **biblical theology** and the interpretation of redemptive history. Van Til’s presuppositional method has provided a distinctive framework for defending the coherence and necessity of the Law-Gospel distinction within a robustly Reformed worldview.
