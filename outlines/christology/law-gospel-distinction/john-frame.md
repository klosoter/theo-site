# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the **Law-Gospel distinction** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity of **God’s revelation** while recognizing legitimate distinctions within **biblical covenants**. He is critical of sharp dichotomies between **Law and Gospel**, instead advocating for a redemptive-historical approach that sees both as expressions of God’s one covenantal relationship with his people.

- "The law and the gospel are not two separate messages, but two aspects of the one message of Scripture." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord
- The Doctrine of God
- Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
- "Law and Gospel" (in Contemporary Worship Music: A Biblical Defense)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Triperspectival Approach to Law and Gospel**
   - Law and Gospel are understood through the normative, situational, and existential perspectives.
   - Each perspective reveals different aspects of God’s will and grace.
   - The unity of God’s revelation precludes absolute separation between Law and Gospel.
   - This approach seeks to honor the complexity and richness of biblical teaching.
   - "We must see law and gospel as perspectives on the one message of God’s grace." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

2. **Continuity of Covenant Revelation**
   - Frame emphasizes the continuity between Old and New Testament covenants.
   - Both Law and Gospel are rooted in God’s covenantal dealings with his people.
   - The Law points to Christ and is fulfilled in the Gospel.
   - The Gospel does not abolish the Law but brings its true intent to fulfillment.
   - "The gospel fulfills the law, not by abolishing it, but by bringing its purposes to completion in Christ." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Critique of Sharp Law-Gospel Dichotomy**
   - Frame warns against radical separation of Law and Gospel.
   - He argues such dichotomies can distort the biblical message.
   - Both Law and Gospel reveal God’s character and redemptive plan.
   - The distinction is real but must not undermine their unity.
   - "A sharp dichotomy between law and gospel is not faithful to the biblical text." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

4. **Ethical Function of the Law in the Christian Life**
   - The Law continues to guide believers in sanctification.
   - Frame affirms the third use of the Law as a rule of life for Christians.
   - The Gospel empowers obedience to the Law.
   - Law and Gospel together shape Christian ethics and discipleship.
   - "The law, rightly understood, is a gracious gift to God’s people." (The Doctrine of the Christian Life)

5. **Christocentric Fulfillment of Law and Gospel**
   - Jesus Christ is the center and fulfillment of both Law and Gospel.
   - All Scripture points to Christ’s redemptive work.
   - The Law’s demands are met in Christ’s obedience and atoning death.
   - The Gospel proclaims the benefits of Christ’s fulfillment to believers.
   - "Christ is the one in whom law and gospel meet and are fulfilled." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s nuanced approach to the **Law-Gospel distinction** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology, especially among those seeking to avoid false dichotomies in biblical interpretation. His **triperspectivalism** offers a flexible yet robust framework for understanding the unity of God’s revelation. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on covenant theology, ethics, and the relationship between Old and New Testaments within evangelical and Reformed circles.
