# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian whose understanding of the **Law-Gospel distinction** is shaped by a strong emphasis on **redemptive history** and **union with Christ**. He insists that the relationship between Law and Gospel must be interpreted within the unfolding of **covenant history**, highlighting the inseparability of **justification** and **sanctification** in the believer’s participation in Christ’s work.

- "The law-gospel contrast is not a contrast between the Old and New Testaments, but between two ways of seeking acceptance before God." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- Perspectives on Pentecost: New Testament Teaching on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Theonomy and Eschatology: Some Reflections on Postmillennialism" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Justification and Eschatology" in Justification: What’s at Stake in the Current Debates?

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law-Gospel Distinction as Redemptive-Historical**
    - The distinction unfolds within the progress of **redemptive history**, not as a static doctrinal formula.
    - Both Law and Gospel are present in both Testaments, but their relationship is clarified in Christ.
    - The Mosaic Law’s function is tied to the history of **covenant** and its fulfillment in Christ.
    - The Gospel is the announcement of what God has accomplished in Christ, not merely a new law.
    "The contrast between law and gospel is fundamentally a contrast between two epochs in the history of redemption." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Union with Christ Central to Law and Gospel**
    - **Union with Christ** is the context in which both justification and sanctification are received.
    - The believer’s relationship to the Law is transformed through participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.
    - Law condemns outside of Christ, but in Christ, the Law’s demands are fulfilled.
    - The Gospel unites the believer to Christ, securing both pardon and new obedience.
    "All the benefits of salvation flow from union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Justification and Sanctification Inseparable**
    - Justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of **salvation**.
    - The Law’s condemning power is broken in justification, but its directive role continues in sanctification.
    - The Gospel does not abolish the Law but reorients the believer’s relationship to it.
    - Assurance and growth in holiness are grounded in the same union with Christ.
    "Justification and sanctification are not to be separated, but neither are they to be confused." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Critique of Overly Sharp Law-Gospel Dichotomies**
    - Warns against reading the Law-Gospel distinction as a strict antithesis between Old and New Testaments.
    - Emphasizes continuity of God’s **redemptive purpose** across the covenants.
    - The Law is not merely negative; it also reveals God’s will for redeemed living.
    - The Gospel does not set aside the Law’s ethical demands but empowers their fulfillment.
    "The law is not the antithesis of the gospel, but its necessary corollary." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment of Law and Gospel**
    - The Law-Gospel distinction is ultimately resolved in the eschatological work of Christ.
    - The Law points forward to the consummation realized in Christ’s resurrection and return.
    - The believer’s present experience of salvation is an anticipation of final vindication.
    - The Law’s demands are fully met in the glorified life to come.
    "Eschatology is essential for understanding the relationship between law and gospel." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s nuanced approach to the **Law-Gospel distinction** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in debates over justification, sanctification, and covenant. His emphasis on **union with Christ** and redemptive-historical interpretation has influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond. Gaffin’s work continues to serve as a corrective to both antinomian and legalistic tendencies within the church, grounding the Law-Gospel distinction in the unfolding drama of redemption.
