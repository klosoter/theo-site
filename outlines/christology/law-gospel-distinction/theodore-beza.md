# Theodore Beza (1519–1605)

Theodore Beza was a leading Reformed theologian who gave systematic shape to the **Law-Gospel distinction** within the context of **covenant theology**. He emphasized the sharp contrast between the **demands of the Law** and the **promise of the Gospel**, insisting that justification comes by faith alone apart from works of the Law. Beza’s articulation of this distinction influenced later Reformed orthodoxy and clarified the role of the Law in both convicting of sin and driving believers to Christ.

- "The law commands and requires perfect obedience, but the gospel promises freely the remission of sins to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Totius Christianismi)

## Key Works

- Summa Totius Christianismi (1555)
- Confessio Christianae Fidei (1560)
- Tractationes Theologicae (various, esp. on justification and covenant)
- Correspondence with Lutheran and Reformed theologians (selected letters)
- Secondary: Jill Raitt, The Colloquy of Poissy; Richard Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Law-Gospel Antithesis**
    - The Law reveals God’s perfect righteousness and humanity’s inability to fulfill it.
    - The Gospel offers **free justification** through Christ apart from works.
    - The two must not be confused, lest assurance of salvation be undermined.
    - The Law convicts of sin, while the Gospel brings comfort and life.
    - "The law shows us our sin and condemns us, but the gospel reveals Christ and justifies us." (Summa Totius Christianismi)

2. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - Adam was placed under a **covenant of works** requiring perfect obedience.
    - After the Fall, God established the **covenant of grace** promising salvation through faith in Christ.
    - The Law is tied to the first covenant; the Gospel to the second.
    - This framework clarifies the historical and theological distinction between Law and Gospel.
    - "God made a covenant with Adam, but after his fall, He made a new covenant in Christ." (Confessio Christianae Fidei)

3. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is grounded in Christ’s righteousness, not human merit.
    - The Law cannot justify; it only exposes guilt.
    - The Gospel alone offers the righteousness imputed to believers.
    - Assurance rests on the promise of the Gospel, not on Law-keeping.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, without the works of the law." (Confessio Christianae Fidei)

4. **Third Use of the Law**
    - The Law continues to guide believers in sanctification after justification.
    - It no longer condemns but instructs in gratitude.
    - The Law’s role is subordinate to the Gospel in the Christian life.
    - Obedience flows from faith, not as a means of earning favor.
    - "The law is a rule of life for the faithful, but not a means of justification." (Tractationes Theologicae)

5. **Pastoral Application of Law and Gospel**
    - Proper preaching distinguishes Law and Gospel for the comfort of consciences.
    - The Law is used to humble, the Gospel to lift up.
    - Assurance and repentance are fostered by rightly dividing the two.
    - Confusion leads to legalism or antinomianism.
    - "The distinction between law and gospel is necessary for the peace of consciences." (Summa Totius Christianismi)

## Legacy and Impact

Beza’s rigorous articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** became foundational for later Reformed confessions and scholastic theology. His covenantal framework shaped the development of **federal theology** and influenced generations of Protestant preachers and theologians. By clarifying the distinct roles of Law and Gospel, Beza helped secure the doctrine of justification by faith alone and provided a lasting model for pastoral ministry within the Reformed tradition.
