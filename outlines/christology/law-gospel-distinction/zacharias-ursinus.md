# Zacharias Ursinus (1534–1583)

Zacharias Ursinus, principal author of the **Heidelberg Catechism**, offered a classic Reformed articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction**. He taught that the **Law** exposes sin and God's righteous demands, while the **Gospel** proclaims **justification** by faith in Christ apart from works, shaping his understanding of **covenant theology** and the use of **Scripture** in the Christian life.

- "The law is a knowledge of sin, and of the wrath of God; but the gospel is a knowledge of grace, and of the remission of sins." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel as Distinct Words of God**
    - The **Law** and **Gospel** are two fundamentally different modes of divine revelation.
    - The Law commands and condemns, while the Gospel promises and comforts.
    - Mixing Law and Gospel confuses the doctrines of **justification** and assurance.
    - Proper distinction is essential for understanding the Christian life.
    "The law is that part of the divine word which commands men to perfect obedience...the gospel is the doctrine concerning Christ." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

2. **The Law Reveals Sin and Condemnation**
    - The Law exposes human inability to fulfill God's demands.
    - It serves as a mirror, showing the depth of human depravity.
    - The Law drives sinners to despair of self-righteousness.
    - Its ultimate purpose is to prepare the heart for the Gospel.
    "The law is a knowledge of sin, and of the wrath of God." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

3. **The Gospel Announces Free Justification**
    - The Gospel proclaims forgiveness and righteousness through Christ alone.
    - **Justification** is received by faith, not by works of the Law.
    - The Gospel is the means by which the Spirit creates and sustains faith.
    - Assurance of salvation rests on the Gospel, not on Law-keeping.
    "The gospel is a knowledge of grace, and of the remission of sins." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

4. **Covenantal Structure: Law in Both Covenants, Gospel in the New**
    - The Law is present in both the **Covenant of Works** and the **Covenant of Grace**.
    - Under the Covenant of Works, the Law promised life for perfect obedience.
    - In the Covenant of Grace, the Gospel offers life through Christ's obedience.
    - The Law retains a role for believers, but not as a means of justification.
    "The law is natural, and known by nature; the gospel is revealed from heaven." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

5. **Pedagogical Use of the Law for Believers**
    - The Law continues to instruct believers in gratitude and obedience.
    - It guides Christian living, but does not threaten condemnation.
    - The Law's demands drive believers to continual reliance on the Gospel.
    - The Law and Gospel together shape the life of repentance and faith.
    "The law teaches what we ought to be; the gospel teaches what we ought to believe." (Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism)

## Legacy and Impact

Ursinus's articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** became foundational for Reformed catechesis and preaching, especially through the enduring influence of the **Heidelberg Catechism**. His careful separation of Law and Gospel shaped later Reformed and Lutheran discussions, providing clarity on **justification by faith alone**. Ursinus’s legacy endures in Reformed confessional documents and in ongoing debates about the role of the Law in the Christian life.
