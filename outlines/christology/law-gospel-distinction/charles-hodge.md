# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge articulated a classic **Reformed law-gospel distinction**, emphasizing the enduring moral authority of the **moral law** while upholding the sufficiency of the **gospel** for justification. He maintained that the **law** reveals human sinfulness and the need for **grace**, while the **gospel** proclaims the means of salvation through **Christ’s atonement**.

- "The law, therefore, as a rule of duty, is not set aside by the gospel." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law as a Reflection of God’s Moral Character**
    - The **moral law** is rooted in the unchanging character of God.
    - The law’s demands are universal and perpetual for all humanity.
    - The law exposes sin and points to the need for redemption.
    - The law remains binding as a rule of life for believers.
    - "The law is a transcript of the moral perfections of God." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Law and Gospel Serve Distinct Functions**
    - The law reveals sin and the impossibility of self-justification.
    - The gospel offers the promise of **justification by faith** in Christ.
    - Law and gospel are not opposed but serve complementary roles in salvation.
    - The distinction safeguards the doctrine of **grace**.
    - "The law condemns; the gospel justifies." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is grounded solely in the work of Christ, not in law-keeping.
    - The law cannot provide righteousness; it drives sinners to Christ.
    - Faith receives the righteousness of Christ as imputed to the believer.
    - Assurance rests on the sufficiency of Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - "The gospel is the revelation of the method of justification." (Systematic Theology)

4. **The Law’s Threefold Division**
    - Hodge affirms the traditional distinction between **moral, ceremonial, and civil law**.
    - The ceremonial and civil laws are abrogated in Christ.
    - The moral law remains as the abiding standard for Christian conduct.
    - This division clarifies the believer’s relationship to the Old Testament law.
    - "The ceremonial law was fulfilled in Christ and is no longer binding." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Sanctification and the Law**
    - The law guides believers in sanctification after justification.
    - Obedience to the law is the fruit, not the ground, of salvation.
    - The Spirit enables believers to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law.
    - The law’s role in sanctification preserves the necessity of holiness.
    - "Sanctification is the fruit of justification, and the law is its rule." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **law-gospel distinction** became foundational for later Reformed theology, especially in American Presbyterianism. His careful balance of the law’s enduring moral authority with the gospel’s exclusive power to justify influenced generations of pastors and theologians. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed emphasis on the proper distinction and relationship between law and gospel in preaching, teaching, and Christian living.
