# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **Law-Gospel distinction** through the lens of his overarching concern for **revelation in history** and the unity of **God’s self-disclosure**. He critiqued sharp dichotomies between **Law** and **Gospel**, emphasizing their integration within the unfolding of **salvation history** and the eschatological fulfillment in Christ. For Pannenberg, the Law is not merely negated by the Gospel but finds its true meaning and completion in the **revelatory event** of Jesus Christ.

- "The law is not abolished by the gospel but fulfilled in the new life that the gospel brings." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

- Anthropology in Theological Perspective
- Basic Questions in Theology, Vol. 1

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Revelation as Historical Event**
   - Revelation unfolds in the course of universal history, not as isolated propositions.
   - The distinction between Law and Gospel must be understood within the movement of **salvation history**.
   - Both Law and Gospel are modes of God’s self-revelation, culminating in Christ.
   - The Law prepares for the Gospel by revealing human need and pointing to fulfillment.
   - "The revelation of God is not a timeless truth but an event in history." (Revelation as History)

2. **Unity of Law and Gospel in Christ**
   - Christ is the center where Law and Gospel converge and are reinterpreted.
   - The Law’s demands are not simply set aside but are fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
   - The Gospel does not abolish the Law but brings its true intention to realization.
   - The eschatological work of Christ integrates judgment (Law) and grace (Gospel).
   - "In Christ, the law is not simply negated but fulfilled and transcended." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Critique of Antinomianism**
   - Pannenberg rejects any view that the Gospel renders the Law irrelevant.
   - The Law retains a positive, guiding function for Christian ethics.
   - The Gospel empowers believers to live out the Law’s intent through the Spirit.
   - The Law is reinterpreted in light of the new creation inaugurated by Christ.
   - "The gospel does not free us from the law but from the law’s condemnation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
   - The Law points forward to its fulfillment in the eschaton.
   - The Gospel is the announcement of that fulfillment already begun in Christ.
   - The distinction between Law and Gospel is provisional, awaiting final consummation.
   - The church lives in the tension of the ‘already’ and ‘not yet’ of Law and Gospel.
   - "The eschatological fulfillment of the law is the work of the Spirit in the community of Christ." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Anthropological Dimension**
   - The Law exposes human sin and the need for redemption.
   - The Gospel addresses the existential plight revealed by the Law.
   - Human identity is shaped by both the demands of the Law and the promise of the Gospel.
   - The Law-Gospel dynamic is essential for understanding human freedom and responsibility.
   - "Only in the light of the gospel does the law’s true function become clear." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s nuanced approach to the **Law-Gospel distinction** has influenced contemporary discussions on **revelation**, **salvation history**, and the integration of biblical categories within systematic theology. His insistence on the unity of God’s self-disclosure in Christ challenged both Lutheran and Reformed traditions to reconsider the relationship between Law and Gospel. Pannenberg’s work continues to shape ecumenical dialogue and the development of a historically grounded, Christocentric theology.
