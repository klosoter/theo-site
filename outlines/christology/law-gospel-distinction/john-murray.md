# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray approached the **Law-Gospel distinction** with careful nuance, emphasizing the unity of the **covenant of grace** while maintaining the distinct roles of **law** and **gospel** in the application of redemption. He rejected both antinomianism and legalism, insisting that the **moral law** retains abiding validity for the believer, even as justification rests solely on the **grace of God in Christ**.

- "The law is not the gospel, and the gospel is not the law; but the gospel is not lawless, nor the law gospelless." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Principles of Conduct (1957)
- Redemption: Accomplished and Applied (1955)
- The Covenant of Grace (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT, 1959–65)
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel are distinct but inseparable**
    - The **law** reveals God's righteous standard and exposes human sinfulness.
    - The **gospel** proclaims deliverance from sin and condemnation through Christ.
    - Both law and gospel function within the **covenant of grace**.
    - The distinction is necessary to avoid confusion of justification and sanctification.
    - "The law is not the gospel, but the gospel does not abrogate the law." (Principles of Conduct)

2. **The moral law’s abiding validity**
    - The **moral law** continues to bind all people, including believers.
    - Christ fulfills but does not abolish the law; its demands are met in Him.
    - The law serves as a guide for Christian conduct post-justification.
    - The believer’s obedience is a fruit of grace, not a means of justification.
    - "The law remains the standard of holiness for the believer." (Principles of Conduct)

3. **Justification by grace alone, apart from works**
    - Justification is grounded solely in the **imputed righteousness of Christ**.
    - Human works, even those enabled by grace, do not contribute to justification.
    - The law convicts and drives sinners to Christ, but cannot justify.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not law-keeping.
    - "Justification is by grace through faith, wholly apart from works of law." (Redemption: Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Sanctification involves law-keeping empowered by the Spirit**
    - Sanctification is distinct from justification but inseparable from it.
    - The Spirit enables believers to fulfill the righteous requirements of the law.
    - Obedience is the evidence, not the ground, of saving faith.
    - The law is a rule of life for those united to Christ.
    - "The law is established in the life of the believer by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Principles of Conduct)

5. **Covenantal unity of law and gospel**
    - Both law and gospel operate within the overarching **covenant of grace**.
    - The Mosaic law is not a republication of the covenant of works, but an administration of grace.
    - The promises and demands of the covenant are fulfilled in Christ.
    - The unity of redemptive history is maintained without collapsing law into gospel.
    - "The law given at Sinai was an administration of the covenant of grace." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to the relationship between justification, sanctification, and the moral law. His insistence on the abiding validity of the law, alongside the sufficiency of grace in Christ, has influenced generations of pastors and theologians. Murray’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking a balanced, covenantal understanding of law and gospel within the Reformed tradition.
