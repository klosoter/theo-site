# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a nuanced **Law-Gospel distinction** rooted in the unity of **redemptive history** and the continuity of **covenant theology**. While affirming the distinct roles of **Law** (as demand and condemnation) and **Gospel** (as promise and grace), Bavinck emphasized their inseparability within the unfolding of **God’s revelation** and the life of the believer.

- "The law is not opposed to the gospel, but is, on the contrary, the presupposition of the gospel." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.452)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law and Gospel as Distinct but United in Redemptive History**
    - Law and Gospel are not two competing principles but function together in God’s plan.
    - The Law reveals **God’s righteousness** and humanity’s need for redemption.
    - The Gospel fulfills the Law’s demands through **Christ’s atoning work**.
    - Both are essential in the administration of the **covenant of grace**.
    - "Law and gospel are not two dispensations but two words of God that run through all of Scripture." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.452)

2. **The Law’s Threefold Use**
    - The Law serves a civil, pedagogical, and normative function.
    - It restrains evil in society (civil use).
    - It exposes sin and drives sinners to Christ (pedagogical use).
    - It guides believers in gratitude after salvation (normative use).
    - "The law remains of great significance for the Christian life." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.453)

3. **Covenantal Context of Law and Gospel**
    - Law and Gospel are administered within the framework of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The Mosaic Law is not a republication of the covenant of works but serves the covenant of grace.
    - The unity of the covenants underscores the continuity of God’s redemptive purpose.
    - The Law is transformed by the Gospel, not abolished.
    - "The law is not the antithesis but the presupposition of the gospel." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.452)

4. **Christ as the Fulfillment of the Law**
    - Christ perfectly obeys and fulfills the Law’s demands.
    - The Gospel proclaims Christ’s righteousness imputed to believers.
    - The believer’s relationship to the Law is transformed in union with Christ.
    - The Law’s curse is removed, but its moral guidance remains.
    - "Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.223)

5. **Pastoral Implications for Assurance and Sanctification**
    - The Law convicts of sin but cannot provide assurance.
    - Assurance and comfort are found in the Gospel’s promise.
    - The Law guides sanctification as a rule of gratitude.
    - The believer’s obedience is a response to grace, not a means of merit.
    - "The gospel alone brings peace to the conscience." (Reformed Dogmatics, 4.454)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s balanced articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** has shaped modern Reformed theology’s approach to **covenant theology** and the doctrine of salvation. His insistence on the unity of God’s revelation and the ongoing relevance of the Law for Christian ethics continues to influence both academic and pastoral contexts. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between **justification** and **sanctification** within the Reformed tradition.
