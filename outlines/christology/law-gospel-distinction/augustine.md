# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s understanding of the **Law-Gospel distinction** is foundational for later Western theology, though he does not sharply separate the two as in later Protestant thought. He sees the **Law** as revealing human sin and the need for **grace**, while the **Gospel** provides the means of **salvation** through **Christ** and the **gift of the Spirit**. For Augustine, the Law prepares the way for the Gospel by exposing human inability and pointing to the necessity of divine intervention.

- "The law was given that grace might be sought; and grace was given that the law might be fulfilled." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Key Works

- On the Spirit and the Letter (De Spiritu et Littera)
- Confessions
- City of God (De Civitate Dei)
- Sermons on Selected Lessons of the New Testament
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law reveals sin and human inability**
    - The Law exposes the depth of human sinfulness and the inability to achieve righteousness by works.
    - It serves as a mirror, showing the need for **divine grace**.
    - Augustine interprets the Law as preparatory, not salvific in itself.
    - The Law’s demands highlight the necessity of **regeneration**.
    - "The law was given, not that it might justify, but that it might convict and make the soul sick, so that it might seek the physician." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

2. **Grace enables fulfillment of the Law**
    - Only through the **Holy Spirit** can the Law’s requirements be met.
    - **Grace** transforms the will, enabling obedience that was previously impossible.
    - The Gospel brings the power to fulfill what the Law commands.
    - Augustine emphasizes the internal renewal over external observance.
    - "What the law enjoins by threatening, grace bestows by faith." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

3. **Continuity and distinction between Old and New Covenants**
    - Augustine sees a unity of **salvation history**, with the Law and Gospel serving different roles.
    - The Old Covenant prefigures and anticipates the New.
    - The Law is not abolished but fulfilled in Christ and the Gospel.
    - The distinction lies in the mode of administration, not in the ultimate goal of union with God.
    - "The Old Testament is revealed in the New, the New is hidden in the Old." (Questions on the Heptateuch)

4. **Role of the Spirit in the New Covenant**
    - The **Spirit** is the agent who writes the Law on the heart.
    - The Gospel brings the Spirit, who empowers true obedience.
    - The external letter kills, but the internal Spirit gives life.
    - The Spirit’s work is essential for moving from Law to Gospel.
    - "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

5. **Christ as the fulfillment of Law and Gospel**
    - Christ embodies both the demands of the Law and the promises of the Gospel.
    - In Christ, the curse of the Law is removed and its righteousness fulfilled.
    - Faith in Christ is the means by which believers receive the benefits of the Gospel.
    - The Law points to Christ, who alone enables its true fulfillment.
    - "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His own Son." (On the Spirit and the Letter)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** profoundly shaped Western Christian thought, especially in his emphasis on **grace** and the inability of human effort to achieve righteousness. His insights laid groundwork for later developments in **Reformed** and **Lutheran** theology, even as his distinction was less sharply drawn than in the Reformation. Augustine’s integration of **salvation history** and his focus on the work of the **Spirit** continue to influence theological discussions on the relationship between Law and Gospel.
