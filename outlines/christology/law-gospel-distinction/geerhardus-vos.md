# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated the **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **redemptive history**, emphasizing the unfolding of **covenant theology** across Scripture. He maintained that the **Law** reveals God's righteous standard and the need for a mediator, while the **Gospel** proclaims the fulfillment of that standard in Christ, culminating in the **covenant of grace**.

- "The law is not opposed to the promise, but it is preparatory to it." (Biblical Theology)

- The Pauline Eschatology
- Reformed Dogmatics
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (article)
- "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Love of God" (article)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law as Preparatory to Gospel**
    - The **Law** serves to reveal sin and humanity’s inability to achieve righteousness.
    - It functions as a **pedagogue** leading to Christ and the need for redemption.
    - The Mosaic covenant is not a republication of the covenant of works but has a preparatory function.
    - The Law’s demands highlight the necessity of the **Gospel** promise.
    - "The law prepares negatively by awakening the consciousness of sin and positively by foreshadowing the coming salvation." (Biblical Theology)

2. **Organic Unity of Redemptive History**
    - The distinction between Law and Gospel is not absolute but unfolds within a single redemptive plan.
    - **Covenant theology** ties the Law and Gospel together in the history of salvation.
    - The Law is not abolished but fulfilled in the Gospel.
    - Both Law and Gospel serve God’s unified purpose in Christ.
    - "The law and the gospel are organically connected in the progress of revelation." (Biblical Theology)

3. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of works** under Adam sets the stage for the later covenant of grace.
    - The Law reflects the original demands of the covenant of works.
    - The **covenant of grace** is the sphere in which the Gospel is proclaimed and received.
    - Christ fulfills the Law’s requirements on behalf of the elect.
    - "The gospel is the revelation of the covenant of grace, which presupposes the covenant of works." (Reformed Dogmatics)

4. **Pauline Theology of Law and Gospel**
    - Vos draws heavily on Paul’s epistles to articulate the Law-Gospel distinction.
    - The Law exposes sin and points to the necessity of justification by faith.
    - The Gospel announces the righteousness of God apart from the Law.
    - Paul’s theology underscores the eschatological fulfillment of the Law in Christ.
    - "Paul’s doctrine of the law is inseparable from his doctrine of the gospel." (The Pauline Eschatology)

5. **Typology and the Law-Gospel Relationship**
    - The Law contains **types and shadows** that anticipate the Gospel realities.
    - Ceremonial aspects of the Law prefigure Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The Law’s typology is fulfilled and transcended in the Gospel.
    - The movement from type to antitype is central to understanding redemptive history.
    - "The typical is the bridge from law to gospel in the unfolding of redemption." (Biblical Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** profoundly shaped modern Reformed biblical theology, especially through his emphasis on **redemptive-historical** interpretation. His work provided a robust framework for understanding the unity and diversity of Scripture, influencing generations of theologians at Westminster and beyond. Vos’s nuanced approach continues to inform contemporary discussions on covenant theology and the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
