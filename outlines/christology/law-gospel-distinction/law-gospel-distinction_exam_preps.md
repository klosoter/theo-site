### ESSAY
The topic of the **law–gospel distinction** forces a candidate to stand at the intersection of exegesis, covenant theology, justification, sanctification, and the doctrine of Scripture’s unity. Law and gospel are not simply two piles of biblical texts sorted into threatening and comforting passages. They are two distinct modes of God’s one saving address: the word that commands, promises life upon perfect obedience, and condemns sinners; and the word that gives Christ and righteousness freely to the ungodly by faith alone. The crucial question is whether one can articulate this distinction robustly enough to safeguard justification by faith alone without dissolving the unity of God’s will, the abiding normativity of the **moral law**, or the necessity of Spirit-wrought obedience.

Martin Luther is the unavoidable starting point, because he reconfigured the entire soteriological landscape around **law and gospel**. His late medieval context was Roman Catholic sacramental and penitential theology in which “gospel” could be defined as the new law of Christ, enabling charity and thereby justifying, and “law” as only the Mosaic code now transcended by evangelical counsels. Luther’s own spiritual crisis under the demands of a righteous God drove him to a reading of Romans and Galatians where “law” denoted God’s demand for perfect righteousness, exposing sin and wrath, while “gospel” denoted the unconditional promise that Christ himself is our righteousness. The debate with Rome at Trent confirms how radical this was: the Roman canons deny that justifying righteousness is imputed alone through faith, insist that the new law of the gospel cooperates with infused grace, and refuse a sharp formal distinction between law and gospel.

For Luther, especially visible in his Galatians commentary and various sermons, the law’s primary theological function is accusatory. It reveals sin, increases trespass, shuts every mouth. The gospel, on the other hand, is a word that has no demands to be met but only a gift to be received, Christ clothed in the promise. He can therefore speak of the Christian as “outside of law” regarding justification, because before God’s judgment seat he clings only to the alien righteousness of Christ. Examiners will press whether this formulation undermines the positive, guiding function of the moral law. The Lutheran confessional tradition itself partially responds with the classic threefold division: civil use to restrain sin, theological use to convict and drive to Christ, and didactic use to guide the regenerate. Yet Luther’s own rhetoric often marginalizes the third use, giving rise to later Lutheran debates over whether the law guides the justified or only continues to accuse them. This pressure point is precisely where the Reformed tradition both appropriates and corrects Luther.

John Calvin stands as the central Reformed architect, integrating **law–gospel distinction** into a broader conceptual structure of **covenant**, **union with Christ**, and the threefold division of the law. For Calvin, as for Luther, law in its strict sense confronts the sinner with God’s justice and demands perfect obedience for life. He agrees that, at the level of justification, law and gospel are antithetical: to be justified by works is to be justified by law, to be justified by faith is to receive Christ with empty hands. Yet Calvin refuses to allow this antithesis to turn into a metaphysical dualism in God or Scripture. The same God who commands perfectly in the law gives perfectly in the gospel. The Decalogue, for Calvin, expresses the eternal, unchanging **natural law** written on the heart, now codified for a redeemed people. That law never ceases to bind creatures as creatures. What shifts in the economy of salvation is not God’s will but our relation to the law in Christ.

Calvin’s carefully ordered treatment of the law in the Institutes shows this integration. He expounds the Decalogue as the sum of the moral law, insists that its demands reveal our incapacity and drive us to Christ, but then insists that the “principal use” of the law for believers is as a rule of life. Here he decisively affirms a robust third use of the law. The believer, justified by the **gospel** that proclaims the finished work of Christ alone, now delights in the same law that once condemned, because in union with the crucified and risen Lord he is no longer under the law as a covenant of works but under grace. Examiners often challenge: does this not collapse law and gospel back together, undermining the Reformational breakthrough? The Reformed answer, pioneered by Calvin and systematized later, is that the distinction of law and gospel is not primarily about two entirely separate textual corpuses nor about two different gods or wills, but about two different legal relations or “covenants” in which the same moral content functions.

This leads naturally to the Reformed scholastic and **federal theology** of Francis Turretin and Herman Witsius, who both take up Calvin’s insights and sharpen them into a covenantal grammar of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. Turretin, in his Institutes of Elenctic Theology, treats the law–gospel distinction explicitly in the context of the doctrines of Scripture and the law. He is at pains to deny that law and gospel are two contrary doctrines in the sense of dogmata opposed within Scripture. Instead, they are two complementary modes of the one doctrine of salvation. Law is that part of the doctrine that teaches what God requires of us as the condition of life, promising life only upon perfect obedience and threatening death upon any transgression. Gospel is that part that teaches what God has done in Christ, gratuitously, to secure that obedience and satisfy that threat on behalf of his people, offering life to them solely by faith. Turretin will insist that if this distinction is denied or softened into a mere pedagogical difference of degrees, the whole fabric of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ collapses into some form of Rome’s teaching where the gospel becomes a softer, grace-enabled law.

At the same time, Turretin, in continuity with much of the Reformed tradition, structures this distinction within the broader architectonic of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. The law, as covenant of works, is the original arrangement in Adam: do this and you shall live. That covenant is not identical with Sinai, but Sinai republishes aspects of it, both to expose sin and to typologically point to Christ. The gospel, as covenant of grace, is the postlapsarian divine arrangement in which God grants in Christ what he demands, so that life is now promised on the basis of the obedience of another, received by faith. Examiners will often test the candidate by asking whether this makes the Mosaic law a legalistic intrusion or falls into dispensational fragmentation. Turretin’s answer, and the classical Reformed answer, is that there is one covenant of grace through all redemptive history, but it operates through different administrations. The legal aspect at Sinai serves a redemptive-historical function to drive Israel to the promised Messiah, not to offer an alternative way of life by their own obedience.

Herman Witsius, in The Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man, develops this same architecture but with more pastoral sensitivity to antinomian and neonomian controversies of his day. He insists that the **law–gospel distinction** is real and essential for preserving the gratuity of grace, yet equally insists that the **moral law** as a rule of life remains in full force for believers. Against antinomians, he argues that to say we are not under the law as a covenant is not to say we are not under law as a rule. Against neonomians, such as Richard Baxter’s more moralistic strands, he argues that to speak of conditions in the covenant of grace is not to turn the gospel into a new law whose milder demands secure our title to life. Faith is the sole instrument, not a work; obedience is the necessary fruit, not a co-instrumental cause. Here Witsius displays the Reformed instinct that the law–gospel distinction belongs formally to the order of justification and assurance, but materially the same Christ who is offered in the gospel writes the law on the heart in the new covenant, fulfilling the prophetic promise of Jeremiah 31.

Michael Horton represents a contemporary Reformed theologian who has self-consciously retrieved this older law–gospel and covenantal grammar for modern preaching, apologetics, and ecclesial life. He reads Luther, Calvin, Turretin, and Witsius as witnesses to a single Reformation core: **law and gospel** distinguished as the two words God speaks to the sinner in this age. Horton frames this against both liberal moralism and evangelical pragmatism, arguing that much of contemporary preaching collapses the gospel back into advice, imperatives, or spiritual technology. The therapeutic or managerial church turns the pulpit into a venue for practical tips, spiritual disciplines, and “you can do it” encouragement. Horton’s point, in line with the classical tradition, is that this is finally law: demands, exhortations, principles, all of which can only condemn when addressed to sinners if not grounded explicitly in the finished work of Christ proclaimed as done.

Examiners might object here that such a rigorous law–gospel distinction tends to denigrate imperatives and moral exhortation in preaching, and that Horton’s rhetoric sometimes sounds like a Lutheran caricature of Reformed sanctification. The best Reformed response is twofold. First, the distinction is not between texts that command and texts that promise, as if every imperative were automatically law and every indicative automatically gospel. Rather, law is whatever in God’s word demands perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience as the condition of life and pronounces curse for disobedience. Gospel is whatever in God’s word announces the free gift of Christ and his benefits apart from works. Both can be present in a single passage in different ways. Second, the Reformed have always insisted that **union with Christ** in its double grace of justification and sanctification must be preached in a way that actually produces holiness. The gospel creates the new obedience that the law describes. Horton himself, following this tradition, insists that actual preaching must simultaneously expose sin by the law, announce Christ in the gospel, and then describe the shape of grateful obedience, without ever letting the exhortations bleed back into the ground of acceptance before God.

The internal debates within Protestantism about law and gospel are largely focused on the third use of the law, the nature of the **covenant of works**, and the risk of either antinomianism or neonomianism. Lutheran orthodoxy sometimes hesitated about whether for the regenerate the law can properly be said to have a positive guiding function or whether its voice is always fundamentally accusatory. Classic Reformed divines like Calvin and Turretin respond by arguing that the law as a written code is always, as such, capable of accusation, but relative to the believer in Christ its condemnation is silenced and its instruction welcomed. The law does not cease to disclose sin even for the believer, but this disclosure now comes within the safety of the **covenant of grace**.

Antinomianism, historically and currently, often appeals to the sufficiency of the gospel and union with Christ to downplay the abiding normativity of the moral law. Examiners may refer to certain strands of “hyper-grace” teaching or to historical figures like John Eaton or Tobias Crisp. The Reformed position, following Witsius and Turretin, is that to sever law from gospel is to destroy both: the gospel saves us from the curse of the law precisely so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but the Spirit. Neonomianism, by contrast, sees the gospel as instituting a milder new law, where sincere though imperfect obedience, joined with faith, becomes the condition of justification or of final acceptance. The Reformed reject this as a betrayal of the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness. Faith is not a work counted as righteousness, but an empty hand receiving Christ.

Externally, the Roman Catholic tradition since Trent has rejected the formal law–gospel distinction. The “new law of the gospel” in Roman theology is essentially the grace-enabled fulfillment of the love commandment. From the Reformational standpoint, this renders the gospel conditional in the wrong sense. The condition of life becomes not the perfect obedience of Christ imputed, but the infused charity within us. Contemporary ecumenical dialogues sometimes attempt to soften this contrast through talk of “theologies of grace,” but the underlying structural difference over law and gospel remains. The Reformed position insists that the law’s demands must be satisfied by a perfect obedience outside of us, and that the gospel’s promise is purely receptive in justification.

More recently, the New Perspective on Paul and Paul-within-Judaism proposals complicate the classical Protestant reading of “works of the law.” If the law is principally about boundary markers and covenant membership rather than merit theology, then the traditional law–gospel contrast may seem exegetically suspect. A Westminster candidate must answer that while attention to Second Temple Jewish backgrounds has refined our understanding, it has not overturned Paul’s fundamental antithesis between a righteousness of the law and a righteousness of faith. Even if “works of the law” in some contexts refers specifically to Jewish identity markers, the deeper logic remains that any system in which obedience functions as the basis for final acceptance stands opposed to the gratuitous **gospel** of Christ crucified for the ungodly. The Reformed law–gospel distinction is thus not wedded to a simplistic “Pelagian Jews” caricature, but to a Pauline distinction between two ways of seeking righteousness.

Contemporary evangelicalism also raises the law–gospel issue in debates over Lordship salvation and free grace. One camp fears that insisting on repentance and obedience in connection with saving faith turns the gospel into law and undermines assurance. The other fears that separating faith from repentance and obedience yields “easy believism” and antinomianism. A properly articulated Reformed position, in line with the figures surveyed, says that the law–gospel distinction operates at the level of ground and instrument of justification, not at the level of the necessary fruits of regeneration. The call to repent and believe is indeed an imperative, but it is the form in which the **gospel** promise confronts the sinner. Repentance and new obedience are inseparable from justifying faith yet are not parts of its instrumentality. Thus, preaching that summons hearers to Christ and to forsake sin is not neonomian, provided it grounds acceptance solely in Christ’s righteousness and treats obedience as effect, not cause.

A further contemporary pressure point is the charge that a strong law–gospel distinction undermines the unity of Scripture and leads to a Marcionite contrast between Old and New Testaments. Here the Reformed appeal again to **covenant theology**. There is one unfolding plan, one Christ, one way of salvation. The **covenant of grace** is present in promise from Genesis 3, is typologically administered under Abraham and Moses, and is brought to fulfillment in the new covenant. Throughout, the gospel is present in shadow and type before it is present in clarity and fulfillment. The law given at Sinai serves not as a rival plan of salvation but as a means to magnify sin, preserve a people, and prefigure Christ. Thus, law and gospel are not coextensive with Old and New Testaments respectively, but they crisscross the canon. Law and gospel are distinct yet united strands of one redemptive-historical fabric woven by the triune God.

One final conceptual concern examiners will probe is the relation of the law–gospel distinction to the doctrine of God and his **simplicity**. Does saying that God speaks both law and gospel imply two wills, two attitudes, or change in God? The Reformed answer, following the broader catholic tradition, is that **divine simplicity** and immutability are non-negotiable. God is one in his simple act, eternally and immutably just and merciful. The distinction of law and gospel arises not in God as composed of parts, but in the diverse relations of creatures to the one God and in the temporal executions of his decree. As creator and covenant Lord, God demands perfect obedience corresponding to his own holiness. As redeemer in Christ, God himself supplies that obedience and answers his own demands on behalf of the elect. There is no contradiction in God, only in our sinful stance toward him. In Christ crucified and risen, the apparent tension of law and gospel is resolved: the law is honored, the curse exhausted, and the promise realized.

The position to be defended, therefore, is a confessional Reformed one that affirms a rigorous yet hermeneutically and pastorally calibrated **law–gospel distinction**. Law and gospel are distinct words: the one demands and condemns, the other promises and grants. They correspond, in redemptive history, to the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, yet both are administered through the one unfolding covenantal plan. This distinction is essential to safeguard **justification by faith alone**, the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, and the sheer gratuity of salvation. At the same time, law and gospel must not be separated. The God who speaks both is one. The same Christ who is offered in the gospel writes the **moral law** on the hearts of his people and calls them to grateful obedience. The three **uses of the law** all remain: civil, to restrain; theological, to accuse; and didactic, to guide the justified who now walk by the Spirit. Any formulation that blurs this distinction tends toward Rome’s confusion of grace with transformed law, or modern evangelical moralism. Any formulation that severs them collapses into antinomianism or mystical subjectivism, in which the “gospel” is detached from concrete obedience.

Under rigorous oral examination, then, the candidate must be able to define the **law–gospel distinction** precisely, expound it through Luther’s existential breakthrough, Calvin’s covenantal integration, Turretin’s and Witsius’s scholastic refinement, and Horton’s modern retrieval, and answer objections from Roman Catholic, Lutheran, New Perspective, antinomian, and neonomian directions. The core thesis to maintain is that God’s one, simple, authoritative word comes to sinners as both law and gospel, that these are neither identical nor contradictory, and that rightly distinguishing them is the evangelical art without which preaching dissolves either into despairing legalism or cheapened grace.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: **Law–gospel distinction** is the differentiation between God’s word that commands perfect obedience and condemns sin and God’s word that promises and grants Christ and his righteousness freely to sinners, while both remain the one word of the one **covenant Lord**.
- Decisive figures:
  - Luther: existential, sharp antithesis of law as accusation and gospel as unconditional promise, risking a weaker third use.
  - Calvin: integrates law–gospel with **covenant** and **union with Christ**, strongly affirms third use of the **moral law**.
  - Turretin: systematizes distinction in terms of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, guards justification by faith alone.
  - Witsius: refines covenantal framework pastorally, counters antinomian and neonomian distortions.
  - Horton: contemporary Reformed retrieval, presses distinction against moralism and therapeutic evangelicalism.
- Debates:
  - Internal: Lutheran versus Reformed on third use; placement of law–gospel within covenant theology; antinomian vs neonomian tensions in Protestant history.
  - External: Roman Catholic denial of formal distinction, viewing gospel as new law; New Perspective and Paul-within-Judaism critiques of Protestant readings of “works of the law.”
  - Contemporary: law–gospel in preaching and counseling; Lordship vs free grace; suspicion of natural or creational law; concerns about undermining Scripture’s unity.
- Defended position: A confessional Reformed stance in which law and gospel are distinct but inseparable words of the one God, structured by **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, preserving justification by faith alone, the three **uses of the law**, and the unity of Scripture and **divine simplicity**.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - Does a sharp law–gospel distinction violate God’s unity?  
    Answer: No, the distinction arises from different creaturely relations and covenantal economies, not from composition in God.
  - How does this relate to the Mosaic covenant and Sinai?  
    Answer: Sinai republishes the law’s condemning function while administering the **covenant of grace** typologically; it is not a separate way of salvation.
  - Is the Mosaic law a republication of the covenant of works?  
    Answer: In a qualified sense: the works principle is echoed at Sinai to expose sin and point to Christ, but within an overarching gracious administration.
  - Does affirming a third use compromise Luther’s insight?  
    Answer: No, because the third use operates for those already justified, with the law as a rule of gratitude, not as a covenant of life.
  - How do you preach law and gospel without antinomian or legalist results?  
    Answer: Preach the law in its full severity to expose sin, preach the gospel as a finished work grounding justification, and then present the **moral law** as the shape of Spirit-empowered gratitude, never as the basis of acceptance.
