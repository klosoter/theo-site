# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated the **Law-Gospel distinction** within a robustly **Reformed framework**, emphasizing the continuity of God's moral law and the necessity of the gospel for salvation. He maintained that the **law** reveals human sinfulness and the **gospel** proclaims the provision of grace in Christ, insisting that both are essential to a proper understanding of **justification** and **sanctification**.

- "The law is but the shadow; the gospel is the substance." (Faith and Life)

## Key Works

- "Faith and Life" (1916)
- "The Plan of Salvation" (1915)
- "The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible" (1881–1915)
- "The Westminster Assembly and Its Work" (1897)
- Selected Shorter Writings

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Law as Revelation of Sin**
    - The **law** functions to expose human inability and guilt before God.
    - It serves as a preparatory instrument, driving sinners to seek grace.
    - Warfield upholds the law’s enduring moral authority.
    - The law is not a means of salvation but a mirror of divine holiness.
    - "The law is given, not to save, but to convince of sin." (Faith and Life)

2. **Gospel as Provision of Grace**
    - The **gospel** announces the free offer of salvation in Christ.
    - It is distinct from the law in its function and content.
    - Warfield stresses the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement for justification.
    - The gospel alone provides the remedy for the condemnation revealed by the law.
    - "The gospel is not good advice, but good news." (Faith and Life)

3. **Continuity and Distinction in Redemptive History**
    - Warfield affirms the unity of the **covenant of grace** across both Testaments.
    - He maintains a real distinction between law and gospel within this unity.
    - The law’s pedagogical role persists, but the gospel fulfills its promise.
    - He rejects any antinomian separation of law from Christian life.
    - "The law and the gospel are not contradictory, but complementary." (Faith and Life)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is grounded solely in Christ’s righteousness, not law-keeping.
    - The law condemns; the gospel justifies through faith apart from works.
    - Warfield defends the forensic character of justification.
    - Assurance rests on the objective work of Christ, not subjective obedience.
    - "It is the gospel, not the law, that brings peace to the conscience." (Faith and Life)

5. **Sanctification and the Third Use of the Law**
    - The law continues to guide believers in gratitude after justification.
    - Warfield upholds the **third use of the law** as a rule for Christian living.
    - The Spirit enables obedience, but never as a basis for acceptance with God.
    - Sanctification flows from the gospel, empowered by grace, not law.
    - "The law is our guide, but the gospel is our power." (Faith and Life)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology, particularly in its defense of **justification by faith alone** and the ongoing role of the law in Christian life. His careful balance of continuity and distinction influenced later theologians and confessional standards. Warfield’s legacy endures in discussions of **covenant theology**, the function of the law, and the centrality of the gospel in preaching and pastoral ministry.
