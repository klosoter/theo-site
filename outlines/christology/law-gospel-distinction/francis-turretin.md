# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a rigorous **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **Reformed scholasticism**, emphasizing the contrast between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**. He maintained that the **Law** demands perfect obedience for life, while the **Gospel** offers salvation through faith in Christ, apart from works, thus safeguarding the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**.

- "The law promises life to those who keep it perfectly; the gospel promises life to those who believe in Christ." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Justification (sections within Institutes)
- The Covenant of Grace (sections within Institutes)
- Willem van Asselt, "Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism" (secondary, for context)
- R. Scott Clark, "Recovering the Reformed Confession" (secondary, for modern reception)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sharp Distinction Between Law and Gospel**
    - The **Law** is fundamentally a command with conditions, while the **Gospel** is a promise of grace.
    - The **Law** reveals sin and the impossibility of self-justification.
    - The **Gospel** proclaims Christ’s fulfillment of the Law and offers righteousness by faith.
    - Confusing Law and Gospel undermines the assurance of salvation.
    - "The law is opposed to the gospel, not as truth to falsehood, but as one kind of truth to another." (Institutes)

2. **Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace**
    - The **covenant of works** was made with Adam, requiring perfect obedience for life.
    - The **covenant of grace** is established in Christ, offering life by faith alone.
    - The Law’s demands are fulfilled in Christ for believers under the covenant of grace.
    - The two covenants are distinct in principle, not merely in degree.
    - "The law is the method of the covenant of works; the gospel, of the covenant of grace." (Institutes)

3. **Role of the Law in Conviction of Sin**
    - The **Law** exposes human inability and drives sinners to Christ.
    - It functions as a mirror, revealing the depth of human depravity.
    - The Law’s pedagogical use is essential for understanding the need for grace.
    - The Law cannot justify; it only condemns apart from Christ.
    - "The law was given, not that it might justify, but that it might convince and condemn." (Institutes)

4. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is grounded in Christ’s obedience, not human merit.
    - Faith alone receives the righteousness offered in the Gospel.
    - Works have no role in the ground of justification.
    - The Law’s demands are satisfied only in Christ, not in believers’ obedience.
    - "We are justified by faith alone, without the works of the law." (Institutes)

5. **Third Use of the Law**
    - The Law remains a rule of life for believers, though not a means of justification.
    - Believers, renewed by the Spirit, are enabled to obey the Law out of gratitude.
    - The Law guides Christian conduct within the covenant of grace.
    - The Law’s condemning power is removed for those in Christ.
    - "The law is abrogated as to justification, not as to direction." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy and provided a bulwark against both antinomianism and legalism. His influence persists in confessional Reformed traditions, especially regarding the doctrines of **justification** and the **covenant of grace**. Modern theologians and confessions continue to draw on Turretin’s careful distinctions to clarify the relationship between faith, works, and assurance.
