# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a nuanced understanding of the **Law-Gospel distinction** within the framework of **medieval scholastic theology**. He viewed the **Old Law** as preparatory and imperfect, oriented toward the **New Law** (the Gospel), which fulfills and perfects the former through **grace** and the work of **Christ**. For Aquinas, the Law and Gospel are not opposed but are stages in the unfolding of **divine revelation** and **salvation history**.

- "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially I-II, Questions 98–108
- Commentary on the Letter to the Romans
- Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV
- The Treatise on Law (Summa Theologiae I-II, Questions 90–108)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Old Law as Preparatory**
    - The **Old Law** was given to prepare humanity for the coming of Christ.
    - It contains **moral, ceremonial, and judicial precepts**.
    - Its ceremonies foreshadowed the realities fulfilled in the Gospel.
    - The Old Law could not confer **sanctifying grace** by itself.
    - "The Old Law was given that it might prepare the way for Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98, a. 2)

2. **The New Law as the Law of Grace**
    - The **New Law** is primarily the **grace of the Holy Spirit**.
    - It is written on the hearts of believers, not merely on tablets of stone.
    - The New Law perfects the Old by enabling true interior obedience.
    - Its external precepts are secondary to the inward gift of grace.
    - "The New Law is chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 106, a. 1)

3. **Continuity and Fulfillment**
    - The Gospel does not abolish the Old Law but fulfills it.
    - **Moral precepts** remain, while ceremonial and judicial laws are abrogated.
    - Christ is the fulfillment of the Law’s types and shadows.
    - The Law-Gospel relationship is one of **promise and fulfillment**.
    - "The Gospel is the perfection of the Law." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 107, a. 2)

4. **Role of Law in Justification**
    - The Old Law could not justify apart from faith and grace.
    - Justification comes through **faith in Christ** and the **infusion of grace**.
    - The Law reveals sin but cannot heal it.
    - The Gospel brings the power to fulfill the Law’s demands through grace.
    - "The Law was given that grace might be sought; grace was given that the Law might be fulfilled." (Commentary on Romans, ch. 7)

5. **Pedagogical Function of the Law**
    - The Law acts as a **teacher** leading to Christ.
    - It convicts of sin and demonstrates the need for a Savior.
    - The ceremonial aspects pointed forward to the realities of the Gospel.
    - The Law’s pedagogy is completed in the coming of Christ and the giving of the Spirit.
    - "The Old Law was a pedagogue to bring us to Christ." (Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 98, a. 6)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s articulation of the **Law-Gospel distinction** shaped subsequent Catholic and Protestant discussions, especially regarding the relationship between **nature and grace**. His synthesis influenced the development of **moral theology** and the understanding of the continuity between the Testaments. While later Reformers would sharpen the contrast between Law and Gospel, Aquinas’s framework remains foundational for discussions of **salvation history** and the role of the Law in Christian life. His thought continues to inform ecumenical dialogue and systematic theology.
