# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **atonement** within his broader project of grounding theology in **religious experience** rather than metaphysical or forensic categories. He rejected traditional **penal substitution** and instead emphasized the necessity of atonement as the means by which the **God-consciousness** of Christ is communicated to the community, thus effecting reconciliation. For Schleiermacher, the extent of the atonement is universal in scope, and its necessity is rooted in the existential condition of human alienation from God.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all other men by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §93)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement as Communication of God-Consciousness**
    - The atonement is not a legal transaction but the impartation of Christ’s **God-consciousness** to believers.
    - Christ’s unique consciousness of God is the source of redemption for humanity.
    - The church is the sphere where this God-consciousness is mediated and actualized.
    - Redemption is understood as the transformation of the human condition through participation in Christ’s life.
    - "Redemption is the communication of the Redeemer’s God-consciousness to the community." (The Christian Faith, §94)

2. **Rejection of Penal Substitution**
    - Schleiermacher denies that Christ’s death is a substitutionary punishment for sin.
    - He critiques forensic theories as incompatible with the nature of divine love and justice.
    - The cross is significant as the culmination of Christ’s self-identification with humanity, not as a legal satisfaction.
    - The focus is on the transformative rather than juridical effects of Christ’s work.
    - "The idea of substitution is foreign to the living relation of Christ to the community." (The Christian Faith, §101)

3. **Necessity Rooted in Human Sinfulness**
    - The necessity of atonement arises from the universal alienation of humanity from God.
    - Only a mediator with perfect God-consciousness could overcome this estrangement.
    - The atonement is necessary for the restoration of the divine-human relationship.
    - Christ’s redemptive work is indispensable for the renewal of the human race.
    - "Without the Redeemer, the God-consciousness could not have become dominant in the human race." (The Christian Faith, §93)

4. **Universal Extent of Atonement**
    - Schleiermacher affirms the universal scope of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - The atonement is not limited to an elect group but is potentially effective for all humanity.
    - The church’s mission is to extend the influence of Christ’s God-consciousness universally.
    - Salvation is ultimately inclusive, though realized through participation in the Christian community.
    - "The influence of Christ is destined for the whole human race." (The Christian Faith, §98)

5. **Atonement as Historical and Existential Event**
    - The atonement is rooted in the historical person and work of Jesus Christ.
    - Its efficacy is realized existentially as individuals and communities participate in Christ’s life.
    - The historical Jesus is essential as the concrete locus of redemption.
    - The ongoing life of the church manifests the continuing power of Christ’s atoning work.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence is a historical fact, perpetuated in the life of the community." (The Christian Faith, §99)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s redefinition of **atonement** shifted the focus from objective, juridical theories to subjective, experiential participation in Christ’s God-consciousness. His approach laid the groundwork for modern **liberal theology** and influenced subsequent discussions on the nature and extent of redemption. While often criticized by confessional traditions for undermining classical doctrines, his thought remains foundational for contemporary explorations of the meaning and necessity of atonement in a post-Enlightenment context.
