# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrine of **atonement** through the lens of **demythologization** and **existential interpretation**, challenging traditional views of the necessity and objective nature of Christ’s work. He rejected classical **substitutionary** and **satisfaction** theories, instead emphasizing the existential encounter with the **kerygma** as the locus of salvation. For Bultmann, the significance of the atonement lies in the individual's response of faith rather than in metaphysical transactions.

- "The event of the cross is not a mythical event but an event that happens to me here and now." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Atonement**
    - Interprets biblical language about atonement as mythological, requiring existential reinterpretation.
    - Rejects literal readings of **sacrifice**, **propitiation**, and **substitution**.
    - Sees mythic atonement motifs as expressions of human self-understanding before God.
    - Focuses on the existential meaning of the cross for the believer.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter over Objective Transaction**
    - Denies that atonement is an objective event effecting change in God or the cosmos.
    - Emphasizes the individual's confrontation with the **kerygma** as transformative.
    - Salvation is realized in the existential decision of faith, not in metaphysical satisfaction.
    - The cross becomes meaningful as it calls the individual to authentic existence.
    - "What matters is not the historical event as such, but its existential significance for us." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Rejection of Classical Theories**
    - Critiques **Anselmian satisfaction** and **penal substitution** as rooted in outdated cosmologies.
    - Argues that these theories misunderstand the New Testament’s existential message.
    - Asserts that God does not require satisfaction or punishment to forgive.
    - Views atonement as the proclamation of new self-understanding, not a legal transaction.
    - "The idea of a vicarious satisfaction is foreign to the message of Jesus." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Universal Offer, Existential Limitation**
    - The message of the cross is universally proclaimed, but its effect is limited to those who respond in faith.
    - Rejects the notion of **limited atonement** as metaphysically irrelevant.
    - The extent of atonement is determined existentially, not by divine decree.
    - The decisive factor is the individual's acceptance of the kerygma.
    - "The saving event is actualized only in the act of faith." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Atonement as Self-Understanding**
    - The cross reveals the human condition of sin and the possibility of authentic existence.
    - Atonement is the disclosure of God’s grace, calling for existential decision.
    - The believer is liberated from self-reliance and opened to new being in Christ.
    - The meaning of atonement is realized in personal transformation, not in cosmic change.
    - "Faith grasps the forgiveness of sins as the possibility of a new existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **atonement** profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** and existentialist interpretations of Christian doctrine. His emphasis on **demythologization** challenged traditional dogmatic formulations and redirected scholarly focus to the existential significance of the cross. While criticized by confessional theologians for undermining objective atonement, his work remains influential in discussions of faith, hermeneutics, and the relationship between history and theology. Bultmann’s legacy endures in ongoing debates over the meaning and relevance of the atonement in contemporary theology.
