# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches the doctrine of **atonement** through his distinctive **triperspectivalism**, emphasizing the necessity, sufficiency, and particularity of Christ’s work. He affirms the **penal substitutionary** model as central, while recognizing the richness of biblical metaphors and the importance of **covenant** context for understanding the extent and efficacy of Christ’s atoning death.

- "The atonement is necessary because of God’s justice, and it is effective because of Christ’s perfect obedience and substitution." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement is Necessary Due to God’s Justice**
    - God’s **holiness** and **justice** require satisfaction for sin.
    - Human inability to atone necessitates a divine solution.
    - The cross is the only sufficient means for reconciliation.
    - Necessity is grounded in God’s unchanging character, not external compulsion.
    - "God’s justice demands that sin be punished, and his love provides the substitute." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Penal Substitution as Central Model**
    - Christ bears the penalty for sin in the place of his people.
    - Substitution is rooted in both Old and New Testament sacrificial themes.
    - This model upholds both God’s justice and mercy.
    - Penal substitution is not exclusive but primary among atonement motifs.
    - "The heart of the atonement is Christ’s substitutionary death for sinners." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Particular Redemption (Definite Atonement)**
    - Christ’s atonement is intended for the elect, not all without exception.
    - The atonement actually secures salvation, not just its possibility.
    - Universal language in Scripture is interpreted in covenantal context.
    - Particular redemption upholds the efficacy and purposefulness of Christ’s work.
    - "Jesus’ death actually saves those for whom it was intended." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Triperspectival Approach to Atonement**
    - Doctrine is understood through **normative** (biblical), **situational** (historical), and **existential** (personal) perspectives.
    - Each perspective enriches understanding without contradiction.
    - Theories of atonement are evaluated in light of all three perspectives.
    - This approach guards against reductionism and false dichotomies.
    - "We must see the atonement from the perspectives of God’s law, our need, and Christ’s person." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Multiplicity of Biblical Atonement Motifs**
    - While penal substitution is central, other motifs (victory, example, ransom) are biblically valid.
    - The atonement accomplishes reconciliation, redemption, and victory over evil.
    - Frame resists limiting the atonement to a single theory.
    - The richness of biblical imagery reflects the fullness of Christ’s work.
    - "The Bible uses many images to describe the atonement, all centering on Christ’s saving work." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **atonement** has influenced contemporary Reformed theology by integrating classic doctrines with a robustly biblical and covenantal framework. His **triperspectivalism** provides a unique lens for evaluating atonement theories, encouraging theological synthesis rather than fragmentation. Frame’s work continues to shape discussions on the necessity, extent, and meaning of Christ’s atoning death, especially within confessional and evangelical circles.
