# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline approached the doctrine of **atonement** through the lens of **covenant theology**, emphasizing the necessity of atonement as rooted in the **covenant of works** and the principle of **divine justice**. He argued that the extent and efficacy of Christ’s atonement are determined by the **federal headship** of Christ and the **intrinsic structure of redemptive covenants**, with a particular focus on the **substitutionary** and **sacrificial** dimensions as prefigured in Old Testament typology.

- "The curse sanction of the covenant of works is executed in the atoning death of Christ, the federal head of the new covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- Images of the Spirit
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement as Covenant Sanction**
   - The atonement is the execution of the **curse sanction** of the covenant of works.
   - Christ, as the **second Adam**, bears the penalty due to covenant breakers.
   - The necessity of atonement is grounded in the **immutability of God’s justice** within the covenant framework.
   - The cross fulfills the legal demands of the original creation covenant.
   - "The atonement is the judicial execution of the curse sanction of the broken covenant." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Typology and Substitution**
   - Old Testament sacrificial systems are typological anticipations of Christ’s atoning work.
   - The principle of **substitution** is central: the innocent suffers for the guilty.
   - Kline highlights the Passover and Day of Atonement as paradigmatic.
   - Christ’s death is the antitype, fulfilling all typological sacrifices.
   - "The typological sacrifices point forward to the ultimate substitutionary sacrifice of Christ." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Particular Redemption and Federal Headship**
   - The extent of the atonement is defined by Christ’s role as federal head of the elect.
   - Redemption is accomplished for those represented by Christ in the new covenant.
   - Kline affirms a **definite atonement** consistent with Reformed confessions.
   - The atonement’s efficacy is inseparable from covenant representation.
   - "Christ’s atonement is limited in its intent and effect to those in covenantal union with him." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Necessity Rooted in Divine Justice**
   - God’s justice requires satisfaction for covenant breach.
   - The necessity of atonement is not arbitrary but flows from God’s holy character.
   - No forgiveness is possible apart from the satisfaction of the curse sanction.
   - The atonement upholds both God’s righteousness and mercy.
   - "The necessity of atonement is dictated by the inviolable justice of the covenant Lord." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Atonement and Eschatology**
   - The atonement inaugurates the **eschatological new creation**.
   - Christ’s death and resurrection secure the blessings of the new covenant.
   - The curse is reversed and the kingdom consummated through atoning work.
   - The atonement is the pivot point of redemptive history, moving from judgment to restoration.
   - "The atonement is the decisive event in the transition from the old creation under curse to the new creation in Christ." (God, Heaven and Har Magedon)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s covenantal approach to the **atonement** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in the areas of **biblical theology** and **hermeneutics**. His emphasis on the legal and typological dimensions of atonement has influenced both academic and pastoral discussions of Christ’s work. Kline’s articulation of the necessity, extent, and structure of atonement continues to inform debates on **definite atonement** and the relationship between Old and New Testament covenants. His work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate covenant theology with a robust doctrine of atonement.
