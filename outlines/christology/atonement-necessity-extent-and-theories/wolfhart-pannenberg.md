# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **atonement** by emphasizing its grounding in the **historical resurrection of Christ** and its cosmic, universal significance. He rejected both purely subjective and strictly penal substitutionary theories, instead arguing that the **necessity** and **extent** of atonement are rooted in God's self-revelation and the eschatological reconciliation of all creation. For Pannenberg, the atonement is not limited but has a universal scope, as God's victory in Christ is decisive for the whole of humanity.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement as Historical Event**
    - The atonement is inseparable from the **historical resurrection** of Jesus.
    - Christ’s resurrection is the foundation for understanding reconciliation.
    - The historical reality of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection is central to salvation.
    - The event of Christ is the eschatological anticipation of the world’s end.
    - "The resurrection of Jesus is the proleptic realization of the reconciliation of the world." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Universal Scope of Atonement**
    - The atonement is not limited to the elect but is intended for all humanity.
    - God’s reconciling act in Christ has cosmic implications.
    - The **extent** of atonement is universal, though its realization is eschatological.
    - The church is the provisional sign of this universal reconciliation.
    - "God’s love is directed to all, and the reconciliation in Christ is for the world as a whole." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Revelation and Atonement**
    - Atonement is inseparable from **God’s self-revelation** in history.
    - The cross and resurrection reveal the character and purpose of God.
    - The necessity of atonement is grounded in God’s will to be known and to reconcile.
    - Revelation is both the means and content of atonement.
    - "God’s revelation is itself the event of reconciliation." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Critique of Traditional Theories**
    - Pannenberg critiques both **penal substitution** and **subjective** theories as insufficient.
    - He emphasizes the eschatological and relational dimensions over legal or moral satisfaction.
    - Theories must account for the resurrection as the decisive act of God.
    - Atonement is not merely a transaction but a transformation of history and humanity.
    - "Neither the satisfaction theory nor the moral influence theory does justice to the eschatological reality of reconciliation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The full realization of atonement is **eschatological**—it will be completed at the end of history.
    - The resurrection is a foretaste of the final reconciliation of all things.
    - The church anticipates and witnesses to this coming fulfillment.
    - The atonement’s necessity is tied to God’s ultimate purpose for creation.
    - "The reconciliation accomplished in Christ awaits its consummation in the eschaton." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s theology of **atonement** has significantly shaped modern discussions by insisting on the centrality of the resurrection and the universal, cosmic scope of reconciliation. His integration of **history**, **revelation**, and eschatology challenged both classical and contemporary theories, urging theologians to consider the atonement within the broader narrative of God’s purposes for creation. Pannenberg’s work continues to influence ecumenical dialogue and the development of constructive, historically grounded accounts of salvation.
