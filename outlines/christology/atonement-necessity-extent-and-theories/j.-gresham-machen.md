# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen defended the **necessity** and **objective character** of the atonement, insisting that Christ’s work was essential for salvation and rooted in **substitutionary penal sacrifice**. He rejected liberal reductions of the atonement to mere moral influence, emphasizing its **definite accomplishment** for the elect and its grounding in **biblical revelation**. Machen’s approach is marked by a strong commitment to the **historic Reformed doctrine** of atonement, particularly as articulated in the Westminster Standards.

- "According to the Christian view, Jesus is our Saviour, not because He has inspired us to live the same kind of life that He lived, but because He took upon Himself the guilt of our sins and bore it instead of us on the cross." ("Christianity and Liberalism")

## Key Works

- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Christian Faith in the Modern World (1936)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- The Origin of Paul's Religion (1921)
- "The Doctrine of the Atonement" (various lectures and articles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement is Necessary for Salvation**
    - Salvation requires a real, objective removal of guilt, not merely moral improvement.
    - The holiness and justice of God demand satisfaction for sin.
    - Christ’s atoning work is the only basis for reconciliation with God.
    - Rejects any view that minimizes the seriousness of sin or the need for a mediator.
    - "Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Atonement is Substitutionary and Penal**
    - Christ bore the penalty due to sinners as their substitute.
    - The atonement satisfies divine justice by addressing the real guilt of sin.
    - Substitution is not merely illustrative but actual and effective.
    - This view is rooted in both Old and New Testament revelation.
    - "The essence of it is substitution—the innocent suffering for the guilty." (Christianity and Liberalism)

3. **Extent of the Atonement is Definite**
    - Christ’s atonement is intended for and effectively applied to the elect.
    - Rejects universalism and general atonement theories as inconsistent with Scripture.
    - The atonement actually secures salvation, not just the possibility of it.
    - Closely aligns with the Westminster Confession’s articulation of particular redemption.
    - "The New Testament everywhere represents the work of Christ as actually accomplishing salvation for those who are saved." (Christianity and Liberalism)

4. **Atonement is Rooted in Divine Revelation**
    - The doctrine is not a human construct but revealed in Scripture.
    - Biblical authority is foundational for understanding the nature and necessity of atonement.
    - Rejects attempts to reinterpret the atonement apart from biblical categories.
    - Upholds the unity of Old and New Testament teaching on sacrifice and redemption.
    - "The Christian doctrine of the atonement is not derived from human speculation but from the Bible." (The Christian Faith in the Modern World)

5. **Rejection of Moral Influence and Example Theories**
    - Moral influence or example theories are insufficient to address the problem of sin.
    - These theories undermine the seriousness of sin and the need for a real sacrifice.
    - Machen insists that Christ’s death is not merely a demonstration of love but an act of redemption.
    - The cross is central as a redemptive, not merely inspirational, event.
    - "If Christ is merely our example, then we are of all men most miserable." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **substitutionary atonement** shaped twentieth-century American Reformed theology, especially in opposition to liberal Protestantism. His insistence on the necessity and objective accomplishment of Christ’s work remains influential in confessional Presbyterian circles. Machen’s writings continue to serve as a bulwark for those upholding the historic doctrines of the atonement amid ongoing theological challenges.
