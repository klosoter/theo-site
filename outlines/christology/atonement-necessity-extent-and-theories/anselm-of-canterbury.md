# Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)

Anselm of Canterbury articulated a foundational account of the **atonement** in his doctrine of **satisfaction**, arguing that the **necessity** of Christ’s work arises from the demands of **divine justice** and **honor**. He rejected both ransom-to-Satan theories and arbitrary divine forgiveness, insisting that only the **God-man** could make adequate satisfaction for human sin, thus securing a universal and objective basis for **reconciliation** between God and humanity.

- "You have not yet considered the weight of sin." ("Cur Deus Homo")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement as Satisfaction for Divine Honor**
    - Sin is an offense against the infinite **honor** of God, requiring satisfaction.
    - Satisfaction must be made either by punishment or by compensation.
    - Only a being both fully **God and man** can offer adequate satisfaction.
    - The atonement restores the moral order disrupted by sin.
    - "It is necessary that as death came upon the human race by man’s disobedience, so by man’s obedience life should be restored." ("Cur Deus Homo")

2. **Necessity Rooted in Divine Justice**
    - God cannot simply forgive sin without satisfaction, as this would violate **justice**.
    - The necessity is not absolute but arises from God’s consistent character.
    - The atonement is the only fitting means for reconciliation.
    - Divine mercy and justice are harmonized in the work of Christ.
    - "God does nothing unjustly or irrationally." ("Cur Deus Homo")

3. **Rejection of Ransom-to-Satan Theory**
    - Anselm critiques the idea that Christ’s death was a payment to Satan.
    - He argues that Satan has no rightful claim over humanity.
    - The atonement is directed toward satisfying God, not appeasing the devil.
    - This shift centers the atonement in the context of **divine justice**.
    - "To whom did He give His soul as a ransom? Certainly not to the devil." ("Cur Deus Homo")

4. **Universality and Sufficiency of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s satisfaction is of infinite value due to His divine nature.
    - The atonement is sufficient for all, though its application is to the faithful.
    - The God-man’s obedience is the basis for the restoration of humanity.
    - The work of Christ is both unique and necessary for salvation.
    - "One who could pay to God more than all that is not God could pay." ("Cur Deus Homo")

5. **Theoretical Priority of Satisfaction over Penal Substitution**
    - Anselm’s model emphasizes restoration of honor rather than penal substitution.
    - The focus is on compensatory satisfaction, not punishment per se.
    - Later theories of **penal substitution** build upon but also diverge from Anselm’s framework.
    - His approach shaped subsequent Western views on the **extent** and nature of atonement.
    - "He who does not pay what he owes, takes from God what is His." ("Cur Deus Homo")

## Legacy and Impact

Anselm’s **satisfaction theory of atonement** became a cornerstone for Western theological reflection, profoundly influencing medieval and Reformation thought. His insistence on the necessity and sufficiency of Christ’s work shaped later debates on the **extent of the atonement** and the relationship between **divine justice** and mercy. While later theologians developed alternative models, Anselm’s framework remains a critical reference point in discussions of atonement theory.
