# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of the **atonement** grounded in the necessity of Christ's substitutionary sacrifice, its definite extent for the **elect**, and its foundation in **penal substitution**. They emphasize the satisfaction of **divine justice**, the unity of Christ’s priestly work, and the sufficiency and efficacy of His death for all whom the Father has given Him.

- "The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself... hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father." (Westminster Confession of Faith, 8.5)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 3, 8, 11)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–56)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–28)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Necessity of the Atonement**
    - The atonement is required by the **holiness and justice of God**.
    - Human sin incurs real guilt and liability to **divine wrath**.
    - No other means of reconciliation is possible apart from Christ’s sacrifice.
    - The atonement is rooted in the **covenant of grace**.
    - "Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those that are thus justified." (WCF 11.3)

2. **Definite (Particular) Extent**
    - Christ’s atonement is intended only for the **elect**.
    - The efficacy of His death is limited to those chosen by God.
    - The atonement secures not only the possibility but the certainty of salvation for the elect.
    - Universal atonement is rejected as inconsistent with God’s decree.
    - "Neither are any other redeemed by Christ... but the elect only." (WCF 3.6)

3. **Penal Substitutionary Theory**
    - Christ bore the **penalty** due to sinners in their place.
    - The atonement satisfies the demands of **God’s justice**.
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience are both essential.
    - The substitution is both legal and representative.
    - "The Lord Jesus... was made under the law, did perfectly fulfill it, endured most grievous torments... and was made a sacrifice, satisfying God's justice." (WLC 49)

4. **Sufficiency and Efficacy**
    - The atonement is of infinite value and sufficient for all.
    - Its efficacy is applied only to those for whom it was intended.
    - The benefits of Christ’s work are communicated through **union with Christ**.
    - The atonement guarantees all saving graces for the elect.
    - "To all those for whom Christ hath purchased redemption, he doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same." (WCF 8.8)

5. **Unity of Christ’s Priestly Work**
    - Christ’s **intercession** and sacrifice are inseparable.
    - His priestly office includes both offering and ongoing mediation.
    - The atonement is not merely an example but an objective accomplishment.
    - Christ’s work is once for all, never to be repeated.
    - "Christ executeth the office of a priest, in his once offering up of himself a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, and reconcile us to God." (WSC 25)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed theology** on the atonement, establishing the classic articulation of **definite atonement** and **penal substitution**. Their careful balance of necessity, sufficiency, and particularity has influenced confessional documents and theological debates for centuries. The Standards remain a touchstone for Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions, ensuring ongoing clarity and fidelity in the doctrine of Christ’s redemptive work.
