# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the doctrine of **atonement** with a strong emphasis on its necessity within the framework of **redemptive history** and the **union with Christ** motif. He affirms the **definite (particular) atonement** of Reformed theology, situating the work of Christ within the broader context of **resurrection**, **justification**, and the application of redemption by the Holy Spirit.

- "The atonement is not an isolated transaction but is inseparable from the resurrection and the believer’s union with Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Work of Christ Applied" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)
- Perspectives on Pentecost

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Atonement as Redemptive-Historical Event**
   - The atonement is inseparable from the broader sweep of **redemptive history**.
   - Christ’s death and resurrection are viewed as a unified saving event.
   - The atonement must be interpreted in light of the **history of revelation**.
   - Emphasizes the eschatological dimension of Christ’s work.
   - "The death and resurrection of Christ are not two separate events but constitute a single, redemptive-historical accomplishment." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Necessity of Atonement Rooted in Divine Justice**
   - The atonement is necessary due to the demands of **God’s justice** and holiness.
   - Human sinfulness requires a substitutionary sacrifice.
   - The necessity is not arbitrary but grounded in the character of God.
   - Christ’s obedience fulfills both the penalty and positive demands of the law.
   - "The necessity of the atonement is grounded in the unchangeable righteousness of God." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

3. **Definite (Particular) Atonement**
   - Christ’s atoning work is intended for the **elect** and is fully effective for them.
   - The atonement actually accomplishes salvation, not merely makes it possible.
   - Gaffin aligns with the classic Reformed understanding of **limited atonement**.
   - The extent of the atonement is defined by God’s sovereign purpose in election.
   - "Christ’s death is not a general provision but a particular accomplishment for his people." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Union with Christ as the Context of Atonement**
   - The benefits of the atonement are applied through **union with Christ**.
   - Justification, sanctification, and glorification flow from this union.
   - The atonement is not merely a legal transaction but a relational reality.
   - The Spirit unites believers to the crucified and risen Christ.
   - "All the saving benefits of Christ’s work are found in union with him." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Integration of Atonement and Resurrection**
   - The resurrection is not an addendum but integral to the atoning work.
   - Justification is grounded in both Christ’s death and resurrection.
   - The atonement achieves not only forgiveness but new life.
   - The resurrection vindicates and completes the atoning work of Christ.
   - "The resurrection is the justification of Jesus and, in him, of all who are his." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on the **atonement**, especially by integrating the doctrines of **union with Christ** and the resurrection into the heart of soteriology. His redemptive-historical approach has influenced both academic theology and pastoral ministry, encouraging a holistic reading of Paul and the New Testament. Gaffin’s articulation of definite atonement and the necessity of Christ’s work continues to inform confessional Reformed theology and the training of ministers at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond.
