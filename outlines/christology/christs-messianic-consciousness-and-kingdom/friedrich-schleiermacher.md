# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher approached **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** through the lens of **religious self-consciousness** and the unique God-consciousness of Christ. He emphasized that Christ’s messianic identity is rooted in his perfect and continuous **God-consciousness**, which becomes the foundation for the emergence of the **Kingdom** as a community of shared faith and ethical life.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all others by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Unique God-Consciousness**
    - Christ’s messianic identity is grounded in his perfect, uninterrupted **God-consciousness**.
    - This consciousness is not merely intellectual but existential, shaping Christ’s entire being and mission.
    - Christ’s God-consciousness is the archetype for the religious life of the community.
    - The uniqueness of Christ lies in the quality and intensity of this consciousness, not in metaphysical speculation.
    - "In Him the existence of God in human form was realized in a way that is unique and unrepeatable." (The Christian Faith)

2. **Messianic Role as Founder of the Kingdom**
    - Christ’s mission is to inaugurate the **Kingdom of God** as a community of God-conscious individuals.
    - The Kingdom is not a political or external reality but a spiritual-ethical fellowship.
    - Christ’s messianic consciousness is inseparable from his vocation to form this community.
    - The Kingdom grows as individuals participate in Christ’s God-consciousness.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence consists in awakening and sustaining the God-consciousness in others." (The Christian Faith)

3. **Redemption as Communication of God-Consciousness**
    - Redemption is understood as the communication of Christ’s God-consciousness to humanity.
    - The process is communal, as the **Kingdom** is realized in the fellowship of believers.
    - Christ mediates the divine to humanity through his unique consciousness and example.
    - The messianic consciousness is thus both the means and the content of redemption.
    - "Redemption is the transition from the state of God-forgetfulness to that of God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith)

4. **Historical Jesus and the Development of Messianic Consciousness**
    - Schleiermacher emphasizes the historical development of Jesus’ self-understanding as Messiah.
    - Jesus’ messianic consciousness is seen as organically growing within his historical context.
    - The historical Jesus is essential for understanding the emergence of the Kingdom.
    - The messianic consciousness is not static but dynamic and relational.
    - "The historical Christ is the necessary presupposition for the existence of the Christian community." (The Christian Faith)

5. **Ethical and Communal Dimensions of the Kingdom**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is realized in the ethical transformation of individuals and communities.
    - The messianic consciousness leads to a new mode of communal life centered on love and fellowship.
    - The Kingdom is both present and future, unfolding as the community embodies Christ’s consciousness.
    - The ethical life of the community is the visible manifestation of the Kingdom.
    - "The Kingdom of God is the union of all in whom the divine consciousness prevails." (The Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s focus on **Christ’s God-consciousness** and the **Kingdom** as a spiritual-ethical community profoundly influenced modern Protestant theology, especially the development of **liberal theology** and the quest for the historical Jesus. His emphasis on the subjective and communal aspects of faith shifted the discussion from metaphysical Christology to the lived experience of the Christian community. Later theologians, both critical and appreciative, have engaged deeply with his understanding of the Kingdom and the person of Christ, making his work a foundational reference in discussions of Christ’s messianic identity and the nature of the Kingdom of God.
