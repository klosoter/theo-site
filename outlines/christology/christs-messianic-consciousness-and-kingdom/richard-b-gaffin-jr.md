# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. emphasizes that **Christ’s messianic consciousness** is inseparable from his self-understanding as the **eschatological Son of Man** and the inaugurator of the **Kingdom of God**. Gaffin argues that Jesus’ awareness of his unique role is rooted in his redemptive-historical mission, culminating in his **resurrection** and the outpouring of the **Spirit**, which marks the arrival of the **already/not yet** Kingdom.

- "Jesus’ messianic self-consciousness is inseparable from his awareness of inaugurating the eschatological kingdom in his own person and work." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Messianic Self-Consciousness is Redemptive-Historical**
    - Jesus’ self-understanding is shaped by his role in the unfolding **history of redemption**.
    - The Gospels present Christ as fully aware of his unique identity and mission.
    - Messianic consciousness is not merely psychological but covenantal and eschatological.
    - Christ’s awareness is tied to his fulfillment of **Old Testament prophecy**.
    - "Jesus’ messianic consciousness is not an abstract self-awareness but is defined by his place in the history of redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **The Kingdom is Inaugurated in Christ’s Resurrection**
    - The **resurrection** is the decisive event marking the arrival of the Kingdom.
    - Jesus’ messianic identity is vindicated and revealed in the resurrection.
    - The resurrection inaugurates the **new creation** and the age to come.
    - The Kingdom is present in Christ’s exaltation and the gift of the Spirit.
    - "The resurrection is the pivotal event in the realization of the kingdom of God." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Already/Not Yet Structure of the Kingdom**
    - The Kingdom is both inaugurated (already) and awaiting consummation (not yet).
    - Believers participate in the Kingdom through union with the risen Christ.
    - The tension of the present age is defined by this eschatological overlap.
    - Jesus’ messianic consciousness includes awareness of this two-stage fulfillment.
    - "The kingdom is present in Christ, yet its fullness awaits his return." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

4. **Pneumatological Realization of the Kingdom**
    - The outpouring of the **Holy Spirit** is the chief evidence of the Kingdom’s arrival.
    - Pentecost is the application of Christ’s messianic work to the church.
    - The Spirit mediates the benefits of Christ’s resurrection to believers.
    - The messianic age is the age of the Spirit, as foreseen by the prophets.
    - "The coming of the Spirit at Pentecost is the eschatological gift of the kingdom." (Perspectives on Pentecost)

5. **Christ’s Obedience and Suffering as Messianic Fulfillment**
    - Jesus’ messianic consciousness includes his vocation to suffer and die.
    - The cross is not a failure but the necessary path to messianic glory.
    - Christ’s obedience fulfills the role of the suffering servant and Son of Man.
    - His suffering and resurrection are inseparable in the accomplishment of redemption.
    - "The messianic identity of Jesus is inseparable from his suffering and obedience unto death." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has profoundly shaped Reformed understanding of **redemptive history**, especially regarding the centrality of the resurrection and the eschatological Kingdom. His articulation of the **already/not yet** framework has influenced generations of biblical theologians and pastors. By grounding Christ’s messianic consciousness in the unfolding of God’s redemptive plan, Gaffin has provided a robust theological foundation for understanding the person and work of Christ within the broader narrative of Scripture. His legacy endures in both academic and ecclesial contexts, particularly within confessional Reformed circles.
