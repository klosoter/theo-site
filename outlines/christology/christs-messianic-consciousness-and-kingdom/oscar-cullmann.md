# Oscar Cullmann (1902–1999)

Oscar Cullmann emphasized the centrality of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the unfolding of the **Kingdom of God** within the framework of **salvation history** (Heilsgeschichte). He argued that Jesus was self-consciously aware of his unique role as the **Messiah** and that his ministry inaugurated the decisive phase of the **eschatological Kingdom**, situated between the "already" and the "not yet." Cullmann’s approach bridges the gap between realized and future eschatology, highlighting the historical progression of redemption centered on Christ.

## Legacy and Impact

His work influenced both biblical theology and systematic theology by insisting on the centrality of Christ’s messianic identity and the inaugurated Kingdom. Cullmann’s legacy endures in discussions of **eschatology**, the unity of Scripture, and the historical grounding of Christian faith.
