# Craig A. Evans (1952– )

Craig A. Evans is a leading New Testament scholar whose work on **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** emphasizes Jesus’ self-understanding within the context of **Second Temple Judaism**. Evans argues that Jesus saw himself as fulfilling **messianic expectations** and inaugurating the **eschatological reign of God**, drawing deeply from Jewish scriptures and traditions. His scholarship highlights the historical plausibility of Jesus’ messianic claims and the centrality of the **Kingdom** in his proclamation.

- "Jesus believed himself to be the one through whom God’s kingdom would be realized in history." (Fabricating Jesus, p. 222)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Jesus and Messianic Identity**
    - Jesus’ self-understanding is rooted in **Second Temple Jewish** messianic hopes.
    - The Gospels reliably reflect Jesus’ messianic consciousness, though filtered through early Christian interpretation.
    - Jesus’ actions (e.g., Temple cleansing, symbolic miracles) intentionally evoke messianic expectations.
    - The title “Messiah” is not anachronistically imposed but emerges from Jesus’ own mission and claims.
    - "Jesus’ messianic consciousness is best understood in light of the Jewish scriptures and traditions he appropriated." (Jesus and His World, p. 94)

2. **Centrality of the Kingdom of God**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is the core of Jesus’ proclamation and mission.
    - Jesus presents the Kingdom as both present (“already”) and future (“not yet”).
    - Parables and miracles are signs of the Kingdom’s arrival and character.
    - The Kingdom is not merely ethical or political, but fundamentally **eschatological**.
    - "The kingdom of God, as Jesus proclaimed it, was both a present reality and a future hope." (Fabricating Jesus, p. 223)

3. **Continuity with Jewish Eschatology**
    - Jesus’ teachings align with and reinterpret **Jewish apocalyptic** and prophetic traditions.
    - Messianic titles (Son of Man, Son of David) are used with nuanced continuity and transformation.
    - Jesus’ vision of the Kingdom draws from Isaiah, Daniel, and the Psalms.
    - The expectation of **restoration** and divine intervention is central to Jesus’ message.
    - "Jesus’ message of the kingdom is best understood as a development within Jewish eschatological expectation." (Jesus and the Kingdom of God, p. 419)

4. **Role of Miracles and Exorcisms**
    - Miracles are not mere wonders but signs of **messianic authority** and the inbreaking Kingdom.
    - Exorcisms demonstrate the defeat of Satan and the arrival of God’s reign.
    - Healing acts fulfill prophetic hopes of restoration and liberation.
    - The miracles authenticate Jesus’ identity as the **anointed one**.
    - "The miracles of Jesus are best interpreted as signs of the kingdom’s presence and the Messiah’s authority." (Jesus and His World, p. 156)

5. **Crucifixion and Vindication**
    - Jesus’ death is interpreted as the suffering of the **Messiah** in fulfillment of scripture.
    - The resurrection is seen as divine vindication of Jesus’ messianic claims.
    - The cross does not negate but confirms Jesus’ messianic consciousness.
    - Early Christian proclamation of the risen Christ is rooted in Jesus’ own understanding of his mission.
    - "The resurrection was understood as God’s vindication of Jesus’ messianic identity and mission." (Fabricating Jesus, p. 241)

## Legacy and Impact

Craig A. Evans has significantly shaped contemporary study of the **historical Jesus** by grounding Jesus’ messianic consciousness and Kingdom proclamation in Jewish context and scripture. His work has influenced both evangelical and critical scholarship, providing a robust defense of the plausibility of Jesus’ self-understanding as Messiah. Evans’ careful engagement with **Second Temple Judaism** and his emphasis on the eschatological dimension of Jesus’ message continue to inform debates on the nature of Jesus’ mission and identity.
