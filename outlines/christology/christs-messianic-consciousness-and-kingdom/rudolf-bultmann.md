# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** through the lens of existential interpretation and **demythologization**. He argued that Jesus’ proclamation of the Kingdom was not about an imminent, apocalyptic event, but a call to authentic existence in response to God’s eschatological act in the present. For Bultmann, the significance of Jesus as Messiah lies in the existential encounter with the **kerygma**, rather than in historical or psychological reconstructions of Jesus’ self-understanding.

- "The eschatological event is not a cosmic catastrophe but the decision of faith here and now." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Key Works

- Jesus and the Word (1926)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- New Testament and Mythology (1941)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of the Kingdom**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is not a future, supernatural realm but a present existential reality.
    - Apocalyptic language in the Gospels is mythological and must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - The message of Jesus is about decision and encounter, not about predicting historical events.
    - The Kingdom is realized wherever authentic faith responds to the divine call.
    - "Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God, but what he meant was the possibility of authentic existence." (Jesus and the Word)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Messianic Consciousness**
    - Jesus’ self-understanding as Messiah is accessible only through the existential impact of his message.
    - The historical Jesus’ psychology is ultimately inaccessible and theologically irrelevant.
    - The significance of Christ lies in the proclamation (kerygma), not in reconstructing his inner life.
    - Faith arises from the existential challenge posed by the Christ-event, not from historical certainty.
    - "We can know almost nothing concerning the life and personality of Jesus." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

3. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The **kerygma** is the proclamation of Christ as the decisive event for faith.
    - The meaning of Jesus’ messianic role is found in the existential response to the preached word.
    - The Kingdom is present wherever the kerygma is received in faith.
    - The church’s task is to proclaim, not to reconstruct historical details.
    - "Faith is decision in response to the kerygma, not assent to historical facts." (Theology of the New Testament)

4. **Rejection of Apocalyptic Expectation**
    - The early church’s expectation of an imminent end was a mythological misunderstanding.
    - Jesus’ message must be freed from first-century apocalypticism to speak to modern people.
    - The true eschatological crisis is the confrontation with God in the present.
    - The Kingdom is not about future fulfillment but present transformation.
    - "The eschatological event is the encounter with God’s word now." (History and Eschatology)

5. **Faith as Existential Decision**
    - Authentic existence is realized in the decision of faith prompted by the proclamation of Christ.
    - The Kingdom is not entered by works or waiting, but by existential openness to God’s act.
    - Messianic consciousness is meaningful only as it evokes decision in the hearer.
    - Salvation is not a future event but a present reality for the one who believes.
    - "To believe in Christ is to be confronted by the demand for decision." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** profoundly shaped twentieth-century New Testament scholarship, especially through his program of demythologization and existential interpretation. His emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential decision of faith redirected theological focus from historical reconstruction to the transformative power of proclamation. While controversial, his work remains a touchstone for debates about the relevance of biblical eschatology and the meaning of Jesus’ message for modern faith.
