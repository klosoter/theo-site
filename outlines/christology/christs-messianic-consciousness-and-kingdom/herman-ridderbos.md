# Herman Ridderbos (1909–2007)

Herman Ridderbos offered a robustly **redemptive-historical** understanding of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God**, emphasizing their centrality in the unfolding of **biblical revelation**. He argued that Jesus’ self-understanding as Messiah is inseparable from His proclamation and inauguration of the **Kingdom**, which is both a present reality and an eschatological hope, rooted in the fulfillment of Old Testament promises.

- "The Kingdom of God is the central theme of Jesus’ proclamation as it is presented to us in the Synoptic Gospels." (The Coming of the Kingdom)

## Key Works

- The Coming of the Kingdom (Het Komst van het Koninkrijk)

- Redemptive History and the New Testament Scriptures
- When the Time Had Fully Come: Studies in New Testament Theology
- Studies in Scripture and Its Authority

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Kingdom as Central to Jesus’ Mission**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is the organizing principle of Jesus’ teaching and ministry.
    - Jesus’ miracles and exorcisms are signs of the Kingdom’s arrival.
    - The Kingdom is both **already present** in Christ and **not yet** fully consummated.
    - Jesus’ messianic identity is revealed through His Kingdom proclamation.
    - "The coming of the Kingdom is the coming of God’s redemptive rule in history." (The Coming of the Kingdom)

2. **Messianic Self-Consciousness Rooted in Scripture**
    - Jesus’ self-understanding is shaped by Old Testament **messianic prophecies**.
    - He identifies Himself as the **Son of Man** and **Servant of the Lord**.
    - Jesus’ actions and words fulfill the typological patterns of Israel’s story.
    - His messianic consciousness is not imposed by later church reflection but is intrinsic to His ministry.
    - "Jesus’ consciousness of His mission is inseparable from the Old Testament promises." (The Coming of the Kingdom)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Interpretation**
    - The meaning of Christ’s work unfolds within the **history of redemption**.
    - The Kingdom is not an abstract ideal but a concrete, historical reality inaugurated in Jesus.
    - Ridderbos rejects purely existential or ethical interpretations of the Kingdom.
    - The **eschatological** dimension of the Kingdom shapes the church’s identity and mission.
    - "The Kingdom is a redemptive-historical event, not merely a spiritual or moral principle." (The Coming of the Kingdom)

4. **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**
    - The Kingdom is present in Jesus’ ministry but awaits final consummation.
    - This tension explains the paradoxes in Jesus’ teaching about the Kingdom.
    - Believers live in the overlap of the ages, experiencing both fulfillment and anticipation.
    - The church is the community of those who participate in the inaugurated Kingdom.
    - "The Kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope." (The Coming of the Kingdom)

5. **Authority of Christ and Scripture**
    - Jesus speaks and acts with divine authority as the Messiah.
    - The New Testament’s witness to Christ’s messianic consciousness is trustworthy and authoritative.
    - Ridderbos upholds the **organic inspiration** and unity of Scripture.
    - The authority of Christ undergirds the authority of apostolic teaching about the Kingdom.
    - "The authority of Jesus is the authority of the Kingdom itself." (Redemptive History and the New Testament Scriptures)

## Legacy and Impact

Ridderbos’s **redemptive-historical** approach profoundly shaped Reformed biblical theology, especially in understanding the **Kingdom of God** as central to Jesus’ self-understanding and mission. His work provided a corrective to both liberal and existential readings of the Gospels, emphasizing the continuity of **biblical revelation** and the eschatological nature of Christ’s messianic consciousness. Ridderbos’s influence endures in contemporary discussions of New Testament theology and the interpretation of Jesus’ proclamation of the Kingdom.
