# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** through the lens of his existential and ontological theology. For Tillich, Christ is the **New Being** who manifests the **Kingdom** as the actualization of ultimate concern and the reconciliation of estranged existence with the **Ground of Being**. The messianic consciousness is not a psychological state but the existential realization of unity between the divine and the human.

- "The Kingdom of God is the actualization of the unity of the divine and the human, the fulfillment of the New Being in history." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially sections on Christology and the Kingdom)
- The New Being
- The Interpretation of History
- The Protestant Era
- A History of Christian Thought

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the New Being**
   - Christ represents the existential answer to human estrangement.
   - The **New Being** is the manifestation of the union between the divine and human.
   - Christ’s messianic consciousness is the awareness of this unique ontological unity.
   - The Kingdom is realized wherever this New Being breaks into existence.
   - "In him the gap between essential and existential being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Kingdom of God as Symbolic Actualization**
   - The Kingdom is not a political or historical program but a symbol of ultimate reconciliation.
   - It points to the fulfillment of history in the unity of divine and human.
   - The Kingdom is present wherever the power of the New Being transforms reality.
   - Its realization is always partial and anticipatory in history.
   - "The Kingdom of God is a symbol for the state of things in which the separation between God and man is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Messianic Consciousness as Existential Awareness**
   - Christ’s messianic consciousness is not a subjective self-understanding but an existential state.
   - It is the consciousness of being the bearer of the New Being.
   - This consciousness is inseparable from Christ’s function as the center of history.
   - It is the foundation for the proclamation of the Kingdom.
   - "The messianic consciousness is the awareness of being the bearer of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Revelation as Event of the Kingdom**
   - Revelation occurs as the event in which the Kingdom is made manifest.
   - Christ is the locus of this revelatory event, embodying the unity of divine and human.
   - The Kingdom is disclosed wherever revelation overcomes estrangement.
   - The event of revelation is existential, not merely doctrinal or historical.
   - "Revelation is the event in which the Kingdom of God becomes real in the midst of estrangement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Eschatology as Present and Future**
   - The Kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope.
   - Its presence is experienced in moments of reconciliation and healing.
   - The future aspect points to the ultimate fulfillment of the New Being.
   - Eschatology is existential, relating to the transformation of being, not merely end-times chronology.
   - "The Kingdom of God is present wherever the New Being is manifest, and it is future as the ultimate fulfillment of history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s interpretation of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** has profoundly shaped existential and ontological approaches to Christology in modern theology. His emphasis on the **New Being** and the symbolic nature of the Kingdom challenged traditional historicist and literalist readings, influencing both Protestant and ecumenical thought. Tillich’s work continues to provoke dialogue on the meaning of Christ’s person and work in relation to human existence and the ultimate concerns of faith.
