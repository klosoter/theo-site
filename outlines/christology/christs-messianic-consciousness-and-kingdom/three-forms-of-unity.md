# Three Forms of Unity (1561–1619)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a classic **Reformed Christology** that emphasizes Christ’s full awareness of his **messianic office** and the inauguration of the **Kingdom of God**. These confessions present Christ as the unique **Mediator**, fulfilling **Old Testament prophecy** and consciously obeying the Father’s redemptive plan as **Prophet, Priest, and King**.

- "Our Lord Jesus Christ was ordained with an oath to be an eternal King, who cannot be dethroned." (Belgic Confession, Art. 26)

## Key Works

- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 18–21, 26
- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 31, 34, 50–52
- The Canons of Dort (1619), especially Head II
- The Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles’, Nicene, Athanasian), as referenced in the confessions
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.

   - His messianic identity is rooted in fulfilling all **Old Testament types and promises**.
   - The confessions stress his active and willing obedience in each office.
   - The **kingdom** is inaugurated through his mediatorial work.
   "Why is he called 'Christ,' that is, Anointed? Because he has been ordained by God the Father and anointed with the Holy Spirit to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, our only High Priest, and our eternal King." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 31)

2. **Messianic Consciousness and Obedience**
   - Christ’s self-understanding as **Messiah** is explicit and essential to his mission.
   - He willingly submits to the Father’s will, knowing himself as the promised **Redeemer**.
   - His obedience is both representative and vicarious for the elect.
   - The confessions highlight his conscious fulfillment of the law and prophets.
   "He presented himself in our place before his Father, appeasing God’s wrath by his full obedience." (Belgic Confession, Art. 21)

3. **Kingdom of God Inaugurated in Christ**
   - The **kingdom** is not merely future but begins with Christ’s earthly ministry.
   - Christ reigns now at the right hand of the Father, gathering and defending his church.
   - The confessions connect Christ’s kingship to the defeat of sin, death, and the devil.
   - The kingdom’s present reality is spiritual, awaiting consummation at Christ’s return.
   "He is head of the church, which he has redeemed by his blood, and he governs us by his Word and Spirit." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 50)

4. **Fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecy**
   - Christ is the promised seed, the true Davidic King, and the fulfillment of all **messianic types**.
   - The confessions stress the unity of **redemptive history** centered on Christ.
   - His messianic work is anticipated in the law, prophets, and psalms.
   - The kingdom is the realization of God’s covenant promises to Israel.
   "We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the eternal Son of God... and that he is the promised Messiah." (Belgic Confession, Art. 19)

5. **Christ’s Ongoing Reign and Eschatological Consummation**
   - Christ’s messianic reign continues until all enemies are subdued.
   - The confessions affirm his return to judge and consummate the kingdom.
   - Believers share in his anointing and are called to live as citizens of his kingdom.
   - The hope of the church is grounded in Christ’s present and future kingship.
   "He will come again to judge the living and the dead, and to take me and all his chosen ones to himself into heavenly joy and glory." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 52)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and Christology, providing a confessional foundation for understanding Christ’s messianic identity and the nature of his kingdom. Their articulation of the **threefold office** and the inaugurated-yet-future kingdom remains central in Reformed theology and worship. These confessions continue to guide churches worldwide in proclaiming Christ as the conscious, reigning Messiah who fulfills all God’s promises.
