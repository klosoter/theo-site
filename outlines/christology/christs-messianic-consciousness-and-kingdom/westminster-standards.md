# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **Christ’s messianic office** and the **Kingdom of God**, emphasizing Christ’s full awareness of His identity and mission as the Mediator. They present Christ as the divinely appointed **Prophet, Priest, and King**, whose consciousness of His messianic role is integral to the accomplishment of redemption and the establishment of His spiritual kingdom. The Standards underscore the inaugurated yet not fully consummated nature of Christ’s kingdom, rooted in His person and work.

- "Christ, the only Mediator between God and man, was called to be Prophet, Priest, and King; the Head and Savior of his Church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world." (Westminster Larger Catechism Q. 42)

## Key Works

- The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)
- The Westminster Larger Catechism (1647)
- The Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647)
- The Directory for Public Worship (1645)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Threefold Office**
   - Christ is explicitly presented as **Prophet, Priest, and King**, fulfilling all Old Testament messianic expectations.
   - His messianic consciousness is evident in His self-understanding and execution of these offices.
   - The Standards affirm that Christ’s offices are essential to His mediatorial work and the establishment of His kingdom.
   - Each office is exercised in both His state of humiliation and exaltation.
   - "Christ executeth the office of a prophet, in revealing to the church, in all ages, by his Spirit and word, in divers ways of administration, the whole will of God, in all things concerning their edification and salvation." (WLC Q. 43)

2. **The Kingdom of Christ is Spiritual and Redemptive**
   - The kingdom is primarily spiritual, not political, and is advanced through the means of grace.
   - Christ’s reign is exercised over His church and in the hearts of believers.
   - The Standards distinguish between the visible and invisible aspects of the kingdom.
   - The consummation of the kingdom awaits Christ’s return, but its inauguration is present in His first coming.
   - "Christ doth execute the office of a king, in calling out of the world a people to himself, and giving them officers, laws, and censures, by which he visibly governs them." (WSC Q. 26)

3. **Messianic Consciousness Rooted in Divine Appointment**
   - Christ’s awareness of His messianic identity is grounded in His eternal appointment by the Father.
   - The Standards stress the covenant of redemption as the context for Christ’s messianic mission.
   - Christ willingly undertook the work of Mediator, fully conscious of His role.
   - His obedience and suffering are presented as voluntary and purposeful.
   - "It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus... to be the Mediator between God and man." (WCF 8.1)

4. **Fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecy**
   - The Standards affirm that Christ fulfills all **typological and prophetic anticipations** of the Messiah.
   - His kingdom is the realization of the promises made to Abraham, David, and the prophets.
   - The unity of Scripture is maintained through Christ’s fulfillment of redemptive history.
   - The messianic consciousness of Christ is seen as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.
   - "Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance, was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments." (WCF 7.6)

5. **Christ’s Kingdom and the Church**
   - The visible church is the primary sphere of Christ’s kingdom on earth.
   - Christ governs the church by His Word and Spirit, exercising His kingly authority.
   - The Standards emphasize the church’s role in manifesting the kingdom until its consummation.
   - The church’s ordinances, discipline, and worship are means by which Christ’s reign is expressed.
   - "Unto this catholic visible church Christ hath given the ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God, for the gathering and perfecting of the saints." (WCF 25.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed ecclesiology** and Christology, providing a foundational articulation of Christ’s messianic consciousness and the nature of His kingdom. Their emphasis on the spiritual and redemptive character of Christ’s reign has influenced Presbyterian and broader Protestant theology. The Standards’ careful integration of biblical prophecy, covenant theology, and the threefold office of Christ continues to inform contemporary discussions on the kingdom of God and the identity of Jesus as Messiah.
