# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame approaches **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** through the lens of his **tri-perspectivalism**, emphasizing the unity of Christ’s self-understanding, redemptive mission, and authority. He stresses that Jesus was fully aware of his **messianic identity** and inaugurated the **Kingdom** in his person and work, integrating **biblical theology** and **systematic categories** to show how Christ’s kingship is central to the gospel.

- "Jesus is the Messiah, the King, and he knows it; his consciousness of his mission is evident throughout the Gospels." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of God
- The Doctrine of the Word of God
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Messianic Self-Consciousness**
    - Jesus possessed a clear and unique awareness of his **divine mission** and identity as Messiah.
    - The Gospels present Christ as deliberately fulfilling **Old Testament prophecy**.
    - Jesus’ teachings and actions consistently reveal his self-understanding as the promised King.
    - Frame argues that Christ’s consciousness is foundational for understanding the **Kingdom**.
    - "Jesus’ messianic consciousness is not a later theological imposition but is integral to the Gospel accounts." (Systematic Theology)

2. **The Kingdom as God’s Rule in Christ**
    - The **Kingdom of God** is fundamentally the reign of God manifested in the person and work of Jesus.
    - Christ inaugurates the Kingdom through his life, death, and resurrection.
    - The Kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope, rooted in Christ’s authority.
    - Frame connects the Kingdom to the fulfillment of **God’s covenant promises**.
    - "The kingdom is present wherever Jesus is acknowledged as Lord." (Systematic Theology)

3. **Tri-Perspectival Approach to Christ’s Kingship**
    - Frame applies his **normative, situational, and existential perspectives** to Christ’s messianic role.
    - The normative perspective highlights Christ’s fulfillment of Scripture and law.
    - The situational perspective examines Christ’s works and miracles as signs of the Kingdom.
    - The existential perspective considers the believer’s personal relationship to Christ the King.
    - "Each perspective reveals the fullness of Christ’s messianic office and kingdom." (Doctrine of God)

4. **Integration of Biblical and Systematic Theology**
    - Frame insists on the unity of **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** in understanding Christ.
    - He traces the theme of the Kingdom from Genesis to Revelation, centering on Jesus.
    - Systematic categories such as **Christology** and **eschatology** are grounded in the biblical narrative.
    - This integration guards against reductionism and preserves the richness of Christ’s messianic work.
    - "Systematic theology must always be rooted in the biblical storyline, especially regarding Christ and his kingdom." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Christ’s Authority and Lordship**
    - Jesus’ messianic consciousness is inseparable from his **divine authority**.
    - Frame emphasizes the comprehensive Lordship of Christ over all creation.
    - The Kingdom is not merely spiritual but encompasses all spheres of life under Christ’s rule.
    - Obedience to Christ is the proper response to his messianic kingship.
    - "To confess Jesus as Messiah is to submit to his lordship in every area of life." (Doctrine of the Christian Life)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the **Kingdom of God** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially through his tri-perspectival method. His work has encouraged theologians and pastors to integrate biblical and systematic approaches, emphasizing the centrality of Christ’s kingship for doctrine and discipleship. Frame’s influence endures in discussions of **Christology**, the Kingdom, and the practical implications of Jesus’ lordship for the church and the world.
