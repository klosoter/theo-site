# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** within the framework of **Reformed Christology** and **covenant theology**. He maintained that Christ possessed a perfect and infallible awareness of His **messianic office** and the nature of the **Kingdom of God**, grounding this in the **hypostatic union** and the fullness of the **Spirit** given to Christ.

- "Christ was not ignorant of his own office, but from the beginning of his ministry, and even from the womb, he was conscious of his Messiahship and the work for which he was sent." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 13.14.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics XIII–XIV)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected sermons and disputations on the person and offices of Christ
- Secondary: Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (for context on Turretin’s Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Full Messianic Self-Consciousness of Christ**
   - Christ possessed an unbroken, infallible awareness of His identity as the Messiah.
   - This consciousness was present from the moment of the incarnation, not acquired gradually.
   - Rooted in the **hypostatic union**, Christ’s divine nature ensured perfect knowledge.
   - Christ’s self-understanding was essential for the fulfillment of His mediatorial work.
   - "He could not have been the true Messiah if he had been ignorant of his own office." (Institutes, 13.14.6)

2. **Kingdom as Spiritual and Redemptive**
   - Turretin emphasized the **Kingdom of God** as primarily spiritual, not political.
   - The kingdom is inaugurated through Christ’s redemptive work and reigns in the hearts of believers.
   - Christ’s miracles and teachings manifest the presence and nature of the kingdom.
   - The consummation of the kingdom awaits Christ’s return, but its reality is present now.
   - "The kingdom of Christ is not of this world, but spiritual and heavenly." (Institutes, 14.2.6)

3. **Messianic Office as Prophet, Priest, and King**
   - Christ’s messianic consciousness included His threefold office: **prophet, priest, and king**.
   - Each office is exercised in perfect knowledge and obedience to the Father’s will.
   - The unity of these offices is essential to Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - Christ’s kingship is exercised both in grace (church) and in power (over all creation).
   - "He was anointed to be prophet, priest, and king, and was always conscious of this threefold office." (Institutes, 14.3.2)

4. **Scriptural Fulfillment and Self-Understanding**
   - Christ’s messianic consciousness is demonstrated by His self-identification with Old Testament prophecy.
   - Turretin argued that Christ interpreted His mission in light of the Scriptures.
   - The fulfillment of prophecy is central to Christ’s understanding of His kingdom.
   - Christ’s use of messianic titles and references to His mission show deliberate scriptural awareness.
   - "He applied to himself the prophecies concerning the Messiah, showing his clear knowledge of them." (Institutes, 14.3.5)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s Knowledge**
   - Christ was endowed with the fullness of the **Holy Spirit**, granting Him all necessary knowledge.
   - The Spirit’s anointing was without measure, ensuring Christ’s perfect awareness of His mission.
   - This fullness enabled Christ to reveal the mysteries of the kingdom authoritatively.
   - The Spirit’s work in Christ is a model for the Spirit’s work in believers.
   - "The Spirit was given to Christ without measure, so that he might perfectly know and reveal the will of God." (Institutes, 13.14.8)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of **Christ’s messianic consciousness** and the nature of the **Kingdom of God** became foundational for later Reformed orthodoxy. His careful defense of Christ’s self-awareness and the spiritual character of the kingdom influenced subsequent confessional theology and polemics against Socinian and rationalist denials of Christ’s knowledge. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions of **Christ’s offices** and the continuity of redemptive history, shaping both academic and ecclesiastical understandings of Christ’s person and work.
