# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as foundational to orthodox **Trinitarian theology**, maintaining that the **Incarnation** is the historical manifestation of the preexistent **Son** assuming a human nature. He insists that the **Son’s identity** is not constituted by the Incarnation but is revealed through it, and that the **Trinity** is fully present and active in the redemptive mission of Christ. Letham’s approach is marked by careful engagement with **patristic sources** and a robust defense of **Nicene orthodoxy**.

- "The Son did not become Son by virtue of the incarnation; he was always the Son, eternally begotten of the Father." ("The Holy Trinity", p. 115)

- Systematic Theology (2019)

- The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context (2009)
- "The Eternal Generation of the Son" (chapter in The Holy Trinity)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The **Son** is eternally begotten of the **Father**, not made, affirming the classic Nicene formula.
    - Eternal generation distinguishes the persons within the **Godhead** without implying subordination.
    - This doctrine safeguards the Son’s full **deity** and equality with the Father.
    - Letham draws on patristic and Reformed sources to defend this against modern denials.
    - "The eternal generation of the Son is the linchpin of orthodox Trinitarianism." ("The Holy Trinity", p. 112)

2. **Incarnation as Assumption, Not Transformation**
    - The **Incarnation** is the eternal Son taking on a human nature, not the Son becoming or changing into something else.
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of Christ, without confusion or division.
    - The Son’s divine identity remains unchanged in the Incarnation.
    - Letham upholds **Chalcedonian Christology** as the standard for understanding the Incarnation.
    - "The Son assumes humanity; he does not become a human person." ("Systematic Theology", p. 505)

3. **Distinction and Unity in the Trinity**
    - The **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Spirit** are distinct persons sharing the same divine essence.
    - The Son’s eternal relation to the Father grounds his identity as Son, not the act of Incarnation.
    - The unity of the Godhead is not compromised by the Son’s mission.
    - Letham rejects any form of **subordinationism** or modalism.
    - "The persons are distinguished by their relations of origin, not by their roles in the economy." ("The Holy Trinity", p. 148)

4. **Revelation of the Son’s Identity in the Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation reveals, rather than constitutes, the Son’s eternal identity.
    - The Son’s mission is rooted in his eternal relationship with the Father.
    - The **Incarnation** is the historical outworking of the eternal counsel of the **Trinity**.
    - Letham emphasizes the continuity between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity**.
    - "The incarnation is the visible manifestation of the eternal Sonship." ("The Holy Trinity", p. 119)

5. **Patristic and Reformed Foundations**
    - Letham draws heavily on **Athanasius**, the Cappadocians, and Reformed confessions.
    - He argues that the **Westminster Standards** presuppose eternal Sonship and orthodox Christology.
    - He critiques modern evangelical departures from classical Trinitarian doctrine.
    - Letham insists on the necessity of historical theology for doctrinal clarity.
    - "The Reformed tradition stands firmly within the Nicene and Chalcedonian consensus." ("The Holy Trinity", p. 121)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s work has reinforced the centrality of **eternal Sonship** and the classical doctrine of the **Incarnation** within contemporary Reformed theology. His careful retrieval of patristic sources and engagement with the **Westminster Confession** have shaped modern discussions on the Trinity and Christology. Letham’s influence is evident in renewed interest in the **doctrine of eternal generation** and in the defense of Nicene orthodoxy against revisionist trends. His writings continue to serve as key resources for students and pastors seeking clarity on these foundational doctrines.
