# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, maintaining that the **second person of the Trinity** is eternally begotten of the Father and fully divine. He emphasized the **Incarnation** as the historical event in which the eternal Son assumed true humanity for the sake of redemption, insisting on the unity of the **person of Christ** without confusion or division of natures.

- "He did not begin to be the Son of God at Bethlehem, but He was the Son of God from eternity." (Sermons on John)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Large Catechism (1529)
- The Smalcald Articles (1537)
- Sermons on John (various years)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - Christ is the **eternally begotten** Son, not created or made.
    - The distinction between the **persons of the Trinity** is maintained without division of essence.
    - The Son shares fully in the divine nature with the Father and the Spirit.
    - The Son’s eternal Sonship grounds His authority and mission in redemption.
    - "The Son is begotten from eternity by the Father in an ineffable manner." (Large Catechism)

2. **True Incarnation of the Eternal Son**
    - The eternal Son became truly human in the person of Jesus Christ.
    - The Incarnation involved the assumption of a complete human nature, body and soul.
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of Christ.
    - The Incarnation is for the purpose of **redemption** and reconciliation.
    - "The Word became flesh, that is, the Son of God became man." (Sermons on John)

3. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Attributes)**
    - The attributes of both natures are ascribed to the one person of Christ.
    - The divine nature does not suffer, but the person who is God suffers in the flesh.
    - This union preserves the integrity of both natures without confusion.
    - The communication of attributes is essential for understanding Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "God cannot die, but He who is God dies in the person of Christ." (Smalcald Articles)

4. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Arianism**
    - Luther opposes any view that denies the eternal deity of the Son.
    - Adoptionism and Arianism are seen as heresies that undermine salvation.
    - The Son is not a creature nor merely adopted as Son at the Incarnation.
    - The full deity of Christ is necessary for the efficacy of His atoning work.
    - "He is not a created or adopted Son, but the true and natural Son of God." (Large Catechism)

5. **Christ’s Person as the Center of Salvation**
    - The unity of the divine and human natures in Christ is essential for redemption.
    - Only the God-man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The Incarnation is the foundation for justification by faith.
    - The believer’s union with Christ depends on the reality of the Incarnation.
    - "Our salvation depends on this, that God and man are one person in Christ." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust affirmation of the **eternal Sonship** and true **Incarnation** of Christ shaped Protestant confessional theology, particularly in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. His articulation of the **communication of attributes** influenced later Christological debates and confessions. Luther’s Christology remains central to discussions of the person and work of Christ, ensuring that the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures are foundational for evangelical soteriology.
