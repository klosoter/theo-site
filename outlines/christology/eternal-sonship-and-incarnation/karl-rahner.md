# Karl Rahner (1904–1984)

Karl Rahner’s approach to the **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** is marked by his insistence on the unity of the **economic** and **immanent Trinity**, and his development of the “Rahner’s Rule” that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa. He emphasizes the **self-communication of God** in the Incarnation, seeing the **Son’s eternal generation** as inseparable from his historical manifestation in Jesus Christ. Rahner’s theology seeks to safeguard both the transcendence of the divine Logos and the radical nearness of God in the **hypostatic union**.

- "The 'economic' Trinity is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity." (The Trinity)

## Key Works

- The Trinity (Grundkurs des Glaubens)
- Foundations of Christian Faith
- Hearers of the Word
- Theological Investigations (various volumes, especially VI and IV)
- Christology within an Evolutionary View of the World

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Economic and Immanent Trinity**
   - The distinction between **economic** and **immanent Trinity** is real but not a separation.
   - The revelation of God in history (Incarnation) truly expresses God’s eternal being.
   - The **Son’s eternal Sonship** is not altered by the Incarnation, but made manifest.
   - The divine missions reflect and reveal the eternal processions.
   - "The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa." (The Trinity)

2. **Self-Communication of God**
   - God’s self-gift reaches its climax in the Incarnation of the Son.
   - The Incarnation is the definitive event of God’s **self-communication** to humanity.
   - The Son’s eternal generation is the ground for his historical mission.
   - The Incarnation is not a mere appearance but a real assumption of human nature.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God’s self-communication is irrevocably and definitively given." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

3. **Hypostatic Union**
   - The divine and human natures are united in the one person (hypostasis) of the Son.
   - The union does not compromise the integrity of either nature.
   - The eternal Son truly becomes man without ceasing to be God.
   - The Incarnation is the unique and unrepeatable event of union between God and creation.
   - "The hypostatic union is the unsurpassable self-communication of God." (Theological Investigations IV)

4. **Eternal Sonship**
   - The Son’s identity as Son is rooted in his eternal relationship to the Father.
   - The Incarnation presupposes and reveals the Son’s eternal generation.
   - The Son’s mission in time is grounded in his eternal origin from the Father.
   - The distinction of persons in the Trinity is essential for understanding the Incarnation.
   - "The Son is sent because he is eternally from the Father." (The Trinity)

5. **Christology and Anthropology**
   - The Incarnation reveals the true destiny of humanity in union with God.
   - Human nature is elevated, not abolished, in the union with the divine.
   - The Incarnation is the model and ground of God’s presence in all creation.
   - The mystery of Christ is inseparable from the mystery of human existence.
   - "The Incarnation is the unique and universal event in which God and man are one." (Foundations of Christian Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Rahner’s articulation of the **unity of the economic and immanent Trinity** has profoundly shaped modern Catholic and ecumenical theology, especially in discussions of the **Incarnation** and the doctrine of God. His emphasis on God’s self-communication and the centrality of the **hypostatic union** has influenced contemporary Christology and the understanding of revelation. Rahner’s thought continues to provoke dialogue and debate, particularly regarding the relationship between divine transcendence and immanence in the mystery of the **Eternal Sonship**.
