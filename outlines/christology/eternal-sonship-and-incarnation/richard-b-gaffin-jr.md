# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as foundational to orthodox **Trinitarian theology** and insists that the **incarnation** does not alter the Son’s divine identity but introduces a new mode of existence as the **God-man**. He emphasizes the unity of the **person of Christ** across both natures, maintaining the full reality of both **pre-existence** and **historical incarnation** within the framework of **redemptive history**.

- "The Son is eternally the Son, and the incarnation is the assumption of human nature by the eternal Son, not the origin of his Sonship." (The Centrality of the Resurrection, 2003)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Theology
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- "The Trinity and the Incarnation" (in The Glory of the Atonement, ed. Hill & Letham)
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship is Essential to Trinitarian Doctrine**
    - The Son’s identity as Son is not contingent upon the incarnation but is an eternal reality within the **Godhead**.
    - The distinction of persons in the **Trinity** is grounded in eternal relations, not in the economy of redemption.
    - The **Father-Son relationship** precedes and grounds the historical mission of Christ.
    - Any denial of eternal Sonship undermines the coherence of **orthodox Christology**.
    - "The incarnation presupposes, it does not constitute, the Son’s Sonship." (The Centrality of the Resurrection)

2. **Incarnation as Assumption, Not Transformation**
    - The **incarnation** is the eternal Son taking on a human nature, not a change in his divine essence.
    - The Son remains fully God while becoming fully man, preserving the integrity of both natures.
    - The **hypostatic union** ensures that the divine and human natures are united in one person without confusion.
    - The incarnation is a redemptive-historical event, not an ontological alteration of the Son.
    - "The incarnation is the assumption of human nature by the eternal Son, not the origin of his Sonship." (The Centrality of the Resurrection)

3. **Redemptive-Historical Emphasis**
    - The incarnation is interpreted within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - Christ’s work is inseparable from his person as the eternal Son who enters history.
    - The resurrection and exaltation are seen as climactic events in the incarnate Son’s mission.
    - The eternal Son’s mission is oriented toward the accomplishment of redemption in time.
    - "The resurrection is the redemptive-historical transition point for the incarnate Son." (Resurrection and Redemption)

4. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - The same person, the eternal Son, is the subject of both divine and human actions.
    - There is no division or confusion between the two natures in the **one person** of Christ.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** (communication of properties) is grounded in the unity of the person.
    - The incarnate Son’s obedience and suffering are the acts of the eternal Son in human nature.
    - "The unity of the person is the indispensable presupposition for understanding the work of Christ." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

5. **Orthodox Reformed Confessionalism**
    - Gaffin’s views are shaped by the **Westminster Standards** and classic Reformed confessions.
    - He upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the best summary of biblical teaching on Christ’s person.
    - The doctrines of **eternal generation** and **incarnation** are non-negotiable for Reformed orthodoxy.
    - He warns against any revisionist Christology that compromises these foundational truths.
    - "The Westminster Standards faithfully reflect the biblical teaching on the person and work of Christ." ("Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust defense of **eternal Sonship** and his careful articulation of the **incarnation** have reinforced confessional orthodoxy within Reformed circles. His redemptive-historical approach has shaped generations of pastors and scholars, especially at Westminster Theological Seminary. By insisting on the unity of Christ’s person and the integrity of both natures, Gaffin has provided a clear framework for understanding the mystery of the God-man in the context of salvation history. His influence endures in contemporary discussions of Christology and the doctrine of the Trinity.
