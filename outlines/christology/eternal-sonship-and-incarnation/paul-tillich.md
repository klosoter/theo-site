# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the doctrines of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** through his method of **correlation**, emphasizing the symbolic and existential significance of Christ as the **New Being**. For Tillich, the **Sonship of Christ** is not a metaphysical assertion about pre-existent divine persons, but a symbol expressing the unity of the divine and human in the event of the **Incarnation**, which reveals the depth of **God’s self-manifestation** in history.

- "The assertion that Jesus as the Christ is the Son of God is a symbolic expression for the decisive manifestation of the divine ground in him." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- The Shaking of the Foundations
- The New Being
- Christology and Symbolism (in Theology of Culture)
- A History of Christian Thought

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Nature of Eternal Sonship**
    - The term "Son of God" is a **symbol** pointing to the unique manifestation of the divine in Jesus.
    - Tillich rejects literal or metaphysical interpretations of **eternal generation**.
    - The **Sonship** expresses the existential relationship between God and humanity.
    - Christ’s Sonship is meaningful only within the context of **revelation** and **history**.
    - "The phrase 'Son of God' is a symbol, not a description of a metaphysical process." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Incarnation as the Manifestation of the New Being**
    - The **Incarnation** is the event in which the **New Being** appears, overcoming existential estrangement.
    - It is not a physical or ontological change in God, but a **revelatory event**.
    - The union of divine and human in Christ is existential, not metaphysical.
    - The **Incarnation** is the answer to the human condition of **alienation**.
    - "The Incarnation is the appearance of the New Being under the conditions of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Substantialist Christology**
    - Tillich critiques traditional **substance metaphysics** in Christology.
    - He views classical formulations (e.g., Chalcedon) as inadequate for modern existential understanding.
    - Christ’s divinity and humanity are not substances but **dimensions of being**.
    - The focus is on the existential impact of Christ, not on ontological definitions.
    - "The Christological dogma must be interpreted in terms of existential symbols." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Doctrine of the Logos as Mediation**
    - The **Logos** is the principle of mediation between God and the world.
    - In Christ, the **Logos** is fully actualized as the bearer of the **New Being**.
    - The Logos is not a second divine person but the **self-manifestation** of God.
    - The Logos concept bridges the gap between **transcendence** and **immanence**.
    - "The Logos is the self-manifestation of the divine ground of being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Existential Significance of Christ’s Sonship**
    - Christ’s **Sonship** reveals the possibility of authentic human existence.
    - The New Being in Christ offers **reconciliation** and **healing** from estrangement.
    - The existential encounter with Christ transforms the believer’s relationship to God.
    - The meaning of **Eternal Sonship** is found in its power to address the human predicament.
    - "The Christ is the New Being; as such, he is the answer to the question implied in our existence." (The New Being)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** challenged traditional dogmatic categories, influencing modern **systematic theology** and existential approaches to Christology. His emphasis on **symbolism** and the existential dimension of doctrine provided a framework for engaging contemporary philosophical questions. While controversial among orthodox theologians, Tillich’s work remains a significant reference point for discussions on the meaning of **Incarnation** and the relevance of Christ in a secular age.
