# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, maintaining that the **Second Person of the Trinity** is eternally begotten of the Father and fully divine prior to the **Incarnation**. He insists that the **Word became flesh** without ceasing to be God, upholding the unity of Christ’s **divine and human natures** in the one person of the Son. Augustine’s articulation of these doctrines profoundly shaped Western understandings of **Christology** and the **Trinity**.

- "For the Word was made flesh, not by being changed into flesh, but by taking flesh to Himself." (On the Trinity, I.14)

## Key Works

- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Sermons on the New Testament (esp. Sermons 187–196)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei), esp. Book X
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Letters (Epistulae), esp. Letter 137

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not made, from the Father.
    - This generation is outside of time and does not imply inferiority or change.
    - The Son shares the same **divine essence** as the Father.
    - The distinction of persons in the Trinity is maintained without division of substance.
    - "The Son is begotten by the Father, and the Father is not begotten by the Son." (On the Trinity, I.11)

2. **Unchangeable Divinity of the Son**
    - The Son remains fully God before, during, and after the Incarnation.
    - The divine nature is impassible and immutable.
    - The Incarnation does not diminish or alter the Son’s divinity.
    - The Son’s assumption of humanity is an act of divine condescension, not change.
    - "He did not lose what He was, but began to be what He was not." (Sermon 187)

3. **True Incarnation: Word Became Flesh**
    - The **Word** assumed a complete human nature, body and soul.
    - The Incarnation is a unique event in which the divine and human are united in one person.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The purpose is the redemption of humanity through the God-man.
    - "He took upon Him what He was not, while remaining what He was." (On the Trinity, XIII.17)

4. **Unity of Person (Hypostatic Union)**
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of the Son.
    - There is no mixing or blending of the two natures.
    - The subject of all Christ’s actions is the one person, the Son.
    - The unity of person ensures the efficacy of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "Both natures met in one person, that is, in Christ." (Enchiridion, 35)

5. **Trinitarian Context of Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation is the work of the whole **Trinity**, though only the Son becomes incarnate.
    - The Father sends, the Son is sent, and the Spirit prepares the way.
    - The missions of the Son and Spirit reflect the eternal relations within the Godhead.
    - The Incarnation reveals the inner life of the Trinity to the world.
    - "The whole Trinity, therefore, accomplished the incarnation of the Son." (On the Trinity, II.7)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s robust articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** became foundational for Western **Trinitarian** and **Christological** thought. His distinctions regarding the unity of person and duality of natures influenced later councils, especially Chalcedon. Augustine’s insights continue to shape Reformed and Catholic theology, providing a framework for understanding the mystery of the Word made flesh. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the relationship between the **divine and human** in Christ.
