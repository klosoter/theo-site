# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge upheld the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as foundational to orthodox **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing that the **Second Person** of the **Godhead** is eternally begotten of the Father. He insisted that the **Incarnation** involved the eternal Son assuming a true human nature without ceasing to be fully divine, thus preserving both the unity and distinction within the **person of Christ**.

- "The Sonship of Christ, therefore, is not official or temporary, but eternal and necessary." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians
- Princeton Sermons

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son’s relationship to the Father is one of eternal generation, not creation or adoption.
    - This generation is a necessary, not voluntary, act within the Godhead.
    - The Son possesses the same **divine essence** as the Father.
    - The doctrine safeguards the full deity and distinct personhood of the Son.
    "The eternal generation of the Son is the only ground of the distinction of persons in the Godhead." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 1)

2. **Full Deity and Humanity in the Incarnation**
    - The **Incarnation** does not diminish or alter the divine nature of the Son.
    - Christ assumed a complete human nature—body and soul—without confusion or change.
    - The two natures are united in one person, the **hypostatic union**.
    - The Son remains eternally God while truly becoming man in time.
    "The two natures are united in one person, without mixture, confusion, or conversion." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

3. **Immutability of the Divine Son**
    - The Son’s divine nature remains immutable before, during, and after the Incarnation.
    - The Incarnation is an addition of human nature, not a change in the divine.
    - The Son’s eternal attributes are never compromised by his human experiences.
    - The distinction between the two natures is always maintained.
    "The Logos did not cease to be what He was, but became what He was not." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

4. **Personal Distinctions within the Trinity**
    - The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons, not merely modes or manifestations.
    - The Son’s Sonship is eternal, not a result of the Incarnation.
    - The personal properties (generation, procession) are essential to Trinitarian identity.
    - The Incarnation reveals but does not create these distinctions.
    "The distinction of persons in the Godhead is not founded on any external or temporal relations." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 1)

5. **Necessity of Eternal Sonship for Redemption**
    - Only the eternal Son can mediate between God and man.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work depends on his eternal divine identity.
    - The Incarnation is the means by which the eternal Son accomplishes redemption.
    - Denial of eternal Sonship undermines the basis for **substitutionary atonement**.
    "If Christ were not the eternal Son of God, He could not be the Redeemer." ("Systematic Theology," Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **eternal Sonship** and the orthodox doctrine of the **Incarnation** shaped generations of Reformed theology, especially at Princeton Seminary. His careful articulation of the **hypostatic union** and Trinitarian distinctions provided a bulwark against both Unitarian and modalist tendencies. Hodge’s influence persists in contemporary evangelical and confessional Reformed circles, where his systematic approach to Christology remains a standard reference.
