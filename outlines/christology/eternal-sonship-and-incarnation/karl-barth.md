# Karl Barth (1886–1968)

Karl Barth’s doctrine of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** is foundational to his **Christology** and his reconfiguration of **Trinitarian theology**. Barth insists that the **Son** is eternally God, distinct in person yet one in essence with the **Father** and **Spirit**, and that the **Incarnation** is the free, sovereign act of God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ, who is both fully divine and fully human.

- "The Son of God who became man is none other than the eternal Son of God." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship as Essential to the Trinity**
   - The **Son** is eternally begotten of the **Father**, not created or subordinate.
   - The distinction of persons in the **Trinity** is real and eternal, not merely economic.
   - The **Son’s** identity is not dependent on the Incarnation but is revealed through it.
   - The **Son** is the mediator of revelation and reconciliation from eternity.
   - "The Son is from eternity to eternity the Son of the Father." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

2. **Incarnation as God’s Self-Revelation**
   - The **Incarnation** is the event in which the eternal **Son** assumes human nature.
   - God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ is the center of all theology.
   - The **Word became flesh** without ceasing to be God.
   - The **Incarnation** is not a change in God but a new act of divine freedom.
   - "In Jesus Christ, God’s Word became flesh, and thus God Himself became visible and knowable." (Church Dogmatics I/2)

3. **Unity of Person in Christ**
   - Jesus Christ is one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human.
   - The **personal union** is grounded in the eternal identity of the **Son**.
   - There is no confusion or separation of the divine and human natures.
   - The subject of the **Incarnation** is always the eternal **Son**.
   - "He who became man in time was and is from all eternity God’s Son." (Church Dogmatics IV/1)

4. **Revelation and Election in the Son**
   - The **Son** is both the electing God and the elected man.
   - Election is realized in the person of Jesus Christ, the eternal **Son**.
   - The **Incarnation** is the fulfillment of God’s eternal purpose to reveal and reconcile.
   - The **Son** is the locus of both divine initiative and human response.
   - "Jesus Christ is both the electing God and elected man in one." (Church Dogmatics II/2)

5. **Rejection of Subordinationism**
   - The **Son** is equal in deity, glory, and majesty with the **Father** and **Spirit**.
   - Any subordination is only in the economy of salvation, not in the eternal being of God.
   - The **Son’s** obedience in the **Incarnation** does not imply inferiority.
   - The **Trinitarian** relations are relations of order, not rank or value.
   - "There is no subordination of the Son to the Father in the being of God." (Church Dogmatics I/1)

## Legacy and Impact

Barth’s robust articulation of the **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** has profoundly shaped modern **Trinitarian theology** and **Christology**, especially in the Reformed tradition. His insistence on the centrality of Jesus Christ as the revelation of God has redirected theological focus to the person and work of the incarnate Son. Barth’s rejection of subordinationism and his emphasis on the unity and distinction within the **Trinity** continue to influence contemporary debates on the doctrine of God. His work remains a touchstone for discussions of divine revelation, election, and the mystery of the **Incarnation**.
