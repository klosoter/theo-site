# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin robustly affirmed the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, distinguishing the Son’s eternal generation within the **Trinity** from his temporal **incarnation**. He argued that the Son’s divine personhood and relation to the Father precede and ground the assumption of human nature, maintaining the unity of the **person of Christ** while upholding the distinction between **nature** and **person**. Turretin’s careful scholastic distinctions aimed to safeguard both the full **deity** and true **humanity** of Christ.

- "The Son is called Son not from the incarnation, but from the eternal generation by the Father." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 3.27.6)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Vol. 2, Topics 13–14, 27)
- Compendium Theologiae Didactico-Elencticae
- Selected Theological Questions (Quaestiones Theologicae Selectae)
- Reformed Dogmatics (as summarized in secondary literature, e.g., R. Letham, The Holy Trinity)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation Distinct from Incarnation**
    - The **Son** is eternally begotten of the Father, not made or adopted.
    - **Incarnation** is a temporal event, not the origin of Sonship.
    - The **personal properties** of the Son (filiation) are eternal.
    - The Son’s deity is not contingent on the assumption of humanity.
    - "The Son is not called Son because he was incarnate, but he was incarnate because he was Son." (Institutes, 3.27.6)

2. **Unity of Person, Distinction of Natures**
    - Christ is one **person** in two distinct natures: divine and human.
    - The **hypostatic union** does not confuse or mix the natures.
    - The divine person of the Son assumes a complete human nature.
    - The union is personal, not essential or accidental.
    - "The Word was made flesh, not by conversion of the Word into flesh, but by assumption of the flesh to the Word." (Institutes, 3.27.10)

3. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - The **divine nature** of the Son remains unchanged in the incarnation.
    - The Son’s deity is not diminished or altered by becoming man.
    - The incarnation is a new relation, not a change in essence.
    - The Son’s actions in the flesh are those of the one divine person.
    - "The Word did not cease to be what he was, but began to be what he was not." (Institutes, 3.27.10)

4. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Socinianism**
    - Turretin opposes views that make Christ’s Sonship a result of the incarnation.
    - He refutes **Socinian** denials of the pre-existence and deity of Christ.
    - The Son’s filiation is ontological, not merely functional or economic.
    - Adoptionism undermines the eternal relations within the Trinity.
    - "The Socinians err in making Christ the Son of God only by reason of the incarnation." (Institutes, 3.27.8)

5. **Necessity of the Eternal Sonship for Redemption**
    - Only the **eternal Son** can mediate between God and man.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work depends on his divine personhood.
    - The incarnation is the means by which the eternal Son accomplishes redemption.
    - The Son’s pre-existence grounds the infinite value of his atonement.
    - "If Christ were not the eternal Son, he could not be the mediator and redeemer of men." (Institutes, 3.27.9)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s rigorous defense of the **eternal Sonship** and careful articulation of the **incarnation** shaped later Reformed orthodoxy and provided a bulwark against both **Socinian** and **Adoptionist** errors. His scholastic clarity influenced confessional formulations and remains a standard reference in discussions of **Christology**. Turretin’s distinctions continue to inform contemporary debates on the person and work of Christ within the Reformed tradition.
