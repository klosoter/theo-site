# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann’s doctrine of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** is shaped by his dynamic, relational **Trinitarian theology**. He insists that the Son’s eternal identity is inseparable from his incarnate suffering and solidarity with humanity, centering the **historical event of Jesus Christ** as the locus of divine self-revelation.

- "The history of Jesus is the history of God, and the history of God is the history of Jesus." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1990)
- The Way of Jesus Christ (1989)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship as Relational and Dynamic**
    - The Son’s eternal identity is defined by his relationship to the Father and Spirit within the **perichoretic Trinity**.
    - Rejects static, metaphysical notions of sonship in favor of a history-affirming approach.
    - The Son’s pre-existence is not abstract but oriented toward **incarnation and redemption**.
    - The eternal Son is always the one who will become incarnate for the world’s salvation.
    - "The Son is the Son in relation to the Father and the Spirit, and in relation to the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

2. **Incarnation as the Self-Emptying of God**
    - The **Incarnation** is the event where God enters into human suffering and history.
    - Emphasizes **kenosis** (self-emptying) as essential to the Son’s mission.
    - The incarnation is not a temporary act but reveals God’s eternal willingness to be with and for humanity.
    - The cross is the ultimate expression of the Son’s incarnate solidarity.
    - "God does not become a different God in the incarnation, but reveals his true being in self-giving love." (The Crucified God)

3. **Suffering of God in the Son**
    - The Son’s suffering is not merely human but is genuinely experienced by God.
    - Rejects the idea of divine **impassibility** in favor of a God who suffers with creation.
    - The cross is central: the **Eternal Son** is revealed in his abandonment and death.
    - The suffering of the Son is constitutive of his eternal identity.
    - "God is not greater than he is in Christ, nor is he any different from him." (The Crucified God)

4. **Trinitarian Fellowship in Incarnation**
    - The **Incarnation** is an act of the whole Trinity, not just the Son alone.
    - The Father, Son, and Spirit are mutually involved in the event of Jesus Christ.
    - The cross reveals the inner-trinitarian love and pain, not just a transaction.
    - The **Trinitarian fellowship** is opened to humanity through the incarnate Son.
    - "The cross is the open Trinity, suffering and loving for the world." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

5. **Eschatological Orientation of Sonship and Incarnation**
    - The **Eternal Sonship** is oriented toward the future consummation of all things.
    - The Incarnation initiates a new creation, pointing toward the resurrection and the coming kingdom.
    - The Son’s mission is not complete until the world is reconciled and renewed.
    - The **Incarnation** is both a historical event and an eschatological promise.
    - "The resurrection of the crucified Christ is the beginning of the new creation." (The Way of Jesus Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** has profoundly influenced contemporary **Trinitarian theology**, especially in its emphasis on divine suffering and relationality. His work challenged classical doctrines of **impassibility** and inspired theologians to rethink the meaning of God’s involvement in history. By rooting the Son’s eternal identity in the event of the cross, Moltmann has shaped ongoing debates about the relationship between **Christology** and the doctrine of God. His vision of a suffering, self-giving God continues to resonate in ecumenical and liberationist theological circles.
