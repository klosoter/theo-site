# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til maintained that the **Eternal Sonship** of Christ is foundational to orthodox **Trinitarianism** and that the **Incarnation** must be understood within the context of the ontological and economic distinctions within the **Godhead**. He emphasized the absolute **self-consistency** of God’s revelation, insisting that the Son’s eternal relationship to the Father is not subordinate in essence but only in role, and that the **Incarnation** is the historical manifestation of the Son’s eternal identity.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship is Essential to Trinitarianism**
    - The Son’s identity as Son is not derived from the Incarnation but is eternally grounded in the **immanent Trinity**.
    - Denial of the Son’s eternal generation undermines the unity and distinction within the **Godhead**.
    - The **Father-Son** relationship is ontological, not merely functional or economic.
    - The Son’s eternal Sonship is the basis for understanding the **Incarnation** as the coming of the pre-existent Son.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity requires that the Son is eternally the Son, not merely after the incarnation." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Incarnation as Historical Manifestation of the Eternal Son**
    - The **Incarnation** is the temporal event in which the eternal Son assumes a human nature.
    - The Son’s deity is not diminished or altered by the assumption of humanity.
    - The **hypostatic union** preserves the full divinity and full humanity of Christ in one person.
    - The Incarnation reveals, but does not create, the Son’s relationship to the Father.
    - "The incarnation is the coming into history of him who was eternally with the Father." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

3. **Revelation is Self-Consistent and Trinitarian**
    - All revelation is **Trinitarian** in character, reflecting the eternal distinctions within the Godhead.
    - The Son reveals the Father because he is eternally the Son, not merely functionally so.
    - The **Incarnation** is the climactic act of revelation, grounded in the eternal counsel of God.
    - Any doctrine of Christ must be consistent with the self-contained ontological Trinity.
    - "There is no revelation except the revelation of the triune God, and the Son is the revealer because he is eternally the Son." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Rejection of Subordinationism in the Trinity**
    - The Son’s subordination is economic, not ontological; he is equal in power and glory with the Father.
    - Eternal Sonship does not imply inferiority or derivation of essence.
    - The **Incarnation** involves voluntary submission, not essential subordination.
    - Any subordinationist Christology is a departure from orthodox **Reformed theology**.
    - "The Son is not less than the Father in being, but only subordinate in the work of redemption." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Covenantal Context of Incarnation and Sonship**
    - The **Incarnation** is the fulfillment of the eternal covenant within the Trinity.
    - The Son’s mission is rooted in the **covenantal agreement** between Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The eternal Son voluntarily undertakes the work of redemption as Mediator.
    - The covenantal framework safeguards both the unity and distinction of the persons in the Godhead.
    - "The covenant of redemption is the background for understanding the incarnation of the eternal Son." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s robust defense of the **Eternal Sonship** and his insistence on the ontological equality of the Son within the **Trinity** have shaped Reformed approaches to Christology and the doctrine of God. His integration of **covenantal** and Trinitarian categories has influenced generations of theologians, especially in the context of defending orthodox Christology against both subordinationism and modalism. Van Til’s thought continues to be a touchstone for discussions on the relationship between the **Incarnation** and the eternal relations within the Godhead.
