# Donald Macleod (1940–2023)

Donald Macleod robustly affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, insisting that the Son’s divine identity precedes and grounds the **Incarnation**. He maintains that the **hypostatic union** is the union of the eternal Son with a true human nature, without confusion or change, and that the Son’s pre-existence is essential for orthodox **Christology**. Macleod’s approach is marked by careful attention to the biblical witness and the classical **Reformed confessions**.

- "The Son did not become Son by virtue of the incarnation; he was the Son who became incarnate." ("The Person of Christ")

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (Contours of Christian Theology)
- Jesus is Lord: Christology Yesterday and Today
- A Faith to Live By: Understanding Christian Doctrine
- "The Incarnation: God Becoming Man" (chapter in various theological collections)
- The Humiliated and Exalted Lord (various lectures and essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship is Essential to Christology**
    - The Son’s identity as Son is not derived from the Incarnation but is eternal.
    - Rejects any notion that the Son became Son at the moment of the Incarnation.
    - Emphasizes the **personal distinctions** within the **Trinity** as foundational.
    - Argues that the Son’s mission presupposes his eternal filial relationship to the Father.
    - "The New Testament never suggests that the Son became the Son by being born of Mary." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Incarnation as Hypostatic Union**
    - The eternal Son assumed a complete human nature, not a human person.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one **person** of the Son.
    - The Incarnation is a unique, unrepeatable event in redemptive history.
    - "The Incarnation means that the eternal Son of God took to himself a human nature and became man." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Kenoticism**
    - Opposes any view that makes the Son’s divine status contingent on the Incarnation.
    - Rejects theories that diminish the Son’s deity or suggest he laid aside divine attributes.
    - Upholds the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature.
    - Maintains that the Son’s humiliation is functional, not ontological.
    - "The Son did not cease to be what he was, but became what he was not." (The Person of Christ)

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Eternal Sonship**
    - Grounds the doctrine in key biblical texts (e.g., John 1, Hebrews 1, Galatians 4).
    - Argues that the Son’s sending presupposes his pre-existence and Sonship.
    - Highlights the consistent testimony of the apostles to the Son’s eternal identity.
    - Insists that the **biblical narrative** requires the Son to be eternally Son.
    - "The sending of the Son presupposes that he is already the Son before the Incarnation." (The Person of Christ)

5. **Incarnation and Redemptive Purpose**
    - The eternal Son became incarnate to accomplish redemption as the **Mediator**.
    - The Son’s obedience and suffering are meaningful only if he is truly God and truly man.
    - The Incarnation is central to the **covenant of redemption**.
    - The Son’s eternal relationship to the Father grounds his unique role in salvation.
    - "Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and men." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Macleod’s defense of the **eternal Sonship** and his clear articulation of the **Incarnation** have shaped contemporary Reformed Christology, especially in the English-speaking world. His work has provided pastors and theologians with accessible yet rigorous resources for understanding the person of Christ. By upholding classical **Trinitarian** and **Christological** categories, Macleod has contributed to the ongoing vitality of orthodox doctrine in the modern church.
