# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as foundational to the doctrine of the **Trinity** and insists that the **Incarnation** does not alter the Son’s divine nature. For Bavinck, the **Son’s generation** is eternal and distinct from his temporal **assumption of human nature**, ensuring the full deity and humanity of Christ in the **hypostatic union**. He maintains that the **Incarnation** is the historical realization of the Son’s eternal identity, not its origin.

- "The incarnation is not the becoming of God the Son, but the becoming of the Son of God in the flesh." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son’s **eternal generation** is an intra-Trinitarian relation, not a temporal event.
    - This generation distinguishes the **Son** from the **Father** and **Spirit** within the Godhead.
    - It grounds the Son’s identity as truly God, equal in essence with the Father.
    - The Son’s deity is not derived from the Incarnation but from his eternal relation to the Father.
    - "The Son is not Son by virtue of the incarnation, but is the eternal Son who became incarnate." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

2. **Incarnation as Assumption, Not Change**
    - The **Incarnation** is the Son’s assumption of a complete human nature.
    - The divine nature remains unchanged and unconfused with the human.
    - The **hypostatic union** unites two natures in one person without mixture.
    - The Son’s personhood is the subject of both divine and human attributes.
    - "The incarnation is not a change of God into man, but the assumption of humanity into the person of the Son." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

3. **Distinction Between Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**
    - The Son’s eternal identity precedes and grounds the Incarnation.
    - The **Incarnation** is a new mode of existence, not a new identity.
    - The Son’s divine person remains constant before and after the Incarnation.
    - The **Incarnation** is the historical manifestation of the eternal Son.
    - "The incarnation presupposes the eternal Sonship and does not constitute it." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

4. **Full Deity and Full Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ possesses a true and complete **divine nature**.
    - Christ assumes a true and complete **human nature**.
    - Both natures are united in the one person of the Son.
    - The unity of person ensures the reality of both natures without confusion.
    - "The person who became man is the eternal Son, and he assumed a complete human nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

5. **Trinitarian Context of Christology**
    - The doctrine of **eternal Sonship** is inseparable from the doctrine of the **Trinity**.
    - The Incarnation reveals but does not create the Son’s relation to the Father and Spirit.
    - The work of redemption is rooted in the eternal counsel of the Triune God.
    - The Son’s mission is a Trinitarian act, not an isolated event.
    - "The incarnation is the work of the triune God, in which the Son is sent by the Father and conceived by the Spirit." (Reformed Dogmatics, 3.293)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has shaped modern Reformed Christology, emphasizing the continuity between the Son’s eternal identity and his redemptive mission. His careful distinction between **eternal generation** and the historical Incarnation safeguards both the full deity and humanity of Christ. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for contemporary discussions on the **Trinity** and the person of Christ, influencing theologians who seek to maintain classical orthodoxy within a Reformed framework.
