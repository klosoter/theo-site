# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the doctrines of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** through a historical and eschatological lens, emphasizing the revelation of Jesus’ divine identity in the context of history. He challenged classical formulations by arguing that the **Sonship of Christ** is not an a priori metaphysical status but is revealed and constituted through the resurrection and the totality of Jesus’ historical existence. For Pannenberg, the **Incarnation** is inseparable from the self-revelation of God in history, culminating in the event of Christ.

- "Only in the light of the end, in the light of the resurrection, is Jesus recognized as the Son of God." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 1–3 (1988–1993)
- Revelation as History (1961, ed. with R. E. C. Browne)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom (1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historical Revelation of Sonship**
    - The **Sonship of Christ** is disclosed through the historical process, especially the resurrection.
    - Rejects a purely ontological or pre-temporal understanding of **Eternal Sonship**.
    - Emphasizes the eschatological vindication of Jesus as the decisive moment of revelation.
    - The identity of the Son is inseparable from the history of Jesus.
    - "The deity of Jesus is not a presupposition but the result of his history." (Jesus—God and Man)

2. **Incarnation as Event in History**
    - The **Incarnation** is not a static metaphysical reality but an event within salvation history.
    - God’s self-disclosure in Christ is dynamic and unfolds in time.
    - The meaning of the Incarnation is fully grasped only in light of the resurrection.
    - The unity of divine and human natures is realized in the historical Jesus.
    - "The incarnation is the event in which God’s self-revelation takes place in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Trinitarian Relations Rooted in Economy**
    - The **Trinity** is understood from the perspective of God’s actions in history (the economic Trinity).
    - The eternal relations are revealed and constituted through the historical mission of the Son and Spirit.
    - The **Son’s** identity is inseparable from his role in redemption.
    - The immanent Trinity is not divorced from the economic Trinity.
    - "The trinitarian distinctions are grounded in the history of revelation." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

4. **Resurrection as Constitutive for Sonship**
    - The resurrection is the decisive event that reveals and constitutes Jesus as the **Son of God**.
    - Without the resurrection, the claim to Sonship would remain ambiguous.
    - The resurrection is both the vindication and the ontological basis for Jesus’ divine identity.
    - The **Eternal Sonship** is thus eschatologically revealed, not merely presupposed.
    - "Jesus’ resurrection is the foundation of his Sonship and deity." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Christology from Below**
    - Begins with the historical Jesus and moves toward the recognition of his divinity.
    - Avoids starting with abstract metaphysical claims about Christ’s nature.
    - The **Incarnation** is interpreted through the lens of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.
    - The confession of Jesus as the **Son of God** arises from the impact of his historical existence.
    - "Christology must proceed from the history of Jesus to the recognition of his deity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** has significantly shaped modern discussions of **Christology**, especially in emphasizing the historical and eschatological dimensions of Jesus’ identity. His insistence on the resurrection as constitutive for divine Sonship challenged both classical dogmatics and liberal reductionism. Pannenberg’s work continues to provoke debate on the relationship between **history and revelation**, and his influence is evident in contemporary trinitarian and Christological thought.
