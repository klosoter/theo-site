# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrines of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** through the lens of **demythologization**, seeking to reinterpret traditional Christological claims in existential terms. He questioned the historical and metaphysical categories of classical **Christology**, emphasizing the **kerygma**—the proclaimed message of Christ—as the locus of faith rather than ontological assertions about Jesus’ divine pre-existence or incarnation.

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christological Language**
    - Traditional doctrines like **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** are mythological expressions shaped by ancient worldviews.
    - The task of theology is to reinterpret these myths in existential terms relevant to modern people.
    - The language of pre-existence and incarnation points to the significance of Jesus for faith, not to metaphysical realities.
    - The focus shifts from ontological claims to the existential encounter with the **kerygma**.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the heart of Christian faith, not metaphysical speculation about his nature.
    - The **kerygma** confronts individuals with the call to authentic existence before God.
    - Faith arises from hearing the message, not from assent to doctrinal formulations about pre-existence or incarnation.
    - The meaning of Jesus’ person is found in the existential decision he evokes.
    - "What matters is not the objective fact of the pre-existence of Christ, but the meaning which the kerygma has for us." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Existential Interpretation of Incarnation**
    - Incarnation is not a literal descent of a divine being but a symbol of God’s address to humanity in Jesus.
    - The significance of Jesus lies in his role as the revealer of authentic existence.
    - The incarnation myth expresses the possibility of a new mode of being through encounter with Christ.
    - The focus is on the transformation of the believer, not on metaphysical union of divine and human natures.
    - "The real meaning of the incarnation is that in Jesus the Word of God is spoken to us." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Rejection of Pre-Existence as Historical Fact**
    - Bultmann denies that the New Testament’s language of pre-existence is a literal historical claim.
    - Such language reflects the mythological thought-world of early Christianity.
    - The idea of **Eternal Sonship** is a way of expressing the significance of Jesus, not a metaphysical reality.
    - Faith does not depend on accepting pre-existence but on responding to the call of the kerygma.
    - "The pre-existence of Christ is not a fact to be believed but a myth to be interpreted." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Faith as Existential Response**
    - True faith is not assent to doctrinal propositions about the person of Christ.
    - Faith is an existential response to the proclamation of the gospel.
    - The doctrines of **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** are meaningful only as they provoke authentic decision.
    - The reality of Christ is encountered in the act of faith, not in metaphysical speculation.
    - "Faith is decision, not assent to a doctrine." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology by challenging traditional metaphysical categories and emphasizing the existential dimension of faith. His method of **demythologization** provoked intense debate, influencing both neo-orthodox and existentialist theologians. While many criticized his rejection of classical Christology, his focus on the **kerygma** and existential response continues to inform discussions on the relevance of Christian doctrine in the modern world.
