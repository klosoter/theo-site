# Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444)

Cyril of Alexandria was a central figure in the Christological debates of the early church, especially regarding the **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** of Christ. He vigorously defended the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ, insisting on the **hypostatic union**—the union of two natures in the one **Person of the Son**—against Nestorianism. For Cyril, the **Son** is eternally begotten of the **Father** and truly became incarnate without division or confusion.

- "We do not say that the Word was changed into flesh, or again that he came into the Sonship from outside, but being by nature God he became flesh and was called Son of man." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

## Key Works

- Third Letter to Nestorius
- Scholia on the Incarnation of the Only-Begotten
- On the Unity of Christ
- Commentary on John
- Letters to Succensus

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship of Christ**
    - The **Son** is eternally begotten of the **Father**, not made or created.
    - The divine Son possesses the same **essence** as the Father, sharing in full deity.
    - The Son’s identity as Son is not contingent on the Incarnation but is an eternal reality.
    - The Son’s relationship to the Father grounds the possibility of the Incarnation.
    - "The Word, being God, was begotten from the very substance of God the Father." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

2. **True Incarnation of the Word**
    - The **Word** truly became flesh, assuming a complete human nature.
    - The Incarnation does not diminish or alter the divinity of the Son.
    - The humanity assumed by the Word is real, not a mere appearance.
    - The Incarnation is for the sake of human salvation and restoration.
    - "He was made flesh, not by being changed into flesh, but by taking flesh to himself." (On the Unity of Christ)

3. **Hypostatic Union**
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one **Person** of the Son.
    - This union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The properties of each nature are preserved in the union.
    - The subject of all Christ’s actions is the one Person of the Word.
    - "We do not divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

4. **Theotokos and the Identity of Christ**
    - Mary is rightly called **Theotokos** (God-bearer) because she bore the eternal Son incarnate.
    - The title safeguards the unity of Christ’s person and the reality of the Incarnation.
    - Denial of Theotokos undermines the reality of the union and the work of redemption.
    - The one born of Mary is both truly God and truly man.
    - "If anyone does not confess that Emmanuel is truly God, and that the holy Virgin is therefore Theotokos... let him be anathema." (Third Letter to Nestorius)

5. **Soteriological Significance of the Incarnation**
    - The union of divine and human natures is essential for redemption.
    - Only the **God-man** can effect true reconciliation between God and humanity.
    - The Incarnation enables the communication of divine life to humanity.
    - The Son’s assumption of human nature is the basis for the restoration of the image of God in man.
    - "He became man so that he might make us gods by grace." (On the Unity of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Cyril’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** became foundational for orthodox Christology, shaping the definitions of the Council of Ephesus and later Chalcedon. His defense of the **Eternal Sonship** and the true **Incarnation** decisively rejected both Nestorian and Apollinarian errors. The affirmation of Mary as **Theotokos** remains a touchstone for discussions of Christ’s person. Cyril’s legacy endures in both Eastern and Western traditions as a key architect of classical Trinitarian and Christological doctrine.
