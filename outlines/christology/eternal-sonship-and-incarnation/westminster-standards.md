# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** articulate a robust doctrine of the **Eternal Sonship** of Christ, affirming that the Second Person of the **Trinity** is the Son by eternal generation, not by virtue of the **Incarnation**. The Standards maintain that the **Incarnation** is the historical act whereby the **eternal Son** assumed a true human nature, remaining one person with two distinct natures, fully divine and fully human.

- "The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance and equal with the Father, did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him man's nature..." (Westminster Confession of Faith 8.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 2, 8)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–39)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on Christ’s person and work)
- The Directory for Public Worship (sections on the Trinity and Christology)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship of Christ**
    - The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, not made or created.
    - His **Sonship** is not dependent on the Incarnation or any temporal event.
    - The Son shares the same **substance** and **glory** as the Father and the Spirit.
    - The distinction of persons in the Trinity is maintained without division of essence.
    - "In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." (WCF 2.3)

2. **Incarnation as Assumption of Human Nature**
    - The eternal Son took to Himself a true human nature, body and soul.
    - The Incarnation occurred "when the fulness of time was come."
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of Christ.
    - The human nature was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary.
    - "The Son of God... did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him man's nature..." (WCF 8.2)

3. **Two Natures, One Person**
    - Christ is fully God and fully man, two natures without confusion or change.
    - The personal union does not mix or convert the divine and human natures.
    - Each nature retains its own properties, yet both are united in one person.
    - This union is permanent and indivisible.
    - "Two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF 8.2)

4. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
    - The divine nature of the Son is not altered or diminished by the Incarnation.
    - The Son remains fully and truly God throughout the Incarnation.
    - The properties of the divine nature are not communicated to the human nature.
    - The union is personal, not essential or natural.
    - "So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures... were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WLC Q. 36)

5. **Necessity and Purpose of the Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation was necessary for the Son to fulfill the office of **Mediator**.
    - Only as God and man could Christ accomplish redemption.
    - The Incarnation enables Christ to be the Prophet, Priest, and King for His people.
    - The eternal Son’s assumption of human nature was an act of voluntary condescension.
    - "It was requisite that the Mediator should be God, that he might sustain and keep the human nature from sinking under the infinite wrath of God..." (WLC Q. 38)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed and Presbyterian understandings of the **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** of Christ, providing a careful and precise articulation of classical **Trinitarian** and **Christological** doctrine. Their formulations have served as a doctrinal benchmark for confessional churches, influencing subsequent theological reflection and ecumenical dialogue. The Standards’ emphasis on the unity and distinction within the person of Christ continues to inform orthodox Christology and safeguard against both ancient and modern errors.
