# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, maintaining that the Second Person of the **Trinity** has always existed as the Son, distinct from the Father and the Spirit. He emphasizes the unity of the **divine nature** and the historical reality of the **Incarnation**, in which the eternal Son took on a fully human nature without ceasing to be God.

- "The Son did not become the Son at the incarnation; he was always the Son, eternally begotten of the Father." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord"
- "The Collected Shorter Theological Writings of John Frame"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God" (for broader Trinitarian context)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship of Christ**
    - The Son is eternally generated by the Father, not created or made.
    - The Son’s identity as Son is intrinsic to his person within the **Trinity**.
    - The Son’s relationship to the Father is one of eternal distinction, not temporal.
    - The doctrine safeguards the full deity and personal distinction of the Son.
    - "The Son is eternally begotten, not made, and his Sonship is not a role assumed in time." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Incarnation as Hypostatic Union**
    - The eternal Son assumed a human nature at a specific point in history.
    - The **hypostatic union** means Christ is fully God and fully man in one person.
    - The divine and human natures remain distinct yet united in the one person of Christ.
    - The Incarnation is a unique, unrepeatable event in redemptive history.
    - "In the incarnation, the eternal Son of God took to himself a complete human nature." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Trinitarian Distinctions and Unity**
    - The three persons of the Trinity are distinct yet share the same divine essence.
    - The Son’s eternal generation does not imply subordination of essence.
    - The Incarnation does not disrupt the unity of the Godhead.
    - The economic roles in redemption reflect, but do not create, eternal distinctions.
    - "The distinctions among the persons are eternal, but they do not divide the divine essence." ("The Doctrine of God")

4. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Modalism**
    - The Son is not merely a title assumed at the Incarnation or baptism.
    - Modalism is rejected; the persons are not mere modes or manifestations.
    - Adoptionism undermines the eternal relationship within the Godhead.
    - The Son’s identity is not a function of redemptive history alone.
    - "Jesus did not become the Son at some point in history; he always was the Son." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Redemptive-Historical Centrality of the Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation is the central event in the history of redemption.
    - The eternal Son’s taking of human flesh is essential for atonement.
    - The Incarnation reveals the fullness of God’s character and purposes.
    - The event is the foundation for understanding **revelation**, **atonement**, and **mediation**.
    - "The incarnation is the supreme revelation of God to man." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has reinforced classic Reformed orthodoxy while engaging contemporary challenges. His emphasis on the unity and distinction within the **Trinity** has shaped evangelical discussions on Christology and the doctrine of God. Frame’s accessible yet rigorous approach has made these doctrines more understandable for pastors and students, ensuring their continued relevance in systematic theology.
