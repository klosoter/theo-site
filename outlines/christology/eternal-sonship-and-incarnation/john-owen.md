# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen robustly defended the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, maintaining that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father and distinct in person, yet fully sharing the **divine essence**. He articulated the **Incarnation** as the voluntary assumption of a true human nature by the eternal Son, without confusion or change in the divine nature, thus upholding the unity of Christ’s person in two natures. Owen’s approach is marked by careful exegesis and a strong commitment to the **Trinitarian** and **Christological** orthodoxy of the Reformed tradition.

- "The Son did not then begin to be, but only to be what he was not before, to be man." (The Works of John Owen, Vol. 1)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
   - The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, not made, and thus fully God.
   - This generation is an **immanent Trinitarian** act, not a temporal event.
   - The Son’s personal distinction is rooted in this eternal relation, not in subordination.
   - Owen rejects any notion that the Son’s divine identity is dependent on the Incarnation.
   - "The Scripture doth assign unto the Father this peculiar property, that he is the Father of the Son, and unto the Son, that he is the Son of the Father, by eternal generation." (Christologia)

2. **Voluntary Incarnation**
   - The eternal Son freely assumed a human nature in time, without compulsion.
   - The Incarnation was not a change in the divine nature but an addition of a true human nature.
   - The Son’s assumption of humanity was in obedience to the Father’s will and for the purpose of redemption.
   - The union of the two natures occurs in the one person of the Son, not by mixture or confusion.
   - "He took our nature upon him, to be his own, by an ineffable act of his divine power and love." (The Glory of Christ)

3. **Unity of Christ’s Person**
   - The two natures, divine and human, are united in the one person of the Son.
   - This union is personal (hypostatic), not essential or accidental.
   - Each nature retains its own properties, yet acts in concert in the one person.
   - The person of Christ is the proper subject of all his actions and experiences.
   - "The same person who is the Son of God is also the Son of Man, and all is spoken of him in either nature." (Christologia)

4. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - The divine nature of the Son is not changed, diminished, or mixed in the Incarnation.
   - The Son remains fully God while becoming fully man.
   - The attributes of deity are not communicated to the human nature, nor vice versa.
   - The mystery of the Incarnation is upheld without compromising divine **immutability**.
   - "The divine nature is not the subject of any change, nor is it capable of any mixture or confusion." (The Glory of Christ)

5. **Redemptive Purpose of the Incarnation**
   - The Incarnation is ordered toward the accomplishment of **redemption**.
   - The Son’s assumption of human nature enables him to be the mediator between God and man.
   - Christ’s obedience and suffering are grounded in his true humanity.
   - The eternal Son’s work is effectual for the salvation of the elect because of his divine person.
   - "He was made like unto us, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God." (Christologia)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s rigorous articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has profoundly shaped Reformed Christology, especially in defending the unity and distinction of Christ’s two natures. His careful exegesis and theological precision provided a bulwark against both **Socinian** and **Arian** errors. Owen’s influence endures in contemporary discussions on the Trinity and the person of Christ, making his work a touchstone for orthodox Reformed theology.
