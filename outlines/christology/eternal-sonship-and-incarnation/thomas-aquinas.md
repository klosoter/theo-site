# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas articulated a robust doctrine of the **Eternal Sonship** of Christ, insisting that the **Second Person of the Trinity** is eternally begotten of the Father and distinct as **Son** prior to and apart from the **Incarnation**. For Aquinas, the **Incarnation** is the assumption of a complete human nature by the pre-existent **Eternal Word**, without confusion or change in the divine essence, thus preserving both the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ.

- "It must be said that the Son of God assumed human nature in order to save us by reconciling us to God." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.2)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially Part III (Tertia Pars), Questions 1–26
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, Chapters 24–55
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- De Veritate, Questions 4 and 29
- Compendium Theologiae, Chapters 221–231

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten by the Father, not made, and shares the same **divine essence**.
    - This generation is an internal, necessary act within the **Trinity**.
    - The distinction of Persons is real, but not a division of substance.
    - The Son's identity as Son precedes and grounds the possibility of the Incarnation.
    - "The Son is said to be begotten, not made, because He is from the substance of the Father." (Summa Theologiae I, q.27, a.2)

2. **Incarnation as Assumption, Not Change**
    - The **Word** assumes a complete human nature, not a human person.
    - There is no change in the divine nature; the change is in the human nature assumed.
    - The union is hypostatic: one Person, two natures.
    - The Incarnation is a free act of divine love, not necessity.
    - "The Word became flesh, not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by the assumption of the flesh into God." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.7)

3. **Distinction and Unity of Natures**
    - Christ possesses both a true **divine nature** and a true **human nature**.
    - The two natures remain distinct, without confusion or mixture.
    - The union occurs in the Person (hypostasis) of the Son.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - "In Christ there are two natures, the divine and the human, united in one hypostasis." (Summa Theologiae III, q.2, a.2)

4. **Necessity and Fittingness of the Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation is not absolutely necessary, but most fitting for human salvation.
    - It manifests God's justice, mercy, and wisdom.
    - The Incarnation enables the possibility of **atonement** and **deification**.
    - The eternal Son is the only suitable mediator between God and man.
    - "It was most fitting that God should become incarnate, both for the manifestation of His goodness and for the salvation of man." (Summa Theologiae III, q.1, a.1)

5. **Perpetual Sonship and Mission**
    - The Son’s eternal origin is distinct from His temporal mission.
    - The mission (Incarnation) presupposes the eternal relation of Son to Father.
    - The Son remains eternally begotten even as He becomes incarnate.
    - The Incarnation does not alter the eternal relations within the Trinity.
    - "The temporal mission presupposes the eternal procession." (Summa Theologiae I, q.43, a.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of **Eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** became foundational for later Western Trinitarian and Christological formulations, especially within Roman Catholic and classical Protestant traditions. His careful distinction between **person** and **nature** provided a conceptual framework that shaped subsequent debates on Christology. Aquinas’s synthesis of patristic sources and Aristotelian philosophy continues to influence contemporary discussions on the relationship between the **Trinity** and the **Incarnation**. His work remains a touchstone for systematic theology, especially regarding the unity and distinction in the person of Christ.
