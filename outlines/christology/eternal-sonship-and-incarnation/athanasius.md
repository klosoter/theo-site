# Athanasius (c. 296–373)

Athanasius was a central defender of the **eternal Sonship** of Christ and the full **divinity** of the Son against Arianism. He argued that the **Incarnation** was the self-revelation of the **eternal Logos**, who became truly human without ceasing to be God, thus securing the reality of **redemption** and the **deification** of humanity.

- "He became what we are that he might make us what he is." (On the Incarnation)

## Key Works

- On the Incarnation (De Incarnatione Verbi Dei)
- Orations Against the Arians
- Letters to Serapion on the Holy Spirit
- Letter to Epictetus
- The Tome to the People of Antioch

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
   - The Son is begotten, not made, from the **essence** of the Father.
   - The Son’s existence is eternal, not a product of time or will.
   - The Son shares the same **divine nature** as the Father.
   - Denial of the Son’s eternal generation undermines the doctrine of **Trinity**.
   - "The Son is eternally from the Father, being his proper offspring, not by will or creation, but by nature." (Orations Against the Arians)

2. **Full Divinity of the Son**
   - The Son is **homoousios** (of one substance) with the Father.
   - Only the true God can accomplish **salvation**.
   - The Son’s divinity is necessary for the **Incarnation** to be effective.
   - Worship of the Son is required and legitimate because he is truly God.
   - "If the Son is not true God, how can he deify us?" (Orations Against the Arians)

3. **Incarnation as Redemptive Act**
   - The eternal Word became truly human for the sake of **human redemption**.
   - The Incarnation is the means by which God restores fallen humanity.
   - The union of divine and human natures is real and unconfused.
   - The Incarnation is motivated by divine love and the need to defeat **death**.
   - "He became man that we might become God." (On the Incarnation)

4. **Immutability of the Divine Son**
   - The Son’s divine nature is unchangeable, even in the Incarnation.
   - The Word assumes humanity without ceasing to be God.
   - The Incarnation does not involve any change in the divine essence.
   - The Son’s actions in the flesh are the actions of the eternal Word.
   - "The Word was not changed into flesh, but the Word took flesh to himself." (Letter to Epictetus)

5. **Deification of Humanity**
   - The purpose of the Incarnation is to bring humans into **union with God**.
   - Through the Son’s humanity, believers are made partakers of the divine nature.
   - Deification is possible only because the incarnate Son is truly God.
   - The Incarnation restores the image of God in humanity.
   - "For he was made man that we might be made God." (On the Incarnation)

## Legacy and Impact

Athanasius’s defense of the **eternal Sonship** and the true **Incarnation** shaped the orthodox doctrine of the **Trinity** and **Christology** for the entire Christian tradition. His articulation of the Son’s full divinity and the redemptive purpose of the Incarnation became foundational for the Nicene Creed and later ecumenical councils. The concept of **deification** influenced both Eastern and Western theology, ensuring Athanasius’s enduring significance in debates over the person and work of Christ.
