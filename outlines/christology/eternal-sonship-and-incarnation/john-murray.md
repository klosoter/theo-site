# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray upheld the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as essential to orthodox **Trinitarian theology**, emphasizing that the **incarnation** did not confer Sonship but revealed the preexistent **Second Person of the Trinity** in human flesh. He maintained that the **mediatorial work** of Christ is rooted in His eternal relationship to the Father, and that the **hypostatic union** preserves both the full deity and true humanity of the incarnate Son.

- "The Sonship of Christ is not derived from the incarnation or from any temporal event, but is eternal and intrinsic to his person." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

- "The Person of Christ" (article in The Westminster Theological Journal)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship is Essential to Christology**
    - The Son’s identity as Son is not a function of the incarnation but is eternally grounded in the Godhead.
    - Denial of eternal Sonship undermines the doctrine of the **Trinity**.
    - The Son’s relationship to the Father is ontological, not merely economic or functional.
    - The **sending** of the Son presupposes His preexistence as Son.
    - "The doctrine of the eternal Sonship is indispensable to the integrity of the doctrine of the Trinity." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Incarnation as the Assumption of Human Nature**
    - The incarnation is the act whereby the eternal Son took to Himself a true human nature.
    - The **hypostatic union** ensures that Christ is fully God and fully man in one person.
    - The incarnation does not alter or diminish the deity of the Son.
    - The human nature assumed is impersonal apart from its union with the divine person.
    - "The incarnation means that the eternal Son became flesh, not that he ceased to be what he was." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

3. **Distinction Between Sonship and Messiahship**
    - Sonship is eternal; Messiahship is historical and redemptive.
    - The Son became the Messiah through the incarnation and redemptive mission.
    - The **mediatorial office** is assumed, not intrinsic to the Son’s eternal identity.
    - Confusing these categories leads to Christological error.
    - "It is the eternal Son who became incarnate and thus entered upon his mediatorial office." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

4. **Scriptural Basis for Eternal Sonship**
    - Murray appeals to passages such as John 1:1–18 and Galatians 4:4 to demonstrate preexistence and Sonship.
    - The language of "sending" and "coming" in Scripture presupposes eternal Sonship.
    - The baptismal formula and apostolic benedictions reflect Trinitarian relations.
    - The **Father-Son** relationship is not a product of the incarnation.
    - "The New Testament witness is unequivocal in its affirmation of the eternal Sonship of Christ." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Redemptive Significance of the Incarnation**
    - The incarnation is the foundation for Christ’s redemptive work as the God-man.
    - Only the eternal Son could accomplish **reconciliation** between God and humanity.
    - The obedience and suffering of Christ have value because of His divine person.
    - The incarnation is not merely an example but the means of atonement.
    - "Redemption is accomplished by the incarnate Son, whose person gives infinite value to his work." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s robust articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **incarnation** has shaped Reformed theology’s approach to Christology, especially in the context of 20th-century debates over the nature of Sonship. His insistence on the ontological distinction between Sonship and Messiahship has provided clarity for subsequent theological reflection. Murray’s careful exegesis and systematic rigor continue to influence evangelical and Reformed understandings of the person and work of Christ.
