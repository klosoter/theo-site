# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The Three Forms of Unity articulate a robust doctrine of the **Eternal Sonship** of Christ, affirming that the **Son is eternally begotten of the Father** and fully shares in the divine essence. They also emphasize the **Incarnation**, teaching that the **Son of God** assumed true human nature, uniting it with the divine in the one person of Christ. This union is essential for the accomplishment of **redemption** and the maintenance of **orthodox Trinitarian theology**.

- "He is the eternal Son of God, in whom the Father from eternity has chosen us." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 20)

## Key Works

- The Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 15–18, 33–36
- The Belgic Confession (1561), especially Articles 8, 10, 18, and 19
- The Canons of Dort (1618–1619), especially Head II, Articles 2–4
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation, ed. James T. Dennison Jr.
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not made, of the same essence as the Father.
    - The distinction of persons in the **Trinity** is maintained without division of substance.
    - The Son’s divine identity is affirmed as fully and eternally God.
    - The Son’s relationship to the Father is foundational for understanding His mission.
    - "We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only begotten Son of God, begotten from eternity, not made nor created." (Belgic Confession, Article 10)

2. **True and Complete Incarnation**
    - The eternal Son assumed a real human nature, body and soul.
    - The Incarnation did not diminish or alter the divine nature.
    - The two natures are united in one person, without confusion or separation.
    - The Incarnation is necessary for Christ to be our Mediator and Redeemer.
    - "The Son of God has assumed a true human nature, with all its infirmities, sin excepted, being conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary." (Belgic Confession, Article 18)

3. **Unity of the Person of Christ**
    - Christ is one person with two distinct natures: divine and human.
    - The personal union is without mixture, change, division, or separation.
    - Both natures retain their own properties, yet act in concert in the one person.
    - This union is essential for the efficacy of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "Thus we confess that he is very God and very man: very God by his power to conquer death, and very man that he might die for us according to the infirmity of his flesh." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

4. **Necessity of the Incarnation for Redemption**
    - Only the true and eternal Son could bear the infinite weight of God’s wrath.
    - The Mediator must be both fully divine and fully human to reconcile God and man.
    - The Incarnation is the means by which the elect are united to Christ.
    - The work of redemption is grounded in the person and natures of Christ.
    - "He must be true God, that by the power of his Godhead he might bear in his manhood the burden of God’s wrath." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 17)

5. **Orthodox Trinitarianism**
    - The Three Forms uphold the co-equality and co-eternity of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
    - The Son’s eternal generation is distinguished from creation or adoption.
    - The Incarnation does not compromise the unity or simplicity of the Godhead.
    - The confession rejects all forms of subordinationism or modalism.
    - "We believe in one only God, who is one single essence, in which are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties." (Belgic Confession, Article 8)

## Legacy and Impact

The Three Forms of Unity have provided a confessional standard for **Reformed churches** worldwide, shaping their doctrine of **Christology** and the **Trinity**. Their clear articulation of the **Eternal Sonship** and **Incarnation** has served as a bulwark against heresies ancient and modern. These documents continue to inform theological education, preaching, and ecumenical dialogue, ensuring that the central mysteries of the Christian faith remain confessed and proclaimed.
