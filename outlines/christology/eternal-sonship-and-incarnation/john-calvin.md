# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin robustly affirmed the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, maintaining that the **Second Person of the Trinity** is eternally begotten of the Father and distinct in personhood. For Calvin, the **Incarnation** is the historical manifestation of the Son, who assumed a true human nature without ceasing to be fully divine, thus ensuring the unity of the **mediator** and the continuity of the Son’s divine identity before and after the Incarnation.

- "He who was the Son of God became the Son of Man, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book I and II)
- Commentary on the Gospel of John
- Commentary on Hebrews
- Sermons on the Deity of Christ
- Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion (ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Generation of the Son**
    - The Son is eternally begotten, not made, of the Father, preserving distinction within the **Trinity**.
    - The Son’s divine personhood is not derived from the Incarnation but is intrinsic to his eternal identity.
    - Calvin rejects any notion that the Son became Son only at the Incarnation.
    - The relationship of Father and Son is ontological, not merely functional or economic.
    - "We say, then, that the Word, begotten by the Father before all ages, always remained with God." (Institutes I.xiii.7)

2. **Full Deity and Humanity in the Incarnation**
    - The Son assumed a complete human nature, body and soul, without ceasing to be fully God.
    - The two natures are united in the one person of Christ, without confusion or division.
    - The **Incarnation** is a voluntary act of the eternal Son, not a change in his divine essence.
    - The **mediatorial work** depends on the true union of divine and human natures.
    - "For we affirm that Christ is God and man, and that he possesses both natures in one person." (Institutes II.xiv.2)

3. **Immutability of the Divine Son**
    - The Son’s divine nature remains immutable and impassible, even in the Incarnation.
    - The Son’s assumption of humanity does not diminish or alter his deity.
    - Calvin rejects any view that the Son’s divinity was set aside or changed in the Incarnation.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** is grounded in the unity of the person, not a mixture of natures.
    - "He did not cease to be in heaven while he was on earth." (Commentary on John 3:13)

4. **Economic and Immanent Trinity**
    - Calvin distinguishes between the **immanent Trinity** (God in himself) and the **economic Trinity** (God’s works in history).
    - The Son’s mission in the Incarnation reflects the eternal relations within the Godhead.
    - The sending of the Son does not imply subordination of essence, but order of persons.
    - The **Incarnation** reveals, but does not create, the Son’s filial relation to the Father.
    - "The Son has a property distinct from the Father, namely, that he is begotten of the Father." (Institutes I.xiii.18)

5. **Purpose of the Incarnation: Redemption**
    - The eternal Son became incarnate to fulfill the role of **mediator** and accomplish redemption.
    - The Son’s pre-existence grounds the efficacy and universality of his saving work.
    - The Incarnation is essential for Christ’s priestly, prophetic, and kingly offices.
    - The Son’s obedience and suffering are effectual because of his divine personhood.
    - "He could not have been our Redeemer unless he had been true God and true man." (Institutes II.xii.3)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has profoundly shaped Reformed Christology, emphasizing both the continuity of the Son’s divine identity and the reality of his human nature. His careful distinction between the **immanent** and **economic Trinity** provided a framework for later Reformed theologians to discuss the person and work of Christ. Calvin’s influence endures in confessional standards and remains foundational for orthodox discussions of Christ’s person and redemptive mission.
