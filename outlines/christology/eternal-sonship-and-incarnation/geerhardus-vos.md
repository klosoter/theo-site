# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos affirmed the **eternal Sonship** of Christ as foundational to the doctrine of the **Trinity** and the **Incarnation**. He maintained that the **Son’s pre-existence** and personal distinction within the Godhead are essential for understanding the redemptive work accomplished in the **hypostatic union**.

- "The Son did not become Son by incarnation, but was Son before incarnation, and as such entered into the world." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Theology Proper
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship as Essential to the Trinity**
    - The Son’s identity is not derived from the Incarnation but is eternally grounded in the **immanent Trinity**.
    - The distinction of persons within the Godhead is real and not merely functional or economic.
    - The **Father-Son relationship** is intrinsic to God’s being, not a result of redemptive history.
    - The Son’s eternal generation is a necessary presupposition for orthodox Christology.
    - "The doctrine of the Trinity requires that the Son be Son from eternity, not merely from the time of the incarnation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

2. **Pre-existence of Christ**
    - Christ’s existence as the Son precedes all creation and is not contingent upon the Incarnation.
    - The Son’s pre-existence is vital for the efficacy of his mediatorial work.
    - Scriptural testimony to the Son’s pre-existence undergirds the reality of the Incarnation.
    - The Son’s divine personhood is maintained before, during, and after the Incarnation.
    - "The pre-existence of the Son is the presupposition of the incarnation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Incarnation as Hypostatic Union**
    - The Incarnation is the assumption of a human nature by the eternal Son, not the transformation of deity.
    - The **hypostatic union** unites two natures, divine and human, in the one person of the Son.
    - The Son remains fully God while becoming fully man, without confusion or division.
    - The union is personal (in the person of the Son), not essential (mixing of natures).
    - "The incarnation is the act of the eternal Son, who takes to Himself a human nature." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Significance of the Incarnation**
    - The Incarnation is central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The eternal Son enters history to accomplish redemption as the promised Messiah.
    - The Incarnation is the climax of God’s self-revelation and covenantal purposes.
    - The work of Christ is rooted in his eternal identity as Son, not merely his earthly mission.
    - "The incarnation is the supreme act of God’s self-disclosure in history." (The Self-Disclosure of Jesus)

5. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Modalism**
    - Vos rejects any view that makes the Son’s identity contingent upon the Incarnation or mission.
    - Adoptionism undermines the eternal relationship within the Trinity.
    - Modalism fails to preserve the real distinction of persons in the Godhead.
    - Orthodox Christology requires the eternal Son to be the subject of the Incarnation.
    - "The Son is not merely a mode or office assumed in time, but a distinct person from eternity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s robust articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has shaped Reformed dogmatics, especially in its insistence on the ontological distinction within the Trinity and the redemptive-historical significance of Christ’s person and work. His influence is evident in later Reformed theology’s resistance to both **adoptionist** and **modalist** tendencies. Vos’s careful exegesis and theological synthesis continue to inform contemporary discussions on the person of Christ and the doctrine of the Trinity.
