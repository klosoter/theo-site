# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield robustly affirmed the **eternal Sonship** of Christ, insisting that the Second Person of the **Trinity** is eternally the **Son** and not merely by virtue of the **Incarnation**. He maintained that the **Incarnation** is the historical manifestation of the preexistent Son, who assumed a true human nature without ceasing to be fully divine. Warfield’s position upholds both the **immutability** of the divine nature and the genuine reality of the **hypostatic union**.

- "He did not become the Son by being sent; He was sent because He was the Son." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Works

- "The Person and Work of Christ"
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "The Divine Sonship of Christ" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Supernatural Birth of Jesus"
- "Biblical and Theological Studies" (various essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Eternal Sonship of Christ**
   - The Son’s identity as Son is intrinsic and not a result of the Incarnation.
   - The titles "Father" and "Son" reflect eternal relations within the **Godhead**.
   - Warfield rejects the view that Christ became Son only at the Incarnation or Resurrection.
   - The sending of the Son presupposes His preexistent Sonship.
   - "The Scriptures know nothing of a Sonship that is not eternal." ("The Divine Sonship of Christ")

2. **Incarnation as Assumption, Not Change**
   - The **Incarnation** is the Son’s taking on of human nature, not a transformation of the divine.
   - The divine nature remains immutable and undiminished in the Incarnation.
   - The Son’s person is the subject of both natures in the **hypostatic union**.
   - The Incarnation is a historical event, but the Son’s person is eternal.
   - "He who became incarnate was none other than He who was eternally with God and was God." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

3. **Full Deity and Full Humanity of Christ**
   - Christ possesses all the attributes of true **deity** and true **humanity**.
   - The two natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation.
   - The Son’s divine prerogatives are retained even as He assumes human limitations.
   - The unity of the person is maintained throughout the earthly life of Christ.
   - "The two natures are united in one person, without mixture, without confusion, without change." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

4. **Scriptural Foundation for Christ’s Sonship**
   - Warfield grounds his doctrine in the exegesis of both Old and New Testament texts.
   - He emphasizes passages that reveal the Son’s preexistence and divine mission.
   - The sending language in Scripture is interpreted as evidence of eternal relations.
   - The **Trinitarian** framework is essential for understanding the Son’s identity.
   - "The New Testament everywhere presupposes the eternal relation of the Son to the Father." ("The Divine Sonship of Christ")

5. **Rejection of Adoptionism and Kenotic Theories**
   - Warfield opposes any view that makes Christ’s Sonship a temporal or adoptive status.
   - He rejects kenotic theories that compromise the Son’s full deity in the Incarnation.
   - The Son’s humiliation is functional, not ontological; He remains fully God.
   - The Incarnation is a mystery, but not a contradiction of divine attributes.
   - "He did not cease to be what He was, though He became what He was not." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of the **eternal Sonship** and the **Incarnation** has shaped orthodox Reformed Christology, especially in defending the full deity and humanity of Christ against modernist and subordinationist trends. His careful exegesis and theological precision provided a bulwark for later evangelical and confessional treatments of the **hypostatic union**. Warfield’s legacy endures in systematic theology as a model of rigorous, biblically grounded reflection on the person of Christ.
