### TITLE
Temptable yet Impeccable: Person, Wills, and the Logic of Christ’s Sinlessness

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core issue: Whether and how Christ could be genuinely tempted and yet be unable to sin, given the **hypostatic union**, two wills, and the nature of human freedom.
- Decisive figures: Cyril of Alexandria, Maximus the Confessor, Thomas Aquinas, John Owen, W. G. T. Shedd, Oliver D. Crisp.
- Traditions: Patristic conciliar Christology and **dyothelitism**, medieval scholastic accounts of grace and will, Reformed orthodox Christology with **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** and the **extra Calvinisticum**, selected analytic theology clarifications.
- Debates:
  - Internal: dyothelite account of will and temptation; Reformed disputes on beatific vision and the mode of Christ’s freedom; whether impeccability undercuts priestly sympathy.
  - External: kenotic and adoptionist Christologies; libertarian freedom requiring alternative possibilities; Socinian reduction of sinlessness to example; modern historicist views of temptation.
  - Contemporary: psychology of temptation and **concupiscence**; analytic claims about counterfactual power; solidarity and atonement integrity.
- Position defended: Christ is impeccable by virtue of the person of the Son who assumes a complete human nature with a true human will; he is temptable without the possibility of sin because his human will lacks a gnomic mode, is filled with grace, and is personally upheld by the immutable holiness of the Logos, securing genuine obedience, priestly sympathy, and federal headship without diminishing real freedom.

### ESSAY
The Christian confession that Christ was tempted in every respect as we are, yet without sin, forces a precise question at the intersection of ontology and soteriology: could Christ have sinned, and if not, were his temptations real, his obedience free, and his priestly sympathy sincere. The doctrine of the impeccability of Christ answers that the incarnate Son could not sin. This is not a pious exaggeration but a judgment rooted in the **hypostatic union**, the dyothelite distinction of wills, and a noncompetitive account of divine and human agency. To defend this, one must anchor the discussion in the decisive trajectory that runs from Cyril’s Christology through Maximus’s account of wills, receives metaphysical articulation in Aquinas, is received and rearticulated by Reformed orthodox theologians such as John Owen and W. G. T. Shedd, and is clarified in contemporary analytic idiom by Oliver Crisp. The cumulative case shows that Christ is temptable yet impeccable, and that this secures rather than compromises the gospel’s coherence.

Cyril of Alexandria stands near the fountainhead because he frames the unity that any account of impeccability presupposes. Against Nestorius, Cyril argued that the subject of all Christ’s acts is the one incarnate Son, the Word who has become flesh. His concern is not abstract metaphysics but the soteriological axiom that what is not assumed is not healed. The one person acts theandricly through both natures without confusion or division. In this configuration, the impeccability question is already shaped: who is the agent that is tempted and who would sin if sin occurred. Cyril’s insistence that the subject is the eternal Son implies that the holiness of the divine person saturates the incarnate life without dehumanizing it. He does not deny a human will, which will be specified later, but he binds the economy of temptation and obedience to the sanctity of the personal subject. Cyril’s polemical focus on unity guards against the Nestorian slide into a merely adjunct human person who could, at least in principle, fall apart from the Word. The Christ who could sin would be a Christ whose human subject could detach from the Logos in the order of willing, which Cyril’s communicative unity forbids. In debates then and now this Celement ensures that impeccability is not the property of a nature in abstraction but a mode of personal moral impossibility arising from the identity of the acting subject.

Maximus the Confessor supplies the second decisive layer by clarifying what kind of will Christ possesses. Against the monothelites, Maximus insists on **dyothelitism**, that Christ has two wills and two energies corresponding to his two natures. But he distinguishes a natural will from a gnomic will. The natural will is the faculty or inclination proper to a nature, tending toward the good that fulfills it. The gnomic will is a deliberative mode that presupposes ignorance, vacillation, and a history of choice whereby a person arrives at the good through inquiry and sometimes through error. Maximus argues that Christ lacks a gnomic will not because he lacks a human faculty of will, but because the personal mode of his human willing is determined by the Logos. The very premise of a gnomic will implies a fallible trajectory, a ratiocinative search occasioned by ignorance that does not befit the incarnate Son. In Maximus, impeccability does not deny temptation or obedience. It specifies that Christ’s human will is natural, fully human, and always coordinated to the divine will of the Logos. Temptation for Christ is not an interior concupiscence rising from concupiscible disorder, since he assumes unfallen humanity; instead it is the pressure of suffering, the trial of obedience under duress, and the enticement presented from without. Gethsemane displays this natural will recoiling from death, a blameless aversion that manifests the integrity of human nature, and yet this recoil is immediately subordinated to the will of the Father. The maximian synthesis answers a familiar examiner’s challenge: if Christ cannot sin, are his temptations empty. No, because the mode of temptation and moral trial is not reducible to the capacity to sin, but to the steadfastness of natural will under intensifying pressures, a steadfastness that, in his case, is personally stabilized by the Logos. Maximus thereby preserves real struggle, real prayer, and real obedience without gnomic indecision or peccability.

Thomas Aquinas articulates impeccability with metaphysical economy. He argues that Christ is impeccable for three mutually reinforcing reasons. First, by reason of person, since the acting subject is the Son who is **immutable** and holy according to **divine simplicity**, to posit his sin is to posit a moral failure in the very subject who is God. Second, by reason of grace, since Christ’s soul is sanctified with the fullness of habitual grace, perfect charity ruling out mortal sin as a matter of moral necessity. Third, by reason of knowledge, because Christ in his earthly life possesses a plenitude of infused knowledge and, Aquinas argues, the beatific vision. The vision of God excludes sin because it arrests the mind in supreme beatitude, ordering the will immovably to God. Critics from within the Reformed camp have often questioned whether granting the beatific vision to Christ during his humiliation undercuts his growth in wisdom and the genuineness of his faith. Aquinas answers that the vision perfects the higher powers while leaving room for experiential growth with respect to acquired knowledge and bodily development. The Thomistic synthesis is therefore twofold. Negatively, he closes the metaphysical door on sin by personal identity with the Word. Positively, he locates the moral impossibility within the soul by fullness of grace and perfected knowledge. The force of Aquinas’s account for contemporary debate lies in its noncompetitive coordination of divine and human agency. A Westminster examiner might ask whether such moral necessity abolishes freedom. Aquinas denies a model of freedom as indifference and argues for **freedom of excellence**, the capacity to act from perfected dispositions toward one’s true end. Christ’s freedom does not consist in a precarious power to turn from God but in a royal spontaneity to will the good without remainder. This reframes temptation: it is not about the presence of a live alternative of sin, but about the costliness of obedient love under suffering. The Aquinas line therefore permits impeccability and still preserves Christ’s active righteousness as the ground of our **federal theology**.

John Owen, representing Reformed orthodoxy, receives the patristic and medieval inheritance while recalibrating points of emphasis. Owen is resolute on two affirmations. First, Christ’s temptations are real, more intense than any we endure, because the Spirit drove him into the wilderness and because his obedience meets maximal satanic opposition. Second, Christ is impeccably holy. Owen insists on the **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** structure: the human nature of Christ has no subsistence apart from the person of the Son and subsists in him. For Owen, the **extra Calvinisticum** is crucial to maintain that the Logos remains who he eternally is while operating in and through the assumed nature. Consequently, the holiness of the person is not an external guardrail but the interior principle of the incarnate life. Owen refuses to ascribe to Christ any concupiscence or relic of original sin. He distinguishes between natural, sinless passions such as hunger and fear and sinful movements of the soul. Temptation operates by external solicitation through created goods and by the dolorous conditions of the fallen world. It does not involve an inner propensity to evil. Owen resists the Thomistic claim regarding the beatific vision during humiliation, not because he rejects its sin-excluding force in principle, but to safeguard the pattern of Christ’s filial faith, Spirit dependence, and growth in experiential obedience. On freedom, Owen anticipates modern confusions: he denies that the liberty necessary for merit entails the ability to sin. Rather, Christ’s liberty is the unhindered exercise of his holy human will under the personal governance of the Son and the anointing of the Spirit. Owen thus secures impeccability by more than a metaphysical fiat; he works out how the sanctified psychology of the Redeemer functions in the economy.

W. G. T. Shedd sharpens the impeccability argument against nineteenth century vacillation. Shedd insists that because the person of Christ is divine, the possibility of sin is excluded. Any attribution of peccability renders the unity of the person fragile. He advances a tight personalist argument: natures do not act, persons act. If the person is divine, then sin would be an act of the divine person and hence impossible. Shedd is aware of the objection that Christ’s human will is a created faculty capable in the abstract of sinning. He replies that any such abstract potency is constrained by the concrete union. In the concrete, the human will is the instrument of the holy person and thus incapable of immoral volition. Shedd’s emphasis is strategically useful in examination when confronted by claims that peccability is required for meaningful temptation. He concludes that the costliness and perfection of Christ’s obedience increase under impeccability, because every solicitation to evil is resisted not by a fragile neutrality but by the holy resolve of the incarnate Son, whose resistance proceeds from impeccable love.

Oliver D. Crisp brings analytic clarity to disputes that often suffer from equivocation. He argues that the correct target is the alleged contradiction between temptability and impeccability. Crisp’s solution relies on distinguishing different modalities of possibility. Christ is temptable in the sense that he can be presented with enticements to sin that register as reasons to act but which he never endorses. He is impeccable in the sense that there is no nearest possible world in which the incarnate Son sins, given the personal identity and the relations of dependence between the human will and the Logos. Crisp rejects attempts to preserve peccability by positing some independent sphere of human-personal willing in Christ, since that would edge toward Nestorianism. He also clarifies how biblical language of being tempted in every respect operates: it concerns the range of trial and the existential pressure under which obedience is rendered, not the presence of disordered desire. Crisp’s work is valuable because it exposes how much modern objections are fueled by a libertarian intuition that equates freedom with the availability of contraries. By exposing that intuition as gratuitous, he sets the stage for the classical move back to **freedom of excellence** and to the maximian ordering of wills.

Internal debates within the main traditions circle around three nodes. First, the mode of Christ’s knowledge and whether the beatific vision should be ascribed during the state of humiliation. The Thomist position gives it pride of place in excluding sin. Reformed orthodox writers often demur, not because they desire peccability, but because they worry about collapsing the drama of obedience and growth. The resolution for a Reformed examiner is to affirm that fullness of habitual grace and a plenary presence of the Spirit are sufficient to secure impeccability without positing the beatific vision on earth. Second, the precise relation of the two wills. Dyothelitism must be defended against both monothelite flattening and confusion of wills. Maximus remains decisive here. The human will is not eclipsed but harmonized. Any appeal to a gnomic indecision in Christ to underwrite empathy is rejected. Third, the nature of temptation. Within Reformed dogmatics, a recurring debate concerns whether Christ experienced temptations that involved innocent natural desires only, or whether he somehow felt the lure of sin without sinning. The sound position is that Christ endured temptation at the level of natural passions and external solicitation, but not concupiscence. He was like us in all respects except sin, and original sin is not coextensive with humanity.

External debates bring rival frameworks into view. Kenotic Christologies that posit a self-emptying by which the Logos relinquishes or suspends attributes to make room for autonomous human volition tend to introduce peccability by severing the stabilizing role of the divine person. This conflicts with **divine simplicity** and immutability, and it collapses the **extra Calvinisticum** by domesticating the Logos into the limits of the flesh. Adoptionist or functional Christologies that refuse the identity claim that Jesus is the eternal Son in person open the door to peccability because the agent is a sanctified man rather than the God-man. Socinian moral exemplarism reduces sinlessness to heroic consistency and sees impeccability as incoherent. Against these, the classical claim is not that a divine nature operates as a firewall around an independent human agent, but that the one agent is the Son whose human faculties are the instruments of his sinless action. Modern libertarian freedom theories insist that moral praise requires categorical alternative possibilities. The reply, prepared by Aquinas and developed by Reformed scholastics, is that **freedom of excellence** is the measure of rational agency. The supreme freedom is the unwavering love of the good. To require the possibility of evil for praiseworthiness is to render God himself unfree. If the triune God is supremely free and yet impeccable, then Christ’s impeccable freedom is not a category error but the archetype of liberty.

Contemporary debates test the doctrine under modern pressures. Psychology of temptation calls attention to affective dynamics and the role of habituation. The classical account maps neatly onto these findings: Christ’s habituated virtue, fullness of grace, and stable vision of the Father yield a psychology of holy resilience without concupiscence. Some argue that solidarity with victims requires Christ to share our disordered desires. This confuses solidarity with sameness of pathology. Priestly sympathy, according to Hebrews, is grounded not in shared concupiscence but in sustained obedience through suffering. The incarnate Son learned obedience through what he suffered, which is precisely the kind of solidarity sufferers need. In analytic philosophy, the challenge that counterfactual power over alternatives is necessary for responsibility is answered again by pointing to divine freedom and by noting that responsibility tracks reasons-responsiveness, not indeterministic forks. Christ’s human will is maximally reasons-responsive. On historical-critical fronts, some claim that Gospel portraits portray Jesus as uncertain, perhaps tempted by despair. Classical Christology interprets such episodes, like Gethsemane, as the natural will’s horror at death and dereliction, not as sinful distrust. The cry of dereliction must be read as the covenantal experience of abandonment under judgment borne for others, not the collapse of filial love.

A Westminster defense of impeccability must also connect to adjacent loci. In anthropology and hamartiology, Christ’s assumption of true humanity without original sin is crucial. He is consubstantial with us in all things except sin. The absence of original sin means the absence of concupiscence as an inward source of temptation. In soteriology, the active obedience of Christ undergirds our justification. If merit requires the possibility of sin, then God could not merit anything. But merit is supererogatory obedience under covenantal conditions, not a precarious balance between good and evil. In Trinity, the holiness of the Son, identical to the divine essence, cannot be compromised by incarnation. Impeccability is therefore a trinitarian entailment. In ecclesiology, the priestly ministry of Christ as the Holy One who sympathizes is paradigmatic for pastoral assurance. The temptable yet impeccable High Priest is an anchor for the conscience because his obedience is indefectible.

Anticipating examiner objections sharpens the argument. First, does impeccability make the temptations unreal. No, because temptation is not defined by inward lust but by the presentation of a contrary will of God under painful conditions. Maximus shows that the natural will can be tried without concupiscence. Owen stresses the real intensities of satanic assault. Second, do two wills and impeccability entail a robotic humanity. No, because the human will acts as a real faculty moved from within by charity and reasons, not by external compulsion. The person of the Son does not bypass but elevates human faculties. Third, if the person is divine and cannot sin, is the human will a mere puppet. No, because **communicatio idiomatum** means that divine and human operations are personalized by the one subject without confusion. The human will remains the proximate principle of human acts. Fourth, is Christ’s obedience meritorious if sin is impossible. Yes, because merit arises from the worth of the person and the intensity and costliness of obedience under covenantal conditions, not from the contingency of sinning. Fifth, does denying beatific vision on earth jeopardize impeccability. No, because the stability of the person, fullness of grace, and Spirit anointing suffice to ground moral impossibility. Aquinas’s argument is instructive but not indispensable. Sixth, does libertarian freedom undermine this account. One can reject the assumption that freedom requires alternative possibilities by appealing to divine freedom as the archetype and arguing that rational spontaneity under perfect virtue is the highest liberty.

If one asks which aspect is decisive, the answer must begin with the personal ontology. Cyril’s insistence on the one subject, Maximus’s dyothelite synthesis without gnomic will, and Aquinas’s elaboration that the person’s identity morally necessitates holiness together yield the core. Owen’s refusal to let a Roman claim about the beatific vision regulate humiliation assures us that impeccability can be secured within classic Protestant commitments by the person, grace, and Spirit. Shedd’s personalist clarity blocks the move into abstract nature talk that feeds peccability. Crisp’s modal and analytic distinctions close semantic loopholes. The theological picture is then coherent. Christ is temptable because he is truly human with a natural will, sinless passions, and the capacity to suffer. He is impeccable because that will is the instrument of the Son, filled with grace, ruled by charity, and never operating with a gnomic mode. He is the second Adam not as a neutral chooser but as the head who bears and heals our moral failure precisely through an obedience that could not fail. This is not a weakness of his solidarity but its power.

Finally, the pastoral freight confirms the dogmatic case. A peccable Christ would imply a redeemer whose fidelity was contingently preserved and hence whose priesthood would be as fragile as ours. An impeccable Christ gives assurance that salvation is as holy and unshakable as the Son himself. The confession that he was tempted in every respect as we are, yet without sin, is not an equivocation but a theological grammar: he truly knows the heat of trial, yet his love did not cool. The very point of his mission was not to prove that a man could stand alone on the knife-edge of libertarian freedom, but that God, in the flesh, would stand for us with a human will that never wavered. That is the impeccability we must defend.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: Impeccability is the moral impossibility of Christ’s sinning grounded in the **hypostatic union**, true **dyothelitism** without a gnomic will, fullness of grace, and the holy personal agency of the incarnate Son; he is temptable but unable to sin.
- Decisive figures:
  - Cyril of Alexandria: one-person Christology ensures the holy subject of all acts.
  - Maximus the Confessor: two wills, no gnomic will; temptation without concupiscence.
  - Thomas Aquinas: impeccability by person, grace, and knowledge; argues for beatific vision.
  - John Owen: Reformed reception; Spirit-anointed obedience, no beatific vision in humiliation; real temptation without peccability.
  - W. G. T. Shedd: personalist impeccability; natures do not act, persons act.
  - Oliver D. Crisp: modal clarity; temptable yet impeccable without libertarian assumptions.
- Debates:
  - Internal: beatific vision in humiliation; mode of Christ’s freedom as **freedom of excellence**; nature of temptation absent **concupiscence**.
  - External: kenotic and adoptionist models undermining the stabilizing person; libertarian freedom requiring alternative possibilities; Socinian exemplarism.
  - Contemporary: analytic modality of possibility; psychology of temptation; priestly sympathy and solidarity.
- Defended position: Christ is genuinely temptable yet impeccably sinless because the human will, fully real, is the instrument of the immutable, holy Son, sanctified by perfect grace and Spirit anointing, operating without gnomic indecision; this secures obedience, merit, and priestly sympathy.
- Likely examiner questions:
  - If impeccable, were temptations real? Yes, trials of obedient love without concupiscence, per Maximus and Owen.
  - Does merit require ability to sin? No, merit tracks costly obedience and worth of person, not libertarian indifference.
  - Did Christ have the beatific vision on earth? Thomists say yes; Reformed can deny yet retain impeccability via person and grace.
  - How do two wills avoid Nestorianism or monothelitism? One person acting through two wills harmonized, no gnomic mode.
  - Does impeccability negate priestly sympathy? No, sympathy arises from suffering and obedience, not shared sinful desire.
