# Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)

Anselm of Canterbury approached the **impeccability of Christ** through his doctrine of the **incarnation** and **atonement**, emphasizing the necessity that the Savior be both truly **God** and truly **man**. For Anselm, Christ’s inability to sin was rooted in his **divine nature**, ensuring the sufficiency and perfection of his **satisfaction** for human sin. This framework undergirds Anselm’s understanding of the necessity and efficacy of Christ’s redemptive work.

- "It was necessary that one who was God-man should make this satisfaction." (Cur Deus Homo)

## Key Works

- Cur Deus Homo (Why God Became Man)
- Monologion
- Proslogion
- De Incarnatione Verbi (On the Incarnation of the Word)
- The Prayers and Meditations of St. Anselm

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Necessity of the God-Man for Atonement**
    - Only one who is both fully **God** and fully **man** can make adequate satisfaction for sin.
    - The **divine nature** ensures Christ’s incapacity to sin.
    - The **human nature** enables Christ to represent humanity.
    - The union of natures is essential for the efficacy of redemption.
    - "None but God can make the satisfaction, and none but man ought to do it." (Cur Deus Homo)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in Divine Nature**
    - Christ’s **divinity** makes sin impossible for him.
    - The **hypostatic union** preserves Christ’s human will from sinning.
    - Impeccability is not merely moral but ontological, grounded in who Christ is.
    - The God-man cannot be divided; the person of the Son is always sinless.
    - "He could not sin, because he was God." (Cur Deus Homo)

3. **Voluntary Obedience and Freedom from Sin**
    - Christ’s obedience is freely given, not compelled.
    - His will is perfectly aligned with the divine will.
    - True freedom is found in perfect righteousness, not the possibility of sinning.
    - Christ’s voluntary offering is essential for satisfaction.
    - "He offered himself because he willed, not because he was compelled." (Cur Deus Homo)

4. **Satisfaction Theory of Atonement**
    - Sin is a failure to render due honor to God.
    - Only a sinless one can offer true satisfaction.
    - Christ’s impeccability ensures the sufficiency of his satisfaction.
    - The atonement requires a perfect, sinless sacrifice.
    - "He who does not owe death, yet dies, offers to God what he does not owe." (Cur Deus Homo)

5. **Impeccability and the Integrity of Redemption**
    - The Redeemer’s sinlessness is necessary for the restoration of humanity.
    - Christ’s inability to sin guarantees the unbreakable efficacy of redemption.
    - The work of Christ is untainted by any moral defect.
    - Impeccability assures believers of the certainty of salvation.
    - "If he could sin, our hope would be vain." (Cur Deus Homo)

## Legacy and Impact

Anselm’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** shaped subsequent Western theology, especially in the development of the **satisfaction theory of atonement**. His insistence on the necessity of a sinless, divine-human mediator influenced both medieval and Reformation thought. The clarity with which he grounded Christ’s impeccability in the **hypostatic union** remains a touchstone for orthodox Christology. Anselm’s legacy endures in ongoing discussions about the necessity, nature, and assurance of Christ’s redemptive work.
