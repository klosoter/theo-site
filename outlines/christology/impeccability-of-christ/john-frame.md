# John Frame (1939– )

John Frame affirms the **impeccability of Christ** as essential to orthodox **Christology**, emphasizing that Jesus, as the incarnate **Son of God**, could not sin due to the unity of his **divine and human natures**. Frame situates Christ’s impeccability within the broader framework of **Reformed theology**, highlighting the necessity of Christ’s sinlessness for his role as the **mediator** and **substitute** in redemption.

- "Jesus could not have sinned, for he was and is God, and God cannot sin." ("Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief"
- "The Doctrine of God"
- "Salvation Belongs to the Lord"
- "The Doctrine of the Christian Life"
- "The Doctrine of the Word of God"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s **divine nature** makes sin impossible.
    - The **hypostatic union** ensures the unity of Christ’s person.
    - The human nature of Christ is never independent from the divine.
    - Impeccability is not merely moral but ontological.
    - "Because Jesus is God, it is impossible for him to sin." ("Systematic Theology")

2. **Reality of Temptation Without Possibility of Sin**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine and intense.
    - Temptation does not require the possibility of sinning.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation demonstrates his perfect obedience.
    - The experience of temptation qualifies Christ as a sympathetic **high priest**.
    - "Jesus’ temptations were real, but he could not have yielded to them." ("Systematic Theology")

3. **Necessity of Impeccability for Atonement**
    - Only a sinless substitute can bear the penalty for others.
    - Christ’s sinlessness is essential for his role as **mediator**.
    - Impeccability guarantees the efficacy of the **atonement**.
    - The doctrine upholds the justice and holiness of God.
    - "If Jesus could have sinned, our salvation would be in jeopardy." ("Systematic Theology")

4. **Affirmation of Both Christ’s Full Humanity and Full Deity**
    - Christ’s humanity was real, yet without sin.
    - The divine nature does not diminish the reality of Christ’s human experience.
    - The two natures are united in one person, not mixed or confused.
    - Impeccability does not compromise Christ’s identification with humanity.
    - "Jesus is fully God and fully man, and his impeccability is consistent with both." ("Systematic Theology")

5. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Frame opposes any view that diminishes Christ’s divine attributes.
    - The Son did not surrender his divine prerogatives in the incarnation.
    - Kenotic theories undermine the doctrine of **impeccability**.
    - The classical doctrine preserves both Christ’s deity and his saving work.
    - "The so-called kenotic theories are not faithful to the biblical witness to Christ’s person." ("Systematic Theology")

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has reinforced the Reformed tradition’s commitment to the full deity and humanity of Jesus. His work has provided clarity on the relationship between Christ’s temptations and his sinlessness, countering both modern and historical errors. Frame’s emphasis on the ontological impossibility of Christ’s sin has shaped contemporary evangelical discussions and remains influential in systematic theology classrooms and confessional churches.
