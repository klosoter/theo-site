### TITLE
Able Not To Sin or Not Able To Sin? Recasting Christ’s Impeccability in Reformed Dogmatics

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: How to affirm that the incarnate Christ was genuinely tempted and a true human agent while also insisting that, as the divine Son, he was **impeccable** and thus could not sin, without fracturing either Christology or soteriology.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Anselm, John Owen, B. B. Warfield.
- Traditions: Nicene and Chalcedonian patristic Christology, medieval Latin soteriology, Reformed scholastic and Puritan dogmatics, Old Princeton theology, with contemporary analytic and evangelical debates as foil.
- Debates addressed: Internal Reformed and catholic debates about the possibility of Christ’s sinning and the mode of his temptations; external challenges from kenotic and modern relational Christologies that weaken **divine immutability**; contemporary worries over psychological realism, human freedom, and Christ’s pastoral example.
- Defended position: The incarnate Christ was absolutely and indefectibly impeccable, not able to sin in virtue of his **hypostatic union** and **divine personhood**, yet his temptations and obedience were fully real and meritorious, grounded in an impeccable but genuinely human will.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of the impeccability of Christ asks whether the incarnate Son not only did not sin but was in fact unable to sin. At stake is not a marginal curiosity but the coherence of **Chalcedonian Christology**, the nature of Christ’s obedience in **federal headship**, and the reliability of his priestly sympathy. The core claim I will defend is that the person of the Son, who is **true God and true man in one person**, could not sin, although he possessed a true human will and was subjected to real and intensifying temptations. Properly framed, impeccability safeguards both the ontological identity of Christ as the eternal Son and the soteriological efficacy of his work, while also securing, rather than diminishing, the reality of his tested and triumphant obedience.

The right starting point is the patristic insistence on the identity of the Savior with the eternal Logos. Athanasius, writing in the midst of the Arian crisis, reorients the discussion of Christ’s sinlessness away from bare example toward ontological identity. In On the Incarnation and his anti‑Arian orations, he argues that only one who is by nature life, light, and righteousness can bestow incorruption upon fallen humanity. For Athanasius, Christ’s sinlessness is not a contingent achievement but a manifestation of his being as the consubstantial Son. The one acting in the human life of Jesus is the Logos who is **immutable** and **simple**, incapable of moral defect. Any suggestion that the Son could morally fail would collapse the anti‑Arian argument: a mutable or peccable mediator cannot be the uncreated Lord who deifies. Thus, even before the technical question “could he have sinned” arises, Athanasius gives us the decisive Christological grammar: the subject of all Christ’s acts is the eternal Son, whose divine nature is necessarily holy and whose assumption of humanity does not jeopardize that holiness because the Logos is not changed by the incarnation.

Gregory of Nazianzus sharpens this grammar by formulating the classic rule, “what is not assumed is not healed.” In his theological orations, especially Oration 29 and 30, and in his Epistle to Cledonius, Gregory contends against Apollinarian truncation of Christ’s humanity. Christ must have a rational human soul and will, for otherwise human rationality and volition would remain unredeemed. For the doctrine of impeccability, this creates a clear tension: if Christ possesses a fully human will, and if a human will is in principle able to sin, how can Christ be said to be impeccable in a meaningful sense? Gregory’s answer lies in the mode of union. The human soul and will of Christ are not independent personal subjects but are enhypostatized in the divine Son. The human will is the will of the Logos in his human mode of existence. That means the metaphysical subject who operates this human will is the impeccable divine person. Gregory does not use the Latin vocabulary of **impeccability**, but his insistence that the acting subject is the Logos safeguards the claim that, while Christ’s human will is formally capable of undergoing temptation and struggle, it is never left to a neutral or autonomous trajectory over against the divine person. The **hypostatic union** determines the moral direction of the human will without obliterating its genuineness.

A likely examiner objection presses at this point: does not such a union either render the human will a puppet or make the temptations mere appearances, contrary to Hebrews’ assertion that Christ was “tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin”? To answer, it is important to distinguish between the metaphysical necessity of Christ’s holiness and the psychological experience of his human soul. The metaphysical necessity arises from **divine simplicity** and **immutability**: the Son as God cannot acquire a new moral state or potentiality; his goodness is infinite and incapable of increase or loss. This necessity is carried into the incarnation by the unity of person. But the psychological experience of temptation operates at the level of Christ’s human faculties, which are finite, passible, and growing in experiential knowledge. Temptation, biblically, is not merely an inward inclination to evil; it is also the external assault and trial that tests and manifests righteousness. Christ’s human soul, exposed to weakness, pain, and suffering, endures real trials. What impeccability denies is not the pressure of those trials but the presence of an inward concupiscence or any genuine potential for moral deviation in the personal subject.

Anselm’s contribution deepens the soteriological dimension of impeccability. In Cur Deus Homo and his other Christological works, Anselm frames the incarnation in terms of **satisfaction** and **fittingness**. The Mediator must be both God and man: man to make satisfaction on behalf of humanity, God to render that satisfaction of infinite worth. Anselm insists that Christ’s obedience is entirely voluntary, supremely meritorious, and incapable of defect. Were there any real potential that Christ’s will might break faith with the Father, the entire economy of redemption would become precarious and contingent. Anselm’s logic of satisfaction presupposes that God’s plan for atonement is not a divine gamble but a settled counsel arising from the immutable will of God. Here the doctrine of **divine decree** intersects with impeccability. The incarnate obedience of Christ is nothing other than the temporal enactment, in human life, of the eternal will of the triune God. To suggest that Christ might have sinned introduces a rupture between the immanent and economic Trinity and compromises **divine aseity** and **immutability**.

Yet Anselm is careful not to evacuate the voluntariness and genuine testing of Christ’s obedience. He emphasizes that Christ could have preserved his life and avoided death, yet willingly embraced the cross for the sake of justice and love. This brings into view a key conceptual distinction that later Reformed theologians develop: the difference between a “natural” possibility and a “hypothetical” or “moral” possibility. In terms of his created human nature considered in the abstract, Christ has the faculties requisite for moral choice. But in terms of the concrete personal union and the decree of God, there is no genuine world in which the incarnate Son apostasizes. Examiners often probe this by asking, “If he could not sin, in what sense was his obedience praiseworthy?” The answer is that merit in biblical and classical theology attaches not first to a bare conditional ability to do otherwise but to the value of the agent and the costliness and constancy of his obedience under intensifying trial. Anselm already prefigures this: the worth of Christ’s obedience derives from who he is, the God‑man, and from the magnitude of the satisfaction rendered, not from any libertarian openness to apostasy.

The Reformed tradition, and within it John Owen in particular, takes the patristic and medieval insights and integrates them with a robust federal and covenantal framework. Owen’s Christologia and his commentary on Hebrews are decisive for the classic Reformed defense of impeccability. Owen insists that Christ’s temptations were real, multifaceted, and more severe than any experienced by the saints, precisely because of his holy intolerance of sin and his unique mediatorial burden. At the same time, he is equally insistent that the person so tempted is the eternal Son, whose divine nature is impeccable and whose human nature, though temptable, is personally sustained in unbroken holiness by the Spirit and by the union with the Logos. For Owen, to deny impeccability is to break the unity of Christ’s person and to posit, in effect, a human person alongside the divine.

Owen introduces a crucial refinement: the distinction between being “able to be tempted” and being “able to sin.” Christ’s human nature is receptive of external suggestions, sufferings, and privations; he can be hungry, weary, sorrowful, and distressed by the cup set before him. In Gethsemane, his human will genuinely recoils from the horror of death and dereliction. Yet that same will is perfectly, even if arduously, aligned with the divine will. Owen stresses that there is no **concupiscence** in Christ, no fomes peccati, because he does not share in Adam’s guilt or corruption. Thus, temptation for Christ is always from without or from the pressure of created weakness, never from an inner inclination to evil. The impeccability of his person means that the human will, though naturally capable of obedience or disobedience in another subject, in this subject is infallibly determined to righteousness.

This is where internal debates within the Reformed and broader catholic traditions surface. Some, desiring to protect the reality of temptation and Christ’s sympathy, have argued for peccability: that Christ could have sinned but in fact did not. Others, following Owen and classic Reformed scholastics, argue that he could not sin. The peccability position often appeals to Hebrews’ language and to Christ as our example: if sin was impossible for him, is he really an example of faith and obedience under trial? Further, some fear that impeccability undermines the integrity of Christ’s human will, making it an instrument rather than a proper human faculty.

In response, Owen and his successors, including B. B. Warfield at Old Princeton, insist that impeccability is not the negation of true humanity but its perfection in union with the Son. Warfield’s essay “The Emotional Life of Our Lord” and his reflections on Christology argue that Jesus’ human psychology was profoundly rich, vulnerable, and affectively engaged. For Warfield, impeccability does not flatten Christ’s humanity into a static, untested state; rather, it undergirds a humanity that is radiant with holy affections, deeply moved by compassion, anger at sin, and grief at unbelief. Warfield sees no tension between Christ’s inability to sin and his capacity for genuine moral growth in the sense of experiential development and progressive manifestation of righteousness. Luke’s statement that Jesus “increased in wisdom and stature” is interpreted as the unfolding, in the temporal sphere, of a holiness that is personally grounded in the Son’s eternal righteousness.

Warfield also engages an external set of challenges that become more prominent in modern theology, particularly in kenotic Christologies. Kenotic thinkers, in various ways, claim that the Son in becoming incarnate “emptied” himself of some divine attributes or their exercise, including omniscience or **immutability**, to make room for genuine human development and vulnerability. On such accounts, the Son’s moral life may be construed as precarious, open to genuine failure, in order to preserve his solidarity with us. Warfield, standing in the classic Reformed commitment to **classical theism**, rejects any suggestion that the incarnation involves a diminishment of the divine nature. The Logos does not lay aside attributes but assumes human nature into personal union. Any model that posits a relinquishment of divine holiness or moral immutability is, in effect, Arianizing, subordinating the Son to the vicissitudes of history.

From the standpoint of classical **dyothelite** Christology, the two wills in Christ are distinct but never in opposition, the human will following and expressing the divine will. Impeccability is simply the moral entailment of dyothelitism under the condition of hypostatic union. Contemporary kenotic and “relational” Christologies that stress divine vulnerability and openness often redefine God’s relation to time and sin such that God’s own moral life becomes historically conditioned. Against this, Warfield and the Reformed orthodox insist that God’s vulnerability in Christ is the vulnerability of the assumed human nature, not of the divine nature as such. The pathos of Christ’s life is real, but it does not insinuate mutability into the divine perfections.

At this juncture an examiner might raise a persistent philosophical worry: if Christ could not have done otherwise, is his obedience genuinely free and thus morally significant? Here we need to articulate a compatibilist account of freedom that is already embedded in Reformed accounts of **providence** and **effectual calling**. Freedom is not chiefly the power of contrary choice but the congruence of one’s will with one’s deepest nature and loves. God is the freest agent precisely because he cannot deny himself. Similarly, the incarnate Son’s obedience is most free because it is the perfect expression of his holy person through his human will. The alignment of Christ’s human will with the divine will is not a coercive imposition but the manifestation in time of who he eternally is. The inability to sin in this context is not a defect but the fullness of moral integrity.

Another set of contemporary debates concerns the pastoral implications of impeccability. Some argue that a Christ who could not sin cannot truly sympathize with believers struggling with indwelling sin. Yet Hebrews grounds Christ’s sympathy not in shared guilt or concupiscence but in shared weakness and tested obedience. He “learned obedience through what he suffered.” Learning here does not imply a transition from disobedience to obedience, but experiential acquaintance with the cost of obedience under suffering. Impeccability does not insulate Christ from the felt agonies of saying “not my will, but yours be done” in the face of dread. If anything, his impeccable holiness intensifies his suffering under temptation, for a perfectly holy soul feels the weight of sin’s assaults and the horror of the cross more acutely than any sinful soul could.

Moreover, impeccability is crucial for assurance. As **mediator of the covenant of grace** and second Adam in **federal theology**, Christ’s obedience is the ground of our justification and the pattern of our sanctification. If his obedience had been precarious, our salvation would be contingent on a moral risk taken by God. The Reformed doctrine of the **covenant of redemption**, the eternal pact between the Father and the Son, presupposes that the Son’s incarnate obedience is the secured outworking of an immutable intra‑trinitarian counsel. To ask whether Christ could have sinned is, in that framework, to ask whether God could fail to be faithful to his own decree.

Internal to Reformed circles, there remain nuanced discussions about the mode of impeccability. Some emphasize what might be called “metaphysical” impeccability: given the person of the Son, sin is impossible. Others attempt to allow a more robust sense of conditional possibility at the level of Christ’s human faculties, so as to preserve a strong sense of conflict and choice. Yet the best of the tradition refuses to drive a wedge between the levels. The metaphysical account determines the moral reality of the human will, and the reality of conflict is described in terms of arduous alignment, not in terms of genuine risk of apostasy. The examiner who pushes for a crisp answer to “could he have sinned?” must be met with a clear no, qualified by the affirmation of temptability and experiential struggle.

Finally, impeccability must be located within a broader dogmatic context. It flows from and reinforces **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity**; it depends on the orthodox doctrines of **hypostatic union** and **dyothelitism**; it undergirds **penal substitutionary atonement** and **federal headship**; it shapes our understanding of sanctification and imitation. The impeccability of Christ is not an isolated puzzle but a necessary entailment of the confession that the one born of Mary, who hungers, weeps, is tempted, and dies, is none other than the Lord of glory, the holy Son who cannot deny himself. To preserve both his true humanity and his divine holiness, we must say that he was temptable but impeccable, fully tested yet infallibly faithful. Any weakening of impeccability either dissolves classical theism into historicist process or severs Christ’s priestly sympathy from his ontological identity as God the Son.

In sum, the classical and Reformed position, drawing from Athanasius and Gregory, refined by Anselm, articulated in federal and covenantal terms by Owen, and defended within a classical theistic framework by Warfield, yields a robust account: Christ as the incarnate Son could not sin, because the personal subject of all his acts is the impeccable Logos; yet as true man, with a rational soul and human will, he underwent genuine temptations, learned obedience through suffering, and rendered a free, costly, and infinitely meritorious obedience as our representative and head. Far from undermining his example or sympathy, impeccability secures the inviolable holiness and reliability of the Savior in whom we trust.

### RECAP NOTES
- Core definition: The impeccability of Christ is the doctrine that the incarnate Son, while truly temptable in his human nature, was as a divine person not able to sin, his human will being infallibly and freely aligned with the divine will by virtue of the **hypostatic union**.
- Decisive figures: Athanasius grounds sinlessness in the consubstantial, immutable Son; Gregory of Nazianzus secures a full human will enhypostatized in the Logos; Anselm ties indefectible obedience to satisfaction and divine decree; John Owen integrates impeccability with **federal theology**, temptability, and the absence of concupiscence; B. B. Warfield defends impeccability within **classical theism** against kenotic and modern revisions.
- Debates: Internal debates pit peccability against impeccability and wrestle with the mode of temptation and freedom; external debates involve kenotic and relational Christologies that compromise **divine immutability** and suggest real moral risk; contemporary debates focus on psychological realism, libertarian freedom, and Christ’s pastoral exemplarity.
- Defended position: Christ was absolutely impeccable, unable to sin as the divine Son, yet his human obedience was genuinely free, arduously tested, and meritorious, forming the secure ground of his priestly sympathy and our salvation.
- Likely examiner questions and one‑line answers:
  - Could Christ have sinned? No, because the personal subject is the impeccable Logos, and the human will is never autonomous from that divine person.
  - Were his temptations real if he could not sin? Yes, because temptation involves external trial and the cost of obedience in human weakness, not necessarily an inner capacity for apostasy.
  - Does impeccability violate Christ’s true humanity and two wills? No, dyothelitism affirms a real human will whose moral direction is determined, not destroyed, by union with the Son.
  - How does impeccability relate to atonement and assurance? It secures the indefectible obedience of our federal head, making the atonement and covenant of grace immovably certain.
  - Is his obedience still free and praiseworthy without the power of contrary choice? Yes, because freedom is the uncoerced expression of a nature and person, and God’s own impeccability is the paradigm of perfect, praiseworthy freedom.
