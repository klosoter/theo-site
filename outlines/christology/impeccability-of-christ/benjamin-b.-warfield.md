# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield staunchly defended the **impeccability of Christ**, asserting that Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Son of God, was not only free from actual sin but also incapable of sinning due to the **hypostatic union**. Warfield argued that Christ’s **divine nature** rendered any real possibility of sin impossible, while still affirming the full reality of Christ’s **human nature** and **temptation**. His position upholds the absolute **sinlessness** and **moral perfection** of Christ as essential for the work of **redemption**.

- "He was not able to sin because He was the immutable God, and it was impossible that God should be tempted with evil." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

## Key Works

- "The Person and Work of Christ" (especially the essay "The Emotional Life of Our Lord")
- "The Humanity and Impeccability of Christ" (in Selected Shorter Writings)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord" (in The Person and Work of Christ)
- "The Sinlessness of Christ" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)
- "The Two Natures in Christ" (in Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one **person**.
    - The divine nature cannot sin, and this incapacity is communicated to the person of Christ.
    - The **person** of Christ is the acting subject, not the natures in abstraction.
    - Impeccability is not a limitation of Christ’s humanity but a necessary consequence of the union.
    - "It was the person of the God-man who was tempted, and the person of the God-man could not sin." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptation**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine and involved real human struggle.
    - The inability to sin does not negate the reality or intensity of temptation.
    - Temptation tested Christ’s obedience and revealed his moral perfection.
    - The experience of temptation was essential for Christ’s role as **High Priest**.
    - "The sinlessness of Jesus does not mean that He was not tempted, but that He was victorious in every temptation." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

3. **Sinlessness as Essential for Redemption**
    - Only a sinless Savior could offer an acceptable sacrifice for sin.
    - Christ’s **active and passive obedience** are grounded in his moral perfection.
    - The atonement requires a spotless substitute.
    - The integrity of the gospel depends on the sinlessness of Christ.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, the foundation of our salvation would be insecure." ("The Person and Work of Christ")

4. **Affirmation of Christ’s True Humanity**
    - Christ possessed a complete human nature, including a human will and emotions.
    - Impeccability does not diminish the reality of Christ’s human experiences.
    - Christ’s human development and suffering were genuine.
    - The union with the divine nature preserves, rather than overrides, true humanity.
    - "Our Lord’s humanity was real and complete, but it was never for a moment separated from His divinity." ("The Emotional Life of Our Lord")

5. **Rejection of the Peccability View**
    - Warfield opposed the idea that Christ could have sinned (peccability).
    - He argued that peccability undermines the doctrine of the **incarnation**.
    - The suggestion of peccability threatens the assurance of salvation.
    - Warfield maintained that the church’s historic confession supports impeccability.
    - "The church has always confessed that our Lord was not only sinless but incapable of sin." ("The Humanity and Impeccability of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped Reformed and evangelical Christology, reinforcing the necessity of Christ’s sinlessness for the doctrine of **atonement**. His careful articulation of the **hypostatic union** and the reality of Christ’s temptations continues to inform contemporary debates. Warfield’s work remains a touchstone for those defending the full deity and humanity of Christ in systematic theology.
