# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther affirmed the **impeccability of Christ**, insisting that Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Son of God, was utterly without sin in both nature and act. For Luther, Christ’s **sinlessness** was essential for His role as the **substitute** in the doctrine of **justification**, ensuring that He could bear the sins of humanity without Himself being tainted. Luther maintained that Christ’s **humanity** was real and complete, yet always united to the **divine nature**, making sin impossible for Him.

- "He was made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, yet He was without sin." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians
- The Large Catechism
- The Small Catechism
- Sermons on John
- "On the Freedom of a Christian"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s True Sinlessness**
    - Christ possessed a true human nature, yet was completely free from original and actual sin.
    - His sinlessness was necessary for Him to be the spotless **Lamb of God**.
    - Luther emphasized that Christ’s obedience was perfect, fulfilling the law in every respect.
    - The sinlessness of Christ is foundational for the believer’s assurance in **justification**.
    - "Christ alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, because He is without blemish." (Sermons on John)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - The union of divine and human natures in Christ made it impossible for Him to sin.
    - Luther taught that the divine nature upheld and preserved the human nature from all sin.
    - The **communicatio idiomatum** ensured that Christ’s actions were those of the divine Person.
    - Impeccability was not merely a moral achievement but a metaphysical necessity.
    - "The person who does these things is not a mere man but God and man in one person." (Lectures on Galatians)

3. **Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s sinlessness is expressed in both His active fulfillment of the law and His passive suffering.
    - Luther stressed that Christ’s obedience was both representative and substitutionary.
    - The active obedience provided the positive righteousness imputed to believers.
    - The passive obedience involved bearing the penalty for sin without Himself being guilty.
    - "He fulfilled the law for us by His obedience and bore our sins by His suffering." (Large Catechism)

4. **Temptation Without Sin**
    - Christ experienced real temptation, yet never consented to sin.
    - Luther argued that temptation was necessary for Christ to be a true high priest and mediator.
    - The reality of temptation highlights the genuineness of Christ’s humanity.
    - Despite temptation, the divine nature ensured that Christ could not fall.
    - "He was tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin." (Lectures on Galatians)

5. **Impeccability and Justification**
    - The sinlessness of Christ is the ground for the believer’s justification before God.
    - Luther taught that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers by faith alone.
    - Only a sinless substitute could bear the curse and grant righteousness.
    - The doctrine safeguards the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ’s atoning work.
    - "His innocence, righteousness, and purity are our righteousness before God." (The Freedom of a Christian)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s robust defense of the **impeccability of Christ** shaped Protestant understandings of both **Christology** and **justification by faith**. His insistence on Christ’s sinlessness as essential for salvation influenced later Reformed and Lutheran confessions. Luther’s teaching provided a foundation for subsequent debates on the nature of Christ’s temptations and the relationship between His divine and human natures. The clarity and pastoral emphasis of his doctrine continue to inform evangelical preaching and catechesis.
