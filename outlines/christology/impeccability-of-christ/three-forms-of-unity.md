# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the **sinlessness** and **true humanity** of Christ, upholding His **impeccability** as essential for His role as **Mediator** and **substitute**. These confessions emphasize that Christ, though **tempted in every respect**, was utterly free from sin, possessing a **divine nature** that rendered actual sinning impossible while maintaining genuine human experience.

- "He is a high priest forever, and is made like unto his brethren in all things, yet without sin." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 16)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True Humanity and True Deity of Christ**
    - Christ is confessed as "true and eternal God" and "true man," uniting both natures in one person.
    - The Belgic Confession insists on the necessity of Christ's real human nature for substitution.
    - His humanity was "like unto his brethren in all things, except for sin."
    - The union of natures ensures Christ could be tempted yet remain impeccable.
    "We confess that God fulfilled the promise... by sending his only Son... who took the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men, truly assuming a real human nature, with all its infirmities, yet without sin." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

2. **Impeccability as Essential for Mediation**
    - Christ's sinlessness is foundational for His priestly office and substitutionary atonement.
    - The confessions stress that only a sinless mediator can bear the penalty for others.
    - His inability to sin is rooted in His divine personhood.
    - The Canons of Dort affirm the sufficiency and perfection of Christ's sacrifice.
    "He must be a true and righteous man; because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned should pay for sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 16)

3. **Temptation Without Sin**
    - Christ experienced real temptation, yet was never inwardly inclined to sin.
    - The confessions echo Hebrews: Christ was "tempted in all things, yet without sin."
    - His temptations serve to assure believers of His sympathy and victory.
    - The reality of temptation does not compromise His impeccability.
    "He was in all things made like unto his brethren, yet without sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 16)

4. **Virgin Birth and Sinlessness**
    - The Belgic Confession links the virgin birth to Christ's freedom from original sin.
    - Christ was "sanctified and separated from sinners" from conception.
    - His conception by the Holy Spirit ensured He did not inherit Adam's guilt.
    - This miraculous birth is essential for His role as the spotless Lamb.
    "He was conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit, without the means of man, and did not partake of the corruption of human nature." (Belgic Confession, Art. 18)

5. **Impeccability and Assurance of Salvation**
    - The confessions connect Christ's sinlessness to the believer's assurance.
    - His perfect obedience is imputed to believers by faith.
    - Christ's inability to sin guarantees the efficacy of His atonement.
    - Assurance rests on the finished, sinless work of the Redeemer.
    "He is our righteousness, making us righteous before God and delivering us from all our sins." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 18)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped Reformed confessional theology, establishing the **impeccability of Christ** as a non-negotiable tenet for orthodox Christology and soteriology. Their careful articulation of Christ’s sinlessness continues to inform catechesis, preaching, and doctrinal standards in Reformed churches worldwide. By rooting assurance in the sinless Mediator, these confessions provide enduring comfort and clarity for believers regarding the sufficiency of Christ’s work.
