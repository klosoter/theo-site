# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos affirmed the **impeccability of Christ** as essential to a robust **Reformed Christology**, emphasizing that the incarnate Son, while truly human, was incapable of sin due to the **hypostatic union**. Vos maintained that Christ’s **divine nature** rendered actual sinning impossible, yet He experienced genuine **temptation** as part of His redemptive work. This safeguarded both the reality of Christ’s humanity and the necessity of His perfect obedience for **substitutionary atonement**.

- "The possibility of sinning is not essential to true humanity, but liability to temptation is." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology"
- "The Eschatological Aspect of the Pauline Conception of the Spirit"
- Pauline Eschatology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one **person**.
    - The divine nature cannot sin, thus the person of Christ is impeccable.
    - Impeccability does not diminish the reality of Christ’s humanity.
    - The union ensures Christ’s obedience is both fully human and divinely guaranteed.
    - "The person of Christ, being divine, could not sin, though He could be tempted." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Reality of Temptation Without Possibility of Sin**
    - Christ’s temptations were real and essential to His mediatorial work.
    - Temptation tested Christ’s obedience, not His ability to sin.
    - The experience of temptation was necessary for Christ’s role as the second Adam.
    - Liability to temptation is distinct from moral susceptibility to sin.
    - "Temptation is not identical with sin, nor does it imply the possibility of sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Perfect Obedience as the Basis of Substitution**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience required absolute sinlessness.
    - Impeccability guarantees the sufficiency of Christ’s **atonement**.
    - Only a sinless mediator can represent fallen humanity before God.
    - The merit of Christ’s obedience is rooted in His unique person.
    - "The value of Christ’s obedience lies in its perfection and its person." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Distinction Between Peccability and Impeccability**
    - Vos distinguishes between the ability to sin (peccability) and the inability to sin (impeccability).
    - Christ’s peccability is denied on the basis of His divine personhood.
    - The church must uphold both Christ’s true humanity and His sinlessness.
    - Theological errors arise from confusing temptation with moral weakness.
    - "It is not necessary to ascribe to Christ the possibility of sinning in order to maintain His true humanity." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Redemptive-Historical Significance of Christ’s Impeccability**
    - Impeccability is vital for Christ’s role as the last Adam in redemptive history.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation inaugurates the new creation.
    - The church’s assurance rests on the unassailable righteousness of Christ.
    - Impeccability is integral to the eschatological hope of believers.
    - "In Christ, the principle of sinlessness is established for the new humanity." (Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped Reformed discussions on Christology, especially regarding the relationship between Christ’s humanity and divinity. His careful distinction between **temptation** and the possibility of sin has provided clarity for subsequent theologians. Vos’s work continues to influence systematic theology, biblical theology, and the understanding of Christ’s mediatorial role within the Reformed tradition.
