# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **impeccability of Christ** through the lens of his **Christology of the New Being**, emphasizing the existential significance of Christ’s sinlessness rather than its metaphysical impossibility. For Tillich, Christ’s **sinlessness** is not a static attribute but the dynamic realization of **unity with the divine** within the conditions of human existence, making Christ the bearer of the **New Being** who overcomes estrangement.

- "The assertion that Jesus was without sin means that in him the gap between essential and existential being was overcome." ("Systematic Theology, Vol. 2")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Sinlessness as Existential Victory**
    - Christ’s **impeccability** is defined by his existential victory over estrangement, not by an abstract incapacity to sin.
    - The sinlessness of Christ is the actualization of **essential being** within the conditions of human existence.
    - Christ’s freedom from sin is the result of his perfect **unity with the divine ground of being**.
    - The focus is on the overcoming of existential separation, not on metaphysical impossibility.
    - "Jesus is called sinless because he was united with God in every moment of his existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Impeccability and the New Being**
    - Christ is the **New Being** who brings reconciliation between God and humanity.
    - The **impeccability** of Christ is the manifestation of the New Being’s power to heal estrangement.
    - Sinlessness is a sign of the New Being’s presence, not merely a moral achievement.
    - The New Being is the answer to the existential predicament of sin and separation.
    - "The New Being appears in history as the power of reunion, conquering the split between man and his essential being." (The New Being)

3. **Rejection of Static Divine-Human Dualism**
    - Tillich rejects a static, metaphysical dualism between Christ’s divine and human natures.
    - The **impeccability of Christ** is not grounded in a metaphysical impossibility to sin, but in the dynamic unity of divine and human.
    - Christ’s sinlessness is the existential realization of the divine-human unity.
    - The doctrine is interpreted through the existential categories of **estrangement** and **reunion**.
    - "The Christological problem is not a problem of two substances, but of the unity of the divine and the human in the act of existence." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Impeccability as Symbolic Expression**
    - Tillich views doctrinal assertions (like impeccability) as **symbols** pointing to existential realities.
    - The sinlessness of Christ symbolizes the possibility of reunion with the divine for all humanity.
    - Doctrinal language is not literal but points to the depth dimension of existence.
    - The symbol of Christ’s impeccability functions to express the hope of overcoming estrangement.
    - "Doctrines are symbols for that which concerns us ultimately." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

5. **Impeccability and Existential Participation**
    - The sinlessness of Christ is meaningful as it opens the way for human participation in the **New Being**.
    - Christ’s victory over sin is paradigmatic for the existential transformation of believers.
    - The doctrine encourages existential openness to the healing power of the New Being.
    - Impeccability is not a remote attribute but an invitation to transformation.
    - "The Christ who is the New Being makes possible the new existence of man." (The New Being)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential reinterpretation of the **impeccability of Christ** shifted the focus from metaphysical debates to the existential and symbolic significance of Christ’s sinlessness. His approach influenced later **liberal Protestant** and existential theologians, encouraging a dynamic understanding of Christology that addresses the human condition of estrangement. While his views diverged from traditional **Reformed** and **orthodox** positions, Tillich’s emphasis on the existential meaning of doctrine remains influential in contemporary theology.
