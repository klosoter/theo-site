# Bruce A. Ware (1953– )

Bruce A. Ware affirms the **impeccability of Christ**, emphasizing that Jesus, as the incarnate **Son of God**, could not sin due to the unity of his **divine and human natures**. Ware argues that Christ’s temptations were real and meaningful, yet his **divine personhood** ensured he remained sinless, upholding both the authenticity of his humanity and the necessity of his **sinlessness** for redemption.

- "Jesus could not have sinned, not because he had resources unavailable to us, but because he was, and is, the divine Son." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in Divine Personhood**
    - Christ’s inability to sin is grounded in his identity as the eternal **Son of God**.
    - The divine nature cannot be separated from the person of Christ, ensuring his sinlessness.
    - The unity of the **hypostatic union** makes actual sin impossible for Jesus.
    - Temptation was real, but the outcome was certain due to his divine personhood.
    - "Because Jesus is the divine Son, it is impossible that he could sin." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Jesus experienced genuine human temptation in his earthly life.
    - The temptations were not merely hypothetical but engaged his full humanity.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation demonstrates the power of the **Spirit** and obedience.
    - The reality of temptation does not require the possibility of sin.
    - "His temptations were real, but his divine nature guaranteed his sinlessness." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

3. **Necessity of Sinlessness for Redemption**
    - Only a sinless Savior could serve as the perfect substitute for sinners.
    - Christ’s **impeccability** is essential for his role as the spotless Lamb of God.
    - The atonement depends on the unblemished character of Christ.
    - Sinlessness is both a qualification and a necessity for the efficacy of the cross.
    - "If Jesus could have sinned, our salvation would be forever in doubt." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s Obedience**
    - Jesus lived and obeyed as a true man, empowered by the **Holy Spirit**.
    - His dependence on the Spirit models the Christian life.
    - The Spirit’s enabling does not negate Christ’s divine nature but highlights his authentic humanity.
    - Christ’s obedience was real, not automatic, within the context of his Spirit-empowered life.
    - "Jesus lived his life and fulfilled his mission in the power of the Holy Spirit." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

5. **Affirmation of the Hypostatic Union**
    - The **two natures** of Christ are united in one person without confusion or division.
    - The divine and human natures retain their distinct properties.
    - The unity of the person ensures that the divine nature upholds the human.
    - The hypostatic union is foundational for understanding Christ’s impeccability.
    - "The union of divine and human natures in the one person of Christ is the key to his impeccability." ("The Man Christ Jesus")

## Legacy and Impact

Bruce A. Ware’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped contemporary evangelical discussions on Christology, especially within Reformed and Baptist circles. His insistence on the reality of Christ’s temptations, coupled with the necessity of his sinlessness, has provided a robust framework for understanding the person and work of Christ. Ware’s work continues to influence debates on the **hypostatic union** and the practical implications of Christ’s humanity and deity for Christian living.
