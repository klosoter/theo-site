# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge firmly upheld the **impeccability of Christ**, asserting that the incarnate Son, though truly human, was utterly incapable of sinning due to the **hypostatic union** of divine and human natures. Hodge argued that Christ’s **divine nature** rendered sin impossible, while his **human nature** was preserved from corruption, ensuring a perfect **mediatorial obedience**.

- "It was, therefore, impossible that He should sin, not merely because of the purpose of God, but because of the constitution of His person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s **divine and human natures** are united in one person without confusion or division.
    - The divine nature’s moral perfection guarantees the impossibility of sin in Christ.
    - The human nature, though real and complete, is upheld by the divine.
    - The union ensures that Christ’s will is always aligned with God’s will.
    - "The two natures are united in one person, and that person is the Son of God, who cannot sin." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ experienced genuine temptation as part of his true humanity.
    - Temptation did not imply a fallen nature or internal inclination to sin.
    - The temptations served to demonstrate Christ’s obedience and faithfulness.
    - Christ’s sinlessness was maintained throughout every trial.
    - "He was tempted, not that He might be drawn into sin, but that He might be proved to be sinless." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Distinction Between Peccability and Impeccability**
    - Hodge distinguishes between the possibility of being tempted and the possibility of sinning.
    - Christ’s human nature, if isolated, could be peccable, but the person of Christ is impeccable.
    - The divine nature’s influence makes actual sin impossible.
    - The distinction safeguards both Christ’s true humanity and his sinlessness.
    - "The possibility of sinning depends on the constitution of the person, not of the nature." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Necessity of Impeccability for Redemption**
    - Only a sinless mediator can offer a perfect **atonement**.
    - Christ’s impeccability is essential for his role as the second Adam.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s priestly work depends on his moral perfection.
    - Impeccability assures believers of the sufficiency and security of salvation.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, the salvation of men would have been forever uncertain." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Affirmation of Christ’s True Humanity**
    - Christ possessed a real human nature, with all its faculties and capacities.
    - His humanity was not diminished by the presence of the divine nature.
    - The reality of Christ’s obedience and suffering is preserved.
    - Impeccability does not negate the authenticity of Christ’s human experience.
    - "He was a true man, but a man in whom the divine nature dwelt in all its fullness." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s robust defense of the **impeccability of Christ** became a standard articulation within Reformed and evangelical theology, shaping subsequent discussions on the person and work of Christ. His careful distinction between **temptation** and the possibility of sin has influenced generations of theologians grappling with the mystery of the incarnation. Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold both the full humanity and full deity of Christ in the context of soteriology.
