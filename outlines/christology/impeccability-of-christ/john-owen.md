# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen vigorously defended the **impeccability of Christ**, arguing that the incarnate Son could not sin due to the **hypostatic union** of divine and human natures. He affirmed the reality of Christ’s **temptations**, but insisted that Christ’s divine personhood rendered actual sinning impossible, thereby safeguarding the integrity of **Christology** and the sufficiency of the **atonement**.

- "It was impossible that the Lord Christ should be overcome by any temptation, or in the least measure turned aside from the perfection of holiness." ("The Temptation and Triumph of Christ")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one person, making sin impossible.
    - The divine nature cannot be tainted by sin, and thus the person of Christ is impeccable.
    - The union ensures that Christ’s will is always aligned with the will of God.
    - Any possibility of Christ sinning would undermine the doctrine of **incarnation**.
    "The union of the two natures in the same person rendered it impossible that he should sin." ("Christologia")

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ experienced genuine temptations as part of his true humanity.
    - Temptation did not imply a liability to sin, but a testing of obedience.
    - The temptations were necessary for Christ’s role as the second Adam.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation demonstrates his perfect righteousness.
    "He was really tempted, though he could not be overcome." ("The Temptation and Triumph of Christ")

3. **Necessity for a Perfect Mediator**
    - Only a sinless mediator could accomplish **redemption** for sinners.
    - Christ’s impeccability guarantees the efficacy of his atoning work.
    - Any imperfection would disqualify Christ as the substitute for sinners.
    - The priestly office of Christ demands absolute holiness.
    "He who was to be a mediator must be absolutely free from all sin." ("The Person of Christ")

4. **Distinction Between Peccability and Impeccability**
    - Owen distinguishes between being able to be tempted (peccability) and being able to sin (impeccability).
    - Christ’s temptability arises from his true humanity, not from any moral weakness.
    - Impeccability is grounded in the divine person, not merely the human nature.
    - The distinction preserves both Christ’s solidarity with humanity and his divine perfection.
    "He was capable of being tempted, but not of sinning." ("The Temptation and Triumph of Christ")

5. **Safeguarding the Doctrine of Atonement**
    - The atonement depends on the sinlessness of the sacrifice.
    - Christ’s impeccability ensures the sufficiency and acceptability of his offering.
    - Any potential for sin would compromise the value of the atonement.
    - The doctrine upholds the justice and holiness of God in salvation.
    "Had he been capable of sin, his sacrifice could not have been accepted." ("Christologia")

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has profoundly shaped Reformed Christology, providing a robust framework for understanding the person and work of Christ. His careful distinction between temptation and the possibility of sin has influenced subsequent theological reflection on the humanity and divinity of Jesus. Owen’s arguments continue to be cited in debates over the nature of Christ’s person and the requirements for a perfect mediator, ensuring his ongoing relevance in **systematic theology**.
