# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann approaches the **impeccability of Christ** through his distinctive **theology of hope** and the concept of the **crucified God**, emphasizing the genuine humanity and suffering of Jesus. He challenges traditional formulations of **impeccability** by stressing the reality of Christ’s temptations and his solidarity with human suffering, while maintaining the significance of the **incarnation** for redemption.

- "If Jesus’ temptations were not real, then neither was his humanity." (The Crucified God)

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Way of Jesus Christ (1989)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1990)
- Theology of Hope (1964)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Emphasis on the Reality of Christ’s Temptation**
    - Christ’s temptations are essential to his true **humanity**.
    - The possibility of sinning is necessary for genuine solidarity with humanity.
    - Impeccability must not undermine the existential depth of Christ’s struggle.
    - The temptations reveal the depth of Christ’s identification with the human condition.
    - "If Christ could not have sinned, then his temptations lose their existential seriousness." (The Way of Jesus Christ)

2. **Crucified God and Divine Suffering**
    - God in Christ truly suffers, including the suffering of temptation.
    - Divine **impassibility** is reinterpreted in light of the cross.
    - The cross is the locus of God’s identification with sinful humanity.
    - Impeccability is reframed as God’s willingness to enter into the risk of suffering.
    - "God allows himself to be affected and wounded by the world in Christ." (The Crucified God)

3. **Hope and Eschatological Fulfillment**
    - The **resurrection** is the vindication of Christ’s faithfulness, not mere avoidance of sin.
    - Eschatological hope is grounded in Christ’s victory over real temptation and death.
    - Impeccability is understood in the context of future redemption, not static perfection.
    - The humanity of Christ is oriented toward the fulfillment of God’s promises.
    - "The resurrection is the answer to the question posed by the cross." (Theology of Hope)

4. **Solidarity with Human Suffering**
    - Christ’s ability to be tempted is central to his solidarity with humanity.
    - Impeccability must not distance Christ from the realities of human pain and struggle.
    - The **incarnation** means full participation in the human condition, including its risks.
    - Redemption is possible because Christ enters into the depths of human lostness.
    - "Only a suffering God can help." (The Crucified God)

5. **Challenging Classical Christological Formulations**
    - Moltmann critiques traditional doctrines that overemphasize Christ’s divine nature at the expense of his humanity.
    - He calls for a dynamic understanding of Christ’s person and work.
    - Impeccability is reinterpreted as faithfulness rather than metaphysical impossibility of sin.
    - Theological reflection must remain open to the paradox of Christ’s **divinity** and humanity.
    - "The doctrine of the two natures must not become a doctrine of two persons." (The Way of Jesus Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s approach to the **impeccability of Christ** has significantly influenced modern discussions of **Christology**, especially regarding the reality of Christ’s temptations and suffering. His emphasis on the **crucified God** has encouraged theologians to reconsider the meaning of divine participation in human pain. By reframing impeccability in terms of solidarity and hope, Moltmann has contributed to a more existential and pastoral understanding of the person and work of Christ. His work continues to provoke debate and inspire new approaches in contemporary theology.
