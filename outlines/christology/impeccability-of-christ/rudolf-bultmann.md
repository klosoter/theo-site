# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **impeccability of Christ** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation, questioning traditional formulations of **sinlessness** and **incarnation**. He argued that the significance of Christ lies not in metaphysical assertions about his nature, but in the **kerygma**—the proclamation that calls individuals to authentic existence through faith.

- "It is not the sinlessness of Jesus as a historical fact that is important, but the significance which the kerygma attributes to him." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "Jesus Christ and Mythology"
- "Theology of the New Testament"
- "New Testament and Mythology" (essay in Kerygma and Myth)
- "Faith and Understanding"
- "History and Eschatology"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christology**
    - Traditional doctrines, including **impeccability**, are mythological expressions needing existential reinterpretation.
    - The focus is on the existential encounter with Christ, not metaphysical claims about his nature.
    - Mythological language about Christ's sinlessness points to his revelatory significance.
    - The historical Jesus is less important than the Christ proclaimed in the **kerygma**.
    - "The real question is not whether Jesus was sinless, but what his existence means for us." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Sinlessness**
    - Christ's **sinlessness** is understood as his openness to God and authentic existence.
    - Sin is alienation from God; Christ represents the possibility of overcoming this alienation.
    - The existential response to Christ is what matters, not his ontological status.
    - The proclamation of Christ calls individuals to decision and faith.
    - "What matters is not the metaphysical nature of Christ, but the call to decision he represents." (Faith and Understanding)

3. **Rejection of Metaphysical Christology**
    - Bultmann rejects metaphysical explanations of the **incarnation** and **impeccability**.
    - He sees such doctrines as products of Hellenistic thought, not essential to faith.
    - The New Testament's concern is existential, not ontological.
    - Faith does not require belief in the historical or metaphysical sinlessness of Jesus.
    - "The mythological conception of Christ's nature is not binding for faith." (New Testament and Mythology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The **kerygma** is the proclamation that mediates the significance of Christ.
    - The meaning of Christ's person is found in the message, not in historical or metaphysical claims.
    - The kerygma interprets Christ's life, death, and resurrection as the decisive event for human existence.
    - The call to faith is the heart of the Christian message.
    - "Faith is not assent to doctrines about Christ, but response to the kerygma." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Faith as Existential Decision**
    - Faith is an existential act, not assent to doctrinal propositions.
    - The question of Christ's **impeccability** is secondary to the individual's encounter with the message.
    - Authentic existence is realized in response to the call of Christ.
    - Theological reflection must serve the existential transformation of the believer.
    - "The decisive thing is the existential encounter with the word, not the acceptance of dogma." (Faith and Understanding)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **impeccability of Christ** profoundly shaped modern **New Testament theology** by shifting the focus from metaphysical doctrines to existential interpretation and the centrality of the **kerygma**. His method of **demythologization** challenged traditional Christological formulations and continues to provoke debate regarding the relationship between faith, history, and doctrine. While controversial, his work remains influential in discussions of **Christology** and the interpretation of biblical texts in the modern era.
