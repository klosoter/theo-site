# Sinclair Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair Ferguson affirms the **impeccability of Christ**, maintaining that Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Son, was not only **sinless** but also unable to sin due to the **hypostatic union** of divine and human natures. Ferguson emphasizes that Christ’s **temptations** were real, yet his divine personhood ensured that he could not fall, safeguarding both the reality of his **obedience** and the certainty of redemption.

- "The sinlessness of Christ is not merely the absence of sin, but the presence of a positive, active, and dynamic obedience." ("The Holy Spirit")

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine nature renders it impossible for him to sin.
    - The **hypostatic union** ensures that the person of Christ is the eternal Son.
    - Christ’s humanity is real and complete, yet never independent from his deity.
    - Impeccability is not a limitation but a perfection of his person.
    - "It is not that the divine nature prevented the human nature from sinning, but that the person of the Son, who is divine, could not sin." (The Holy Spirit)

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine, involving real human struggle.
    - Temptation tested his obedience, not his capacity to sin.
    - The uniqueness of his person means he experienced temptation more acutely than fallen humans.
    - His victory over temptation is essential for his role as the second Adam.
    - "He felt the full force of temptation, precisely because he never yielded to it." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active obedience** refers to his perfect fulfillment of the law.
    - His **passive obedience** culminates in his suffering and death.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the believer’s justification.
    - Impeccability undergirds the efficacy of both obediences.
    - "His obedience was not simply the avoidance of sin, but the positive fulfillment of all righteousness." (In Christ Alone)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s Life**
    - The Spirit empowered Christ’s human nature for ministry and obedience.
    - The Spirit’s presence does not imply any deficiency in Christ’s person.
    - The Spirit’s work demonstrates Christ’s true humanity.
    - The Spirit’s anointing is consistent with Christ’s impeccability.
    - "The Spirit’s ministry in Christ’s life is the pattern for the believer, but never a substitute for his unique person." (The Holy Spirit)

5. **Impeccability and Assurance of Salvation**
    - Christ’s inability to sin guarantees the security of redemption.
    - The believer’s assurance rests on the unchangeable character of Christ.
    - Impeccability ensures the perfection of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - The doctrine safeguards the believer from doubts about Christ’s sufficiency.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, our salvation would hang in the balance." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s robust articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in discussions of Christology and assurance. His careful attention to the **hypostatic union** and the reality of Christ’s temptations has provided clarity for pastors and scholars alike. Ferguson’s work continues to influence evangelical understanding of Christ’s person and work, reinforcing the foundational truth that the Redeemer is both truly human and truly divine, and thus utterly trustworthy.
