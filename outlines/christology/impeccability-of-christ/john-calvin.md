# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin affirmed the **impeccability of Christ**, maintaining that Christ possessed a true and complete **human nature** while remaining utterly without **sin** due to the **hypostatic union** with the divine nature. For Calvin, Christ’s sinlessness was essential for His role as **mediator** and for the efficacy of His **atoning work**.

- "He was subject to all our infirmities, that He might be a true man, yet without any taint of sin." (Institutes 2.13.4)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially Book 2, chapters 12–14)
- Commentary on the Gospel According to John
- Commentary on Hebrews
- Sermons on the Epistle to the Hebrews
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ assumed a complete human nature, including all natural affections and weaknesses.
    - His humanity was real and not a mere appearance or abstraction.
    - Christ’s experience of temptation was genuine, though without sin.
    - The reality of His humanity was necessary for Him to be the second Adam.
    "He took upon Himself our nature, but without sin, that He might be a fit sacrifice." (Institutes 2.13.2)

2. **Sinlessness and Impeccability**
    - Christ was entirely free from original and actual sin.
    - The Holy Spirit sanctified Christ’s human nature from conception.
    - Christ’s sinlessness was not merely the absence of sin, but the impossibility of sinning.
    - Impeccability was grounded in the union of the divine and human natures.
    "He was not only free from all corruption, but was also endowed with the highest purity." (Institutes 2.13.4)

3. **Hypostatic Union**
    - The divine and human natures are united in the one person of Christ.
    - This union ensures that Christ’s humanity is upheld without confusion or division.
    - The divine nature guarantees the impeccability of the person of Christ.
    - The union is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    "For the Son of God was so made man, that by a communion of properties, the name of God might be applicable to the man." (Institutes 2.14.2)

4. **Necessity for Mediation and Atonement**
    - Only a sinless mediator could bear the penalty for others.
    - Christ’s impeccability qualified Him to be the spotless Lamb.
    - His sinlessness is essential for the imputation of righteousness to believers.
    - The efficacy of the atonement depends on Christ’s perfect obedience.
    "For if Christ had any guilt, He could not have suffered for others." (Commentary on Hebrews 4:15)

5. **Temptation Without Sin**
    - Christ experienced real temptations as part of His human experience.
    - These temptations were external and did not arise from sinful inclinations.
    - His victory over temptation demonstrates both His true humanity and divine power.
    - Christ’s temptations equip Him to sympathize with believers.
    "He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin." (Commentary on Hebrews 4:15)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s robust articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has profoundly shaped Reformed Christology, emphasizing both the reality of Christ’s temptations and the necessity of His sinlessness for redemption. His careful distinction between Christ’s true humanity and His utter freedom from sin remains foundational in confessional Reformed theology. Calvin’s insights continue to inform debates on the nature of Christ’s person and work, especially regarding the relationship between the **hypostatic union** and the possibility of sin.
