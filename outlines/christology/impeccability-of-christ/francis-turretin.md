# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin vigorously defended the **impeccability of Christ**, arguing that the incarnate Son could not sin due to the hypostatic union of **divine and human natures**. He maintained that Christ’s **temptations** were real but never entailed any possibility of actual sin, safeguarding both the reality of Christ’s humanity and the integrity of his **mediatorial work**.

- "Although Christ could be tempted as to the feeling of misery, he could not be tempted as to the consent of the will." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae)
- The Doctrine of Christ (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Willem J. van Asselt, ed.)
- Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics (secondary: Richard A. Muller)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s **divine nature** made it impossible for him to sin.
    - The **personal union** of natures ensured the human will was never independent from the divine.
    - Sin would have implied a division within the person of Christ, which Turretin deemed impossible.
    - The union preserved both the reality of Christ’s temptations and his inability to fall.
    - "The hypostatic union rendered sin impossible, not merely improbable." (Institutes)

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ experienced genuine temptations in his human nature.
    - These temptations were external and did not arise from any sinful inclination.
    - The temptations served to demonstrate Christ’s obedience and fitness as **Mediator**.
    - Christ’s temptations were necessary for his role as the second Adam.
    - "He was tempted, not that he might sin, but that he might conquer." (Institutes)

3. **Distinction Between Possibility and Consequence**
    - Turretin distinguished between the **absolute possibility** of sinning and the **consequent impossibility** due to the union.
    - Christ’s human nature, abstractly considered, was peccable; united to the Logos, it was impeccable.
    - The will of Christ was always governed by the divine person.
    - This distinction preserved both the integrity of Christ’s humanity and the certainty of redemption.
    - "He could sin as man, but not as God-man." (Institutes)

4. **Necessity for a Sinless Mediator**
    - Only a sinless Christ could serve as the perfect **High Priest** and substitute.
    - Impeccability was essential for the efficacy of Christ’s atonement.
    - Any possibility of sin would undermine the certainty of salvation.
    - Christ’s sinlessness was both actual and necessary for his mediatorial office.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, our salvation would be uncertain." (Institutes)

5. **Affirmation of True Humanity**
    - Turretin affirmed that Christ’s humanity was complete and real, lacking only the presence of sin.
    - The absence of original sin did not diminish his true human experience.
    - Christ’s human nature possessed a real will and affections, yet was always perfectly aligned with the divine will.
    - The impeccability of Christ did not negate the reality of his human struggles and sufferings.
    - "He was like us in all things, sin excepted." (Institutes)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** became a standard in Reformed scholastic theology, shaping later confessional statements and systematic treatments. His careful distinctions regarding the hypostatic union and the nature of Christ’s temptations influenced generations of theologians, especially within the **Westminster tradition**. Turretin’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the person and work of Christ, especially in debates over the reality and significance of Christ’s sinlessness.
