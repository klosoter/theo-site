# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **impeccability of Christ** by emphasizing the genuine reality of Christ's **human nature** and the true significance of His **temptation**. He was critical of speculative approaches that undermined either Christ’s **sinlessness** or His authentic **human experience**, arguing that the mystery of Christ’s person must be preserved without dissolving the tension between His **divinity** and **humanity**.

- "The mystery of Christ’s sinlessness is not to be explained away, but to be confessed in faith." ("The Person of Christ")

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (1954)
- The Work of Christ (1965)
- Sin (1971)
- Studies in Dogmatics (series)
- Faith and Justification (1954)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of Christ’s True Humanity**
    - Christ’s humanity was not a mere appearance but a real participation in human existence.
    - Temptation was experienced genuinely, not just outwardly or symbolically.
    - Denial of real temptation undermines the reality of the incarnation.
    - Christ’s humanity is essential for His role as **Mediator**.
    - "The reality of Christ’s humanity is not lessened by His sinlessness." (The Person of Christ)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s inability to sin is grounded in the union of **divine and human natures**.
    - The divine person of the Son ensures the impossibility of sinning.
    - The mystery of the union must be preserved, not rationalized away.
    - Attempts to explain impeccability must avoid Nestorian or Eutychian errors.
    - "The union of the divine and human in Christ is the foundation of His impeccability." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Rejection of Speculative Explanations**
    - Berkouwer warns against abstract speculation about Christ’s temptability.
    - The focus should remain on the biblical witness and the mystery of Christ’s person.
    - Overly rationalistic approaches risk distorting the doctrine.
    - The church must confess, not explain away, the paradox.
    - "The church’s confession is not a solution to a problem, but a testimony to a mystery." (The Person of Christ)

4. **Significance of Temptation for Redemption**
    - Christ’s temptation is essential for His solidarity with humanity.
    - The reality of temptation demonstrates His qualification as High Priest.
    - Temptation does not imply a potential for sin, but a real engagement with evil.
    - The redemptive work depends on both His sinlessness and His genuine testing.
    - "He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin." (The Person of Christ)

5. **Faith’s Role in Appropriating the Mystery**
    - The doctrine of impeccability is ultimately a matter of faith, not logical deduction.
    - The believer is called to trust the scriptural testimony regarding Christ.
    - The mystery of Christ’s person is confessed, not resolved.
    - Faith acknowledges both the reality of temptation and the certainty of sinlessness.
    - "Faith bows before the mystery of Christ’s person and work." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped modern Reformed discussions by insisting on the importance of both Christ’s true humanity and His sinlessness. His caution against speculative theology and his emphasis on the mystery of the **hypostatic union** have influenced contemporary Christological debates. Berkouwer’s work continues to encourage theologians to maintain a confessional approach that respects the limits of human understanding while upholding the integrity of biblical revelation.
