# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **impeccability of Christ** by emphasizing the genuine humanity and historicity of Jesus, while maintaining the uniqueness of Christ’s relationship to the **Father** and the **Spirit**. He argued that Christ’s sinlessness is not a metaphysical necessity but is rooted in the dynamic openness of Jesus’ life to **God’s eschatological self-revelation**, making Christ’s obedience a matter of historical decision rather than abstract incapacity to sin.

- "The sinlessness of Jesus is not a presupposition but the result of his obedience to the mission given him by the Father." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (1991)
- Anthropology in Theological Perspective (1985)
- Revelation as History (1968, ed. with R. Rendtorff et al.)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Historicity of Christ’s Sinlessness**
    - Christ’s **impeccability** is demonstrated in the concrete historical life of Jesus.
    - Jesus’ sinlessness is not an a priori metaphysical attribute but a lived reality.
    - The possibility of temptation was real, making Christ’s obedience meaningful.
    - The resurrection vindicates Jesus’ sinless fidelity to God’s will.
    - "The sinlessness of Jesus is to be understood as the result of his historical obedience." (Jesus—God and Man)

2. **Dynamic Relationship with the Father**
    - Jesus’ sinlessness is grounded in his unique filial relationship with God.
    - The Son’s openness to the Father’s will is the basis for his moral perfection.
    - Christ’s obedience is a continual response to the Father, not an automatic quality.
    - The Spirit’s empowerment is essential for Jesus’ faithful obedience.
    - "Jesus’ relation to God is characterized by a unique openness and receptivity." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Metaphysical Impeccability**
    - Pannenberg rejects the idea that Christ could not sin due to divine nature alone.
    - He insists that genuine temptation and the possibility of sin were present.
    - The unity of Christ’s person does not eliminate the reality of his human freedom.
    - Impeccability is a result of actual obedience, not ontological incapacity.
    - "The real possibility of sinning is presupposed by the reality of temptation." (Jesus—God and Man)

4. **Eschatological Orientation**
    - Christ’s sinlessness is oriented toward the fulfillment of God’s eschatological plan.
    - Jesus’ obedience is significant in light of the coming kingdom and final revelation.
    - The resurrection is the eschatological confirmation of Jesus’ sinless life.
    - The future of God’s self-revelation shapes the meaning of Christ’s impeccability.
    - "The resurrection is the eschatological vindication of Jesus’ obedience." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Anthropological Solidarity**
    - Jesus’ impeccability is meaningful for humanity because it is achieved within real human existence.
    - Christ’s victory over sin is representative and vicarious for all people.
    - The possibility of sin is essential for Christ’s solidarity with humanity.
    - Jesus’ sinlessness opens the way for human participation in God’s life.
    - "Only as truly human, exposed to temptation, can Jesus be the representative of humanity." (Anthropology in Theological Perspective)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **impeccability of Christ** has influenced modern discussions by insisting on the historical and existential reality of Jesus’ obedience. His rejection of a purely metaphysical view of sinlessness has encouraged theologians to consider the significance of Christ’s genuine humanity and freedom. Pannenberg’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to integrate **Christology** with historical-critical scholarship and eschatological hope.
