# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The **Westminster Standards** affirm the **impeccability of Christ** by upholding His true humanity and full **divinity** within the unity of His **person**. They teach that Christ, as the **God-man**, was "holy, harmless, undefiled," and could not sin, being sustained by the **hypostatic union** and the indwelling of the **Holy Spirit**. This doctrine safeguards the sufficiency of Christ’s **atonement** and the integrity of His **mediatorial work**.

- "The Son of God, who being very and eternal God, of one substance and equal with the Father, did... take upon him man's nature... yet without sin." (Westminster Confession of Faith, VIII.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially Chapters VIII, XI)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–40)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (sections on Christ’s person and work)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True Humanity and Sinlessness of Christ**
    - Christ assumed a real human nature, yet was "without sin."
    - His human nature was not fallen or corrupt, but pure and holy.
    - The Standards stress that Christ was "tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin."
    - His sinlessness is essential for His role as the spotless **mediator**.
    - "The Lord Jesus... was made under the law, yet without sin." (WCF VIII.4)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine nature made it impossible for Him to sin.
    - The unity of the two natures in one person ensured His moral inviolability.
    - The divine person of the Son sustained the human nature in perfect holiness.
    - The Standards reject any notion that Christ could have actually sinned.
    - "So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures... were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF VIII.2)

3. **Necessity of Impeccability for Atonement**
    - Only a sinless substitute could offer a perfect sacrifice for sin.
    - Christ’s impeccability guarantees the sufficiency and acceptability of His atonement.
    - His active and passive obedience are both grounded in His sinless character.
    - The Standards connect Christ’s sinlessness directly to His priestly office.
    - "Such as was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners." (WLC Q.40)

4. **Temptation Without Possibility of Sin**
    - Christ experienced real temptations as part of His true humanity.
    - The Standards affirm that these temptations did not arise from any sinful inclination.
    - Temptation served to demonstrate His obedience and fitness as Redeemer.
    - His divine nature ensured that temptation could never result in sin.
    - "He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." (WSC Q.16)

5. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s Sinlessness**
    - Christ was conceived and anointed by the Holy Spirit, ensuring His holiness.
    - The Spirit upheld Christ’s human nature in perfect obedience.
    - The Standards highlight the Spirit’s role in Christ’s ministry and moral purity.
    - The Spirit’s presence is a guarantee of Christ’s impeccability.
    - "Christ, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself... hath fully satisfied the justice of his Father." (WCF XI.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Westminster Standards** have profoundly shaped Reformed theology’s understanding of the **impeccability of Christ**, providing a doctrinal foundation for later confessional statements. Their careful articulation of the **hypostatic union** and Christ’s sinlessness remains a benchmark for orthodox Christology. The Standards’ influence endures in Presbyterian and broader Reformed traditions, ensuring that the doctrine of Christ’s impeccability is central to the church’s confession and proclamation.
