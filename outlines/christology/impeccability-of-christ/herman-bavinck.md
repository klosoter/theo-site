# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck affirms the **impeccability of Christ** as essential to orthodox **Christology**, insisting that the incarnate Son, while truly human, was incapable of sin due to the **hypostatic union** of divine and human natures. He maintains that Christ’s **sinlessness** is not merely the result of external constraint but arises from his unique personhood as the **God-man**, ensuring the integrity of **redemption** and the reliability of Christ as the second Adam.

- "It was not possible for Christ to sin, not because he lacked a human will, but because as the Son of God he could not will to sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation
- The Wonderful Works of God
- "The Sinlessness of Christ" (in various collected essays)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one person, making sin impossible.
    - The divine nature cannot be tainted by sin, and this preserves the human nature from sinning.
    - The person of the Son is the acting subject, ensuring the will is always aligned with God.
    - Impeccability is not a limitation but a perfection of Christ’s person.
    - "The possibility of sinning is excluded by the personal union of the human nature with the Logos." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **True Humanity and Real Temptation**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine, corresponding to his real human nature.
    - He experienced the full range of human weakness, yet without sin.
    - Temptation served to demonstrate, not test, his sinlessness.
    - His victory over temptation is essential for his role as the second Adam.
    - "He was tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Sinlessness as Essential for Redemption**
    - Only a sinless mediator can offer a perfect sacrifice for sin.
    - Christ’s sinlessness qualifies him as the representative and substitute for sinners.
    - The efficacy of atonement depends on the spotless character of the Redeemer.
    - Impeccability guarantees the unbreakable accomplishment of salvation.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, our redemption would rest on an uncertain foundation." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Distinction Between Peccability and Impeccability**
    - Bavinck distinguishes between the abstract possibility (peccability) and the actual impossibility (impeccability) of Christ sinning.
    - He rejects views that make Christ’s sinlessness merely hypothetical or contingent.
    - Impeccability is grounded in Christ’s person, not just his actions.
    - The church’s confession upholds both Christ’s true humanity and his inability to sin.
    - "The church has always confessed both the reality of Christ’s temptations and the impossibility of his sinning." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Impeccability and the Assurance of Believers**
    - Christ’s impeccability provides the foundation for the believer’s assurance of salvation.
    - The unchangeable righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers.
    - Assurance is rooted in the finished and flawless work of the Redeemer.
    - The church’s hope rests on the certainty of Christ’s moral perfection.
    - "The certainty of our salvation is anchored in the sinlessness and impeccability of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s robust articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped Reformed dogmatics, providing a nuanced synthesis of classical Christology and modern concerns. His careful distinction between Christ’s real temptations and his inability to sin has influenced subsequent theologians and preserved the integrity of orthodox soteriology. Bavinck’s work remains a touchstone for discussions on the person and work of Christ, especially regarding the relationship between the **hypostatic union** and the assurance of redemption.
