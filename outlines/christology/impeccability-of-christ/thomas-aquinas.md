# Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)

Thomas Aquinas affirms the **impeccability of Christ** by grounding it in the **hypostatic union** of the divine and human natures in the one **Person of the Son**. For Aquinas, Christ’s human will is perfectly aligned with the **divine will**, making it impossible for Him to sin, while still preserving the reality of His **true humanity** and **temptation**.

- "It was not possible for the soul of Christ to sin, because it was assumed by the Word, to whom it is united in person." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 15, a. 1)

## Key Works

- Summa Theologiae, especially III, q. 15–18
- Summa Contra Gentiles, Book IV, ch. 55–56
- Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Book III, dist. 13–16
- De Veritate, q. 24, a. 12

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s **divine nature** renders His human nature incapable of sinning.
    - The **Person of the Word** is the acting subject in Christ, ensuring moral infallibility.
    - Sin would imply a defect in the union, which is impossible.
    - The **communication of idioms** allows predication of impeccability to the Person.
    "The human nature of Christ could not sin, because it was assumed by the Word." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 15, a. 1)

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ experienced genuine **temptation** in His human nature.
    - Temptation did not arise from concupiscence but from external sources.
    - Temptation served to manifest Christ’s holiness and defeat the devil.
    - There is a distinction between being tempted and having the capacity to sin.
    "Christ was able to be tempted, but not able to sin." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 18, a. 4)

3. **Integrity of Christ’s Human Will**
    - Christ possessed a true and complete **human will**.
    - The human will was always perfectly subject to the **divine will**.
    - No conflict or disorder existed between Christ’s two wills.
    - The human will’s freedom is preserved, but always oriented toward the good.
    "The will of Christ was always conformed to the divine will." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 18, a. 5)

4. **Necessity of Impeccability for the Work of Redemption**
    - The Redeemer must be free from all sin to offer a perfect sacrifice.
    - Impeccability guarantees the efficacy of Christ’s **atonement**.
    - Christ’s sinlessness is essential for His role as **mediator**.
    - The possibility of sin would undermine the certainty of salvation.
    "It was fitting that He who came to take away sins should be free from sin." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 15, a. 1)

5. **Distinction Between Possibility and Power**
    - Christ had the **potentia absoluta** to sin in His human nature, but not **potentia ordinata** due to the union.
    - The inability to sin is not a defect but a perfection.
    - Impeccability is not contrary to true humanity.
    - The divine Person’s preservation of the human nature ensures impeccability.
    "Christ could not sin, not by lack of power, but by the power of the union." (Summa Theologiae III, q. 18, a. 4)

## Legacy and Impact

Aquinas’s doctrine of the **impeccability of Christ** has profoundly shaped both Roman Catholic and broader Christian theology, especially in articulating the relationship between Christ’s **divine and human natures**. His careful distinctions regarding temptation, will, and the necessity of impeccability for redemption remain foundational in systematic Christology. Later theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, have engaged his arguments, often affirming his insistence on the necessity of impeccability for the work of salvation.
