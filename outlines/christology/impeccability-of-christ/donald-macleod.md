# Donald Macleod (1940–2023)

Donald Macleod robustly defends the **impeccability of Christ**, arguing that Jesus Christ, as the incarnate Son, was not only able not to sin but was utterly unable to sin due to the **hypostatic union**. Macleod maintains that Christ’s **divine nature** ensured the impossibility of sin, while his **human nature** experienced genuine temptation, thus safeguarding both Christ’s **sinlessness** and the authenticity of his **temptations**.

- "If the person of Christ is divine, then impeccability is not only possible but inevitable." ("The Person of Christ," p. 228)

## Key Works

- The Person of Christ (Contours of Christian Theology, 1998)
- Jesus is Lord: Christology Yesterday and Today (1982)
- A Faith to Live By (1998)
- "The Impeccability of Christ" (in various essays and lectures)
- Christ Crucified: Understanding the Atonement (2014)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s **divine and human natures** are united in one person, making sin impossible.
    - The **divine nature** cannot sin, and this incapacity is communicated to the person of Christ.
    - The unity of the person means Christ’s actions are always those of the divine Son.
    - Impeccability does not undermine the reality of Christ’s humanity.
    - "The union of the two natures in the one person of Christ makes sin impossible for Him." ("The Person of Christ," p. 228)

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine and involved real struggle.
    - Temptation was experienced in his **human nature**, not his divine nature.
    - The inability to sin does not negate the authenticity of temptation.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation demonstrates his true humanity.
    - "Impeccability does not mean that Christ’s temptations were unreal or that He was insulated from the pressure of sin." ("The Person of Christ," p. 229)

3. **Sinlessness Essential for Mediatorship**
    - Christ’s **sinlessness** is necessary for his role as the perfect mediator.
    - Only a sinless substitute can bear the penalty for others.
    - Impeccability guarantees the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement.
    - The **priestly work** of Christ depends on his moral perfection.
    - "Only one who is Himself without sin can offer Himself for the sins of others." ("The Person of Christ," p. 230)

4. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Macleod opposes any view that diminishes Christ’s deity or suggests he could have sinned.
    - Kenotic theories undermine the **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature.
    - The Son did not divest himself of divine attributes in the incarnation.
    - True incarnation involves addition, not subtraction, of natures.
    - "The kenotic theory is incompatible with the biblical doctrine of the person of Christ." ("The Person of Christ," p. 215)

5. **Pastoral Implications of Impeccability**
    - Christ’s impeccability assures believers of the security of salvation.
    - The unchangeable holiness of Christ is the ground of Christian hope.
    - Impeccability provides confidence in Christ’s ongoing intercession.
    - The doctrine encourages worship and trust in Christ’s unique person.
    - "The impeccability of Christ is the guarantee of our salvation and the foundation of our assurance." ("The Person of Christ," p. 232)

## Legacy and Impact

Donald Macleod’s defense of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped contemporary Reformed Christology, especially in affirming the coherence of Christ’s true humanity and deity. His work has provided clarity against both kenotic and merely moralistic understandings of Christ’s person. Macleod’s careful articulation of the hypostatic union and its implications for Christ’s sinlessness continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students within the Reformed tradition.
