# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray maintained that the **impeccability of Christ** is essential to a biblical understanding of the **person of Christ** and the **atonement**. He argued that Christ, as the **God-man**, could not sin due to the hypostatic union, and that this impeccability was necessary for His role as the **second Adam** and **mediator**.

- "It was not possible for the incarnate Son of God to sin, and this impossibility inhered in the uniqueness of his person." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- "Redemption Accomplished and Applied" (1955)
- "The Person of Christ" (in Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2)
- "The Impeccability of Christ" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1943)
- "The Epistle to the Romans" (NICNT, 1959–1965)
- "Principles of Conduct" (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one **person**.
    - The divine nature renders it impossible for Christ to sin.
    - The **integrity of the incarnation** requires that Christ’s humanity is never independent from His deity.
    - Impeccability is not merely the absence of sin but the impossibility of sinning.
    - "The impossibility of sinning is grounded in the constitution of his person." ("The Impeccability of Christ")

2. **Distinction Between Peccability and Temptation**
    - Christ’s temptations were real, yet He was not able to sin.
    - The reality of temptation does not require the possibility of yielding.
    - Christ’s experience of temptation demonstrates His true humanity.
    - The impeccability of Christ intensifies, rather than diminishes, the reality of His temptations.
    - "The reality of the temptations is not dependent upon the liability to sin." ("The Impeccability of Christ")

3. **Necessity for Redemptive Efficacy**
    - Only an impeccable Christ could be the **spotless Lamb** required for atonement.
    - Impeccability ensures the **perfection** of Christ’s obedience.
    - The efficacy of the **atonement** depends on Christ’s sinlessness.
    - Christ’s role as **mediator** presupposes His absolute holiness.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, the security of our redemption would be destroyed." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

4. **Federal Headship and the Second Adam**
    - Christ’s impeccability is essential to His role as the **second Adam**.
    - As federal head, Christ must succeed where Adam failed.
    - The unbreakable righteousness of Christ secures the justification of the elect.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ depends on Christ’s inability to sin.
    - "He must be impeccable if he is to be the last Adam and the head of a new humanity." ("The Impeccability of Christ")

5. **Rejection of Kenotic and Liberal Christologies**
    - Murray rejects any view that compromises the full deity or sinlessness of Christ.
    - Kenotic theories undermine the unity and integrity of Christ’s person.
    - Liberal Christologies that posit moral development or peccability are unbiblical.
    - The church must uphold the **orthodox doctrine** of Christ’s person and work.
    - "Any theory that allows for the possibility of sin in Christ is a denial of his true deity." ("The Person of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s rigorous defense of the **impeccability of Christ** has shaped Reformed Christology in the twentieth century, especially within confessional and Westminster circles. His arguments continue to be cited in discussions of the **person and work of Christ**, providing a robust theological foundation against both modernist and kenotic reinterpretations. Murray’s clarity and fidelity to **biblical doctrine** have made his work a standard reference for those defending the sinlessness and redemptive sufficiency of Christ.
