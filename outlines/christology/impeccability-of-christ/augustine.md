# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine affirms the **impeccability of Christ**, insisting that the incarnate Son, though truly human, was utterly without sin and incapable of sinning. He grounds this in Christ’s **divine nature**, the **hypostatic union**, and the necessity of a sinless mediator for **redemption**. Augustine’s Christology thus safeguards both the reality of Christ’s temptations and the certainty of his victory over sin.

- "He took upon Him our nature, but not our sin." (Enchiridion 36)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate (On the Trinity)
- Enchiridion (Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love)
- Sermons (various, especially on the Incarnation and Temptation)
- Contra Julianum (Against Julian)
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Sinlessness**
    - Christ assumed **human nature** without inheriting original sin.
    - The virgin birth ensured Christ was not subject to Adam’s guilt.
    - Christ’s will was always perfectly aligned with the divine will.
    - His sinlessness was essential for his role as **mediator**.
    - "He was made man, but not a sinner." (Enchiridion 41)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - The **divine and human natures** are united in the one person of Christ.
    - The divine nature renders Christ incapable of sinning.
    - Temptation was real, but Christ’s divine person guaranteed victory.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - "He could be tempted, but not conquered." (Sermon 131)

3. **Necessity of a Sinless Redeemer**
    - Only a sinless Christ could offer true **atonement** for humanity.
    - The mediator must be free from the curse of sin to redeem others.
    - Christ’s perfection fulfills the demands of divine justice.
    - His sinlessness is the basis for the believer’s justification.
    - "He alone was born without sin, that He might take away our sin." (Sermon 293)

4. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine, reflecting true humanity.
    - He experienced hunger, fatigue, and emotional distress.
    - Temptation was necessary for his identification with sinners.
    - Yet, his divine nature ensured he would not fall.
    - "He suffered temptation, but from without, not from within." (De Trinitate XIII.20)

5. **Transmission of Sin and the Virgin Birth**
    - Original sin is transmitted through ordinary human generation.
    - The virgin birth interrupts this transmission in Christ’s case.
    - Christ’s conception by the Holy Spirit preserves his purity.
    - This affirms both his full humanity and total sinlessness.
    - "He was born of a woman, but not by the concupiscence of the flesh." (Enchiridion 34)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** profoundly shaped Western Christology, influencing both medieval and Reformation theology. His emphasis on the necessity of a sinless mediator became foundational for later doctrines of the **atonement** and **original sin**. Augustine’s careful balance of Christ’s true humanity and divine incapacity for sin continues to inform orthodox Christian reflection on the person and work of Christ.
