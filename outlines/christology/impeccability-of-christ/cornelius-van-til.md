# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **impeccability of Christ** within the framework of **Reformed Christology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the unity of Christ’s **divine and human natures** in the one **person of the Mediator**, insisting that Christ’s inability to sin was grounded in the ontological reality of the **incarnation** and the sovereign plan of the **triune God**.

- "It was not possible for the person of Christ to sin, since the person of Christ is the second person of the Trinity." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

## Key Works

- "An Introduction to Systematic Theology"
- "The Defense of the Faith"
- "Christianity and Barthianism"
- "The Person of Christ" (in The New Bible Dictionary)
- "The Doctrine of Scripture" (for Christological implications)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True Union of Divine and Human Natures**
    - Christ is one person with both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - The divine nature guarantees the impeccability of the person.
    - The human nature is real, yet never acts independently of the person.
    - "The person of Christ is not divided; it is the second person of the Trinity who assumed human nature." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

2. **Impeccability Rooted in Person, Not Merely Nature**
    - The inability to sin is a property of the person, not just the divine nature.
    - Christ’s human nature was temptable, but the person was not peccable.
    - The unity of the person ensures that sin was impossible.
    - Impeccability is not a limitation but a perfection of the Mediator.
    - "It is the person who acts, and the person is the Son of God." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

3. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Van Til opposes any view that diminishes Christ’s deity or attributes.
    - The incarnation did not involve the surrender of divine attributes.
    - Christ’s divine prerogatives remain intact throughout his earthly ministry.
    - Kenotic theories undermine the reality of the atonement and mediation.
    - "The Son did not lay aside his divine nature or attributes in becoming man." ("Christianity and Barthianism")

4. **Covenantal and Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - Christ’s impeccability is essential for his role as the **second Adam**.
    - The obedience of Christ fulfills the demands of the covenant of works.
    - The redemptive plan of the triune God necessitates a sinless Mediator.
    - Impeccability is tied to the certainty of redemption for the elect.
    - "Only a sinless Christ could be the Redeemer in the covenant of grace." ("An Introduction to Systematic Theology")

5. **Presuppositional Defense of Orthodox Christology**
    - The doctrine of Christ’s impeccability is a necessary presupposition for Christian theology.
    - Any denial of impeccability undermines the authority of **Scripture** and the coherence of the gospel.
    - Apologetics must begin with the self-attesting Christ of Scripture.
    - The antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought is evident in Christological debates.
    - "We must presuppose the Christ of Scripture, who could not sin, in all our reasoning." ("The Defense of the Faith")

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** reinforced the classical Reformed position within a presuppositional framework, shaping generations of Reformed theologians and apologists. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s person and the necessity of a sinless Mediator has had a lasting influence on both systematic theology and apologetics. Van Til’s approach continues to inform debates on the person and work of Christ, especially in defending the orthodox doctrine against modern and neo-orthodox reinterpretations.
