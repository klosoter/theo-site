# Robert Letham (1947– )

Robert Letham affirms the **impeccability of Christ**, maintaining that the incarnate Son, as the divine person of the **second person of the Trinity**, could not sin. He emphasizes the unity of Christ’s **divine and human natures** in the **hypostatic union**, arguing that while Christ experienced genuine temptation, his **divine identity** rendered actual sinning impossible.

- "The person who was tempted was none other than the eternal Son, and as such he could not sin." (Systematic Theology, 2019)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s inability to sin is grounded in his being the eternal **Son of God**.
    - The **hypostatic union** ensures that the divine nature upholds the human nature.
    - The person who acts in Christ is always the divine Son, not a separate human individual.
    - Any possibility of Christ sinning would threaten the unity and integrity of his person.
    - "The one who was tempted was the eternal Son, and as such, he could not sin." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Reality of Temptation**
    - Christ’s temptations were real and involved genuine human struggle.
    - Temptation was experienced in his **human nature**, not his divine nature.
    - The absence of a fallen nature does not negate the reality of temptation.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation is essential for his role as the **second Adam**.
    - "He was tempted as we are, yet without sin, and this was a real temptation." (The Person of Christ)

3. **Distinction Between Peccability and Impeccability**
    - Letham distinguishes between the ability to be tempted (peccability) and the ability to sin (impeccability).
    - Christ could be tempted but could not sin due to his divine personhood.
    - The distinction safeguards both the authenticity of Christ’s humanity and the certainty of redemption.
    - This distinction is vital for maintaining **orthodox Christology**.
    - "He could be tempted, but he could not sin." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Role of the Holy Spirit in Christ’s Life**
    - Christ lived and acted in the power of the **Holy Spirit**.
    - The Spirit’s presence does not imply Christ’s peccability but demonstrates his true humanity.
    - The Spirit’s work is consistent with the Son’s divine nature and mission.
    - The Spirit’s empowering is part of the incarnate Son’s voluntary self-limitation.
    - "Jesus lived his life in the power of the Holy Spirit, yet as the eternal Son he could not sin." (The Person of Christ)

5. **Soteriological Significance**
    - Christ’s impeccability guarantees the **perfection of his atoning work**.
    - Only a sinless mediator can accomplish redemption for fallen humanity.
    - Impeccability assures believers of the certainty and sufficiency of salvation.
    - The doctrine upholds the reliability of Christ as the **high priest** who is holy, innocent, and undefiled.
    - "If Christ could have sinned, the whole basis of our salvation would be undermined." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

Letham’s articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has reinforced a robust, Reformed understanding of the person and work of Christ in contemporary theology. His careful distinction between genuine temptation and the impossibility of Christ’s sin has influenced discussions on **orthodox Christology** and the doctrine of salvation. Letham’s work continues to shape evangelical and Reformed engagement with the mystery of the incarnation and the reliability of Christ as Redeemer.
