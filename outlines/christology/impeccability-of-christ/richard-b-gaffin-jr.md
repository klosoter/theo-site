# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. affirms the **impeccability of Christ** as essential to orthodox **Christology**, emphasizing that Jesus, as the incarnate **Son of God**, could not sin due to the hypostatic union of divine and human natures. Gaffin maintains that Christ’s genuine **human experience of temptation** was real, yet his divine personhood rendered actual sinning impossible, safeguarding the integrity of **redemption** and the **substitutionary atonement**.

- "The reality of Christ’s temptations does not imply the possibility of his sinning, given the unity of his person as the eternal Son." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Key Works

- "By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation"
- "Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology"
- "The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology" (in *The Glory of the Atonement*, eds. Hill & Letham)
- "Calvin and the Sabbath" (for Christ’s obedience and sinlessness)
- Contributions to "The Westminster Theological Journal" on Christology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Impeccability Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Christ’s divine and human natures are united in one person without confusion or separation.
    - The divine nature renders it impossible for Christ to sin.
    - The person of the Son is the acting subject in all Christ’s actions.
    - Impeccability is not a limitation but a necessary aspect of the Redeemer’s person.
    - "The possibility of Christ’s sinning would compromise the unity of his person as truly God and truly man." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

2. **Reality of Christ’s Temptations**
    - Christ’s temptations were genuine and involved real human struggle.
    - The temptations serve to demonstrate his solidarity with humanity.
    - The experience of temptation does not imply a liability to sin.
    - Christ’s victory over temptation is essential for his role as the second Adam.
    - "The temptations of Christ are real, but their outcome is assured by who he is." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

3. **Necessity for Redemptive Efficacy**
    - Only a sinless Savior can provide effective atonement.
    - Impeccability ensures the sufficiency of Christ’s substitutionary work.
    - The unblemished nature of Christ fulfills the typology of the Old Testament sacrifices.
    - Christ’s obedience is both active and passive, grounded in his sinlessness.
    - "The atoning work of Christ depends on his perfect obedience and sinlessness." ("Resurrection and Redemption")

4. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Gaffin opposes any view that diminishes Christ’s divine attributes in the incarnation.
    - The Son retains all divine prerogatives even while assuming true humanity.
    - Kenotic theories undermine the doctrine of impeccability.
    - The integrity of Christ’s person is maintained throughout his earthly ministry.
    - "To suggest that Christ could sin is to adopt a kenotic view foreign to biblical Christology." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

5. **Union with Christ and Believers’ Sanctification**
    - Christ’s impeccability grounds the believer’s hope for sanctification.
    - Union with the sinless Christ is the basis for the believer’s victory over sin.
    - The pattern of Christ’s obedience is paradigmatic for Christian living.
    - The Spirit applies the benefits of Christ’s sinless life to the church.
    - "Our sanctification is rooted in the sinless obedience of the incarnate Son." ("By Faith, Not by Sight")

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s robust articulation of the **impeccability of Christ** has reinforced Reformed orthodoxy in contemporary theological discussions. His careful exegesis and defense of the hypostatic union have shaped generations of pastors and scholars, particularly within the Westminster tradition. By integrating Christ’s sinlessness with the doctrines of atonement and union with Christ, Gaffin has provided a framework that continues to influence systematic theology and pastoral ministry.
