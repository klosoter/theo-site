# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **impeccability of Christ** from the perspective of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing both Christ's true **humanity** and **divinity**. He maintained that while Christ was genuinely tempted and fully human, His **sinlessness** was grounded in His unique relationship to the **Word of God** and the **incarnation**. Brunner rejected speculative approaches, focusing instead on the existential and relational dimensions of Christ's person.

- "He who is the Word made flesh is not able to sin, not because of a metaphysical impossibility, but because of His obedience to the Father." (The Mediator)

## Key Works

- The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith
- Dogmatics, Vol. II: The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption
- The Christian Doctrine of God
- Revelation and Reason

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s True Humanity and Temptation**
    - Christ experienced real temptation as part of His genuine humanity.
    - Brunner insists that Christ’s temptations were not illusory but existentially significant.
    - The reality of temptation affirms Christ’s solidarity with fallen humanity.
    - Christ’s humanity is not diminished by His sinlessness.
    - "The temptation of Christ is real, or else His humanity is a mere appearance." (The Mediator)

2. **Impeccability Rooted in Divine Obedience**
    - Christ’s inability to sin is grounded in His perfect obedience to the Father.
    - Impeccability is not a metaphysical constraint but a relational reality.
    - The unity of Christ’s will with the divine will ensures His sinlessness.
    - Brunner avoids speculative explanations, focusing on Christ’s lived obedience.
    - "His sinlessness is not a natural quality, but the result of His obedience." (The Mediator)

3. **Rejection of Abstract Metaphysics**
    - Brunner resists explaining impeccability through abstract ontological categories.
    - He critiques traditional formulations that separate Christ’s natures too sharply.
    - The mystery of the incarnation is preserved by refusing speculative answers.
    - Christ’s person must be understood through revelation, not philosophical necessity.
    - "We must not seek to explain the mystery of Christ’s person by metaphysical speculation." (Dogmatics II)

4. **Centrality of Revelation and Encounter**
    - The knowledge of Christ’s impeccability comes through revelation, not reason.
    - Brunner emphasizes the existential encounter with the living Christ.
    - Faith apprehends Christ’s sinlessness as a reality, not a doctrine to be deduced.
    - The event of revelation is foundational for understanding Christ’s person.
    - "It is only in the encounter with the risen Lord that we know His sinlessness." (The Mediator)

5. **Impeccability and Soteriology**
    - Christ’s sinlessness is essential for His role as Mediator and Redeemer.
    - Only the sinless One can effect true reconciliation between God and humanity.
    - The doctrine of impeccability is inseparable from the doctrine of atonement.
    - Brunner links Christ’s moral perfection to the efficacy of His redemptive work.
    - "The Redeemer must Himself be without sin, or else He cannot save." (The Mediator)

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s approach to the **impeccability of Christ** influenced modern discussions by emphasizing the existential and relational aspects of Christ’s person. His resistance to speculative metaphysics and focus on revelation shaped later dialectical and neo-orthodox theologians. Brunner’s insistence on the reality of Christ’s temptation and obedience continues to inform debates on the relationship between Christ’s humanity and divinity. His work remains significant for those seeking to articulate a robust, biblically grounded Christology.
