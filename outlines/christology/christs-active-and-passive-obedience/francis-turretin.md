# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin provided a classic Reformed articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience**, distinguishing between Christ’s fulfillment of the **law’s precepts** (active) and His suffering the **law’s penalties** (passive) as both essential to the believer’s **justification**. He insisted that both aspects are imputed to believers, forming the basis of their **righteousness before God** and safeguarding the integrity of **substitutionary atonement**.

- "Both the active and passive obedience of Christ are required for our justification, and both are imputed to us." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 2.447)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae), esp. vol. 2, topics 14–17
- “Disputationes Theologicae” (various academic disputations)
- Willem van Asselt, Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism (secondary, for context)
- Richard A. Muller, Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, vol. 2 (secondary, for analysis of Turretin’s doctrine)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Distinction between Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active obedience** refers to His perfect fulfillment of the law’s commands.
    - **Passive obedience** designates His suffering and death under the law’s curse.
    - Both are necessary for the full satisfaction of divine justice.
    - The distinction preserves the fullness of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "The law demands not only that we suffer punishment for sin, but also that we fulfill all righteousness." (Institutes, 2.447)

2. **Imputation of Both Obediences**
    - Justification requires the imputation of both Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - Believers are counted righteous by Christ’s law-keeping and His atoning death.
    - Imputation is forensic, not transformative.
    - This guards against any notion of human merit in justification.
    - "The whole obedience of Christ, both in doing and suffering, is imputed to us for righteousness." (Institutes, 2.447)

3. **Necessity for Justification**
    - The law’s demands are both positive (do this) and penal (die for sin).
    - Christ’s obedience satisfies both aspects on behalf of the elect.
    - Without both, justification would be incomplete.
    - This upholds the integrity of the **covenant of works** and its fulfillment in Christ.
    - "If only the passive obedience were imputed, we would be pardoned but not accounted righteous." (Institutes, 2.447)

4. **Substitutionary Atonement**
    - Christ acts as the representative and substitute for His people.
    - His obedience is vicarious, performed in the place of sinners.
    - Both His life and death are substitutionary in character.
    - This ensures the believer’s full acceptance before God.
    - "Christ was made under the law, both to obey and to suffer, in our stead." (Institutes, 2.447)

5. **Rejection of Antinomian and Roman Catholic Errors**
    - Rejects the Roman Catholic view that limits Christ’s merit to His suffering.
    - Opposes antinomian tendencies that deny the necessity of Christ’s law-keeping.
    - Affirms the Reformed doctrine against Socinian and Arminian objections.
    - Emphasizes the sufficiency and exclusivity of Christ’s righteousness.
    - "We must not separate what God has joined together in the obedience of Christ." (Institutes, 2.447)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s robust defense of the **imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience** became a standard in Reformed orthodoxy, shaping later confessional statements and systematic theologies. His careful distinctions influenced generations of theologians, including the Westminster divines and later Reformed scholastics. The clarity and precision of his arguments continue to serve as a bulwark against both legalism and antinomianism in discussions of justification. Turretin’s legacy endures in the ongoing Reformed commitment to the sufficiency of Christ’s righteousness for the believer.
