# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as essential to the **Reformed understanding of justification**. He maintained that Christ’s fulfillment of the **law** (active obedience) and His suffering and death (passive obedience) are both imputed to believers, forming the basis of their **righteousness before God**.

- "Christ took our place under the law, alike in its precept and its penalty." (The Person and Work of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Person and Work of Christ
- Biblical and Theological Studies (esp. essays on justification)
- The Plan of Salvation
- Faith and Life
- Selected Shorter Writings (ed. Meeter)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Active Obedience as Fulfillment of the Law**
    - Christ’s life was a perfect, personal fulfillment of the **divine law**.
    - This obedience is not merely exemplary but vicarious and representative.
    - The righteousness Christ achieved is **imputed** to believers.
    - Warfield saw this as indispensable for a full doctrine of **justification**.
    - "He fulfilled all righteousness, not for Himself, but for us." (The Person and Work of Christ)

2. **Passive Obedience as Substitutionary Suffering**
    - Christ’s suffering and death were endured in the place of sinners.
    - His **passive obedience** satisfied the penalty demanded by the law.
    - Warfield emphasized the penal and substitutionary nature of the atonement.
    - Both the curse and the punishment of the law are borne by Christ.
    - "He bore our sins in His own body on the tree." (The Person and Work of Christ)

3. **Imputation of Both Obediences**
    - Warfield insisted that both active and passive obedience are imputed to believers.
    - Justification is not merely pardon, but the reckoning of Christ’s full righteousness.
    - The believer stands before God clothed in Christ’s **perfect obedience**.
    - This double imputation is central to the **Reformed doctrine of salvation**.
    - "We are accepted as righteous in God’s sight only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

4. **Rejection of Reductionist Views**
    - Warfield opposed views that limited Christ’s work to only His death or only His life.
    - He argued that both aspects are necessary for a complete salvation.
    - Any denial of either obedience undermines the gospel’s sufficiency.
    - Warfield critiqued contemporary trends that blurred these distinctions.
    - "To omit either is to mutilate the gospel." (The Person and Work of Christ)

5. **Scriptural Foundation for the Twofold Obedience**
    - Warfield grounded his doctrine in both Old and New Testament texts.
    - He highlighted passages such as Romans 5:19 and Galatians 4:4–5.
    - The unity of Christ’s work is seen in the whole scope of redemptive history.
    - Warfield’s exegesis aimed to show the biblical necessity of both obediences.
    - "The Scriptures know no Christ who is not both our righteousness and our sacrifice." (Biblical and Theological Studies)

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** shaped twentieth-century Reformed theology and remains a standard reference in discussions of **justification**. His careful distinction and integration of both aspects influenced later confessional statements and systematic theologians. Warfield’s biblical rigor and polemical clarity continue to inform debates on the nature of Christ’s work and the doctrine of imputation. His legacy endures in the ongoing defense of the full-orbed gospel within the Reformed tradition.
