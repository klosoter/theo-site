# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** through his existential and ontological framework, rather than traditional Reformed categories. For Tillich, the work of Christ is best understood as the **New Being** who overcomes **estrangement** and embodies the **reconciliation** of humanity with God. He reframed the classical distinction between active and passive obedience, focusing instead on the **symbolic** and existential significance of Christ’s life and death.

- "The Christ is the New Being in whom the separation of man from his essential being is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Existential Reinterpretation of Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience is not a legal transaction but the existential act of overcoming estrangement.
    - The distinction between active and passive obedience is subsumed under the broader concept of the **New Being**.
    - Christ’s life and death symbolize the reunion of the finite with the infinite.
    - Obedience is understood as total surrender to the divine ground of being.
    - "The work of Christ is the manifestation of the New Being, not the fulfillment of a legal requirement." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Symbolic Understanding of Atonement**
    - The cross is a symbol of the ultimate act of obedience and surrender.
    - Christ’s suffering and death represent the depth of human estrangement and the possibility of reconciliation.
    - The atonement is not a substitutionary payment but a revelation of divine participation in human existence.
    - The meaning of Christ’s obedience is existentially appropriated by the believer.
    - "The cross as a symbol participates in the reality to which it points." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Rejection of Forensic Categories**
    - Tillich rejects the legalistic framework of **imputed righteousness**.
    - He views justification as existential acceptance rather than forensic declaration.
    - Christ’s obedience is not transferred to believers but awakens them to their essential being.
    - The classical Reformed distinction is seen as inadequate for expressing the depth of reconciliation.
    - "Justification is the acceptance of the unacceptable, not the transfer of merit." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Christ as the Bearer of the New Being**
    - Christ’s active and passive obedience are unified in his person as the New Being.
    - The New Being is the power that overcomes existential estrangement.
    - Christ’s obedience is the actualization of essential unity between God and humanity.
    - The believer participates in the New Being through faith, not through imputed obedience.
    - "In the Christ, the gap between essence and existence is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Faith as Participation, Not Transaction**
    - Faith is existential participation in the reality revealed in Christ.
    - The believer’s union with Christ is not based on legal exchange but on ontological transformation.
    - The obedience of Christ is a model and source of transformation for the believer.
    - Salvation is the experience of the New Being, not the reception of Christ’s merits.
    - "Faith is the state of being grasped by the power of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s existential and ontological approach to **Christology** challenged traditional Reformed categories such as **active and passive obedience**, shifting the focus from legal and forensic models to symbolic and existential realities. His theology influenced later discussions on the meaning of atonement, reconciliation, and the person of Christ, especially within liberal and existentialist circles. While his views diverged sharply from confessional Reformed theology, Tillich’s reinterpretation of Christ’s work continues to provoke dialogue about the nature and scope of salvation.
