# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within his broader emphasis on **religious consciousness** and the **God-consciousness of Christ**. Rather than affirming the traditional Reformed distinction between Christ’s obedience to the law (active) and his suffering (passive) as the basis for **justification**, Schleiermacher saw Christ’s redemptive work as the communication of a new **God-consciousness** to humanity.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all men by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §94)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Redefinition of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience is not a legal fulfillment but the perfect realization of **God-consciousness**.
    - The distinction between **active** and **passive obedience** is not central to Schleiermacher’s soteriology.
    - Redemption is effected through Christ’s unique spiritual life, not through imputed merit.
    - Christ’s significance lies in his role as the mediator of the divine-human relationship.
    - "The Redeemer’s perfection consists in the unbroken communication of the God-consciousness to the community." (The Christian Faith, §106)

2. **Rejection of Forensic Justification**
    - Schleiermacher moves away from the forensic model of **justification** based on Christ’s obedience.
    - Justification is understood as participation in Christ’s God-consciousness, not as a legal declaration.
    - The traditional Reformed categories of merit and imputation are reinterpreted or set aside.
    - The focus is on the transformation of the believer’s inner life.
    - "Justification is not a forensic act, but a real change in the individual through Christ." (The Christian Faith, §120)

3. **Christ as the Archetype of God-Consciousness**
    - Christ is the supreme example and communicator of **God-consciousness**.
    - His obedience is the expression of his perfect relation to God, not a fulfillment of external law.
    - The work of Christ is primarily transformative, not transactional.
    - The church participates in Christ’s God-consciousness through spiritual union.
    - "In Christ, the divine essence has become personal and historical." (The Christian Faith, §93)

4. **Emphasis on the Community of Believers**
    - The effects of Christ’s obedience are mediated through the **Christian community**.
    - Salvation is experienced corporately as the spread of God-consciousness.
    - The church is the ongoing presence of Christ’s redemptive influence.
    - The distinction between active and passive obedience is subsumed under the life of the community.
    - "The Redeemer’s influence is perpetuated in the community which he founded." (The Christian Faith, §98)

5. **Transformation over Imputation**
    - Schleiermacher prioritizes the **transformation** of the believer over the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
    - The believer’s union with Christ is existential and spiritual, not merely legal.
    - Christ’s obedience is a model and source of new life, not a substitute for human obedience.
    - The work of Christ is appropriated through faith as a living connection, not a legal transaction.
    - "The new life in Christ is the true effect of redemption, not the imputation of his merits." (The Christian Faith, §111)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** marked a decisive shift in modern theology, moving away from traditional Reformed categories toward a focus on **religious experience** and **God-consciousness**. His approach influenced later liberal theology and contributed to the decline of forensic models of **justification** in many Protestant circles. While often criticized by confessional theologians, Schleiermacher’s work remains foundational for understanding the development of modern Christology and soteriology. His legacy endures in ongoing debates about the nature of Christ’s work and the meaning of salvation.
