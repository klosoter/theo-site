# Meredith G. Kline (1922–2007)

Meredith G. Kline articulated a distinctive understanding of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within the framework of **covenant theology**. He maintained that Christ, as the Second Adam, fulfilled both the positive requirements and penal sanctions of the law, thereby securing the **imputed righteousness** necessary for the believer’s **justification**.

- "The obedience of Christ, both in doing and in suffering, is the ground of the justification of the ungodly." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Key Works

- Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a Covenantal Worldview
- By Oath Consigned: A Reinterpretation of the Covenant Signs of Circumcision and Baptism
- Treaty of the Great King: The Covenant Structure of Deuteronomy
- God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Covenantal Structure of Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience is interpreted through the lens of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**.
    - The first Adam’s failure under the covenant of works necessitated a Second Adam.
    - Christ fulfills the probationary obedience required by the original covenant.
    - Both the positive and penal aspects of the law are satisfied in Christ’s work.
    "The probationary obedience required of Adam is fulfilled by Christ as covenant head." (Kingdom Prologue)

2. **Active Obedience as Law-Keeping**
    - Christ’s active obedience refers to His perfect fulfillment of the law’s demands.
    - This obedience is not merely avoidance of sin but positive righteousness.
    - The merit of Christ’s law-keeping is imputed to believers.
    - Active obedience is essential for the believer’s **justification**.
    "The righteousness required for life is the accomplishment of the law’s positive demands." (Kingdom Prologue)

3. **Passive Obedience as Penal Substitution**
    - Christ’s passive obedience centers on His suffering and death under the curse of the law.
    - He bears the penalty due to sinners as their substitute.
    - Passive obedience is inseparable from active obedience in the work of redemption.
    - The curse-bearing aspect fulfills the covenant’s sanction for disobedience.
    "Christ’s suffering is the judicial execution of the curse for covenant-breaking." (By Oath Consigned)

4. **Imputation and Federal Representation**
    - Christ acts as the federal head of the new humanity.
    - His obedience (both active and passive) is reckoned to believers by imputation.
    - This federal transfer is rooted in the structure of biblical covenants.
    - Justification depends entirely on Christ’s representative obedience.
    "The forensic transfer of Christ’s obedience is the heart of justification." (Kingdom Prologue)

5. **Typology and Redemptive-Historical Fulfillment**
    - Kline reads Christ’s obedience in light of Old Testament typology.
    - The exodus, sacrificial system, and covenant mediators prefigure Christ’s work.
    - Christ’s obedience fulfills the typological patterns of law and sacrifice.
    - The redemptive-historical approach underscores the unity of Scripture.
    "The typological structures of the old covenant find their telos in Christ’s obedience." (Kingdom Prologue)

## Legacy and Impact

Kline’s robust articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within a covenantal framework has significantly shaped Reformed biblical theology. His emphasis on **federal headship** and the redemptive-historical unity of Scripture has influenced generations of scholars and pastors, especially in the Westminster tradition. Kline’s work continues to provoke discussion on the relationship between law, gospel, and the structure of biblical covenants.
