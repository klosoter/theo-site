# Martin Luther (1483–1546)

Martin Luther’s doctrine of **justification by faith alone** is foundational to his understanding of **Christ’s active and passive obedience**. He insisted that both Christ’s perfect fulfillment of the **Law** (active obedience) and his atoning **suffering and death** (passive obedience) are imputed to believers, forming the sole basis of their **righteousness before God**.

- "Christ has fulfilled the Law for us, so that we are counted righteous on account of Him." (Lectures on Galatians)

## Key Works

- Lectures on Galatians (1535)
- The Freedom of a Christian (1520)
- Commentary on Romans (1515–1516)
- Heidelberg Disputation (1518)
- Luther’s Small Catechism (1529)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Justification by Faith Alone**
    - Justification is a forensic declaration, not a process of moral transformation.
    - The believer is declared righteous solely on the basis of Christ’s merit.
    - Faith is the means by which Christ’s righteousness is received.
    - Works contribute nothing to the ground of justification.
    - "Faith alone justifies, but faith is never alone." (Commentary on Galatians)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - Christ’s righteousness is reckoned to the believer by God’s gracious act.
    - Both Christ’s obedience to the Law and his suffering are imputed.
    - The believer’s sin is imputed to Christ, and Christ’s righteousness to the believer.
    - This double imputation is central to the believer’s assurance.
    - "This is that mystery which is rich in divine grace to sinners: wherein by a wonderful exchange our sins are no longer ours but Christ’s." (Two Kinds of Righteousness)

3. **Active and Passive Obedience of Christ**
    - Christ’s active obedience refers to his perfect fulfillment of the Law.
    - His passive obedience refers to his suffering and death for sinners.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the believer’s justification.
    - The entirety of Christ’s work is credited to the believer.
    - "He fulfilled the Law for us and bore our punishment, so that we might be free." (Lectures on Galatians)

4. **Forensic Nature of Righteousness**
    - Righteousness is an external status, not an internal quality.
    - God declares the sinner righteous on account of Christ.
    - The believer remains simul iustus et peccator (simultaneously righteous and sinner).
    - Assurance rests on God’s declaration, not on personal holiness.
    - "We are righteous not in ourselves but in Christ, by faith." (Commentary on Romans)

5. **Exclusion of Human Merit**
    - Human works play no role in achieving or maintaining justification.
    - Salvation is entirely by grace, apart from works of the Law.
    - Even the regenerate remain dependent on Christ’s righteousness.
    - Any attempt to add human merit undermines the gospel.
    - "The Law says, ‘Do this,’ and it is never done. Grace says, ‘Believe in this,’ and everything is already done." (Heidelberg Disputation)

## Legacy and Impact

Luther’s articulation of **justification by faith alone** and the imputation of Christ’s **active and passive obedience** became foundational for Protestant theology, especially within the Reformed and Lutheran traditions. His emphasis on the forensic nature of justification and the exclusion of human merit shaped subsequent confessional standards and debates. Luther’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on the doctrine of salvation and the nature of Christian assurance.
