# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine did not explicitly articulate the later Reformed distinction between **Christ’s active and passive obedience**, but his theology laid crucial groundwork for understanding **Christ’s righteousness** and **atoning work**. He emphasized Christ’s fulfillment of the **Law** and His suffering as the means by which humanity is redeemed, highlighting both the obedience of Christ’s life and His sacrificial death as essential to **salvation**.

- "He was made man to show us in Himself the pattern of holy life, and to make satisfaction for our sins." (Enchiridion 33)

## Key Works

- De Trinitate
- Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, and Love
- Sermons on Selected Lessons of the New Testament
- On the Spirit and the Letter
- City of God

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Obedience as Fulfillment of the Law**
    - Christ’s life demonstrates perfect obedience to the divine Law.
    - Augustine sees Christ as the new Adam, succeeding where Adam failed.
    - The righteousness of Christ’s life is essential for human restoration.
    - Christ’s obedience is both an example and a source of merit for believers.
    - "He fulfilled all righteousness in order to show that righteousness which alone is truly perfect." (Sermon 83)

2. **Atonement through Christ’s Suffering**
    - Christ’s suffering is central to the forgiveness of sins.
    - Augustine emphasizes the necessity of Christ’s death as a sacrifice.
    - The cross is the means by which the penalty for sin is borne.
    - Christ’s passion is the culmination of His obedience.
    - "He endured death, not as a penalty for Himself, but as a penalty for us." (Enchiridion 41)

3. **Union with Christ in Salvation**
    - Believers are united to Christ’s righteousness through faith.
    - The benefits of Christ’s obedience are applied to the faithful.
    - Augustine connects justification with participation in Christ.
    - The Church is the body in which Christ’s merits are shared.
    - "We are justified by faith in Christ, who was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification." (On the Spirit and the Letter 32)

4. **Grace as the Foundation of Obedience**
    - Human obedience is impossible without divine grace.
    - Christ’s obedience is both a model and a gift imparted by grace.
    - Augustine rejects any notion of meritorious works apart from grace.
    - The initiative in salvation always belongs to God.
    - "For what have we that we have not received?" (On the Spirit and the Letter 15)

5. **Christ as Mediator and Substitute**
    - Christ mediates between God and humanity through His obedience and suffering.
    - His substitutionary role is central to Augustine’s soteriology.
    - Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers through His mediatorial work.
    - The incarnation is necessary for Christ to act as both priest and sacrifice.
    - "He who was without sin became sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him." (Enchiridion 41)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s theology of **Christ’s obedience** profoundly shaped Western understandings of atonement and righteousness, providing a foundation for later distinctions between active and passive obedience in Reformed thought. His emphasis on **grace**, the necessity of Christ’s fulfillment of the Law, and the substitutionary nature of the cross influenced medieval and Reformation theologians alike. While not systematic on this precise distinction, Augustine’s insights remain pivotal for discussions of **justification** and the work of Christ.
