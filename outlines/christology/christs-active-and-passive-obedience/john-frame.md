# John Frame (1939–)

John Frame affirms the classic Reformed doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience**, emphasizing their inseparability in the accomplishment of **redemption**. He maintains that Christ’s entire life and death constitute the fulfillment of the **law** and the satisfaction of **divine justice**, forming the basis for the believer’s **justification**. Frame’s approach is marked by his commitment to **biblical theology** and his distinctive **triperspectivalism**.

- "Jesus’ whole life, not just his death, was necessary for our salvation, for he had to fulfill all righteousness on our behalf." (Systematic Theology)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (2013)
- Salvation Belongs to the Lord (2006)
- The Doctrine of God (2002)
- The Doctrine of the Christian Life (2008)
- "Active and Passive Obedience of Christ" (in The Collected Shorter Theological Writings)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience cannot be artificially divided; his whole incarnate life is redemptive.
    - Both his law-keeping and his suffering are essential for **justification**.
    - The distinction is helpful pedagogically but not ontologically.
    - Frame resists any view that minimizes either aspect in the work of **atonement**.
    - "The distinction between active and passive obedience is useful, but we must remember that all of Christ’s obedience is both active and passive." (Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenant Representation**
    - Christ acts as the second **Adam**, fulfilling the covenant of works on behalf of his people.
    - His obedience is vicarious, representing the elect before God.
    - Both his life and death are necessary to secure the blessings of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Frame grounds this in the biblical narrative of federal headship.
    - "Jesus is our representative, succeeding where Adam failed, both in life and in death." (Salvation Belongs to the Lord)

3. **Triperspectival Analysis**
    - Frame applies his triperspectival method to Christ’s obedience: normative (law), situational (history), existential (person).
    - This approach highlights the multifaceted significance of Christ’s work.
    - It guards against reductionism in understanding **redemption**.
    - The perspectives are mutually interpreting, not competing.
    - "We must see Christ’s obedience from every angle: as fulfillment of law, as historical event, and as personal act." (Systematic Theology)

4. **Imputation to the Believer**
    - The righteousness of Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers for their **justification**.
    - This includes both the fulfillment of the law and the payment for sin.
    - Frame upholds the forensic character of justification.
    - He rejects any view that makes justification dependent on the believer’s own works.
    - "Our justification depends entirely on the righteousness of Christ, credited to us by faith." (Systematic Theology)

5. **Biblical-Theological Emphasis**
    - Frame grounds the doctrine in the whole counsel of Scripture, not just isolated proof texts.
    - He emphasizes the unfolding of Christ’s obedience through redemptive history.
    - The Old Testament anticipates both the suffering and law-keeping of the Messiah.
    - New Testament texts (e.g., Romans 5, Philippians 2) are central to his argument.
    - "The biblical story shows us that Christ’s obedience is the fulfillment of all God’s promises." (Systematic Theology)

## Legacy and Impact

John Frame’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** has reinforced the classic Reformed understanding while integrating it with his influential triperspectival framework. His work has shaped contemporary discussions on the doctrine of **justification** and the nature of Christ’s redemptive work. Frame’s biblical-theological method and clarity have made his writings a standard reference for students and pastors seeking to understand the unity and depth of Christ’s obedience.
