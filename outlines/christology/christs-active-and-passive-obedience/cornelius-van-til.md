# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within the broader context of **Reformed soteriology** and the **covenant of grace**. He emphasized that Christ’s obedience, both in fulfilling the law and bearing the penalty for sin, is essential for the believer’s justification, and he interpreted these doctrines through the lens of **presuppositional apologetics** and the **Creator-creature distinction**.

- "It is only because Christ has rendered both active and passive obedience that the sinner can be justified before God." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Key Works

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active** and **passive obedience** are inseparable aspects of his mediatorial work.
    - Both forms of obedience are necessary for the full satisfaction of the **covenant of works**.
    - Van Til rejects any division that would undermine the unity of Christ’s person and work.
    - The obedience of Christ is always covenantal, rooted in the eternal plan of redemption.
    - "The active and passive obedience of Christ are not to be separated, for both are required by the justice of God." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Covenantal Representation**
    - Christ acts as the **second Adam**, representing his people in both law-keeping and penalty-bearing.
    - The obedience of Christ fulfills the requirements of the **covenant of grace**.
    - The imputation of Christ’s righteousness is grounded in his federal headship.
    - Van Til frames Christ’s obedience within the context of redemptive history and covenant theology.
    - "Christ’s obedience is covenantal, as he stands in the place of his people before God." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

3. **Presuppositional Foundation**
    - The necessity of Christ’s obedience is intelligible only on the basis of **Reformed presuppositions**.
    - Human autonomy cannot account for the need or efficacy of Christ’s work.
    - The Creator-creature distinction undergirds the uniqueness of Christ’s mediatorial role.
    - All attempts to explain Christ’s obedience apart from biblical presuppositions result in distortion.
    - "Only the Reformed faith, with its presuppositional approach, does justice to the necessity of Christ’s obedience." (The Defense of the Faith)

4. **Forensic Justification**
    - Justification is grounded in the **imputation** of both Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - The believer’s standing before God is entirely forensic, not infused or inherent.
    - Van Til insists that any compromise on imputation undermines the gospel.
    - The double imputation (our sin to Christ, his righteousness to us) is central to salvation.
    - "The righteousness of Christ, both active and passive, is imputed to the believer for justification." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

5. **Antithesis with Non-Reformed Views**
    - Van Til critiques non-Reformed theologies for separating or minimizing Christ’s obedience.
    - He argues that Roman Catholic and liberal Protestant views distort the biblical doctrine.
    - The antithesis between belief and unbelief is evident in their respective understandings of Christ’s work.
    - Only a consistently Reformed approach maintains the integrity of Christ’s obedience and its application.
    - "Any view that does not maintain both the active and passive obedience of Christ falls short of the biblical gospel." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** reinforced the centrality of these doctrines in Reformed theology and apologetics. His presuppositional approach shaped generations of theologians to see the necessity of Christ’s obedience as foundational to the gospel and the believer’s assurance. By integrating covenant theology and the Creator-creature distinction, Van Til provided a robust defense of the Reformed understanding of justification. His influence persists in contemporary discussions of **federal theology** and the apologetic defense of orthodox Christology.
