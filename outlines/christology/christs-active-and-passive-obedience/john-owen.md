# John Owen (1616–1683)

John Owen articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as central to the work of **atonement** and the believer’s **justification**. He insisted that both Christ’s perfect fulfillment of the **law** (active obedience) and his suffering the penalty for sin (passive obedience) are imputed to believers, forming the basis of their acceptance before God.

- "The obedience of Christ, both active and passive, is the sole foundation of our justification before God." (The Doctrine of Justification by Faith)

## Key Works

- The Doctrine of Justification by Faith
- The Death of Death in the Death of Christ
- Communion with God
- The Works of John Owen (especially Volumes 5 and 11)
- Biblical Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Necessity of Both Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active obedience** refers to his perfect fulfillment of the moral law on behalf of the elect.
    - His **passive obedience** encompasses his suffering and death as the penalty for sin.
    - Owen insists both aspects are essential for a complete **righteousness** imputed to believers.
    - Denial of either aspect undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "He was made under the law, both as to the obligation to obedience and the penalty due unto sin." (Justification by Faith)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - The righteousness of Christ, in both obedience and suffering, is **imputed** to believers.
    - Justification is not based on inherent righteousness but on the alien righteousness of Christ.
    - Owen distinguishes between the **imputation** of Christ’s obedience and the infusion of grace.
    - This imputation is the ground of the believer’s acceptance before God.
    - "The obedience and suffering of Christ are imputed unto us for our justification." (Justification by Faith)

3. **Federal Headship and Covenant Theology**
    - Christ acts as the **second Adam** and federal head of the elect.
    - His obedience fulfills the terms of the **covenant of works** on behalf of his people.
    - Owen’s covenant theology frames Christ’s obedience as vicarious and representative.
    - The unity of Christ’s person ensures the efficacy of both active and passive obedience.
    - "He fulfilled the law as our surety, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." (Justification by Faith)

4. **Sufficiency and Perfection of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s obedience is perfect, lacking nothing for the salvation of the elect.
    - No human merit or additional works can supplement Christ’s righteousness.
    - Owen rejects any notion of partial justification or cooperation with grace.
    - The sufficiency of Christ’s obedience guarantees the believer’s full acceptance.
    - "There is nothing wanting in the obedience of Christ, for the justification of them that do believe." (Justification by Faith)

5. **Union with Christ as the Basis for Imputation**
    - Believers are united to Christ by faith, forming the basis for the imputation of his obedience.
    - Union with Christ ensures that what is his becomes theirs, including his righteousness.
    - This union is spiritual, effected by the Holy Spirit, and foundational to justification.
    - Owen emphasizes that all benefits flow from this vital union.
    - "We are made partakers of all that Christ did and suffered, by virtue of our union with him." (Communion with God)

## Legacy and Impact

Owen’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology and the doctrine of **justification by faith**. His rigorous defense of the imputation of Christ’s righteousness remains a cornerstone in confessional Reformed theology. Later theologians, including those at Westminster, have drawn heavily from Owen’s covenantal and federal framework. His influence endures in contemporary debates on justification and the nature of Christ’s mediatorial work.
