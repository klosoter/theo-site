# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in **Princeton Theology**, articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as essential to the **Reformed understanding of justification**. He maintained that Christ’s perfect fulfillment of the **law** (active obedience) and his suffering the penalty for sin (passive obedience) are both imputed to believers, forming the basis of their **righteousness before God**.

- "The righteousness of Christ is the ground of our justification, and that righteousness consists in his perfect obedience to the law, in all that he did and suffered in our stead." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology (3 vols.)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on justification and atonement)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Active Obedience as Fulfilling the Law**
    - Christ’s active obedience refers to his perfect, lifelong conformity to the **moral law**.
    - This obedience is not merely negative (avoiding sin), but positive (fulfilling all righteousness).
    - Hodge insists this obedience is vicarious, performed on behalf of the elect.
    - It is essential for believers’ **justification**, as it provides the positive righteousness required by God.
    - "His obedience was not for Himself, but for us, and is imputed to us as the ground of our justification." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Passive Obedience as Suffering for Sin**
    - Christ’s passive obedience centers on his suffering and death as the penalty for human sin.
    - Hodge distinguishes this from active obedience, though both are inseparable in Christ’s work.
    - The passive obedience satisfies the demands of **divine justice**.
    - It removes the guilt and penalty due to sinners, making reconciliation possible.
    - "By his sufferings and death, he bore the penalty of the law in our stead." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Imputation of Both Obediences**
    - Both active and passive obedience are imputed to believers, forming the ground of their acceptance.
    - Imputation is a legal or forensic act, not a transformation of the believer’s nature.
    - Hodge rejects any view that limits imputation to only Christ’s death or suffering.
    - This double imputation secures both pardon and positive righteousness.
    - "The Scriptures teach that the whole work of Christ, his obedience and death, is the ground of our justification." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Justification as Forensic Declaration**
    - Justification is a legal declaration of righteousness, not an infusion of grace.
    - The righteousness imputed is entirely external to the believer, belonging to Christ alone.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which believers receive this righteousness.
    - Hodge opposes any confusion of justification with sanctification or moral renewal.
    - "Justification is not the making the person just, but declaring him to be just on the ground of what Christ has done." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Necessity of Both Obediences for Salvation**
    - Both aspects of Christ’s obedience are necessary for a full and complete salvation.
    - Without active obedience, believers would only be pardoned, not positively righteous.
    - Without passive obedience, the penalty for sin would remain unpaid.
    - Hodge sees the unity of Christ’s work as essential to the integrity of the **gospel**.
    - "It is only by the obedience and death of Christ that the demands of the law are satisfied in our behalf." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** became a standard within American Reformed theology, shaping subsequent Princeton theologians and the broader **Westminster tradition**. His careful distinction and integration of both aspects of Christ’s work have influenced confessional statements and debates on justification. Hodge’s legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of **imputed righteousness** as central to the doctrine of salvation in Reformed circles.
