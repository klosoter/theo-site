# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936– )

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. is a leading Reformed theologian who emphasizes the inseparability of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within the framework of **union with Christ**. He contends that both aspects are essential for the believer’s **justification** and must be understood as integrally related within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The active and passive obedience of Christ are not two distinct phases, but two aspects of the one obedience by which he secured our salvation." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Key Works

- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation in Christ
- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- "Justification and Union with Christ" (in Justified in Christ, ed. Beilby & Eddy)
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- Perspectives on Pentecost

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active** (law-keeping) and **passive** (suffering) obedience are inseparable in his redemptive work.
    - Both aspects are present throughout Christ’s entire earthly ministry, not merely at distinct moments.
    - The distinction is conceptual, not temporal or ontological.
    - This unity is essential for a robust doctrine of **justification**.
    "The distinction between active and passive obedience is helpful, but it must not obscure the unity of Christ’s obedience." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

2. **Obedience in Redemptive-Historical Context**
    - Christ’s obedience must be understood within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The resurrection is the climactic vindication of Christ’s obedience.
    - The benefits of Christ’s obedience are applied to believers in union with his resurrection life.
    - The historical accomplishment and its application are inseparable.
    "The resurrection is the public justification of Jesus, the declaration of his righteousness as the obedient Son." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Union with Christ as the Soteriological Center**
    - All benefits of salvation, including **justification**, flow from **union with Christ**.
    - Christ’s obedience is imputed to believers only in union with him.
    - Union with Christ encompasses both his death and resurrection.
    - This union is both forensic and transformative.
    "Justification is not something alongside or apart from union with Christ, but is one aspect of it." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
    - The righteousness imputed to believers is the whole obedience of Christ.
    - Both active and passive obedience are necessary for a complete righteousness.
    - Imputation is grounded in Christ’s representative, substitutionary work.
    - The believer’s standing before God is based solely on Christ’s obedience.
    "The imputation of Christ’s righteousness includes the totality of his obedience, not just his suffering." (Justification and Union with Christ)

5. **Critique of Reductionistic Views**
    - Warns against separating or minimizing either aspect of Christ’s obedience.
    - Critiques views that limit justification to the forgiveness of sins (passive obedience only).
    - Emphasizes the necessity of Christ’s law-keeping for positive righteousness.
    - Argues that Reformed orthodoxy requires both aspects for a full doctrine of salvation.
    "To restrict justification to the forgiveness of sins is to truncate the gospel." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s work has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed discussions on **union with Christ** and the doctrine of **justification**. His insistence on the unity of Christ’s active and passive obedience has provided a corrective to reductionistic tendencies in modern theology. Gaffin’s biblical-theological approach has influenced a generation of pastors and scholars, reinforcing the centrality of Christ’s person and work in the application of salvation. His contributions continue to be foundational in Westminster and broader Reformed circles.
