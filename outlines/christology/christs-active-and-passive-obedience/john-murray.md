# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray offered a robust articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within the framework of **Reformed soteriology**. He emphasized that both aspects are inseparable and essential for the believer’s **justification**, insisting that Christ’s lifelong obedience to the law and his suffering unto death together constitute the full ground of salvation.

- "The obedience of Christ is not to be divided into two parts, but is to be regarded as a unitary whole." ("Redemption Accomplished and Applied")

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- The Epistle to the Romans
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Select Lectures in Systematic Theology
- "The Active and Passive Obedience of Christ" (Westminster Theological Journal, 1955)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience is a single, indivisible whole encompassing both his life and death.
    - The distinction between active and passive is pedagogical, not ontological.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the accomplishment of redemption.
    - The entirety of Christ’s work is vicarious and representative.
    - "It is not proper to regard the active obedience as one part and the passive as another; both are integral to the one obedience." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

2. **Active Obedience: Fulfilling the Law**
    - Christ’s active obedience refers to his perfect fulfillment of the law throughout his life.
    - This obedience is imputed to believers as their positive righteousness.
    - Without this, justification would lack the positive aspect of righteousness.
    - Christ’s law-keeping is essential for the believer’s standing before God.
    - "The law demands not only the payment of the penalty but also the fulfillment of its precepts." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Passive Obedience: Suffering and Death**
    - Christ’s passive obedience centers on his suffering, culminating in the cross.
    - This obedience satisfies the penalty due for sin.
    - It is not limited to the crucifixion but includes all Christ’s sufferings.
    - The passive aspect is necessary for the removal of guilt.
    - "His passive obedience consisted in his enduring the penalty of sin and all the suffering entailed thereby." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Imputation in Justification**
    - Both active and passive obedience are imputed to believers.
    - Justification involves the reckoning of Christ’s righteousness to the sinner.
    - The believer is accepted as righteous because of Christ’s obedience.
    - Imputation is forensic, not transformative.
    - "The righteousness of Christ is the righteousness of his obedience in its entirety, and it is this righteousness that is imputed to the believer." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

5. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - Both aspects of obedience are required for full redemption.
    - Christ’s obedience addresses both the penalty and the positive demands of the law.
    - The work of Christ is sufficient and complete for salvation.
    - Any denial of either aspect undermines the doctrine of justification.
    - "If we do not have both, we do not have the full-orbed salvation provided in Christ." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Legacy and Impact

Murray’s careful articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** has become a standard reference in Reformed theology, shaping contemporary discussions on **justification** and the work of Christ. His insistence on the unity and necessity of both aspects has influenced generations of theologians and pastors. Murray’s legacy endures in the ongoing affirmation of the imputation of Christ’s full obedience as the ground of the believer’s acceptance before God.
