# John Calvin (1509–1564)

John Calvin articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s obedience**, distinguishing between His **active obedience** (fulfilling the law) and **passive obedience** (suffering the penalty for sin). While Calvin did not always use these later technical terms, his theology affirms that both aspects are essential for the believer’s **justification** and the accomplishment of **redemption**.

- "For how could Christ have atoned for our sins except by obeying the Father even unto death?" (Institutes II.xvi.5)

## Key Works

- Institutes of the Christian Religion (especially II.xvi–xvii)
- Commentary on Romans (notably Romans 5:19)
- Commentary on Philippians (notably Philippians 2:8)
- Sermons on Isaiah 53
- Calvin: Theological Treatises (ed. J.K.S. Reid)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Obedience is Vicarious**
    - Christ acts as the representative and substitute for His people.
    - His obedience is imputed to believers, forming the basis of their righteousness.
    - Both His law-keeping and suffering are performed on behalf of the elect.
    - The unity of Christ’s person ensures the unity of His saving work.
    - "For in his death, regarded as a sacrifice by which he expiated our sins, we see displayed his obedience, because he gave himself up to do the Father’s will." (Institutes II.xvi.5)

2. **Active Obedience: Fulfillment of the Law**
    - Christ perfectly fulfilled the demands of the **moral law** throughout His life.
    - This lifelong obedience is necessary for positive righteousness before God.
    - Calvin affirms that Christ’s righteousness is reckoned to believers.
    - The law’s requirements are satisfied in Christ’s actions, not just His death.
    - "Christ, by his obedience, indeed, wiped off our transgressions, and by his sacrifice appeased the divine anger." (Institutes II.xvi.5)

3. **Passive Obedience: Suffering the Penalty**
    - Christ bore the curse and penalty due to sinners by His suffering and death.
    - His **passion** is the culmination of His obedience, enduring God’s wrath.
    - The cross is central as the place where Christ’s passive obedience is displayed.
    - This suffering is necessary for the satisfaction of divine justice.
    - "He endured the punishment which by our sins we had deserved, and by his death offered himself as a sacrifice to remove our guilt." (Institutes II.xvi.6)

4. **Unity of Christ’s Work**
    - Calvin resists a strict separation between active and passive obedience.
    - Both aspects are inseparably united in the one mediatorial work of Christ.
    - The entirety of Christ’s incarnate life is redemptive.
    - Obedience and suffering are two sides of the same saving act.
    - "The whole course of his obedience is to be regarded as our righteousness." (Institutes II.xvi.5)

5. **Justification by Imputed Righteousness**
    - Believers are justified by the imputation of Christ’s obedience, not their own works.
    - Both Christ’s fulfillment of the law and His atoning death are credited to the elect.
    - Justification is forensic, grounded in Christ’s obedience alone.
    - Assurance rests on the sufficiency of Christ’s active and passive obedience.
    - "We, therefore, explain justification simply as the acceptance with which God receives us into his favor as righteous men." (Institutes III.xi.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Calvin’s articulation of **Christ’s obedience** laid the groundwork for later Reformed distinctions between active and passive obedience, even if he did not always use those precise terms. His emphasis on the unity of Christ’s work and the imputation of righteousness profoundly shaped the doctrine of **justification** in the Reformed tradition. Calvin’s insights continue to influence systematic theology, exegesis, and confessional formulations regarding the person and work of Christ.
