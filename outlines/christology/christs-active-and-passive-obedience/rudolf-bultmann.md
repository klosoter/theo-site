# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** through the lens of **demythologization** and existential interpretation. Rather than affirming the traditional Reformed categories of Christ’s obedience as the basis for **justification**, Bultmann emphasized the existential encounter with the **kerygma** and the call to authentic faith, seeing the significance of Christ’s work primarily in its proclamation and transformative impact on the believer.

- "The significance of the Christ event lies not in a metaphysical transaction but in the call to decision that it addresses to each individual." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christ’s Work**
    - Christ’s obedience is not to be understood in forensic or metaphysical terms.
    - The language of **active and passive obedience** is mythological and must be reinterpreted.
    - The focus is on the existential meaning of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.
    - The New Testament’s message is to be translated into terms relevant for modern existence.
    - "It is not the objective event but its existential meaning that matters." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Encounter over Forensic Categories**
    - Justification is not a legal declaration based on Christ’s obedience.
    - The believer encounters God’s grace in the proclamation of the **kerygma**.
    - Faith is a personal response to the call of God, not assent to doctrinal formulations.
    - The significance of Christ’s obedience is realized in the believer’s existential decision.
    - "Faith is not assent to a doctrine but an existential self-understanding." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Substitutionary Atonement**
    - Bultmann rejects the idea of Christ’s obedience as a substitutionary satisfaction for sin.
    - The cross is not a transaction but a revelation of God’s love and call to authentic existence.
    - The meaning of the cross is found in the believer’s transformation, not in legal imputation.
    - The categories of **active** and **passive obedience** are seen as outdated.
    - "The cross is not a cultic act of expiation but the call to follow." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ’s death and resurrection is the locus of salvation.
    - The kerygma confronts the hearer with the demand for decision and faith.
    - The historical details of Christ’s obedience are secondary to the existential message.
    - The believer’s response to the kerygma is what constitutes justification.
    - "The kerygma is the event in which God encounters man." (Faith and Understanding)

5. **Transformation through Faith**
    - The effect of Christ’s obedience is not imputed righteousness but new existence.
    - Faith brings about a radical reorientation of the self in relation to God.
    - Justification is existential: the believer is set free from self-reliance and sin.
    - The work of Christ is meaningful as it enables authentic existence before God.
    - "To believe in Christ is to receive a new existence." (Theology of the New Testament)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s existential reinterpretation of **Christ’s obedience** challenged traditional Reformed and Lutheran categories, shifting the focus from forensic justification to existential transformation. His approach provoked significant debate regarding the nature of **atonement** and the relevance of doctrinal formulations in modern theology. While controversial among confessional theologians, Bultmann’s work remains influential in discussions of **hermeneutics** and the relationship between faith and history. His legacy endures in the ongoing conversation about the meaning of Christ’s work for contemporary faith.
