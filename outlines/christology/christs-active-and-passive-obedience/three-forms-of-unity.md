# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—comprising the **Heidelberg Catechism**, **Belgic Confession**, and **Canons of Dort**—articulate a classic Reformed understanding of **Christ’s active and passive obedience**. These confessions emphasize that Christ’s perfect fulfillment of the **law** (active obedience) and His substitutionary **suffering and death** (passive obedience) are both essential for the believer’s **justification** before God. Together, they underscore that salvation is entirely by **grace** through the **imputed righteousness** of Christ.

- "He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood, and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 1)

## Key Works

- Heidelberg Catechism (1563), especially Q&A 12, 16, 17, 60
- Belgic Confession (1561), Articles 20–23
- Canons of Dort (1618–1619), Second Head of Doctrine
- Reformed Confessions of the 16th and 17th Centuries in English Translation (ed. James T. Dennison, Jr.)
- The Three Forms of Unity: Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort (standard editions)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Active Obedience Fulfills the Law**
    - Christ’s perfect life satisfied the demands of God’s **law** on behalf of the elect.
    - His righteousness is **imputed** to believers, forming the basis of their acceptance.
    - The Catechism teaches that Christ’s obedience is counted as ours before God.
    - This obedience is necessary, not just His suffering, for **justification**.
    - "God grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, as if I had never sinned nor been a sinner." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

2. **Christ’s Passive Obedience Removes Guilt**
    - Christ bore the **wrath of God** and the penalty due to sin in His suffering and death.
    - His sacrificial death is the ground for the forgiveness of sins.
    - The confessions stress the necessity of a true and righteous satisfaction for sin.
    - Christ’s suffering is vicarious and substitutionary.
    - "He presented himself in our name before his Father, to appease his wrath with full satisfaction by offering himself on the tree of the cross and pouring out his precious blood for the cleansing of our sins." (Belgic Confession, Article 21)

3. **Justification by Imputed Righteousness**
    - Justification is not by works, but by faith in Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - The believer receives both the pardon of sins and the gift of Christ’s righteousness.
    - The confessions explicitly reject any human merit in justification.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which Christ’s obedience is received.
    - "Although my conscience accuses me... God, without any merit of my own... grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ." (Heidelberg Catechism Q&A 60)

4. **Necessity of Both Obediences for Salvation**
    - Both Christ’s active and passive obedience are essential for complete salvation.
    - The confessions teach that Christ’s whole work—life and death—secures redemption.
    - No part of salvation is left to human effort or merit.
    - The unity of Christ’s person and work is emphasized throughout.
    - "We believe that Jesus Christ is a high priest forever... who presented himself in our name before his Father, to appease his wrath with full satisfaction." (Belgic Confession, Article 21)

5. **Salvation is Entirely by Grace**
    - The confessions stress the **sovereign grace** of God in providing Christ’s obedience.
    - Human works contribute nothing to the ground of acceptance before God.
    - The Canons of Dort defend the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ’s atonement for the elect.
    - Assurance rests on Christ’s finished work, not on human performance.
    - "This justification is entirely of God’s grace, granted solely because of Christ’s merit." (Canons of Dort, Second Head, Article 7)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have profoundly shaped the Reformed understanding of **justification** and the work of Christ, especially in distinguishing between His active and passive obedience. Their clear articulation of **imputed righteousness** and the sufficiency of Christ’s work remains foundational for Reformed confessional identity. These documents continue to serve as doctrinal standards for Reformed churches worldwide, ensuring that the centrality of Christ’s obedience is preserved in preaching, teaching, and pastoral care.
