# Andrew A. Bonar (1810–1892)

Andrew A. Bonar, a leading Scottish Presbyterian, taught that both **Christ’s active and passive obedience** are essential for the believer’s **justification**. He insisted that Christ’s perfect fulfillment of the **law** and His substitutionary **atonement** together secure the full redemption of sinners, grounding assurance in the sufficiency of Christ’s work alone.

- "He obeyed the law for us, and He suffered the penalty for us; in both, our Surety is all our righteousness." (The Everlasting Righteousness)

## Key Works

- The Everlasting Righteousness (1874)
- Commentary on Leviticus (1846)
- Memoir and Remains of Robert Murray M‘Cheyne (1844)
- Christ and His Church in the Book of Psalms (1859)
- The Blood of the Cross (1866)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Necessity of Both Active and Passive Obedience**
   - Christ’s obedience to the law and His suffering are both essential for salvation.
   - The law’s demands are not only penal but also require perfect righteousness.
   - Christ’s active obedience fulfills the preceptive aspect of the law.
   - His passive obedience satisfies the penal demands through His death.
   "He must obey as well as suffer, or there is no righteousness for us." (The Everlasting Righteousness)

2. **Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness**
   - The righteousness of Christ is counted to believers by faith.
   - Both His obedience in life and His atoning death are imputed.
   - Justification is grounded in the complete work of Christ, not in human merit.
   - Imputation ensures the believer stands accepted before God.
   "It is not our faith, but His obedience, that is our righteousness." (The Everlasting Righteousness)

3. **Substitutionary Atonement**
   - Christ acts as the substitute for His people in both obedience and suffering.
   - His substitution is personal, particular, and effectual for the elect.
   - The cross is the culmination of His passive obedience.
   - The believer’s assurance rests on Christ’s finished work as substitute.
   "He took our place in law, and bore our curse, that we might stand in His place of blessing." (The Blood of the Cross)

4. **Fulfillment of the Covenant of Works**
   - Christ fulfills the broken covenant of works on behalf of His people.
   - His perfect life restores what Adam lost by disobedience.
   - The covenantal structure undergirds the necessity of both forms of obedience.
   - Believers are brought into the blessings of the covenant by union with Christ.
   "The Second Adam has kept the law for us, and so the covenant is fulfilled." (Commentary on Leviticus)

5. **Pastoral Assurance in Christ’s Complete Work**
   - Assurance is rooted in the sufficiency of Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
   - The believer’s peace comes from looking to Christ’s finished work, not inward experience.
   - Bonar’s pastoral counsel directs Christians to rest in Christ’s righteousness.
   - The double obedience of Christ is the foundation for Christian comfort and hope.
   "Rest not in your feelings, but in His finished obedience and blood." (The Everlasting Righteousness)

## Legacy and Impact

Bonar’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** reinforced classic Reformed soteriology and provided deep assurance to believers in the Free Church of Scotland and beyond. His writings popularized the doctrine of **imputed righteousness** and shaped devotional life for generations. Bonar’s influence persists in Reformed discussions of justification and the work of Christ, ensuring the centrality of Christ’s complete obedience in evangelical theology.
