### TITLE
The one obedience of the last Adam: why justification requires both fulfillment and curse-bearing

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Core conceptual issue: Whether Christ, as the second and **last Adam**, fulfilled both the precept and penalty of God’s law under the **covenant of works**, and whether both aspects of that one mediatorial obedience are imputed to believers in **union with Christ** for their justification.
- Decisive figures: John Calvin, Francis Turretin, John Owen, Johannes Piscator, Robert Bellarmine, N. T. Wright.
- Relevant traditions: Reformed scholastic and **federal theology**; early Reformed and Puritan confession; Tridentine Roman Catholic soteriology; modern biblical theology and Pauline studies.
- Debates addressed:
  - Internal: Reformed dispute over imputation of Christ’s active obedience versus remission only, the status of the **covenant of works**, and the relation of **imputation** to **union with Christ**.
  - External: Roman Catholic denial of imputed righteousness in favor of infused habitus and merit; critiques of **penal substitution** and law-court categories.
  - Contemporary: New Perspective on Paul’s redefinition of justification and righteousness, Federal Vision tensions over union and final judgment, anxieties about antinomianism and legal fiction.
- Defended position: In line with classic Reformed **federal theology**, I will argue that Christ’s whole mediatorial obedience is one indivisible work with distinguishable aspects, actively fulfilling the law and passively bearing its curse, both of which are imputed to believers for justification, grounding both pardon and positive title to life, without collapsing **law-gospel** or denying sanctification.

### ESSAY
The doctrine of Christ’s active and passive obedience attempts to articulate how the incarnate Son, as the last Adam, answers the twofold demand of the divine law within the order of creation: perfect, personal, perpetual obedience to its precept, and satisfaction for its violated sanction. In the grammar of classic **federal theology**, this law-order is identified with the **covenant of works**, by which God promised eschatological life to Adam and his posterity upon obedience and threatened death upon transgression. To say that Christ’s obedience is active and passive is not to divide his work into discrete bins, as if he first completed a catalogue of virtues and then proceeded to die. Rather, it is to mark a single mediatorial obedience rendered across his whole incarnate state that has two relations to the law: as fulfilling the law’s precept in righteousness, and as bearing the law’s curse in sacrificial death. The further claim that both are imputed to believers in **union with Christ** is the Reformed answer to justification’s two dimensions: the forgiveness of sins and the positive reckoning of righteousness before God.

John Calvin (1509–1564) framed the doctrinal center even if he did not consistently deploy the later terminology. Writing against both the Roman view of infused righteousness and emerging antinomian distortions, Calvin anchored justification in the forensic declaration of righteousness on the basis of Christ alone. In the Institutes and commentaries, he repeatedly speaks of the whole obedience of Christ as the material cause of our justification, and he links that obedience to both fulfillment and sacrifice. On Romans 5, he contrasts the disobedience of the first Adam with the obedience of the second, and on Galatians 3 and 4 he insists that Christ was made under the law and became a curse for us, in order to redeem and to confer the adoption to sons. A Westminster examiner will press whether Calvin clearly taught imputation of Christ’s active obedience. The answer is that Calvin’s insistence that Christ merited righteousness for us by a lifelong course of obedience, his use of Romans 5 to speak of the obedience of Christ as the ground of our acceptance, and his refusal to collapse justification into mere pardon together render the later Reformed formulation a faithful rational development rather than departure. Calvin’s method was exegetical, his polemical target was the Tridentine denial of forensic justification, and his theological pole-axes were Christ’s priestly work and our mystical union with him. These coordinates set the stage for the post-Reformation refinement that would speak explicitly of active and passive obedience.

Francis Turretin (1623–1687) provided the classic scholastic articulation that still governs the discussion. In his Institutes of Elenctic Theology he posed the question directly: is the active obedience of Christ imputed to believers, or only his passive obedience unto death? Turretin’s framework is unapologetically **federal theology**. He reasons from the order God has established. If the law as such promises life to the doer and threatens death to the transgressor, and if the first Adam’s failure brought both guilt and corruption upon his posterity, then the mediator, in order to secure a people’s right to life, must both bear the curse and fulfill the precept. Turretin responds to the internal Reformed dissent of Johannes Piscator by distinguishing personal and mediatorial obedience. He grants that as man Christ owed obedience, but he denies that this debt renders his fulfillment incommunicable. As the designed mediator under the **covenant of redemption**, Christ rendered his obedience not as a private person for himself but as a public person for his people. Further, Turretin underscores that even had the curse been borne, mere remission would restore a sinner to a state of probation, not crown him with eschatological life. Without imputed righteousness, justification becomes only non-imputation of sin rather than also the positive imputation of righteousness. To the objection that Scripture nowhere teaches the imputation of Christ’s active obedience, he argues that Romans 5 requires a righteousness constituted by the obedience of the one man, that 2 Corinthians 5 asserts we become the righteousness of God in him, and that Philippians 2 and Hebrews 5 depict an obedience perfected through suffering unto life for many. An examiner will ask whether this is not an artificial scholastic overlay. Turretin’s rejoinder is that the law’s twofold demand is native to biblical law-court idiom, that Christ’s role as the last Adam is covenantal and federal, and that these distinctions, although technical, minister clarity to the apostolic logic.

John Owen (1616–1683), a chief theological architect of post-Westminster Anglican Puritanism, matched Turretin’s clarity with pastoral weight and polemical power. In The Doctrine of Justification by Faith, Owen defends imputation, not as a speculative construct, but as the scriptural grammar of the gospel. He contends that justification has two parts conjoined by **union with Christ**: the non-imputation of sin and the imputation of righteousness. For Owen, the righteousness imputed is neither faith as a new law nor a subset of Christ’s obedience, but the whole obedience of Christ as mediator, considered under the distinct relations of precept and penalty. He draws heavily on Romans 5 to argue that the one man’s obedience is reckoned to the many unto justification. He links Galatians 4 to Christ’s being made under the law and redeeming those under the law, and he insists that the curse in Galatians 3 is not reducible to exile or social malediction but is the judicial curse of the law that Christ bears in our place. In The Death of Death, Owen defends **penal substitution** under the logic of federal headship, which presupposes a precept to be fulfilled and a penalty to be borne. Against Roman Catholic opponents like Robert Bellarmine, Owen insists that infused habits of love cannot be the formal cause of our right standing, because justification is a courtly act, not a hospital therapy. If challenged on antinomianism, Owen replies that imputed righteousness grounds our acceptance and liberates conscience, but the sanctifying work of the Spirit in union with the righteous Christ produces real, necessary obedience as the fruit and evidence of faith according to **law-gospel** order. Final judgment according to works becomes a public vindication of grace, not an alternate ground of life. Owen’s conceptual contribution is to gather the strands of federal headship, atonement, and the nature of justification into a coherent whole in which Christ’s active and passive obedience are indispensable.

Johannes Piscator (1546–1625) catalyzed the central internal debate. A respected Reformed exegete, Piscator denied the imputation of Christ’s active obedience, arguing that as a man, Christ owed the law for himself. His obedience formed his personal qualification for priestly sacrifice and could not be reckoned to others. He therefore limited the ground of justification to the remission of sins by the imputation of Christ’s death. This view was not marginal in his day; it forced a definitive response among the Reformed. The Helvetic Consensus Formula and the Westminster Standards took up the issue. Westminster Confession 11 speaks of God justifying not by infusing righteousness but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, and the Larger Catechism states that Christ fulfilled all righteousness. The inclusion of obedience in the formal cause of justification is a deliberate repudiation of Piscator’s restriction. Turretin and Owen, as well as Rutherford and other divines, refuted Piscator by appeal to Romans 5 and to the federal nature of Christ’s mediatorial person. They contended that although Christ as man owed obedience, he did not owe it as a private party under the covenant of works; rather, he subsisted as the eternal Son assuming human nature precisely to render obedience for his seed. The Reformed thus framed a careful distinction: Christ’s human nature owed obedience, but the incarnate person did not owe it for himself in such a manner as to exclude its imputation for others, because he entered the human condition as covenant head.

Robert Bellarmine (1542–1621) stands as the most formidable external opponent in the Tridentine tradition. Within Roman soteriology, justification is the transformation of the ungodly into godly by infused grace, with the resulting habitual righteousness as the formal cause of acceptance. Bellarmine attacked imputation as a legal fiction that fails to renew and transgresses God’s justice. He distinguishes initial justification by infusion through faith formed by charity and its increase through cooperation and merit. Within that scheme, Christ’s obedience and passion merit grace as the instrument by which the justified become worthy. On this account, talk of imputing Christ’s personal obedience is unintelligible. The Reformed answer was twofold. First, justification is forensic because Scripture speaks this way. God justifies the ungodly not by overlooking sin but by providing a mediator who bears guilt and fulfills righteousness for them. Second, the imputation of Christ’s righteousness is not a fiction because it is grounded in a real **union with Christ** established by the Spirit through faith. The union is federal and vital. As the first Adam’s sin is truly reckoned to his posterity under covenantal solidarity, so the last Adam’s obedience is truly reckoned to his. Neither are legal contrivances. Bellarmine’s insistence on infused habitus answers the sin-entanglement of the will, but it cannot answer the law’s penal demand without collapsing grace into works. The Reformed insistence on twofold imputation secures both pardon and title to life as gifts, while setting sanctification in its proper causal order as fruit rather than formal ground.

Modern objections have shifted from Tridentine merit to exegetical reconfigurations. N. T. Wright represents a contemporary inflection of the external debate. By reframing justification as the declaration that someone is a member of the covenant family and treating the righteousness of God as his covenant faithfulness rather than as a status imputed, Wright resists the classic Reformed doctrine. He places the center on the faithfulness of the Messiah and the badge of covenant membership, setting individual soteriology within a corporate narrative. On this reading, Romans 5 is the story of Christ as the representative Israelite whose faithful death and resurrection bring covenant renewal, not the imputation of a law-keeping life. A Westminster examiner will ask how to answer the charge that imputation is un-Pauline, a projection of later dogma. The reply must be textual and conceptual. First, Paul’s antithetical pairing of Adam and Christ is not a mere corporate narrative but a judicial typology in which one man’s act is counted to the many as condemnation and one man’s obedience is counted to the many as righteousness. The forensic uses of logizomai in Romans 4, the made-under-the-law language in Galatians 4, the curse-bearing in Galatians 3, and the obedience unto death in Philippians 2 all converge on a second Adam who wins what the first Adam lost by both fulfilling and suffering under the law. Second, the corporate dimension is not denied in classic **federal theology**; it is deepened by identifying the legal and covenantal structures by which the many are united to the one. The denial of imputation in the name of narrative leaves believers without an articulated ground for their positive right to life before the judge of all.

The doctrine must be stress-tested against charges of antinomianism and legal fiction, and it must be integrated with adjacent loci. The alleged antinomian entailment is that if Christ’s active obedience is imputed, believers have no reason to obey and may live lawlessly. The Reformed reply relies on **union with Christ**. The Christ whose righteousness is imputed is also the Christ whose Spirit indwells and conforms the justified to his image. The law’s curse is removed, and the law’s precept is re-inscribed in the covenant of grace as the rule of life. Justification and sanctification are distinct benefits of union, not separable in the economy of redemption. The doctrine of the **law-gospel** relation preserves the ordo: the gospel declares us righteous in Christ, and the law, now devoid of curse for us, directs our grateful obedience. Moreover, the imputation of active obedience undercuts antinomianism rather than feeds it, because the life believers receive is a life already brought through obedience into resurrection; they are united to a righteous Christ whose life defines their vocation. If pressed on the relation to final judgment according to works, one should say that the last day’s verdict publicly manifests the truth of union and faith through Spirit-wrought works, but does not shift the formal ground of life from Christ to us.

The charge of legal fiction misunderstands both the nature of law and the nature of union. Imputation is the accounting of what truly belongs to a person by covenantal solidarity. The denial that legal reckoning can convey what is real would undo the Pauline logic of Adamic sin, the sacrificial system’s substitution, and any federal structure at all. The doctrine of **divine simplicity** also indirectly buttresses this point. God’s justice and mercy are not competing parts but a single simple perfection. In the cross of the obedient Son, God remains just and the justifier. The law is not bypassed but honored in both its precept and sanction, precisely in the one obedience of the Son, such that mercy is not set against justice, but justice itself becomes the form of mercy for those in Christ.

At the center of the doctrine lies a Christology of the mediator. The person who obeys and suffers is the eternal Son in assumed human nature. All his works are theandric. That fact guards against any notion of a private righteousness accrued by a human individual and then transferred. The person constitutes the public character of the work. The two-natures Christology thus grounds the communicability of Christ’s righteousness. Moreover, the doctrine of the pactum salutis, or **covenant of redemption**, displays that the Son’s obedience is not self-serving but missionally federal. He takes the form of a servant and obeys unto death as the Father’s commissioned heir to secure a people. In this light, to deny the imputation of his active obedience is to keep the law’s fulfillment as a merely private achievement, contrary to the design of the mission.

Scripture must be allowed to set the contours. Romans 5 contrasts the disobedience of the first man with the obedience of the last, resulting in condemnation and justification respectively. The righteousness that justifies is grounded in that obedience. Galatians 3 asserts that Christ became a curse for us to redeem us from the curse of the law. Galatians 4 states that God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, in order that we might receive adoption. The phrase under the law is not a general social descriptor but a legal location. Philippians 2 presents Christ as obedient unto death, and Hebrews 5 speaks of him learning obedience through suffering and being made perfect as the source of eternal salvation. 2 Corinthians 5 testifies that God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we would become the righteousness of God in him. Isaiah’s servant songs and the righteous sufferer motif in the Psalms furnish the typological ground for a righteous one who bears iniquity and whose righteousness justifies many. These texts do not themselves deploy the later labels, but they together require a mediator who both fulfills and bears and whose fulfillment and bearing are reckoned to his people.

It is important to relate the doctrine to the **covenant of works**. If there never was a legal arrangement promising life through obedience, then the rationale for Christ’s active obedience loses its edge. Some modern theologians hesitate to affirm a covenant of works, preferring to speak of filial communion without merit language. The Reformed answer is that the covenant of works is not a Pelagian contract. Adam’s obedience would have been owed, yet God freely condescended to promise eschatological life upon that obedience. Christ, as the second Adam, merits for his people within that graciously established order. The term merit is justified at the level of covenant, not strict commutative justice, because the Son’s person elevates the value of his obedience and because God has promised life upon obedience. To deny the preceptive side of the Adamic economy imperils Paul’s Adam–Christ pattern and blurs the law-gospel distinction in the administration of redemption.

The Lutheran comparison clarifies a real convergence and a historic difference of emphasis. Luther himself spoke mostly of passive obedience and the joyous exchange, but Lutheran orthodoxy commonly affirmed that Christ fulfilled the law for us. The point of divergence lay not so much in denial of the active obedience but in the way each tradition integrated it with their law-gospel hermeneutic and sacramental practice. The Reformed insistence, sharpened in controversy with Piscator, on the imputation of the whole obedience as grounding both pardon and title to life became confessional, while some Lutherans allowed the preceptive fulfillment to be the necessary condition of the spotless lamb rather than the form of our counted righteousness. The differences warn against building polemical caricatures and urge that we press the shared exegetical core.

Contemporary intra-Reformed debates about union and ordo salutis sometimes generate fog. Some fear that to speak of the imputation of active obedience introduces a pre-union transaction in a quasi-legal space. The answer is to insist on the duplex benefit in a single bond. Faith unites to the obedient and crucified Christ, and in that union God imputes both the non-imputation of sin and the imputation of righteousness. Others fear that the stress on active obedience dilutes the cross, as if death were insufficient. The answer is that the cross is not diminished but framed by the whole obedient life as its crown, just as Philippians 2 and Hebrews 5 teach. The curse-bearing is the apex of the obedience. Likewise, some argue that stress on positive righteousness undercuts the seriousness of sanctification. The answer is that only if righteousness is first a gift can our obedience be fruit rather than currency, and only then does sanctification become the necessary manifestation of a life already brought through death into resurrection in Christ.

The doctrine also resists modern reductions of salvation to social or political rectification. If justification becomes merely the badge of community membership, the courtroom is collapsed into the covenant room. Scripture employs both spaces. The church is indeed the people of God, but it is such a people as have had their sins forgiven and righteousness reckoned apart from works. The public identity of the church as God’s renewed people is parasitic upon the juridical act. To deny the latter is to hollow out the former.

Finally, one must hold together analytic clarity with dogmatic modesty. Active and passive are not two obediences but one obedience under two relations. They are not two formal causes of justification but two elements of the one righteousness of the mediator imputed. They are not separable in time, as if obedience were limited to pre-crucifixion and passivity to the cross, but span the whole incarnate course in the distinct modes of fulfilling and bearing. The key is to let the law’s precept and penalty, the federal structure of Adam–Christ, and the union of believer with Christ set the logic. Under these anchors, the Reformed thesis stands: justification by the imputation of the whole obedience of Christ, actively fulfilling, passively suffering, grounds both pardon and positive title to life and secures the glory of the Son as the righteous redeemer.

To summarize the argumentative contour: Calvin bequeaths the center by tying justification to Christ’s whole obedience, Westminster codifies it against Piscator, Turretin supplies the juridical logic from **federal theology**, Owen integrates it with **union with Christ** and **penal substitution**, Bellarmine sharpens the external lines by defending infusion and opposing **imputation**, and N. T. Wright forces current exegetical clarity by challenging the law-court frame. In answer to all, the position defended is that Scripture’s last Adam obeys and dies for his people under the **covenant of works**, and that God counts to believers both the removal of curse and the fulfillment of precept in him. If an examiner asks for the one text that demands imputation of active obedience, name Romans 5, then show the intertextual web that binds it to Galatians and Philippians and Hebrews. If asked whether this makes our works irrelevant, answer that they are necessary evidences in the economy of sanctification and judgment according to works but never the formal ground of life. If asked whether the categories are late, answer that the labels are, but the substance is apostolic. If asked whether divine justice is satisfied, answer that in the cross of the obedient Son, **divine simplicity** assures us God is just and justifier. And if asked whether this doctrine still matters, answer that without it, we cannot say why Christ had to live as well as die, nor can we give shaken consciences a ground both for absolution and for confident access into the life of God.
