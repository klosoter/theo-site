# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a robust doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as essential to the **Reformed understanding of justification**. They teach that Christ, as the **Mediator**, fulfilled all the requirements of the **law** (active obedience) and bore the **penalty for sin** (passive obedience), both of which are imputed to believers for their **justification** before God.

- "Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth... by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them." (Westminster Confession of Faith 11.1)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith (especially chapters 8, 11)
- Westminster Larger Catechism (Questions 36–40, 70–73)
- Westminster Shorter Catechism (Questions 21–23, 33)
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (often appended to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ’s Obedience is Vicarious**
    - Christ acts as the **federal head** and representative of the elect.
    - His obedience is performed on behalf of believers, not for Himself.
    - Both His fulfilling of the law and suffering are substitutionary.
    - The benefits of His obedience are received by faith alone.
    - "The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice... hath fully satisfied the justice of His Father." (WCF 8.5)

2. **Active Obedience: Fulfilling the Law**
    - Christ’s life was marked by perfect conformity to the law of God.
    - This obedience is not merely negative (avoiding sin) but positive (fulfilling all righteousness).
    - His active obedience is essential for the imputation of righteousness.
    - The Standards distinguish between Christ’s law-keeping and His suffering.
    - "He was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfill it." (WLC 36)

3. **Passive Obedience: Suffering the Penalty**
    - Christ endured the curse and penalty due to sinners.
    - His suffering culminated in the cross, bearing divine wrath.
    - Passive obedience refers to His willingness to submit to suffering.
    - This aspect is necessary for the satisfaction of divine justice.
    - "He most willingly underwent the most grievous torments... and the cursed death of the cross." (WLC 49)

4. **Imputation to Believers**
    - Both active and passive obedience are imputed to the believer.
    - Justification is not based on inherent righteousness but on Christ’s merit.
    - Faith is the sole instrument by which this righteousness is received.
    - The believer’s status before God is grounded in Christ’s obedience alone.
    - "Justification is an act of God’s free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous... only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us." (WSC 33)

5. **Indivisibility of Christ’s Work**
    - The Standards do not sharply separate active and passive obedience but see them as a unified work.
    - Both aspects are necessary for a complete redemption.
    - Christ’s whole life and death are viewed as one saving obedience.
    - The distinction serves to clarify, not divide, the fullness of His mediatorial work.
    - "By his obedience and death, Christ made a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God’s justice." (WCF 11.3)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed soteriology**, establishing the dual imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience as central to the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**. Their careful articulation has influenced confessional documents and theological education across Presbyterian and Reformed traditions. The distinction and unity of Christ’s obedience remain foundational for understanding the believer’s assurance and standing before God.
