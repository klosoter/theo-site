# Sinclair B. Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair B. Ferguson strongly affirms the classic Reformed doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as essential to the believer’s justification. He emphasizes that both the fulfillment of the **law’s demands** (active obedience) and the bearing of **penal substitutionary wrath** (passive obedience) are inseparably united in the person and work of **Christ as Mediator**, forming the basis for the believer’s **imputed righteousness**.

- "Christ’s obedience is not divided into two, but is the one obedience of the one Mediator, who fulfilled all righteousness for us." ("The Whole Christ")

## Key Works

- "The Whole Christ: Legalism, Antinomianism, and Gospel Assurance" (2016)
- "The Christian Life: A Doctrinal Introduction" (1981)
- "In Christ Alone: Living the Gospel Centered Life" (2007)
- "Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister is Called to Be" (2017)
- "The Holy Spirit" (1996)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active** and **passive obedience** are not two separate works but one unified obedience.
    - The distinction is analytical, not temporal or ontological, within the single work of the Mediator.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the full accomplishment of **redemption**.
    - The unity safeguards the integrity of **Christ’s person and work**.
    - "It is the one obedience of the one Mediator that is reckoned to us." ("The Whole Christ")

2. **Active Obedience: Fulfilling the Law**
    - Christ’s lifelong obedience to the law is essential for the positive righteousness imputed to believers.
    - This obedience is not merely preparatory for the cross but an integral part of **redemptive accomplishment**.
    - The law’s demands are met in Christ’s perfect life, qualifying Him as the spotless Lamb.
    - Believers receive the benefit of this obedience through **union with Christ**.
    - "His obedience to the law is the ground of our acceptance before God." ("The Christian Life")

3. **Passive Obedience: Substitutionary Suffering**
    - Christ’s suffering and death are the climactic expression of His obedience.
    - He bears the curse of the law and endures the penalty due to sinners.
    - The cross is the culmination, not the totality, of His passive obedience.
    - This aspect secures the removal of guilt and condemnation for the elect.
    - "In his death, Christ bore the penalty of the law in our place." ("In Christ Alone")

4. **Imputation of Righteousness**
    - The righteousness of Christ, consisting of both active and passive obedience, is imputed to believers.
    - Justification is grounded in this imputed righteousness, not in any inherent merit.
    - The believer is counted righteous before God solely because of Christ’s obedience.
    - This doctrine preserves the **sola fide** principle of the Reformation.
    - "We are justified by the imputed righteousness of Christ alone." ("The Whole Christ")

5. **Pastoral and Assurance Implications**
    - The doctrine provides the foundation for **assurance of salvation**.
    - It guards against both legalism and antinomianism by rooting acceptance in Christ’s finished work.
    - Pastoral ministry must continually point believers to Christ’s obedience as their hope.
    - Assurance is found not in self, but in the sufficiency of Christ’s obedience.
    - "Our assurance rests not in our obedience, but in Christ’s obedience for us." ("The Whole Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s exposition of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** has shaped contemporary Reformed theology and pastoral practice, particularly in the areas of **justification** and **assurance**. His clear articulation of the unity and sufficiency of Christ’s work has influenced both academic and popular audiences, reinforcing classic Westminster standards. Ferguson’s teaching continues to equip pastors and laypeople to rest in the finished work of Christ, safeguarding the heart of the gospel for future generations.
