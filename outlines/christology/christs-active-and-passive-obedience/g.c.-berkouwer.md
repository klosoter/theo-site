# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached **Christ’s active and passive obedience** with a focus on the unity of Christ’s redemptive work, emphasizing that both aspects are inseparable within the broader context of **reconciliation** and **atonement**. He critiqued overly schematic distinctions, arguing that the fullness of **Christ’s obedience** is realized in His entire incarnate life and death, which together accomplish the salvation of the elect.

- "The distinction between active and passive obedience is not a separation, but a distinction within the unity of Christ’s obedience." (The Work of Christ)

## Key Works

- The Work of Christ (1956)
- Faith and Justification (1954)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Sin (1971)
- Studies in Dogmatics: Faith and Sanctification (1952)
- A Half Century of Theology (1977)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Christ’s Obedience**
    - Christ’s **active** and **passive obedience** are two aspects of a single, unified work.
    - The distinction serves explanatory purposes but should not divide Christ’s redemptive act.
    - Both His life (fulfilling the law) and His death (bearing the curse) are essential for salvation.
    - The unity reflects the wholeness of Christ’s mediatorial role.
    - "We must not lose sight of the unity of Christ’s obedience in our theological formulations." (The Work of Christ)

2. **Critique of Schematic Distinctions**
    - Overly rigid separation risks distorting the biblical witness.
    - Theological distinctions must serve, not obscure, the gospel’s central message.
    - Berkouwer warns against abstracting Christ’s work from its scriptural context.
    - He urges a return to the biblical narrative of Christ’s life and death.
    - "The danger is that the distinction becomes a separation, and thus the richness of Christ’s work is lost." (The Work of Christ)

3. **Obedience as Fulfillment of Covenant**
    - Christ’s obedience is the fulfillment of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Both law-keeping and suffering are covenantal requirements met by Christ.
    - The covenant context frames both active and passive obedience as redemptive.
    - This fulfillment is necessary for the justification of believers.
    - "Christ’s obedience is covenantal, embracing both the law and the curse." (Faith and Justification)

4. **Obedience and Justification**
    - The imputation of Christ’s obedience is central to **justification by faith**.
    - Both aspects of obedience are necessary for the believer’s righteousness.
    - Justification is not based on Christ’s death alone, but also His perfect life.
    - The believer’s status before God rests on the totality of Christ’s obedience.
    - "Justification is grounded in the total obedience of Christ, not in one aspect alone." (Faith and Justification)

5. **Christ’s Obedience and Human Response**
    - Christ’s obedience is the foundation for the believer’s sanctification.
    - The believer’s obedience is a response, not a contribution, to salvation.
    - Berkouwer stresses the transformative power of Christ’s work in the Christian life.
    - The pattern of Christ’s obedience shapes the church’s ethical calling.
    - "The obedience of Christ is not only substitutionary but also exemplary for the life of faith." (Faith and Sanctification)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s nuanced treatment of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** influenced Reformed theology by emphasizing the unity and covenantal context of Christ’s redemptive work. His critiques of rigid distinctions encouraged a more biblically grounded and holistic understanding of **atonement** and **justification**. Berkouwer’s approach continues to shape contemporary discussions on the relationship between Christ’s work and the believer’s life, reinforcing the centrality of Christ’s obedience in Reformed soteriology.
