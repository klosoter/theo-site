# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos articulated a robust doctrine of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** within the framework of **Reformed federal theology**. He emphasized that both aspects of Christ’s obedience—His perfect fulfillment of the **law** (active) and His suffering unto death (passive)—are essential for the believer’s **justification** and union with Christ as the Second Adam.

- "The active and passive obedience of Christ are not to be separated, but together constitute the one righteousness by which the sinner is justified." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Pauline Eschatology
- "The Doctrine of the Covenant in Reformed Theology" (essay)
- "The Priesthood of Christ in Hebrews" (Biblical and Theological Studies)
- Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Active and Passive Obedience**
    - Christ’s obedience is a single, indivisible work encompassing both law-keeping and suffering.
    - Both aspects are necessary for the full accomplishment of redemption.
    - The distinction is analytical, not temporal or existential.
    - Justification rests on the totality of Christ’s obedience.
    - "The two are not successive stages, but two sides of the same obedience." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Federal Representation in Obedience**
    - Christ acts as the representative head of the elect, fulfilling the covenant of works.
    - His obedience is imputed to believers as their own before God.
    - The parallel between Adam and Christ is central to understanding justification.
    - The merit of Christ’s obedience is covenantal, not merely exemplary.
    - "Christ as the second Adam fulfills the law and bears the penalty for His people." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Necessity of Law-Keeping (Active Obedience)**
    - Christ’s perfect law-keeping is essential for positive righteousness.
    - Without active obedience, justification would only mean acquittal, not acceptance.
    - The law demands both penalty and perfect obedience for eternal life.
    - Christ’s fulfillment of the law is the ground of the believer’s title to life.
    - "The law requires not only the removal of guilt but also the presence of positive righteousness." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Vicarious Suffering (Passive Obedience)**
    - Christ’s suffering and death are substitutionary, bearing the penalty of sin.
    - Passive obedience culminates in the cross but includes His whole life of suffering.
    - This obedience satisfies divine justice and removes the curse.
    - The atonement is inseparable from Christ’s obedience to the law.
    - "His suffering was not merely physical but the judicial bearing of the curse." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Integration with Redemptive History**
    - Christ’s obedience is the fulfillment of Old Testament typology and promise.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted within the unfolding of the **covenant of grace**.
    - Vos situates Christ’s obedience within the broader movement of **redemptive history**.
    - The benefits of Christ’s obedience are applied to the elect in union with Him.
    - "The obedience of Christ is the central fact of redemptive history." (The Pauline Eschatology)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** has profoundly shaped Reformed soteriology and biblical theology, reinforcing the inseparability of Christ’s law-keeping and atoning death for justification. His emphasis on **federal headship** and the unity of Christ’s work continues to influence contemporary discussions on the doctrine of salvation. Vos’s integration of systematic and biblical theology provides a lasting framework for understanding the work of Christ within the drama of redemption.
