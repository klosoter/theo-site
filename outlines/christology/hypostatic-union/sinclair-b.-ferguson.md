# Sinclair Ferguson (1948– )

Sinclair Ferguson affirms the **hypostatic union** as the inseparable joining of **divine** and **human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He emphasizes the importance of this doctrine for the integrity of **redemption**, the reality of the **incarnation**, and the ongoing **mediatorial work** of Jesus. Ferguson situates his understanding within classic **Reformed Christology**, highlighting the mystery and necessity of the union for Christian faith and life.

- "The hypostatic union is the foundation of all that Christ accomplished for us and all that he continues to do as our Mediator." (The Whole Christ)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures, One Person**
    - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - These two natures are united in the one **person** (hypostasis) of the Son.
    - The union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - This union is essential for Christ’s role as **Mediator**.
    - "Jesus Christ is not a compound of two persons, but the one person who is both God and man." (The Whole Christ)

2. **The Integrity of Each Nature**
    - The divine and human natures retain their distinct properties.
    - The human nature is not deified, nor is the divine nature diminished.
    - Christ’s humanity includes a real body, mind, and will.
    - The natures are united in the person, not mixed in essence.
    - "The union does not destroy the integrity of either nature." (The Holy Spirit)

3. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can reconcile God and humanity.
    - The hypostatic union qualifies Christ to be the perfect **substitute**.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering are effective because of who he is.
    - The union grounds the sufficiency and efficacy of the atonement.
    - "Our salvation depends on the reality of the hypostatic union." (In Christ Alone)

4. **Ongoing Mediatorial Work**
    - The hypostatic union continues in Christ’s exalted state.
    - Christ intercedes as the God-man at the right hand of the Father.
    - The union ensures Christ’s ongoing sympathy and representation for believers.
    - The ascended Christ remains both fully God and fully man.
    - "He remains the God-man forever, our eternal Mediator." (The Christian Life)

5. **Pastoral and Practical Significance**
    - The hypostatic union assures believers of Christ’s ability to save completely.
    - It provides the basis for true communion with God through Christ.
    - The doctrine shapes Christian worship, prayer, and assurance.
    - Ferguson applies this truth to combat legalism and antinomianism.
    - "The hypostatic union is not a mere abstraction; it is the heartbeat of Christian living." (The Whole Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Ferguson’s exposition of the **hypostatic union** has shaped contemporary Reformed understanding of Christology, especially in pastoral and devotional contexts. His teaching bridges rigorous doctrinal clarity with practical application, making the doctrine accessible to both scholars and laypeople. Ferguson’s work continues to influence pastors, theologians, and students, reinforcing the centrality of Christ’s person for the whole of Christian faith and life.
