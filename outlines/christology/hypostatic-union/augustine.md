# Augustine (354–430)

Augustine’s doctrine of the **hypostatic union** affirms the true union of **divine** and **human natures** in the one **person** of Jesus Christ. He insisted that the **Word became flesh** without confusion or change, maintaining the full integrity of both natures within the unity of Christ’s person. Augustine’s Christology laid foundational groundwork for later **conciliar definitions** of the hypostatic union.

- "For the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, not by being turned into flesh, but by taking flesh to Himself." (On the Trinity, I.14)

## Key Works

- On the Trinity (De Trinitate)
- Sermons (especially Sermon 187)
- Letters (notably Epistle 137 to Volusianus)
- City of God (De Civitate Dei), Book X
- Enchiridion

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Unity of Person in Christ**
    - Christ is one **person** (hypostasis), not a mere conjunction of two beings.
    - The divine and human natures are united without separation or division.
    - The union is not a blending or confusion of natures.
    - The subject of all Christ’s actions is the one person of the Word.
    - "He did not so take the man that there should be two persons, but that both should be one Christ." (On the Trinity, I.7)

2. **Integrity of Both Natures**
    - The **divine nature** remains fully divine, unaltered by the incarnation.
    - The **human nature** is complete, possessing a rational soul and true body.
    - Neither nature is diminished or absorbed by the other.
    - Each nature retains its own properties within the union.
    - "He took upon Him the form of a servant, yet without losing the form of God." (On the Trinity, I.7)

3. **Communication of Attributes (Communicatio Idiomatum)**
    - Predicates of both natures can be ascribed to the one person of Christ.
    - The person of Christ can be spoken of as both God and man.
    - Divine and human actions are attributed to the single subject, the Word.
    - This communication does not confuse the natures themselves.
    - "The same person is both the Son of God and the Son of Man." (Sermon 187)

4. **Purpose of the Union: Redemption**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Only one who is both God and man can reconcile God and humanity.
    - The union enables Christ’s obedience and sacrificial death to have saving efficacy.
    - The incarnation is the means by which God’s grace is imparted to humanity.
    - "He became man that we might be made God." (Sermon 192)

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Augustine grounds the hypostatic union in key biblical texts (e.g., John 1:14; Philippians 2:6–8).
    - He interprets Scripture to show the unity and distinction of natures in Christ.
    - Exegesis of Christ’s words and actions demonstrates the reality of the union.
    - Scripture’s testimony is decisive for understanding the mystery of the incarnation.
    - "The authority of the Scriptures is greater than all human ingenuity." (On the Trinity, I.23)

## Legacy and Impact

Augustine’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** profoundly shaped Western Christology, influencing the development of orthodox doctrine at the **Council of Chalcedon**. His careful distinction between **person** and **nature** provided a conceptual framework for later theological reflection. Augustine’s emphasis on the unity of Christ’s person and the integrity of both natures remains foundational for subsequent Reformed and Catholic theology.
