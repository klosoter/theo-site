# Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (1936–)

Richard B. Gaffin Jr. approaches the **hypostatic union** with a robust commitment to **Reformed Christology**, emphasizing the inseparable union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He situates the hypostatic union within the broader framework of **redemptive history**, highlighting its significance for **revelation**, **salvation**, and the believer’s union with Christ.

- "The incarnation is the permanent assumption of human nature by the Son, not a temporary arrangement for the sake of redemption." (Resurrection and Redemption)

## Key Works

- Resurrection and Redemption: A Study in Paul’s Soteriology
- Calvin and the Sabbath: The Controversy of Applying the Fourth Commandment
- By Faith, Not by Sight: Paul and the Order of Salvation
- "The Holy Spirit and the Resurrection of Christ" (Westminster Theological Journal)
- "Biblical Theology and the Westminster Standards" (Westminster Theological Journal)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Hypostatic Union as Redemptive-Historical**
    - The union of **divine and human natures** in Christ is central to the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - The incarnation is not an isolated event but is integrally related to Christ’s resurrection and exaltation.
    - The hypostatic union grounds the efficacy of Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - Christ’s person is the locus where salvation is accomplished and applied.
    - "The hypostatic union is the indispensable presupposition for the redemptive work of Christ." (Resurrection and Redemption)

2. **Permanence of the Incarnation**
    - The Son’s assumption of human nature is irreversible and eternal.
    - Christ remains fully God and fully man even after his resurrection and ascension.
    - The ongoing humanity of Christ is essential for his high priestly intercession.
    - This permanence underscores the believer’s hope in the glorified Christ.
    - "The incarnation is not a temporary expedient but a permanent reality." (Resurrection and Redemption)

3. **Functional Unity of Christ’s Natures**
    - The two natures act in concert within the one person of Christ.
    - There is no confusion or separation of the natures, in line with Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
    - The divine and human are distinct yet inseparably joined for the work of redemption.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering are truly human, yet efficacious because of his divinity.
    - "The unity of the person is the basis for the unity of Christ’s work." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

4. **Revelatory Significance of the Hypostatic Union**
    - The incarnation is the supreme revelation of God to humanity.
    - In Christ, the fullness of deity dwells bodily, making God known in a unique way.
    - The hypostatic union enables a true and saving knowledge of God.
    - Scripture’s testimony to Christ’s person is foundational for Christian faith.
    - "The incarnate Christ is the definitive revelation of God." (Resurrection and Redemption)

5. **Union with Christ Rooted in the Hypostatic Union**
    - Believers’ union with Christ is grounded in his unique person as God-man.
    - The benefits of salvation flow from the reality of the hypostatic union.
    - The Spirit unites believers to the risen and incarnate Christ.
    - This union is both legal (justification) and vital (sanctification and glorification).
    - "Our union with Christ presupposes and is made possible by the hypostatic union." (By Faith, Not by Sight)

## Legacy and Impact

Gaffin’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** has significantly shaped contemporary Reformed theology, especially in its integration with **redemptive-historical** and **union with Christ** themes. His work has influenced generations of pastors and scholars at Westminster Theological Seminary and beyond, reinforcing the centrality of Christ’s person for all of Christian doctrine. Gaffin’s careful exegesis and theological synthesis continue to serve as a standard for evangelical engagement with classic Christological formulations.
