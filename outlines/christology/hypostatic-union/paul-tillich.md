# Paul Tillich (1886–1965)

Paul Tillich approached the **hypostatic union** through his method of **correlation**, reinterpreting the traditional doctrine in existential and ontological terms. Rather than focusing on the metaphysical union of **divine and human natures** in Christ, Tillich emphasized the **New Being** revealed in Jesus as the symbol of the unity between **God and humanity**, making the doctrine a paradigm for understanding the reconciliation of estrangement.

- "The assertion that Jesus as the Christ is the New Being means that in him the gap between existence and essence is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Symbolic Interpretation of Doctrine**
    - The **hypostatic union** is not a literal metaphysical event but a symbol expressing the unity of **divine and human**.
    - Doctrinal language must be understood as pointing beyond itself to existential realities.
    - Christ as the "New Being" is the ultimate symbol of reconciliation.
    - Theological symbols participate in the reality they signify without being identical to it.
    - "The term 'union' is symbolic, expressing the participation of the divine in the human and the human in the divine." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Existential Estrangement and Reconciliation**
    - Humanity is marked by existential estrangement from **God** and **essence**.
    - The **hypostatic union** in Christ represents the overcoming of this estrangement.
    - Jesus is the bearer of the "New Being," manifesting the possibility of reunion.
    - The doctrine addresses the human condition of alienation and the hope for healing.
    - "In him, the separation between God and man is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Christ as the New Being**
    - Christ is not merely a historical figure but the manifestation of the **New Being**.
    - The **New Being** is the state in which the split between divine and human is healed.
    - The **hypostatic union** is the existential realization of this new reality.
    - This concept redefines traditional **Christology** in ontological terms.
    - "Jesus as the Christ is the New Being in whom the existential estrangement is overcome." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Rejection of Classical Metaphysics**
    - Tillich critiques traditional **substance metaphysics** in explaining the union of natures.
    - He prefers existential and ontological categories over static metaphysical ones.
    - The classical language of "person" and "nature" is seen as inadequate for modern understanding.
    - The **hypostatic union** is reinterpreted as a dynamic event, not a static state.
    - "The doctrine of two natures must be transformed into existential and ontological terms." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Method of Correlation**
    - Tillich's theology correlates existential questions with theological answers.
    - The **hypostatic union** is meaningful as it addresses the human quest for unity with the divine.
    - Christology must respond to contemporary existential concerns.
    - The method allows reinterpretation of traditional doctrines for modern contexts.
    - "The method of correlation mediates between the question of human existence and the answer given in the manifestation of the New Being." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 1)

## Legacy and Impact

Tillich’s reinterpretation of the **hypostatic union** influenced modern theology by shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to existential meaning. His use of **symbol** and the concept of the **New Being** provided a framework for engaging traditional doctrines with contemporary philosophical questions. While his approach has been critiqued for departing from orthodox formulations, it remains a significant contribution to 20th-century **systematic theology** and continues to shape discussions on the relevance of Christology in a secular age.
