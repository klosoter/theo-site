# Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–2014)

Wolfhart Pannenberg approached the **hypostatic union** through the lens of **Christology from below**, emphasizing the historical revelation of Jesus as the locus of divine self-disclosure. He argued that the union of **divine and human natures** in Christ is best understood eschatologically, with the full significance of Jesus’ identity as the **Son of God** revealed in the resurrection and the consummation of history. Pannenberg’s account stresses the dynamic and historical character of the **incarnation** rather than a static metaphysical union.

- "The deity of Jesus is not a presupposition but the result of the history of Jesus as it is completed in his resurrection." (Jesus—God and Man)

## Key Works

- Jesus—God and Man (1968)
- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (1980)
- Revelation as History (1961, with R. Rendtorff et al.)
- Theology and the Kingdom of God (1969)
- The Idea of God and Human Freedom (1973)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christology from Below**
    - Begins with the historical Jesus and his resurrection as the basis for understanding his divinity.
    - Rejects a priori metaphysical definitions of the **hypostatic union**.
    - Emphasizes the revelatory significance of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.
    - Sees the recognition of Jesus’ divine sonship as an eschatological event.
    - "The confession of Jesus’ deity is justified only in the light of his resurrection." (Jesus—God and Man)

2. **Eschatological Revelation**
    - The full meaning of Jesus’ person is revealed at the end of history.
    - The **hypostatic union** is not a static fact but a reality disclosed in the eschaton.
    - The resurrection is the decisive event confirming Jesus’ identity as the God-man.
    - The unity of divine and human natures is oriented toward the future consummation.
    - "Only in the eschatological consummation will the unity of God and man in Jesus be fully manifest." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Dynamic Incarnation**
    - The **incarnation** is a dynamic, historical process rather than a once-for-all metaphysical event.
    - Jesus’ identity unfolds through his mission, culminating in the resurrection.
    - The union of natures is actualized in the history of Jesus’ obedience and exaltation.
    - The divine self-giving is realized in the narrative of Jesus’ life.
    - "The incarnation is not a static state but a movement of God’s self-giving in history." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Relational Ontology**
    - The person of Christ is defined by his relationship to the Father and the Spirit.
    - The **hypostatic union** is understood in terms of relationality, not substance metaphysics.
    - Jesus’ identity is constituted by his openness to the Father and his role in salvation history.
    - The unity of natures is a function of the relational event of revelation.
    - "The being of Jesus is constituted by his relation to God and to humanity." (Jesus—God and Man)

5. **Rejection of Chalcedonian Dualism**
    - Critiques traditional Chalcedonian formulations for separating the natures too sharply.
    - Seeks a more integrated understanding of the divine-human unity in Christ.
    - Emphasizes the historical and existential unity of Jesus’ person.
    - Argues that the **hypostatic union** must be meaningful within the framework of history.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula must be interpreted in the light of the historical revelation of Jesus." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Pannenberg’s approach to the **hypostatic union** has significantly influenced modern **Christological** debates, especially those engaging with historical-critical methods and eschatological perspectives. His emphasis on the resurrection and the unfolding of Jesus’ identity in history challenged static metaphysical accounts and encouraged a more dynamic, relational understanding of the incarnation. Pannenberg’s work continues to provoke discussion on the integration of **history and ontology** in systematic theology.
