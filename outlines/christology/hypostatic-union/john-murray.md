# John Murray (1898–1975)

John Murray, a leading figure in twentieth-century **Reformed theology**, articulated a robust and classically orthodox understanding of the **hypostatic union**. He emphasized the real and inseparable union of **divine and human natures** in the single **person of Christ**, upholding the integrity of both natures without confusion or division.

- "The two natures are united in one person without confusion, without change, without division, and without separation." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

## Key Works

- Redemption Accomplished and Applied
- Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 2: Systematic Theology
- The Epistle to the Romans (NICNT)
- "The Person of Christ" (in Collected Writings, Vol. 2)
- Principles of Conduct

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Unity of Christ’s Person**
    - Christ is a single **person** with two distinct natures.
    - The **divine** and **human** natures are inseparably joined.
    - There is no mixture or confusion between the natures.
    - The unity of personhood is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
    - "The person is the subject of the two natures, and the natures retain their distinct properties." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

2. **Integrity of the Divine and Human Natures**
    - The **divine nature** remains fully divine, unaltered by the incarnation.
    - The **human nature** is true and complete, including body and soul.
    - Each nature acts according to its own properties.
    - The natures are not fused or diminished in the union.
    - "He who became incarnate was eternally the Son, and in the incarnation he took into union with himself a human nature." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

3. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - The hypostatic union is foundational for Christ’s role as **mediator**.
    - Only one who is both God and man can accomplish **redemption**.
    - The union ensures the efficacy of Christ’s obedience and sacrifice.
    - The person of Christ is the agent of redemptive acts, not the natures abstractly.
    - "The efficacy of Christ’s work rests upon the uniqueness of his person." (Redemption Accomplished and Applied)

4. **Rejection of Heretical Distortions**
    - Murray rejects **Nestorianism** (division of persons) and **Eutychianism** (confusion of natures).
    - He affirms the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the orthodox standard.
    - Any denial of the true humanity or deity of Christ undermines salvation.
    - Heretical views distort the biblical witness to Christ’s person.
    - "The Chalcedonian formula is the bulwark against both forms of error." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - The doctrine is rooted in the testimony of **Scripture**.
    - Key texts (e.g., John 1:14; Philippians 2:5–11; Hebrews 2:14–17) are central.
    - The biblical witness affirms both the deity and humanity of Christ.
    - Murray insists on exegesis that upholds the unity and distinction in Christ.
    - "The hypostatic union is not a speculative construction but a biblical necessity." (Collected Writings, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

John Murray’s careful articulation of the **hypostatic union** has shaped generations of Reformed theologians and pastors, especially within the Westminster tradition. His insistence on the integrity of both natures and the unity of Christ’s person provided a clear and faithful exposition of classical Christology. Murray’s work remains a standard reference for those seeking to understand and defend orthodox views of the person of Christ.
