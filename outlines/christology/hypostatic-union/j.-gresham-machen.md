# J. Gresham Machen (1881–1937)

J. Gresham Machen staunchly defended the **orthodox doctrine of the hypostatic union**, affirming that in the **incarnation**, the eternal **Son of God** assumed a complete human nature without confusion or division. He emphasized the necessity of Christ being both **fully God and fully man** for the efficacy of **redemption**, and rejected any compromise with **liberal theology** that undermined these truths.

- "Jesus was a supernatural Person; He was God and man; He was one person with two natures." ("The Person of Jesus")

## Key Works

- The Person of Jesus (1937)
- Christianity and Liberalism (1923)
- The Virgin Birth of Christ (1930)
- What Is Faith? (1925)
- New Testament Greek for Beginners (1923) [for textual basis]

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Full Deity and Humanity of Christ**
    - Christ possesses both a complete divine nature and a complete human nature.
    - The union of these natures is essential for the work of **redemption**.
    - Denial of either nature undermines the gospel.
    - Machen opposed any reduction of Christ’s deity or humanity as found in liberal theology.
    - "If Jesus was only man, then He is dead, and we have no Savior." (Christianity and Liberalism)

2. **Personal Union Without Confusion**
    - The two natures are united in one **person** (hypostasis), not mingled or confused.
    - Each nature retains its own attributes and properties.
    - The union is mysterious but real, not a mere moral or functional association.
    - Machen upheld the **Chalcedonian Definition** as the biblical standard.
    - "The New Testament presents Jesus as one person, but with two distinct natures." (The Person of Jesus)

3. **Necessity of the Hypostatic Union for Redemption**
    - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The divine nature gives Christ’s work infinite value; the human nature enables true substitution.
    - The atonement depends on the reality of both natures in one person.
    - Machen insisted that soteriology collapses without the hypostatic union.
    - "The very center and core of the whole Bible is the doctrine of the two natures of Jesus Christ." (The Person of Jesus)

4. **Historical and Scriptural Foundation**
    - The doctrine is rooted in the testimony of **Scripture**, not speculative philosophy.
    - Machen argued that the New Testament presents Jesus as both truly God and truly man.
    - He appealed to the **historical creeds** as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.
    - He critiqued modernist attempts to reinterpret or demythologize the incarnation.
    - "The New Testament is unintelligible apart from the two-nature Christology." (Christianity and Liberalism)

5. **Rejection of Liberal Reductions**
    - Machen opposed all attempts to reduce Christ to a mere moral teacher or religious genius.
    - He saw liberalism’s denial of the supernatural as fatal to Christianity.
    - The uniqueness of Christ’s person is non-negotiable for true faith.
    - Machen called for a return to confessional orthodoxy regarding Christ’s person.
    - "A low view of the person of Christ goes hand in hand with a low view of His work." (Christianity and Liberalism)

## Legacy and Impact

Machen’s robust defense of the **hypostatic union** provided a bulwark against the encroachment of liberal theology in the early twentieth century. His insistence on the full deity and humanity of Christ remains influential in **Reformed and evangelical circles**. Machen’s work continues to shape confessional approaches to **Christology**, ensuring that the church maintains fidelity to the biblical and historic doctrine of Christ’s person.
