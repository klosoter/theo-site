# Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)

Friedrich Schleiermacher reinterpreted the **hypostatic union** through the lens of religious consciousness, emphasizing the unity of **divine and human natures** in Christ as a unique and exemplary realization of **God-consciousness**. Rather than affirming the traditional Chalcedonian formula, Schleiermacher located the union in the sphere of **personal experience** and **redemptive function**, making Christ’s sinless consciousness of God the central point of union.

- "The Redeemer is distinguished from all other men by the constant potency of his God-consciousness, which was a veritable existence of God in him." (The Christian Faith, §93)

- Brief Outline of the Study of Theology

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **God-Consciousness as the Basis of Union**
    - Christ’s unique **God-consciousness** constitutes the true union of divine and human.
    - The divine does not subsist as a separate nature but as the determinative principle in Christ’s personality.
    - The hypostatic union is not metaphysical but existential and experiential.
    - Christ’s sinlessness derives from the uninterrupted presence of God-consciousness.
    - "The divine essence is not a second substance in Christ, but the causative factor of his God-consciousness." (The Christian Faith, §94)

2. **Rejection of Traditional Two-Natures Doctrine**
    - Schleiermacher critiques the Chalcedonian distinction of two natures as speculative and unhelpful.
    - He argues that the unity of Christ’s person cannot be explained by ontological categories.
    - The focus shifts from metaphysical composition to the unity of consciousness and vocation.
    - The divine and human are united in the function and activity of Christ, not in substance.
    - "The doctrine of two natures is not a necessary element of faith, but a product of reflection." (The Christian Faith, §96)

3. **Redemptive Function of the Union**
    - The hypostatic union is meaningful only in relation to Christ’s role as Redeemer.
    - Christ’s God-consciousness is communicated to the community through redemption.
    - The union is actualized in the life and mission of Christ, not in abstract essence.
    - Redemption is the transmission of Christ’s unique consciousness to believers.
    - "The Redeemer’s God-consciousness becomes the vital principle of the Church." (The Christian Faith, §106)

4. **Mediation of Divine through Human**
    - The divine is mediated through the perfect humanity of Christ.
    - Christ’s human development and experience are essential to the union.
    - The divine does not override or diminish the human, but is expressed through it.
    - The union is dynamic, realized in Christ’s historical life and obedience.
    - "The divine nature is present only as it is mediated by the human." (The Christian Faith, §98)

5. **Exemplar Model of Christology**
    - Christ is the archetype of true humanity in relation to God.
    - The hypostatic union serves as the model for the believer’s relationship with God.
    - The uniqueness of Christ lies in the fullness and constancy of his God-consciousness.
    - The Church participates in the hypostatic union by sharing in Christ’s consciousness.
    - "In Christ, the personal union of the divine with the human is the pattern for all believers." (The Christian Faith, §109)

## Legacy and Impact

Schleiermacher’s reinterpretation of the **hypostatic union** profoundly shaped modern **liberal theology**, shifting the focus from metaphysical speculation to religious experience and consciousness. His Christology influenced later theologians who emphasized the existential and ethical dimensions of the incarnation. While often criticized by confessional traditions for departing from classical formulations, Schleiermacher’s approach remains foundational for discussions of **Christ’s person** in modern theology.
