# Three Forms of Unity (16th–17th c.)

The **Three Forms of Unity**—the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort—affirm the **hypostatic union** as the inseparable joining of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. These confessions uphold the **Chalcedonian Definition**, emphasizing that Christ is truly God and truly man, with each nature retaining its own properties, united without confusion or division for the purpose of **redemption**.

- "We believe that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably united and connected with the human nature, so that there are not two Sons of God, nor two persons, but two natures united in one single person." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

## Key Works

- Belgic Confession, Articles 18–19
- Heidelberg Catechism, Lord’s Days 5, 6, 14, 15

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **True and Complete Humanity and Deity of Christ**
    - Christ possesses a **true human nature** with body and soul.
    - He remains **eternally God**, sharing the same essence with the Father and Spirit.
    - Both natures are necessary for His mediatorial work.
    - The union does not diminish or alter either nature.
    "We confess... that He is very God and very man, very God by His power to conquer death, and very man that He might die for us according to the infirmity of His flesh." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

2. **Unity of the Person**
    - The two natures are united in **one person** (the Son).
    - There is no division or separation of the person after the union.
    - The subject of all Christ’s actions is the one person, not two persons.
    - The union is personal, not merely moral or accidental.
    "Thus that which He committed to His Father when dying, He kept as God, and received as man, and gave by His divine power." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

3. **Distinction of Natures Maintained**
    - The divine and human natures remain **distinct** after the union.
    - There is no mixing, confusion, or absorption of one nature into the other.
    - Each nature retains its own attributes and operations.
    - The distinction is essential for Christ’s mediatorial role.
    "These two natures are so closely united in one person that they were not separated even by His death." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

4. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ to be the **mediator** between God and man.
    - Only one who is both God and man can satisfy divine justice and represent humanity.
    - The union enables Christ’s obedience and atoning death to be effective for salvation.
    - The confession links the union directly to the accomplishment of redemption.
    "He must be very man, for the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned should make satisfaction for sin." (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 16)

5. **Affirmation of Orthodox Christology**
    - The confessions explicitly align with the **Chalcedonian Definition**.
    - They reject heresies such as Nestorianism (division) and Eutychianism (confusion).
    - The language of the confessions reflects careful adherence to ecumenical creeds.
    - Christ’s two natures are confessed as “inseparably united” yet “distinct.”
    "We believe that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably united and connected with the human nature." (Belgic Confession, Article 19)

## Legacy and Impact

The **Three Forms of Unity** have shaped Reformed Christology by providing a clear, confessional articulation of the **hypostatic union** rooted in both Scripture and the ecumenical creeds. Their careful balance of unity and distinction in Christ’s natures has served as a standard for Reformed orthodoxy and catechesis. These documents continue to inform theological education, preaching, and the defense of orthodox Christology within the global Reformed tradition.
