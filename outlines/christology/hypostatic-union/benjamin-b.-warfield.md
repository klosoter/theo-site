# B.B. Warfield (1851–1921)

B.B. Warfield upheld the **Chalcedonian definition** of the **hypostatic union**, emphasizing the true and complete **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion or division. He argued that this union is essential for the efficacy of the **atonement** and the reliability of **revelation** in Christ, defending the classical Reformed understanding against both modernist and kenotic reinterpretations.

- "The two natures are united in one person, and that one person is the eternal Son of God." ("The Person of Christ")

## Key Works

- "The Person of Christ" (in The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)
- "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
- "The Divine and Human in the Person of Christ"
- "The Humanity of Christ"
- "The Christ that Paul Preached"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Affirmation of the Two Natures**
    - Christ possesses a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - These two natures are united in one **person** (hypostasis).
    - The union does not result in a mixture or confusion of natures.
    - Warfield insists on the full integrity of both natures post-incarnation.
    - "He who became incarnate was from eternity very God, and he who became incarnate was from the moment of conception very man." ("The Person of Christ")

2. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Warfield opposes theories that diminish Christ’s **divine attributes** in the incarnation.
    - He maintains that the **Son of God** did not surrender or limit his deity.
    - The incarnation is not a subtraction but an addition of human nature.
    - Kenoticism undermines the biblical witness to Christ’s full divinity.
    - "The doctrine of kenosis is not only unscriptural, but irrational." ("The Person of Christ")

3. **Unity of the Person**
    - The **hypostatic union** means Christ is one person, not two.
    - All actions of Christ are the actions of the one **divine-human person**.
    - Warfield emphasizes the communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties).
    - The personal subject of all Christ’s experiences is the eternal Son.
    - "It is not two Christs, but one Christ, who is both God and man." ("The Person of Christ")

4. **Necessity for Redemption**
    - The hypostatic union is foundational for the **atonement**.
    - Only one who is both fully God and fully man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - Christ’s obedience and suffering have infinite value because of his divine person.
    - The union ensures the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ’s redemptive work.
    - "Only he who is both God and man can be the Redeemer of men." ("The Person of Christ")

5. **Scriptural Foundation**
    - Warfield grounds the doctrine in the testimony of **Scripture**.
    - He appeals to passages that affirm both Christ’s deity and humanity.
    - The biblical witness is consistent with the **Chalcedonian** formula.
    - He critiques modern reinterpretations as departures from biblical truth.
    - "The New Testament everywhere presupposes the two-natured person of Christ." ("The Person of Christ")

## Legacy and Impact

Warfield’s robust defense of the **hypostatic union** shaped twentieth-century Reformed Christology, reinforcing the classical orthodox position against both liberal and kenotic trends. His insistence on the full deity and humanity of Christ remains influential in evangelical and confessional circles. Warfield’s work continues to serve as a bulwark for the **Chalcedonian** understanding of Christ’s person, ensuring doctrinal fidelity in discussions of the incarnation.
