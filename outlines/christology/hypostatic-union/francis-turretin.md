# Francis Turretin (1623–1687)

Francis Turretin articulated a rigorous and precise doctrine of the **hypostatic union**, emphasizing the inseparable yet distinct union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**. He defended the **Chalcedonian Definition** and rejected both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors, insisting that the two natures remain unconfused, unchanged, indivisible, and inseparable within the unity of the **mediatorial office**.

- "The union is not a conversion or confusion of the natures, but a personal union, so that the same person is both God and man." (Institutes of Elenctic Theology, 2.13.2)

## Key Works

- Institutes of Elenctic Theology (especially Volume 2, Topics 13–14)
- The Doctrine of Christ (sections within Institutes)
- Reformed Dogmatics (as compiled and referenced in later secondary literature)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith (as interpreted and defended by Turretin)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures, One Person**
   - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
   - These two natures are united in the one **hypostasis** (person) of the Son.
   - The union does not result in a third nature or a mixture of the two.
   - The person of Christ is the subject of all actions and experiences, divine and human.
   - "The two natures are so united in the person of the Word that neither is confounded with the other nor is the property of either destroyed." (Institutes, 2.13.4)

2. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
   - The properties of each nature are truly predicated of the one person.
   - There is no transfer or confusion of attributes between the natures themselves.
   - The person acts according to either nature, but the action is attributed to the one Christ.
   - This safeguards the reality of both Christ’s divinity and humanity in all his works.
   - "The communication is not of the natures themselves, but of their properties to the person." (Institutes, 2.13.10)

3. **Rejection of Heresies**
   - Turretin explicitly rejects **Nestorianism** (dividing Christ into two persons).
   - He also rejects **Eutychianism** (confusing or merging the natures).
   - He upholds the **Chalcedonian** boundaries as essential for orthodox Christology.
   - The union is neither merely moral nor accidental, but true and substantial.
   - "We must avoid both the division of persons and the confusion of natures." (Institutes, 2.13.6)

4. **Impeccability and True Humanity**
   - Christ’s human nature is real and complete, yet without sin.
   - The **divine nature** guarantees Christ’s impeccability, but does not diminish his true humanity.
   - The union does not destroy the natural properties of either nature.
   - Christ’s human experiences (hunger, suffering, death) are genuine and essential for redemption.
   - "Although Christ could suffer and die according to his human nature, he could not sin, because of the personal union with the Word." (Institutes, 2.13.15)

5. **Necessity for Redemption**
   - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - Only one who is both God and man can reconcile God and humanity.
   - The union enables Christ to offer a sacrifice of infinite value and to represent humanity.
   - Turretin grounds the efficacy of Christ’s offices (prophet, priest, king) in this union.
   - "Unless Christ were true God and true man in one person, he could not be our Mediator." (Institutes, 2.14.2)

## Legacy and Impact

Turretin’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** became a standard for later **Reformed orthodoxy**, shaping confessional documents and theological education in the tradition. His careful distinctions and polemical clarity provided a robust defense against both Roman Catholic and Socinian critiques. Turretin’s influence endures in systematic theology, especially in discussions of Christ’s person and work, and his legacy is evident in the ongoing commitment to the **Chalcedonian Christology** within Reformed confessionalism.
