# Herman Bavinck (1854–1921)

Herman Bavinck articulated a robust doctrine of the **hypostatic union**, emphasizing the true union of **divine and human natures** in the single **person of Christ**. He maintained that the two natures remain **distinct yet inseparable**, upholding the integrity of both without confusion or division, in line with classic **Chalcedonian Christology**.

- "The two natures are united in one person without being fused, changed, separated, or divided." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ
- The Wonderful Works of God
- "The Doctrine of God" (in Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2)
- "The Person of Christ" (various essays and lectures)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Chalcedonian Definition Affirmed**
    - Bavinck upholds the **Chalcedonian formula**: Christ is one person in two natures, truly God and truly man.
    - He insists that the natures are **without confusion, change, division, or separation**.
    - The union is personal, not essential; the **person** is the locus of unity.
    - He rejects both **Nestorianism** (division) and **Eutychianism** (fusion).
    - "The church has always confessed that Christ is one person in two natures, and that these natures remain unconfused and undivided." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Integrity of Both Natures**
    - The **divine nature** retains all its attributes, undiminished by the incarnation.
    - The **human nature** is complete, including body and soul, and is not absorbed by the divine.
    - Christ’s humanity is real and genuine, not a mere appearance.
    - The two natures act in communion but are not blended into a third thing.
    - "The divine and human natures are united in the one person of the Mediator, each retaining its own properties." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Personal Union (Communicatio Personarum)**
    - The union is not of natures but of **person**: the eternal Son assumes human nature.
    - The **person of the Logos** is the subject of all Christ’s actions and experiences.
    - The human nature has no independent personal subsistence apart from the Logos.
    - All Christ’s acts are theandric (divine-human), rooted in the unity of the person.
    - "The person of the Mediator is the person of the Logos, who assumed human nature into union with himself." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Rejection of Kenotic Christology**
    - Bavinck rejects theories that the Son divested himself of divine attributes in the incarnation.
    - The **immutability** and **impassibility** of the divine nature are preserved.
    - The incarnation is an **addition** (assumption of humanity), not a subtraction from deity.
    - The Son’s self-emptying (kenosis) refers to his **humiliation**, not loss of divinity.
    - "The incarnation is not a change of God into man, but the assumption of human nature by the Son of God." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

5. **Redemptive Significance of the Hypostatic Union**
    - The union is essential for Christ’s role as **Mediator** between God and man.
    - Only one who is both fully God and fully man can accomplish **atonement**.
    - The hypostatic union grounds the efficacy of Christ’s obedience and suffering.
    - The union is the basis for the believer’s union with Christ and participation in salvation.
    - "Only he who is both God and man can be the Mediator and accomplish redemption." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Legacy and Impact

Bavinck’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** has profoundly shaped modern Reformed Christology, providing a careful synthesis of classical doctrine with contemporary concerns. His insistence on the integrity of both natures and the unity of the person of Christ remains a benchmark for orthodox theology. Bavinck’s work continues to inform debates on the person of Christ, especially in relation to **modernist** and **kenotic** reinterpretations. His legacy endures in both academic and ecclesial settings, reinforcing the centrality of the incarnate Christ in **Reformed dogmatics**.
