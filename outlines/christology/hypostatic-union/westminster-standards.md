# Westminster Standards (1646–1647)

The Westminster Standards articulate a classic **Reformed Christology**, affirming the **hypostatic union** as the inseparable joining of two complete natures, **divine and human**, in the one **person of Christ**. They stress the **immutability** of the divine nature, the **integrity** of the human nature, and the **personal union** without confusion, change, division, or separation, in line with Chalcedonian orthodoxy.

- "Two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (Westminster Confession of Faith, VIII.2)

## Key Works

- Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter VIII: "Of Christ the Mediator"
- Westminster Larger Catechism, Q&A 36–40
- Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q&A 21–23
- The Sum of Saving Knowledge (Appendix to the Standards)
- A. A. Hodge, The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures in One Person**
   - Christ possesses both a true **divine nature** and a true **human nature**.
   - These natures are united in one **person** without mixture or confusion.
   - The union is personal, not merely moral or accidental.
   - The distinction of natures is preserved, even as they are joined.
   - "So that the two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion." (WCF VIII.2)

2. **Immutability of the Divine Nature**
   - The divine nature of the Son is not changed or diminished by the incarnation.
   - Christ remains "very God" even as He becomes "very man."
   - The divine attributes are not transferred to the human nature.
   - The union does not compromise the **immutability** or **impassibility** of the divine.
   - "The Godhead was not at all changed by the union." (WLC Q. 37)

3. **Integrity of the Human Nature**
   - Christ assumed a true human body and a reasonable soul.
   - His human nature is complete, lacking nothing essential to humanity.
   - The human nature is not deified or absorbed by the divine.
   - Christ’s human experiences are genuine and real.
   - "He took upon him a true body, and a reasonable soul." (WSC Q. 22)

4. **Personal Union Without Confusion**
   - The union is in the person (hypostasis), not in the natures.
   - The properties of each nature are preserved and act according to their kind.
   - The natures are not blended or mixed into a third thing.
   - The union is permanent and indissoluble.
   - "Yet, by reason of this union, the properties of each nature do sometimes communicate." (WLC Q. 40)

5. **Christ the Only Mediator**
   - The hypostatic union qualifies Christ uniquely to mediate between God and man.
   - Only one person, the God-man, can reconcile the two parties.
   - His mediatorial work depends on the reality of both natures.
   - The union is essential for Christ’s offices as Prophet, Priest, and King.
   - "This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake, which that he might discharge, he was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it." (WCF VIII.4)

## Legacy and Impact

The Westminster Standards have profoundly shaped **Reformed confessional theology**, providing a precise and enduring articulation of the **hypostatic union**. Their formulations have served as a doctrinal benchmark for Presbyterian and Reformed churches worldwide. By grounding Christology in the language of **Chalcedonian orthodoxy** and emphasizing the necessity of both natures for redemption, the Standards continue to influence systematic theology, catechesis, and ecumenical dialogue.
