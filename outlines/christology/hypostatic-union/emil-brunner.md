# Emil Brunner (1889–1966)

Emil Brunner approached the **hypostatic union** through the lens of **dialectical theology**, emphasizing the paradoxical unity of **divine and human natures** in the one person of **Jesus Christ**. He rejected both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors, insisting that the union preserves the full integrity of both natures without confusion or separation, and stressed the existential significance of Christ’s person for human reconciliation with God.

- "The mystery of the Incarnation is the mystery of the union of God and man in the one Person of Jesus Christ." ("The Mediator")

## Key Works

- "The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith"
- "Dogmatics: Volume II—The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption"
- "The Divine-Human Encounter"
- "Revelation and Reason: The Christian Doctrine of Faith and Knowledge"

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Christ as the Center of Revelation**
    - Christ is the unique and final **self-revelation of God**.
    - The hypostatic union is foundational for understanding revelation.
    - Divine and human natures are united in Christ for the sake of revelation.
    - The person of Christ is the locus of God’s address to humanity.
    "In Jesus Christ, God Himself has come to us and revealed Himself to us." ("The Mediator")

2. **Rejection of Metaphysical Speculation**
    - Brunner resists classical metaphysical explanations of the union.
    - He prioritizes the existential and relational significance over ontological definitions.
    - The mystery of the union is to be confessed, not explained.
    - The focus is on the encounter with the living Christ, not abstract formulations.
    "The Incarnation is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be adored." ("The Mediator")

3. **Integrity of Both Natures**
    - Both **divine** and **human** natures are fully preserved in Christ.
    - There is no mixture or absorption of one nature into the other.
    - The union is personal, not a fusion of substances.
    - Each nature retains its distinct properties within the one person.
    "The two natures are united in such a way that neither is impaired nor altered." ("Dogmatics II")

4. **Soteriological Purpose of the Union**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for **atonement** and reconciliation.
    - Only one who is both God and man can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The union enables Christ’s representative and substitutionary work.
    - The reality of salvation depends on the reality of the union.
    "Only He who is both God and man can be the Mediator." ("The Mediator")

5. **Existential Encounter with Christ**
    - The hypostatic union is meaningful in the believer’s existential encounter with Christ.
    - Faith is not mere assent to a doctrine, but a meeting with the living Lord.
    - The union is experienced in the personal relationship with Christ.
    - The doctrine serves to ground the reality of this encounter.
    "The doctrine of the Incarnation is the presupposition of the personal encounter with Christ." ("The Divine-Human Encounter")

## Legacy and Impact

Brunner’s interpretation of the **hypostatic union** influenced 20th-century Protestant theology by emphasizing the existential and relational dimensions of Christology. His work provided a mediating position between strict Chalcedonian orthodoxy and modern existential concerns, shaping discussions on the person of Christ in the context of **dialectical theology**. Brunner’s insistence on the mystery and paradox of the union continues to inform contemporary debates about the relationship between **divine revelation** and human experience.
