# Cornelius Van Til (1895–1987)

Cornelius Van Til approached the **hypostatic union** through the lens of **Reformed Christology** and his distinctive **presuppositional apologetics**. He emphasized the mystery and necessity of the union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**, insisting that this doctrine is foundational for a consistently Christian worldview and for the defense of the faith.

- "The incarnation is the supreme mystery of the Christian faith, the point at which the Creator-creature distinction is most profoundly maintained and revealed." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

- Essays on Christian Education

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Creator-Creature Distinction Maintained in the Hypostatic Union**
    - The **hypostatic union** does not blur the distinction between God and man.
    - Christ’s two natures are united in one person without confusion or change.
    - The union is a unique event, revealing both the transcendence and immanence of God.
    - This distinction is essential for a proper understanding of revelation and redemption.
    - "The incarnation is not a compromise between God and man, but the coming together of two natures in one person." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

2. **Absolute Personality of Christ**
    - Christ is the only true **person** in the union; the human nature is impersonal apart from the union.
    - The divine Logos assumes a complete human nature, not a human person.
    - The unity of personhood in Christ is essential for mediation and atonement.
    - This guards against Nestorian and Eutychian errors.
    - "It is the person of the Son who takes to himself a human nature, not a human person." (The Defense of the Faith)

3. **Revelational Epistemology Rooted in Christ**
    - The **hypostatic union** is the foundation for all true knowledge of God.
    - Christ as the God-man is the supreme revelation of God to humanity.
    - Human knowledge is analogical, grounded in the revelation of Christ’s person.
    - The mystery of the union points to the limits of human reason and the necessity of revelation.
    - "All knowledge of God comes to us through the incarnate Christ." (An Introduction to Systematic Theology)

4. **Redemptive Necessity of the Hypostatic Union**
    - Only one who is both fully God and fully man can mediate between God and sinners.
    - The union is essential for Christ’s substitutionary atonement.
    - The efficacy of Christ’s work depends on the integrity of both natures.
    - The union ensures that redemption is both just and effective.
    - "If Christ were not both God and man, he could not save us." (Christian Theistic Ethics)

5. **Antithesis and the Uniqueness of Christ**
    - The **hypostatic union** sets Christianity apart from all other worldviews.
    - Non-Christian thought cannot account for the unity and diversity found in Christ.
    - The doctrine exemplifies the antithesis between Christian and non-Christian systems.
    - Apologetics must begin with the reality of the incarnate Christ.
    - "The Christian position stands or falls with the doctrine of the incarnation." (The Defense of the Faith)

## Legacy and Impact

Van Til’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** reinforced the centrality of Christ’s person in **Reformed theology** and apologetics. His insistence on the Creator-creature distinction and the uniqueness of Christ’s personhood shaped generations of theologians and apologists, especially within the Westminster tradition. Van Til’s approach continues to influence discussions on the relationship between **revelation, reason, and the person of Christ** in contemporary theology.
