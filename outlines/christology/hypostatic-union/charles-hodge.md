# Charles Hodge (1797–1878)

Charles Hodge, a leading figure in nineteenth-century **Reformed theology**, articulated a classic doctrine of the **hypostatic union** that aligns with historic **Christological orthodoxy**. He insisted on the real and inseparable union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**, maintaining the full integrity of both natures without confusion or division.

- "The two natures are united, not by any conversion of the one into the other, nor by any mixture of the two, but by a personal union." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Key Works

- Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (especially chapters on the Person of Christ)
- The Way of Life
- Princeton Sermons (selected sermons on Christology)
- Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures, One Person**
   - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
   - These natures are united in the one **person (hypostasis)** of the Son.
   - The union does not result in a third nature or a blending of the two.
   - The **person of Christ** is the eternal Logos, not a human person elevated to divinity.
   "The union is not of two persons, but of two natures in one person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

2. **Integrity of Each Nature**
   - The divine and human natures retain their distinct properties.
   - Neither nature is diminished or altered by the union.
   - The attributes of one nature are not transferred to the other.
   - The human nature is not deified, nor is the divine nature humanized.
   "Each nature retains its own attributes, and neither is changed by the union." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

3. **Personal Union, Not Moral or Mystical**
   - The union is a true **personal union**, not merely a moral or mystical association.
   - Christ is not simply indwelt by God, but is **God incarnate**.
   - The union is unique and unparalleled in all of history.
   - The person of Christ is the subject of all actions and experiences.
   "It is not a mere indwelling, as of God in his people, but a personal union." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

4. **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties)**
   - The properties of each nature are ascribed to the one person.
   - Actions or experiences are predicated of Christ according to either nature.
   - The person of Christ can be spoken of as both God and man.
   - This communication does not confuse or mix the natures themselves.
   "The attributes of both natures are predicated of the one person." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

5. **Necessity for Redemption**
   - The hypostatic union is essential for Christ’s mediatorial work.
   - Only one who is truly God and truly man can reconcile God and humanity.
   - The union ensures the efficacy and sufficiency of Christ’s **atonement**.
   - The mediator must represent both parties in the **covenant of grace**.
   "The union of the two natures in the one person of Christ is essential to his work as mediator." (Systematic Theology, Vol. 2)

## Legacy and Impact

Hodge’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** became a standard reference for conservative **Reformed Christology** in America. His careful defense of the integrity and unity of Christ’s person influenced generations of theologians at Princeton and beyond. Hodge’s work remains a touchstone for those seeking to uphold **Chalcedonian orthodoxy** within the Reformed tradition.
