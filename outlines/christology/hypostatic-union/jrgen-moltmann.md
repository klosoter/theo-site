# Jürgen Moltmann (1926–)

Jürgen Moltmann interprets the **hypostatic union** through the lens of **trinitarian theology** and the **theology of the cross**, emphasizing the dynamic and relational character of the union between Christ’s divine and human natures. He highlights the significance of **kenosis** and the suffering of God in Christ, arguing that the union is most fully revealed in the event of the **crucifixion**.

- "In the cross of Christ, God himself suffers the pain of abandonment and death, and thus the hypostatic union is revealed as the union of suffering love." ("The Crucified God")

## Key Works

- The Crucified God (1972)
- The Trinity and the Kingdom (1980)
- Jesus Christ for Today’s World (1990)
- Experiences in Theology (2000)
- Theology of Hope (1964)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **The Hypostatic Union as Dynamic Event**
    - Views the union of divine and human natures in Christ as an ongoing, relational event.
    - Emphasizes historical revelation of this union in Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.
    - Argues the union is most clearly seen in Christ’s suffering and abandonment on the cross.
    - Connects the hypostatic union to eschatological hope and humanity’s participation in God.
    - "The unity of the divine and human in Christ is not a static possession, but a history of suffering and love." (The Crucified God)

2. **Kenosis and Divine Suffering**
    - Interprets the incarnation as an act of **kenosis**—God’s self-emptying and participation in human suffering.
    - Rejects classical **impassibility**, asserting that God truly suffers in Christ.
    - Sees the cross as the ultimate expression of God’s solidarity with humanity.
    - Frames the hypostatic union as the means by which God enters into the depths of human pain.
    - "God does not become man in order to play a role, but to suffer and die in reality." (The Crucified God)

3. **Trinitarian Context of the Union**
    - Places the hypostatic union within the broader context of **trinitarian relations**.
    - Argues that the suffering of Christ involves the whole **Trinity**, especially the Father-Son relationship.
    - Suggests the cross reveals inner-trinitarian love and self-giving.
    - Maintains the union of natures in Christ is inseparable from the triune God’s engagement with the world.
    - "The cross is a trinitarian event: the Son suffers, the Father gives him up, and the Spirit unites them in love." (The Trinity and the Kingdom)

4. **Christology from Below**
    - Begins with the historical Jesus and his experience of suffering and abandonment.
    - Emphasizes the human experience of Jesus as the locus for understanding the divine.
    - Argues the hypostatic union must be interpreted in light of Jesus’ earthly ministry and passion.
    - Critiques abstract metaphysical formulations in favor of a narrative, historical approach.
    - "Christology must start from the cross and resurrection, not from abstract divine attributes." (Jesus Christ for Today’s World)

5. **Eschatological Implications**
    - Connects the hypostatic union to the future hope of new creation and universal reconciliation.
    - Sees Christ’s union of natures as the basis for the transformation of humanity and the world.
    - Argues the resurrection is the vindication and fulfillment of the hypostatic union.
    - Frames the union as the foundation for Christian hope and participation in God’s life.
    - "The resurrection of the crucified Christ is the beginning of the new creation in which God and humanity are united." (Theology of Hope)

## Legacy and Impact

Moltmann’s interpretation of the **hypostatic union** has profoundly influenced modern **trinitarian theology** and the theology of the cross, especially in emphasizing divine suffering and solidarity with humanity. His work has challenged classical doctrines of **impassibility** and inspired renewed interest in the relational and historical dimensions of Christology. Moltmann’s approach continues to shape contemporary discussions on the meaning of the incarnation, the nature of God, and the hope of redemption.
