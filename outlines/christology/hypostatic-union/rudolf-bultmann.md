# Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976)

Rudolf Bultmann approached the **hypostatic union** through the lens of his program of **demythologization**, challenging traditional metaphysical formulations of Christ’s two natures in one person. He argued that the New Testament’s proclamation of **Jesus Christ** should be understood **existentially**, emphasizing the **kerygma** rather than ontological definitions of Christ’s person. For Bultmann, the significance of Christ lies in the call to authentic existence, not in metaphysical speculation about the union of divine and human natures.

- "It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of spirits and miracles." (New Testament and Mythology)

## Key Works

- "New Testament and Mythology" (1941)
- Jesus Christ and Mythology (1958)
- Theology of the New Testament (1948–1953)
- "The Christological Confession of the World Council of Churches" (1952)
- History and Eschatology (1957)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Demythologization of Christology**
    - The language of **hypostatic union** is mythological and must be reinterpreted for modern understanding.
    - The New Testament expresses faith in Christ through existential categories, not metaphysical ones.
    - The focus is on the proclamation (kerygma) rather than ontological explanations.
    - Demythologization seeks to uncover the existential meaning behind traditional doctrines.
    - "Mythology is the use of imagery to express the otherworldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human life." (New Testament and Mythology)

2. **Existential Interpretation of Jesus’ Person**
    - Christ’s significance is found in the existential encounter, not in metaphysical union.
    - The divine and human are not united in a metaphysical sense but in the event of faith.
    - The call of Christ is to authentic existence, not assent to doctrinal formulations.
    - The meaning of Christ’s person is realized in the believer’s response.
    - "What matters is not the objective fact of the union of the two natures, but the existential decision to which the kerygma calls us." (Theology of the New Testament)

3. **Rejection of Metaphysical Christology**
    - Traditional dogma about two natures is rooted in outdated metaphysics.
    - The Chalcedonian formula is seen as an obstacle to genuine faith for modern people.
    - Christological doctrine should not be a barrier to the existential message of the gospel.
    - The reality of Christ is accessible only through faith, not metaphysical speculation.
    - "We cannot use the language of Chalcedon without falling into mythology." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

4. **Centrality of the Kerygma**
    - The proclamation of Christ is the heart of Christian faith.
    - The kerygma confronts individuals with the demand for decision.
    - The hypostatic union is meaningful only insofar as it serves the proclamation.
    - Faith is response to the kerygma, not assent to metaphysical doctrine.
    - "The real content of the New Testament proclamation is the kerygma, not metaphysical speculation." (Theology of the New Testament)

5. **Historical Jesus and the Christ of Faith**
    - The distinction between the historical Jesus and the proclaimed Christ is crucial.
    - The hypostatic union belongs to the Christ of faith, not to historical analysis.
    - Faith does not depend on historical or metaphysical certainty.
    - The Christ event is an existential encounter, not a historical or ontological fact.
    - "Faith is not assent to a doctrine, but an existential self-understanding in response to the kerygma." (Jesus Christ and Mythology)

## Legacy and Impact

Bultmann’s approach to the **hypostatic union** profoundly shaped twentieth-century theology by shifting focus from metaphysical formulations to existential interpretation. His program of **demythologization** challenged traditional Christology and provoked widespread debate about the nature of doctrine and faith. While many criticized his rejection of classical formulations, his emphasis on the **kerygma** and the existential encounter with Christ continues to influence contemporary theological discussions. Bultmann remains a pivotal figure in the ongoing conversation about the relevance of traditional doctrines in the modern world.
