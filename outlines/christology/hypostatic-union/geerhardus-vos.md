# Geerhardus Vos (1862–1949)

Geerhardus Vos approached the **hypostatic union** as a central mystery of **Christology**, emphasizing its grounding in **Scripture** and its necessity for the accomplishment of **redemption**. He maintained that the union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ** is essential for understanding the work of the **Mediator** and the unfolding of **redemptive history**.

- "The union of the two natures in the one person of Christ is the indispensable presupposition for the possibility of redemption." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

## Key Works

- Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Christology
- The Self-Disclosure of Jesus
- The Teaching of Jesus Concerning Himself
- Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments
- "The Pauline Conception of Redemption" (in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Hypostatic Union as Scriptural Doctrine**
    - The **two natures** of Christ are clearly attested in both Old and New Testaments.
    - Vos insists on the **exegetical foundation** for the doctrine, not merely philosophical speculation.
    - The **incarnation** is seen as the fulfillment of redemptive promises.
    - The union is necessary for Christ to be the true **Mediator**.
    - "Scripture itself compels us to confess the union of the divine and human in the one person of Christ." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

2. **Unity of the Person**
    - Christ is a single **person** (hypostasis), not a fusion or confusion of natures.
    - The **person** of the Son assumes human nature without ceasing to be divine.
    - The unity is maintained without diminishing the integrity of either nature.
    - The personal subject of all Christ’s actions is the eternal Son.
    - "The subject of the incarnation is the second person of the Trinity, who remains one throughout." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

3. **Distinction and Integrity of Natures**
    - The **divine** and **human natures** remain distinct, unmingled, and unconfused.
    - Each nature retains its own attributes and operations.
    - The communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum) is grounded in the unity of the person, not a blending of natures.
    - The human nature is real and complete, not a mere appearance.
    - "The two natures are united in the one person, but each remains what it is." (Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3)

4. **Redemptive-Historical Significance**
    - The hypostatic union is essential for the accomplishment of **redemption**.
    - Only one who is both **God and man** can mediate between God and humanity.
    - The union enables Christ’s obedience and atoning work to have infinite value.
    - The work of Christ is interpreted within the unfolding of **redemptive history**.
    - "The God-man is the center of redemptive revelation and accomplishment." (Biblical Theology)

5. **Revelation of the Person in History**
    - The hypostatic union is progressively revealed in the history of **revelation**.
    - Vos emphasizes the organic development of Christological understanding.
    - The self-disclosure of Jesus points to his unique personhood.
    - The union is not a static doctrine but is seen in the dynamic mission of Christ.
    - "The revelation of Christ’s person is inseparable from the history of redemption." (The Self-Disclosure of Jesus)

## Legacy and Impact

Vos’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** shaped Reformed dogmatics by grounding the doctrine in the flow of **redemptive history** and biblical revelation. His insistence on the unity and distinction of Christ’s natures influenced later Reformed theologians and contributed to a robust, scripturally-rooted Christology. Vos’s work remains foundational for understanding the person and work of Christ within the broader framework of **biblical theology**.
