# Maximus the Confessor (c. 580–662)

Maximus the Confessor provided a decisive articulation of the **hypostatic union**, defending the full **divinity** and **humanity** of Christ united in one **person** without confusion, change, division, or separation. He emphasized the integrity of both **natures** and the operation of two **wills** and **energies** in Christ, safeguarding the unity of Christ’s person against both **Nestorian** and **Monophysite** errors.

- "The Word, when He became flesh, did not become God and man in a divided way, but remained one and the same, being God by nature and becoming man by nature." (Ambigua 5)

## Key Works

- Ambigua (Ambigua ad Ioannem)
- Opuscula Theologica et Polemica (including Opusculum 7: Against the Monothelites)
- Disputation with Pyrrhus
- Questions to Thalassius (Quaestiones ad Thalassium)
- Theological and Ethical Treatises (various letters and sermons)

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures United in One Person**
    - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
    - The union occurs in the one **hypostasis** (person) of the Word.
    - The natures remain **distinct** yet inseparably united.
    - This union is without confusion, change, division, or separation.
    - "There is one and the same Son, who is perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity." (Ambigua 5)

2. **Dyothelitism: Two Wills and Two Energies**
    - Christ has both a **divine will** and a **human will**.
    - Each will operates according to its respective nature.
    - The human will is fully obedient and harmonized with the divine will.
    - Denial of two wills undermines the reality of Christ’s humanity.
    - "We say that there are two natural wills and two natural operations in Christ." (Opusculum 7)

3. **Communion Without Confusion**
    - The natures are united in the person of Christ without blending or mixing.
    - Each nature retains its own properties and operations.
    - The union is real and personal, not merely moral or external.
    - This safeguards both the **immutability** of the divine and the integrity of the human.
    - "The union is not a mixture, but a real union of the natures in the hypostasis." (Ambigua 5)

4. **Theological Necessity for Salvation**
    - Only one who is truly God and truly man can mediate salvation.
    - The full humanity of Christ is essential for the healing and deification of human nature.
    - The hypostatic union enables Christ to act as the new Adam.
    - The two natures ensure that Christ’s actions are both divine and human.
    - "What is not assumed is not healed; but what is united to God is saved." (Epistle to Thalassius 60)

5. **Rejection of Heretical Alternatives**
    - Opposed **Monophysitism** (one nature) and **Monothelitism** (one will).
    - Affirmed the Chalcedonian Definition as the orthodox standard.
    - Emphasized the dangers of dividing or confusing Christ’s natures.
    - Saw Christological heresies as undermining the reality of redemption.
    - "If Christ has only one will, then He is not truly human." (Disputation with Pyrrhus)

## Legacy and Impact

Maximus the Confessor’s defense of the **hypostatic union** and dyothelitism was pivotal for the outcome of the Sixth Ecumenical Council (Constantinople III, 680–681), which affirmed two wills in Christ. His Christology shaped both Eastern Orthodox and Western theological traditions, providing a robust framework for understanding the unity and distinction in Christ. Maximus’s insights continue to influence contemporary discussions on the person and work of Christ, especially regarding the relationship between **nature** and **person**.
