# G.C. Berkouwer (1903–1996)

G.C. Berkouwer approached the **hypostatic union** with a strong emphasis on the mystery and centrality of the **incarnation** within **Christology**. He stressed the true union of **divine and human natures** in the one **person of Christ**, while warning against speculative explanations that undermine the biblical witness. Berkouwer’s treatment is marked by a careful avoidance of both **Nestorian** and **Eutychian** errors, focusing instead on the redemptive significance of the union.

- "The confession of the two natures in the one person of Christ is not a speculative construction, but a confession of faith in the reality of redemption." (The Person of Christ)

## Legacy and Impact

Berkouwer’s treatment of the **hypostatic union** has shaped modern Reformed **Christology** by emphasizing the mystery and redemptive significance of the incarnation. His careful engagement with both historical theology and contemporary issues has provided a model for confessional fidelity without speculative excess. Berkouwer’s influence endures in discussions of the person and work of Christ, especially in his insistence on the centrality of the biblical witness and the unity of Christ’s person.
