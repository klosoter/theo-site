# John of Damascus (c. 675–749)

John of Damascus provided a definitive articulation of the **hypostatic union** within the context of **Chalcedonian Christology**, emphasizing the union of **two natures**—divine and human—in the one **person** of Jesus Christ. He defended the distinction yet inseparability of **nature** and **person**, ensuring that neither the **divinity** nor the **humanity** of Christ was compromised or confused.

- "We confess one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, made known in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." ("Exposition of the Orthodox Faith," III.3)

## Key Works

- Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (De Fide Orthodoxa)
- Dialogue Against the Manicheans
- Homilies on the Nativity and the Transfiguration
- On Heresies

## Key Theological Commitments

1. **Two Natures United in One Person**
   - Christ possesses both a complete **divine nature** and a complete **human nature**.
   - The union occurs in the one **hypostasis** (person) of the Son.
   - The natures remain distinct, unconfused, and unmingled.
   - The union is real and personal, not merely moral or associative.
   - "For the natures are united without confusion, and each preserves its own properties unimpaired." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.3)

2. **Preservation of Distinct Properties**
   - The divine and human natures retain their respective attributes.
   - The divine does not absorb or overwhelm the human.
   - Each nature acts according to its own properties within the one person.
   - The unity does not result in a third, blended nature.
   - "Each nature wills and acts in communion with the other, but in accordance with its own properties." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.19)

3. **Rejection of Confusion and Division**
   - Opposes **Eutychianism** (confusion of natures) and **Nestorianism** (division of persons).
   - Emphasizes the formula: "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
   - The union is neither a fusion nor a mere conjunction.
   - The person of Christ is not split or doubled.
   - "We do not divide the one Christ into two persons nor do we confuse the natures." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.4)

4. **Communication of Idioms (Communicatio Idiomatum)**
   - The properties of each nature are ascribed to the one person.
   - The person of Christ can be spoken of according to either nature.
   - Divine and human actions are attributed to the same subject.
   - This communication does not entail confusion of the natures themselves.
   - "The same is both God and man, perfect in both divinity and humanity." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.7)

5. **Scriptural and Conciliar Foundation**
   - Grounds his doctrine in the **Scriptures** and the **Council of Chalcedon**.
   - Appeals to patristic consensus, especially **Cyril of Alexandria**.
   - Uses biblical texts to demonstrate the unity and distinction in Christ.
   - Defends the faith against heresies by appealing to authoritative tradition.
   - "We follow the holy Fathers and the holy ecumenical synods." (Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, III.1)

## Legacy and Impact

John of Damascus’s articulation of the **hypostatic union** became a standard reference for both Eastern and Western Christian theology. His precise terminology and defense of the **Chalcedonian Definition** shaped later Christological debates and provided a foundation for Orthodox, Catholic, and Reformed understandings of the person of Christ. His influence persists in ecumenical dialogues and in the ongoing defense of orthodox Christology against both ancient and modern errors.
